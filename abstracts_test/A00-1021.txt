 
In this paper, we describe a system to rank sus- 
pected answers to natural language questions. 
We process both corpus and query using a new 
technique, predictive annotation, which aug- 
ments phrases in texts with labels anticipating 
their being targets of certain kinds of questions. 
Given a natural anguage question, our IR sys- 
tem returns a set of matching passages, which 
we then rank using a linear function of seven 
predictor variables. We provide an evaluation of 
the techniques based on results from the TREC 
Q&A evaluation in which our system partici- 
pated.
