 
Using examples of the transfer-based MT 
system between Czech and Russian 
RUSLAN and the word-for-word MT system 
with morphological disambiguation between 
Czech and Slovak (~ESILKO we argue that 
for really close languages it is possible to 
obtain better translation quality by means of 
simpler methods. The problem of translation 
to a group of typologically similar languages 
using a pivot language is also discussed here.
