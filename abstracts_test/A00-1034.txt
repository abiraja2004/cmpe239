 
This paper presents a hybrid approach for 
named entity (NE) tagging which combines 
Maximum Entropy Model (MaxEnt), Hidden 
Markov Model (HMM) and handcrafted 
grammatical rules. Each has innate strengths 
and weaknesses; the combination results in a 
very high precision tagger. MaxEnt includes 
external gazetteers in the system. Sub-category 
generation is also discussed.
