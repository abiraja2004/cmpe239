 
We present an algorithm and a tool for 
automatically revising grammars for natural 
language processing (NLP) systems to 
disallow specifically identified sentences or 
sets of sentences. We also outline an 
approach for automatically revising attribute 
value grammars using counter-examples. 
Developing rammars for NLP systems that 
are both general enough to accept most 
sentences about a domain, but constrained 
enough to disallow other sentences i very 
tedious. Our approach of revising grammars 
automatically using counter-examples 
greatly simplifies the development and 
revision of tightly constrained grammars. 
We have successfully used our tool to 
constrain over-generalizing rammars of 
speech understanding systems and obtained 
higher ecognition accuracy.
