 
This paper proposes a framework of language inde- 
pendent morphological nalysis and mainly concen- 
trate on tokenization, the first process of morpholog- 
ical analysis. Although tokenization is usually not 
regarded as a difficult task in most segmented lan- 
guages uch as English, there are a number of prob- 
lems in achieving precise treatment oflexical entries. 
We first introduce the concept of morpho-fragments, 
which are intermediate units between characters and 
lexical entries. We describe our approach to resolve 
problems arising in tokenization so as to attain a 
language independent morphological nalyzer.
