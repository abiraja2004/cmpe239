 
We present an evaluation of domain- 
independent atural anguage tools for use in 
the identification of significant concepts in 
documents. Using qualitative evaluation, we 
compare three shallow processing methods for 
extracting index terms, i.e., terms that can be 
used to model the content of documents. We 
focus on two criteria: quality and coverage. In 
terms of quality alone, our results show that 
technical term (TT) extraction \[Justeson and 
Katz 1995\] receives the highest rating. How- 
ever, in terms of a combined quality and cover- 
age metric, the Head Sorting (HS) method, 
described in \[Wacholder 1998\], outperforms 
both other methods, keyword (KW) and TT.
