 
This paper describes an application of APE (the 
Atlas Planning Engine), an integrated planning and 
execution system at the heart of the Atlas dialogue 
management system. APE controls a mixed- 
initiative dialogue between a human user and a 
host system, where turns in the 'conversation' may 
include graphical actions and/or written text. APE 
has full unification and can handle arbitrarily 
nested discourse constructs, making it more 
powerful than dialogue managers based on finite- 
state machines. We illustrate this work by 
describing Atlas-Andes, an intelligent tutoring 
system built using APE with the Andes physics 
tutor as the host.
