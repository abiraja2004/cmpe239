 
This paper reports on a large-scale, end-to- 
end relation and event extraction system. At 
present, the system extracts a total of 100 
types of relations and events, which 
represents a much wider coverage than is 
typical of extraction systems. The system 
consists of three specialized pattem-based 
tagging modules, a high-precision co- 
reference resolution module, and a 
configurable template generation module. 
We report quantitative valuation results, 
analyze the results in detail, and discuss 
future directions.
