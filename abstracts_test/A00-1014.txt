 
This paper describes MIMIC, an adaptive mixed initia- 
tive spoken dialogue system that provides movie show- 
time information. MIMIC improves upon previous 
dialogue systems in two respects. First, it employs 
initiative-oriented strategy adaptation to automatically 
adapt response generation strategies based on the cumu- 
lative effect of information dynamically extracted from 
user utterances during the dialogue. Second, MIMIC's 
dialogue management architecture decouples its initia- 
tive module from the goal and response strategy selec- 
tion processes, providing ageneral framework for devel- 
oping spoken dialogue systems with different adaptation 
behavior.
