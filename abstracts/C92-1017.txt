 
This paper presents Trace & Unification Grammar 
(TUG), a declarative and reversible grammar formal- 
ism that brings together Unification Grammar (UG) 
and ideas of Government & Binding Theory (on)~ 
The main part of the paper consists in a description 
of many free word order phenomena of German syn- 
tax. It will be shown that the use of traces allows 
for an easier and more elegant way of description 
than competing approaches like ID/LP-format rules 
as used e.g. in GPSG and HPSG. Grammkrs writ- 
ten in the TUG-formallsm can be compiled to a very 
efficient parser. The occurrence of head movement, 
wh-movement and scrambling in one sentence does 
not lead to any decrease in parsing efficiency.
