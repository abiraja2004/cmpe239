 
Generally speaking, statistical machine 
translation systems would be able to attain 
better performance with more training sets. 
Unfortunately, well-organized training sets 
are rarely available in the real world. Con-
sequently, it is necessary to focus on modi-
fying the training set to obtain high 
accuracy for an SMT system. If the SMT 
system trained the translation model, the 
translation pair would have a low probabil-
ity when there are many variations for tar-
get sentences from a single source sentence. 
If we decreased the number of variations 
for the translation pair, we could construct 
a superior translation model. This paper de-
scribes the effects of modification on the 
training corpus when consideration is given 
to synonymous sentence groups. We at-
tempt three types of modification: com-
pression of the training set, replacement of 
source and target sentences with a selected 
sentence from the synonymous sentence 
group, and replacement of the sentence on 
only one side with the selected sentence 
from the synonymous sentence group. As a 
result, we achieve improved performance 
with the replacement of source-side sen-
tences.
