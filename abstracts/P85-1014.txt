 
Conjunctions are particularly difficult to parse in tra- 
ditional, phra.se-based gramniars. This paper shows how 
a different representation, not b.xsed on tree structures, 
markedly improves the parsing problem for conjunctions. 
It modifies the union of phra.se marker model proposed by 
GoodalI \[19811, where conjllnction is considered as tile lin- 
earization of a three-dimensional union of a non-tree I),'med 
phrase marker epresentation. A PItOLOG grantm~tr for con- 
junctions using this new approach is given. It is far simpler 
and more transparent than a recent phr~e-b~qed extra- 
position parser conjunctions by Dahl and McCord \[1984\]. 
Unlike the Dahl and McCor, I or ATN SYSCONJ appr~ach, 
no special trail machinery i.~ needed for conjunction, be- 
yond that required for analyzing simple sentences. While 
oi contparable ?tficiency, the new ~tpproach unifies under a 
single analysis a host of related constructions: respectively 
sentences, right node raising, or gapping. Another ,'ulvan- 
rage is that it is also completely reversible (without cuts), 
and therefore can be used to generate sentences.
