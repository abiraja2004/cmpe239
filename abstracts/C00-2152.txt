 
This paper describes a machine translation 
architecture that integrates the use el' 
examples for flexible, idiomatic translations 
with the use o1' linguistic rules for broad 
coverage and grammatical acctu'acy. We 
have implemented a prototype for 
English-to-Japanese translation, and our 
ewfluation shows lhat tile system has good 
translation quality, and only requires 
reasonable computational resources.
