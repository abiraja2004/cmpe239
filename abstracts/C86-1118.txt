 
An overview of TOPIC is provided, a knowledge-based 
text information system for the analysis of German- 
language texts. TOPIC supplies text condensates 
(summaries) on variable degrees of generality and 
makes available facts acquired from the texts. The 
presentation focuses on the major methodological 
principles underlying the design of TOPIC: a frame 
representation model that incorporates various integ- 
rity constraints, text parsing with focus on text 
cohesion and text coherence properties of expository 
texts, a lexlcally distributed semantic text grammar 
in the format of word experts, a model of partial 
text parsing, and text graphs as appropriate repre- 
sentation structures for text condensates.
