 
This paper presents a semi-automatic technique for 
developing broad-coverage finite-state morphological 
analyzers for any language. It consists of three 
components-elicitation of linguistic information from 
humans, a machine learning bootstrapping scheme and 
a testing environment. The three components are ap- 
plied iteratively until a threshold of output quality is 
attained. The initial application of this technique is 
for morphology of low-density languages in the context 
of the Expedition project at NMSU CRL. This elicit- 
build-test echnique compiles lexical and inflectional 
information elicited from a human into a finite state 
transducer lexicon and combines this with a sequence 
of morphographemic rewrite rules that is induced us- 
ing transformation-based learning from the elicited ex- 
amples. The resulting morphological nalyzer is then 
tested against a test suite, and any corrections are fed 
back into the learning procedure that builds an im- 
proved analyzer.
