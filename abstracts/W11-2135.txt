This paper describes LIMSI?s submissions to
the Sixth Workshop on Statistical Machine
Translation. We report results for the French-
English and German-English shared transla-
tion tasks in both directions. Our systems
use n-code, an open source Statistical Ma-
chine Translation system based on bilingual
n-grams. For the French-English task, we fo-
cussed on finding efficient ways to take ad-
vantage of the large and heterogeneous train-
ing parallel data. In particular, using a sim-
ple filtering strategy helped to improve both
processing time and translation quality. To
translate from English to French and Ger-
man, we also investigated the use of the
SOUL language model in Machine Trans-
lation and showed significant improvements
with a 10-gram SOUL model. We also briefly
report experiments with several alternatives to
the standard n-best MERT procedure, leading
to a significant speed-up.
