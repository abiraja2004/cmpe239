Identifying background (context) informa-
tion in scientific articles can help schol-
ars understand major contributions in their
research area more easily. In this paper,
we propose a general framework based
on probabilistic inference to extract such
context information from scientific papers.
We model the sentences in an article and
their lexical similarities as a Markov Ran-
dom Field tuned to detect the patterns that
context data create, and employ a Belief
Propagation mechanism to detect likely
context sentences. We also address the
problem of generating surveys of scien-
tific papers. Our experiments show greater
pyramid scores for surveys generated us-
ing such context information rather than
citation sentences alone.
