We present a sub-sentential alignment
system that links linguistically motivated
phrases in parallel texts based on lexical
correspondences and syntactic similarity.
We compare the performance of our sub-
sentential alignment system with different
symmetrization heuristics that combine the
GIZA++ alignments of both translation di-
rections. We demonstrate that the aligned
linguistically motivated phrases are a use-
ful means to extract bilingual terminology
and more specifically complex multiword
terms.
