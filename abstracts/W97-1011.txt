 
We examine the Differential Grammar,  
a representation designed to discriminate 
which of a set of eonfusable alternatives i
most likely in the context it occurs in. This 
approach is useful whereever uncertainty 
may exist about the identity of a token 
or sequence of tokens, including in speech 
recognition, optical character ecognition 
and machine translation. In this paper our 
application is word processing: we discuss 
multiple models of confusion which may 
be used in the identification of confused 
words, we show how significant contexts 
may be identified and condensed into Dif- 
ferential Grammars,  and we contrast the 
performance of our implementation with 
that of two commercial grammar checkers 
which purport  to handle the confused word 
problem.
