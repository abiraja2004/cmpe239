This paper presents intial work on a system that
bridges from robust, broad-coverage natural lan-
guage processing to precise semantics and auto-
mated reasoning, focusing on solving logic puzzles
drawn from sources such as the Law School Admis-
sion Test (LSAT) and the analytic section of the
Graduate Record Exam (GRE). We highlight key
challenges, and discuss the representations and per-
formance of the prototype system.
