Latent Dirichlet Allocation is an unsupervised
graphical model which can discover latent top-
ics in unlabeled data. We propose a mech-
anism for adding partial supervision, called
topic-in-set knowledge, to latent topic mod-
eling. This type of supervision can be used
to encourage the recovery of topics which are
more relevant to user modeling goals than the
topics which would be recovered otherwise.
Preliminary experiments on text datasets are
presented to demonstrate the potential effec-
tiveness of this method.
