This paper presents an approach to the
question whether it is possible to construct
a parser based on ideas from case-based
reasoning. Such a parser would employ
a partial analysis of the input sentence
to select a (nearly) complete syntax tree
and then adapt this tree to the input sen-
tence. The experiments performed on Ger-
man data from the Tu?ba-D/Z treebank and
the KaRoPars partial parser show that a
wide range of levels of generality can be
reached, depending on which types of in-
formation are used to determine the simi-
larity between input sentence and training
sentences. The results are such that it is
possible to construct a case-based parser.
The optimal setting out of those presented
here need to be determined empirically.
