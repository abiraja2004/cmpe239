This paper presents a methodology for us-
ing the argument structure of sentences, as
encoded by the PropBank project, to de-
velop clusters of verbs with similar mean-
ing and usage. These clusters can be fa-
vorably compared to the classes developed
by the VerbNet project. The most inter-
esting cases are those where the cluster-
ing methodology suggests new members for
VerbNet classes which will then be associ-
ated with the semantic predicates for that
class.
