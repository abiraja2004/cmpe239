We present the first provably optimal polyno-
mial time dynamic programming (DP) algo-
rithm for best-first shift-reduce parsing, which
applies the DP idea of Huang and Sagae
(2010) to the best-first parser of Sagae and
Lavie (2006) in a non-trivial way, reducing
the complexity of the latter from exponential
to polynomial. We prove the correctness of
our algorithm rigorously. Experiments con-
firm that DP leads to a significant speedup
on a probablistic best-first shift-reduce parser,
and makes exact search under such a model
tractable for the first time.
