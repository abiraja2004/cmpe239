Knowing the degree of antonymy between
words has widespread applications in natural
language processing. Manually-created lexi-
cons have limited coverage and do not include
most semantically contrasting word pairs. We
present a new automatic and empirical mea-
sure of antonymy that combines corpus statis-
tics with the structure of a published the-
saurus. The approach is evaluated on a set of
closest-opposite questions, obtaining a preci-
sion of over 80%. Along the way, we discuss
what humans consider antonymous and how
antonymy manifests itself in utterances.
