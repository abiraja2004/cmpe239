NLP tasks are often domain specific, yet sys-
tems can learn behaviors across multiple do-
mains. We develop a new multi-domain online
learning framework based on parameter com-
bination from multiple classifiers. Our algo-
rithms draw from multi-task learning and do-
main adaptation to adapt multiple source do-
main classifiers to a new target domain, learn
across multiple similar domains, and learn
across a large number of disparate domains.
We evaluate our algorithms on two popular
NLP domain adaptation tasks: sentiment clas-
sification and spam filtering.
