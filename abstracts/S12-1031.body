We investigate the effects of adding semantic
annotations including word sense hypernyms
to the source text for use as an extra source
of information in HPSG parse ranking for the
English Resource Grammar. The semantic an-
notations are coarse semantic categories or en-
tries from a distributional thesaurus, assigned
either heuristically or by a pre-trained tagger.
We test this using two test corpora in different
domains with various sources of training data.
The best reduces error rate in dependency F-
score by 1% on average, while some methods
produce substantial decreases in performance.
