Phrase-based machine translation models
have shown to yield better translations than
Word-based models, since phrase pairs en-
code the contextual information that is needed
for a more accurate translation. However,
many phrase pairs do not encode any rele-
vant context, which means that the transla-
tion event encoded in that phrase pair is led
by smaller translation events that are indepen-
dent from each other, and can be found on
smaller phrase pairs, with little or no loss in
translation accuracy. In this work, we pro-
pose a relative entropy model for translation
models, that measures how likely a phrase pair
encodes a translation event that is derivable
using smaller translation events with similar
probabilities. This model is then applied to
phrase table pruning. Tests show that con-
siderable amounts of phrase pairs can be ex-
cluded, without much impact on the transla-
tion quality. In fact, we show that better trans-
lations can be obtained using our pruned mod-
els, due to the compression of the search space
during decoding.
