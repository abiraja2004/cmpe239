 
Traditional approaches to Relation Extraction 
from text require manually defining the rela-
tions to be extracted.  We propose here an ap-
proach to automatically discovering relevant 
relations, given a large text corpus plus an ini-
tial ontology defining hundreds of noun cate-
gories (e.g., Athlete, Musician, Instrument).  
Our approach discovers frequently stated rela-
tions between pairs of these categories, using a 
two step process. For each pair of categories 
(e.g., Musician and Instrument) it first co-
clusters the text contexts that connect known 
instances of the two categories, generating a 
candidate relation for each resulting cluster.  It 
then applies a trained classifier to determine 
which of these candidate relations is semanti-
cally valid. Our experiments apply this to a text 
corpus containing approximately 200 million 
web pages and an ontology containing 122 cat-
egories from the NELL system [Carlson et al, 
2010b], producing a set of 781 proposed can-
didate relations, approximately half of which 
are semantically valid.  We conclude this is a 
useful approach to semi-automatic extension of 
the ontology for large-scale information extrac-
tion systems such as NELL.
