Shallow semantic parsing, the automatic
identification and labeling of sentential con-
stituents, has recently received much atten-
tion. Our work examines whether seman-
tic role information is beneficial to question
answering. We introduce a general frame-
work for answer extraction which exploits
semantic role annotations in the FrameNet
paradigm. We view semantic role assign-
ment as an optimization problem in a bipar-
tite graph and answer extraction as an in-
stance of graph matching. Experimental re-
sults on the TREC datasets demonstrate im-
provements over state-of-the-art models.
