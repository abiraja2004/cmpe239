The DDIExtraction 2013 task concerns the
recognition of drugs and extraction of drug-
drug interactions that appear in biomedical
literature. We propose two subtasks for the
DDIExtraction 2013 Shared Task challenge:
1) the recognition and classification of drug
names and 2) the extraction and classification
of their interactions. Both subtasks have been
very successful in participation and results.
There were 14 teams who submitted a total of
38 runs. The best result reported for the first
subtask was F1 of 71.5% and 65.1% for the
second one.
