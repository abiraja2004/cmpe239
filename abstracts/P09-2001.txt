Variational EM has become a popular
technique in probabilistic NLP with hid-
den variables. Commonly, for computa-
tional tractability, we make strong inde-
pendence assumptions, such as the mean-
field assumption, in approximating pos-
terior distributions over hidden variables.
We show how a looser restriction on the
approximate posterior, requiring it to be a
mixture, can help inject prior knowledge
to exploit soft constraints during the varia-
tional E-step.
