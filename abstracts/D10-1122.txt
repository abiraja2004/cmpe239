We propose two hashing-based solutions to
the problem of fast and effective personal
names spelling correction in People Search
applications. The key idea behind our meth-
ods is to learn hash functions that map similar
names to similar (and compact) binary code-
words. The two methods differ in the data
they use for learning the hash functions - the
first method uses a set of names in a given lan-
guage/script whereas the second uses a set of
bilingual names. We show that both methods
give excellent retrieval performance in com-
parison to several baselines on two lists of
misspelled personal names. More over, the
method that uses bilingual data for learning
hash functions gives the best performance.
