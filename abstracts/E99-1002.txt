 
A simple formalism isproposed to repre- 
sent the contexts in which pronouns, def- 
inite/indefinite d scriptions, and ordinal 
descriptions (e.g. 'the second book') can 
be used, and the way in which these ex- 
pressions change the context. It is shown 
that referring expressions can be gener- 
ated by a unification grammar provided 
that some phrase-structure rules are spe- 
cially tailored to express entities in the 
current knowledge base.
