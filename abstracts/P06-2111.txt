There have been many proposals to ex-
tract semantically related words using
measures of distributional similarity, but
these typically are not able to distin-
guish between synonyms and other types
of semantically related words such as
antonyms, (co)hyponyms and hypernyms.
We present a method based on automatic
word alignment of parallel corpora con-
sisting of documents translated into mul-
tiple languages and compare our method
with a monolingual syntax-based method.
The approach that uses aligned multilin-
gual data to extract synonyms shows much
higher precision and recall scores for the
task of synonym extraction than the mono-
lingual syntax-based approach.
