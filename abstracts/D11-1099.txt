An entity in a dialogue may be old, new,
or mediated/inferrable with respect to the
hearer?s beliefs. Knowing the information
status of the entities participating in a dia-
logue can therefore facilitate its interpreta-
tion. We address the under-investigated prob-
lem of automatically determining the informa-
tion status of discourse entities. Specifically,
we extend Nissim?s (2006) machine learning
approach to information-status determination
with lexical and structured features, and ex-
ploit learned knowledge of the information
status of each discourse entity for coreference
resolution. Experimental results on a set of
Switchboard dialogues reveal that (1) incor-
porating our proposed features into Nissim?s
feature set enables our system to achieve state-
of-the-art performance on information-status
classification, and (2) the resulting informa-
tion can be used to improve the performance
of learning-based coreference resolvers.
