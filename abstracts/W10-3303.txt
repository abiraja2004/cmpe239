 
We are describing the construction 
process of a specialized multilingual 
lexical resource dedicated for the ar-
chive of the Digital Silk Road DSR. The 
DSR project creates digital archives of 
cultural heritage along the historical Silk 
Road; more than 116 of basic references 
on Silk Road have been digitized and 
made available online. These books are 
written in various languages and attract 
people from different linguistic back-
ground, therefore, we are trying to build 
a multilingual repository for the termi-
nology of the DSR to help its users, and 
increase the accessibility of these books. 
The construction of a terminological da-
tabase using a classical approach is dif-
ficult and expensive. Instead, we are in-
troducing specialized lexical resources 
that can be constructed by the commu-
nity and its resources; we call it Multi-
lingual Preterminological Graphs 
MPGs.  We build such graphs by ana-
lyzing the access log files of the website 
of the Digital Silk Road. We aim at 
making this graph as a seed repository 
so multilingual volunteers can contrib-
ute.  We have used the access log files 
of the DSR since its beginning in 2003, 
and obtained an initial graph of around 
116,000 terms. As an application, We 
have used this graph to obtain a preter-
minological multilingual database that 
has a number of applications.
