 
Current rule induction techniques based on hard 
matching (i.e., strict slot-by-slot matching) tend to 
fare poorly in extracting information from natural 
language texts, which often exhibit great 
variations. The reason is that hard matching 
techniques result in relatively high precision but 
low recall. To tackle this problem, we take 
advantage of the newly proposed soft pattern rules 
which offer high recall through the use of 
probabilistic matching. We propose a 
bootstrapping framework in which soft and hard 
matching pattern rules are combined in a cascading 
manner to realize a weakly supervised rule 
induction scheme. The system starts with a small 
set of hand-tagged instances. At each iteration, we 
first generate soft pattern rules and utilize them to 
tag new training instances automatically. We then 
apply hard pattern rule induction on the overall 
tagged data to generate more precise rules, which 
are used to tag the data again. The process can be 
repeated until satisfactory results are obtained. Our 
experimental results show that our bootstrapping 
scheme with two cascaded learners approaches the 
performance of a fully supervised information 
extraction system while using much fewer hand-
tagged instances.
