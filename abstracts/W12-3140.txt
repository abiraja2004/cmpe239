This paper describes the joint QUAERO sub-
mission to the WMT 2012 machine transla-
tion evaluation. Four groups (RWTH Aachen
University, Karlsruhe Institute of Technol-
ogy, LIMSI-CNRS, and SYSTRAN) of the
QUAERO project submitted a joint translation
for the WMT German?English task. Each
group translated the data sets with their own
systems and finally the RWTH system combi-
nation combined these translations in our final
submission. Experimental results show im-
provements of up to 1.7 points in BLEU and
3.4 points in TER compared to the best single
system.
