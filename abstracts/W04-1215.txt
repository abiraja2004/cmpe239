 
Named entity recognition is a fundamental 
task in biomedical data mining.  Multiple -class 
annotation is more challenging than single -
class annotation.  In this paper, we took a 
single word classification approach to dealing 
with the multiple -class annotation problem 
using Support Vector Machines (SVMs).  
Word attributes, results of existing 
gene/protein name taggers, context, and other 
information are important features for 
classification.  During training, the size of 
training data and the distribution of named 
entities are considered.  The preliminary 
results showed that the approach might be 
feasible when more training data is used to 
alleviate the data imbalance problem.
