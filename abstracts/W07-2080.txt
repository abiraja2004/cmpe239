The UC Berkeley team participated in the
SemEval 2007 Task #4, with an approach
that leverages the vast size of the Web in or-
der to build lexically-specific features. The
idea is to determine which verbs, preposi-
tions, and conjunctions are used in sentences
containing a target word pair, and to com-
pare those to features extracted for other
word pairs in order to determine which are
most similar. By combining these Web fea-
tures with words from the sentence context,
our team was able to achieve the best results
for systems of category C and third best for
systems of category A.
