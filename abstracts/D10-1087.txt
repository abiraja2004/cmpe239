This paper proposes a method for automat-
ically inserting commas into Japanese texts.
In Japanese sentences, commas play an im-
portant role in explicitly separating the con-
stituents, such as words and phrases, of a sen-
tence. The method can be used as an ele-
mental technology for natural language gen-
eration such as speech recognition and ma-
chine translation, or in writing-support tools
for non-native speakers. We categorized the
usages of commas and investigated the ap-
pearance tendency of each category. In this
method, the positions where commas should
be inserted are decided based on a machine
learning approach. We conducted a comma
insertion experiment using a text corpus and
confirmed the effectiveness of our method.
