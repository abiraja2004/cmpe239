Studies assessing rating scales are very com-
mon in psychology and related fields, but
are rare in NLP. In this paper we as-
sess discrete and continuous scales used for
measuring quality assessments of computer-
generated language. We conducted six sep-
arate experiments designed to investigate the
validity, reliability, stability, interchangeabil-
ity and sensitivity of discrete vs. continuous
scales. We show that continuous scales are vi-
able for use in language evaluation, and offer
distinct advantages over discrete scales.
