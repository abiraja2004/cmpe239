The idea that some words carry more semantic 
content  than  others,  has  led  to  the  notion  of 
term specificity,  or informativeness. Computa-
tional  estimation of  this  quantity  is  important 
for various applications such as information re-
trieval. We propose a new method of comput-
ing term specificity, based on modeling the rate 
of learning of word meaning in Latent Semantic 
Analysis  (LSA).  We analyze  the performance 
of this method both qualitatively and quantitat-
ively and  demonstrate  that  it  shows excellent 
performance compared to existing methods on 
a  broad  range  of  tests.  We  also  demonstrate 
how it can be used to improve existing applica-
tions  in  information  retrieval  and  summariza-
tion.
