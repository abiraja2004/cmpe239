Multilingual Pseudo-Relevance Feedback
(MultiPRF) is a framework to improve
the PRF of a source language by taking
the help of another language called as-
sisting language. In this paper, we ex-
tend the MultiPRF framework to include
multiple assisting languages. We consider
three different configurations to incorpo-
rate multiple assisting languages - a) Par-
allel - all assisting languages combined
simultaneously b) Serial - assisting lan-
guages combined in sequence one after
another and c) Selective - dynamically se-
lecting the best feedback model for each
query. We study their effect on MultiPRF
performance. Results using multiple as-
sisting languages are mixed and it helps in
boosting MultiPRF accuracy only in some
cases. We also observe that MultiPRF be-
comes more robust with increase in num-
ber of assisting languages.
