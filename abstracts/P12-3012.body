In this paper we present an API for program-
matic access to BabelNet ? a wide-coverage
multilingual lexical knowledge base ? and
multilingual knowledge-rich Word Sense Dis-
ambiguation (WSD). Our aim is to provide the
research community with easy-to-use tools to
perform multilingual lexical semantic analysis
and foster further research in this direction.
