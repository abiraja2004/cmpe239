Determining whether two terms in text have
an ancestor relation (e.g. Toyota and car) or
a sibling relation (e.g. Toyota and Honda) is
an essential component of textual inference in
NLP applications such as Question Answer-
ing, Summarization, and Recognizing Textual
Entailment. Significant work has been done
on developing stationary knowledge sources
that could potentially support these tasks, but
these resources often suffer from low cover-
age, noise, and are inflexible when needed to
support terms that are not identical to those
placed in them, making their use as general
purpose background knowledge resources dif-
ficult. In this paper, rather than building a sta-
tionary hierarchical structure of terms and re-
lations, we describe a system that, given two
terms, determines the taxonomic relation be-
tween them using a machine learning-based
approach that makes use of existing resources.
Moreover, we develop a global constraint opti-
mization inference process and use it to lever-
age an existing knowledge base also to enforce
relational constraints among terms and thus
improve the classifier predictions. Our exper-
imental evaluation shows that our approach
significantly outperforms other systems built
upon existing well-known knowledge sources.
