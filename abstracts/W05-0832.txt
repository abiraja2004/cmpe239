Translation memories provide assis-
tance to human translators in produc-
tion settings, and are sometimes used
as first-pass machine translation in as-
similation settings because they pro-
duce highly fluent output very rapidly.
In this paper, we describe and eval-
uate a simple whole-segment transla-
tion memory, placing it as a new lower
bound in the well-populated space of
machine translation systems. The re-
sult is a new way to gauge how far ma-
chine translation has progressed com-
pared to an easily understood baseline
system.
The evaluation also sheds light on the
evaluation metric and gives evidence
showing that gaming translation with
perfect fluency does not fool bleu the
way it fools people.
