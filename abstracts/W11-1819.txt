In this paper we describe a rule-based sys-
tem developed for the BioNLP 2011 GENIA
event detection task. The system applies Ky-
bots (Knowledge Yielding Robots) on anno-
tated texts to extract bio-events involving pro-
teins or genes. The main goal of this work is to
verify the usefulness and portability of the Ky-
bot technology to the domain of biomedicine.
