We describe our system for the translation
task of WMT 2010. This system, devel-
oped for the English-French and French-
English directions, is based on Moses and
was trained using only the resources sup-
plied for the workshop. We report exper-
iments to enhance it with out-of-domain
parallel corpora sub-sampling, N-best list
post-processing and a French grammatical
checker.
