One deficiency of current shallow pars-
ing based Semantic Role Labeling (SRL)
methods is that syntactic chunks are too
small to effectively group words. To par-
tially resolve this problem, we propose
semantics-driven shallow parsing, which
takes into account both syntactic struc-
tures and predicate-argument structures.
We also introduce several new ?path? fea-
tures to improve shallow parsing based
SRL method. Experiments indicate that
our new method obtains a significant im-
provement over the best reported Chinese
SRL result.
