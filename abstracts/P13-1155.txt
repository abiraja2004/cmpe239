We introduce a social media text normal-
ization system that can be deployed as a
preprocessing step for Machine Transla-
tion and various NLP applications to han-
dle social media text. The proposed sys-
tem is based on unsupervised learning of
the normalization equivalences from unla-
beled text. The proposed approach uses
Random Walks on a contextual similarity
bipartite graph constructed from n-gram
sequences on large unlabeled text corpus.
We show that the proposed approach has a
very high precision of (92.43) and a rea-
sonable recall of (56.4). When used as
a preprocessing step for a state-of-the-art
machine translation system, the translation
quality on social media text improved by
6%. The proposed approach is domain and
language independent and can be deployed
as a preprocessing step for any NLP appli-
cation to handle social media text.
