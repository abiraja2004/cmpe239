This paper describes the Nara Institute
of Science and Technology (NAIST) er-
ror correction system in the CoNLL 2013
Shared Task. We constructed three sys-
tems: a system based on the Treelet Lan-
guage Model for verb form and subject-
verb agreement errors; a classifier trained
on both learner and native corpora for
noun number errors; a statistical machine
translation (SMT)-based model for prepo-
sition and determiner errors. As for
subject-verb agreement errors, we show
that the Treelet Language Model-based
approach can correct errors in which the
target verb is distant from its subject. Our
system ranked fourth on the official run.
