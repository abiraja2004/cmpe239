The automatic interpretation of noun-noun
compounds is an important subproblem
within many natural language processing
applications and is an area of increasing
interest. The problem is difficult, with dis-
agreement regarding the number and na-
ture of the relations, low inter-annotator
agreement, and limited annotated data. In
this paper, we present a novel taxonomy
of relations that integrates previous rela-
tions, the largest publicly-available anno-
tated dataset, and a supervised classifica-
tion method for automatic noun compound
interpretation.
