. Many methods of term extraction have been discussed in
terms of their accuracy on huge corpora. However, when we try to apply
various methods that derive from frequency to a small corpus, we may
not be able to achieve sufficient accuracy because of the shortage of
statistical information on frequency. This paper reports a new way of
extracting terms that is tuned for a very small corpus. It focuses on the
structure of compound terms and calculates perplexity on the term unit?s
left-side and right-side. The results of our experiments revealed that the
accuracy with the proposed method was not that advantageous. However,
experimentation with the method combining perplexity and frequency
information obtained the highest average-precision in comparison with
other methods.
