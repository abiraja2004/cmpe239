This paper attempts to bridge the gap between
FrameNet frames and inference. We describe a
computational formalism that captures structural re-
lationships among participants in a dynamic sce-
nario. This representation is used to describe the
internal structure of FrameNet frames in terms of
parameters for event simulations. We apply our for-
malism to the commerce domain and show how it
provides a flexible means of accounting for linguis-
tic perspective and other inferential effects.
