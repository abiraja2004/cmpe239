Coreference resolution systems rely heav-
ily on string overlap (e.g., Google Inc. and
Google), performing badly on mentions with
very different words (opaque mentions) like
Google and the search giant. Yet prior at-
tempts to resolve opaque pairs using ontolo-
gies or distributional semantics hurt precision
more than improved recall. We present a new
unsupervised method for mining opaque pairs.
Our intuition is to restrict distributional se-
mantics to articles about the same event, thus
promoting referential match. Using an En-
glish comparable corpus of tech news, we built
a dictionary of opaque coreferent mentions
(only 3% are in WordNet). Our dictionary can
be integrated into any coreference system (it
increases the performance of a state-of-the-art
system by 1% F1 on all measures) and is eas-
ily extendable by using news aggregators.
