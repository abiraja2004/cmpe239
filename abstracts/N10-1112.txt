We describe a method of incorporating task-
specific cost functions into standard condi-
tional log-likelihood (CLL) training of linear
structured prediction models. Recently intro-
duced in the speech recognition community,
we describe the method generally for struc-
tured models, highlight connections to CLL
and max-margin learning for structured pre-
diction (Taskar et al, 2003), and show that
the method optimizes a bound on risk. The
approach is simple, efficient, and easy to im-
plement, requiring very little change to an
existing CLL implementation. We present
experimental results comparing with several
commonly-used methods for training struc-
tured predictors for named-entity recognition.
