We present FireCite, a Mozilla Firefox
browser extension that helps scholars as-
sess and manage scholarly references on
the web by automatically detecting and
parsing such reference strings in real-time.
FireCite has two main components: 1)
a reference string recognizer that has a
high recall of 96%, and 2) a reference
string parser that can process HTML web
pages with an overall F1 of .878 and plain-
text reference strings with an overall F1
of .97. In our preliminary evaluation, we
presented our FireCite prototype to four
academics in separate unstructured inter-
views. Their positive feedback gives evi-
dence to the desirability of FireCite?s cita-
tion management capabilities.
