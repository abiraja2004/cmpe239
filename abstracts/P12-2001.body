This paper presents a higher-order model for
constituent parsing aimed at utilizing more lo-
cal structural context to decide the score of
a grammar rule instance in a parse tree. Ex-
periments on English and Chinese treebanks
confirm its advantage over its first-order ver-
sion. It achieves its best F1 scores of 91.86%
and 85.58% on the two languages, respec-
tively, and further pushes them to 92.80%
and 85.60% via combination with other high-
performance parsers.
