We present our system used in the CoNLL
2007 shared task on multilingual parsing.
The system is composed of three compo-
nents: a k-best maximum spanning tree
(MST) parser, a tree labeler, and a reranker
that orders the k-best labeled trees. We
present two techniques for training the
MST parser: tree-normalized and graph-
normalized conditional training. The tree-
based reranking model allows us to explic-
itly model global syntactic phenomena. We
describe the reranker features which include
non-projective edge attributes. We provide
an analysis of the errors made by our system
and suggest changes to the models and fea-
tures that might rectify the current system.
