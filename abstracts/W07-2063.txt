We describe experiments for the cross-
document coreference task in SemEval
2007. Our cross-document coreference sys-
tem uses an in-house agglomerative clus-
tering implementation to group documents
referring to the same entity. Clustering
uses vector representations created by sum-
marization and semantic tagging analysis
components. We present evaluation results
for four system configurations demonstrat-
ing the potential of the applied techniques.
