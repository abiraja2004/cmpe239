In this paper, we present a dependency tree-
based method for sentiment classification of
Japanese and English subjective sentences us-
ing conditional random fields with hidden
variables. Subjective sentences often con-
tain words which reverse the sentiment po-
larities of other words. Therefore, interac-
tions between words need to be considered
in sentiment classification, which is difficult
to be handled with simple bag-of-words ap-
proaches, and the syntactic dependency struc-
tures of subjective sentences are exploited in
our method. In the method, the sentiment po-
larity of each dependency subtree in a sen-
tence, which is not observable in training data,
is represented by a hidden variable. The po-
larity of the whole sentence is calculated in
consideration of interactions between the hid-
den variables. Sum-product belief propaga-
tion is used for inference. Experimental re-
sults of sentiment classification for Japanese
and English subjective sentences showed that
the method performs better than other meth-
ods based on bag-of-features.
