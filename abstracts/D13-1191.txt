We explore Debatepedia, a community-
authored encyclopedia of sociopolitical de-
bates, as evidence for inferring a low-
dimensional, human-interpretable representa-
tion in the domain of issues and positions. We
introduce a generative model positing latent
topics and cross-cutting positions that gives
special treatment to person mentions and opin-
ion words. We evaluate the resulting repre-
sentation?s usefulness in attaching opinionated
documents to arguments and its consistency
with human judgments about positions.
