We present a novel approach for multilin-
gual document clustering using only com-
parable corpora to achieve cross-lingual
semantic interoperability. The method
models document collections as weighted
graph, and supervisory information is
given as sets of must-linked constraints for
documents in different languages. Recur-
sive k-nearest neighbor similarity propa-
gation is used to exploit the prior knowl-
edge and merge two language spaces.
Spectral method is applied to find the best
cuts of the graph. Experimental results
show that using limited supervisory in-
formation, our method achieves promis-
ing clustering results. Furthermore, since
the method does not need any language
dependent information in the process, our
algorithm can be applied to languages in
various alphabetical systems.
