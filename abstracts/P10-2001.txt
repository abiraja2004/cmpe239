Lattice decoding in statistical machine
translation (SMT) is useful in speech
translation and in the translation of Ger-
man because it can handle input ambigu-
ities such as speech recognition ambigui-
ties and German word segmentation ambi-
guities. We show that lattice decoding is
also useful for handling input variations.
Given an input sentence, we build a lattice
which represents paraphrases of the input
sentence. We call this a paraphrase lattice.
Then, we give the paraphrase lattice as an
input to the lattice decoder. The decoder
selects the best path for decoding. Us-
ing these paraphrase lattices as inputs, we
obtained significant gains in BLEU scores
for IWSLT and Europarl datasets.
