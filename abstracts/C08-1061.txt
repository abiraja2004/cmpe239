 
Classifying what-type questions into 
proper semantic categories is found more 
challenging than classifying other types 
in question answering systems.  In this 
paper, we propose to classify what-type 
questions by head noun tagging. The ap-
proach highlights the role of head nouns 
as the category discriminator of what-
type questions. To reduce the semantic 
ambiguities of head noun, we integrate 
local syntactic feature, semantic feature 
and category dependency among adjacent 
nouns with Conditional Random Fields 
(CRFs). Experiments on standard ques-
tion classification data set show that the 
approach achieves state-of-the-art per-
formances.
