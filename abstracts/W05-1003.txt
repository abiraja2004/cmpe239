 
We developed a novel classification of 
concept attributes and two supervised 
classifiers using this classification to iden-
tify concept attributes from candidate at-
tributes extracted from the Web. Our 
binary (attribute / non-attribute) classifier 
achieves an accuracy of 81.82% whereas 
our 5-way classifier achieves 80.35%.
