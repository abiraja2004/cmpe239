 
The primary focuses of this entry this year 
was firstly, to develop a framework to al-
low multiple researchers from our group to 
easily contribute metrics measuring textual 
entailment, and secondly, to provide a 
baseline which we could use in our tools to 
evaluate and compare new metrics.  A de-
velopment environment tool was created to 
quickly allow for testing of various metrics 
and to easily randomize the development 
and test sets.  For each test, this RTE tool 
calculated two sets of results by applying 
the metrics to both a univariate Gaussian 
density and by maximizing a linear dis-
criminant function.  The metrics used for 
the submission were a lexical similarity 
metric and a lexical similarity metric using 
synonym and antonym replacement.  The 
two submissions for RTE 2007 scored an 
accuracy of 61.00% and 62.62%.
