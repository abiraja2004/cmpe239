 
This paper describes and evaluates MOP, an 
IE system for automatic extraction of 
metalinguistic information from technical and 
scientific documents. We claim that such a 
system can create special databases to boot-
strap compilation and facilitate update of the 
huge and dynamically changing glossaries, 
knowledge bases and ontologies that are vital 
to modern-day research.
