alignment tasks often adopt word 
segmentation systems firstly to identify 
words. However, word-mismatching 
problems exist between languages and will 
degrade the performance of word 
alignment. In this paper, we propose two 
unsupervised methods to adjust word 
segmentation to make the tokens 1-to-1 
mapping as many as possible between the 
corresponding sentences. The first method 
is learning affix rules from a bilingual 
terminology bank. The second method is 
using the concept of impurity measure 
motivated by the decision tree. Our 
experiments showed that both of the 
adjusting methods improve the 
performance of word alignment 
significantly.
