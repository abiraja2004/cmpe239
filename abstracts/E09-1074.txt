Current approaches to the prediction of
associations rely on just one type of in-
formation, generally taking the form of
either word space models or collocation
measures. At the moment, it is an open
question how these approaches compare
to one another. In this paper, we will
investigate the performance of these two
types of models and that of a new ap-
proach based on compounding. The best
single predictor is the log-likelihood ratio,
followed closely by the document-based
word space model. We will show, how-
ever, that an ensemble method that com-
bines these two best approaches with the
compounding algorithm achieves an in-
crease in performance of almost 30% over
the current state of the art.
