We describe a method for incorporating syntactic informa-
tion in statistical machine translation systems. The first step
of the method is to parse the source language string that is be-
ing translated. The second step is to apply a series of trans-
formations to the parse tree, effectively reordering the surface
string on the source language side of the translation system. The
goal of this step is to recover an underlying word order that is
closer to the target language word-order than the original string.
The reordering approach is applied as a pre-processing step in
both the training and decoding phases of a phrase-based statis-
tical MT system. We describe experiments on translation from
German to English, showing an improvement from 25.2% Bleu
score for a baseline system to 26.8% Bleu score for the system
with reordering, a statistically significant improvement.
