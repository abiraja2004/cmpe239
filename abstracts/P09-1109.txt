We propose a hybrid approach to coor-
dinate structure analysis that combines
a simple grammar to ensure consistent
global structure of coordinations in a sen-
tence, and features based on sequence
alignment to capture local symmetry of
conjuncts. The weight of the alignment-
based features, which in turn determines
the score of coordinate structures, is op-
timized by perceptron training on a given
corpus. A bottom-up chart parsing al-
gorithm efficiently finds the best scor-
ing structure, taking both nested or non-
overlapping flat coordinations into ac-
count. We demonstrate that our approach
outperforms existing parsers in coordina-
tion scope detection on the Genia corpus.
