Recently, hierarchical text classification has
become an active research topic. The essential
idea is that the descendant classes can share
the information of the ancestor classes in a
predefined taxonomy. In this paper, we claim
that each class has several latent concepts and
its subclasses share information with these d-
ifferent concepts respectively. Then, we pro-
pose a variant Passive-Aggressive (PA) algo-
rithm for hierarchical text classification with
latent concepts. Experimental results show
that the performance of our algorithm is com-
petitive with the recently proposed hierarchi-
cal classification algorithms.
