 
We describe an approach for generating a 
ranked list of candidate document transla-
tion pairs without the use of bilingual dic-
tionary or machine translation system. We 
developed this approach as an initial, filter-
ing step, for extracting parallel text from 
large, multilingual?but non-parallel?
corpora. We represent bilingual documents 
in a vector space whose basis vectors are 
the overlapping tokens found in both lan-
guages of the collection. Using this repre-
sentation, weighted by tf?idf, we compute 
cosine document similarity to create a 
ranked list of candidate document transla-
tion pairs. Unlike cross-language informa-
tion retrieval, where a ranked list in the 
target language is evaluated for each source 
query, we are interested in, and evaluate, 
the more difficult task of finding translated 
document pairs. We first perform a feasi-
bility study of our approach on parallel col-
lections in multiple languages, representing 
multiple language families and scripts. The 
approach is then applied to a large bilingual 
collection of around 800k books. To avoid 
the computational cost of )( 2nO document 
pair comparisons, we employ locality sen-
sitive hashing (LSH) approximation algo-
rithm for cosine similarity, which reduces 
our time complexity to )log( nnO .
