Hierarchical Bayesian Models (HBMs)
have been used with some success
to capture empirically observed pat-
terns of under- and overgeneralization
in child language acquisition. How-
ever, as is well known, HBMs are
?ideal? learning systems, assuming ac-
cess to unlimited computational re-
sources that may not be available
to child language learners. Conse-
quently, it remains crucial to carefully
assess the use of HBMs along with al-
ternative, possibly simpler, candidate
models. This paper presents such
an evaluation for a language acquisi-
tion domain where explicit HBMs have
been proposed: the acquisition of En-
glish dative constructions. In particu-
lar, we present a detailed, empirically-
grounded model-selection compari-
son of HBMs vs. a simpler alternative
based on clustering along with max-
imum likelihood estimation that we
call linear competition learning (LCL).
Our results demonstrate that LCL can
match HBM model performance with-
out incurring on the high computa-
tional costs associated with HBMs.
