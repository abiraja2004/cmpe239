Generative lexicalized parsing models,
which are the mainstay for probabilistic
parsing of English, do not perform as well
when applied to languages with differ-
ent language-specific properties such as
free(r) word order or rich morphology. For
German and other non-English languages,
linguistically motivated complex treebank
transformations have been shown to im-
prove performance within the framework
of PCFG parsing, while generative lexical-
ized models do not seem to be as easily
adaptable to these languages.
In this paper, we show a practical way
to use grammatical functions as first-class
citizens in a discriminative model that al-
lows to extend annotated treebank gram-
mars with rich feature sets without hav-
ing to suffer from sparse data problems.
We demonstrate the flexibility of the ap-
proach by integrating unsupervised PP at-
tachment and POS-based word clusters
into the parser.
