Unsupervised approaches to multi-document
summarization consist of two steps: find-
ing a content model of the documents to be
summarized, and then generating a summary
that best represents the most salient informa-
tion of the documents. In this paper, we
present a sentence selection objective for ex-
tractive summarization in which sentences are
penalized for containing content that is spe-
cific to the documents they were extracted
from. We modify an existing system, HIER-
SUM (Haghighi & Vanderwende, 2009), to use
our objective, which significantly outperforms
the original HIERSUM in pairwise user eval-
uation. Additionally, our ROUGE scores ad-
vance the current state-of-the-art for both su-
pervised and unsupervised systems with sta-
tistical significance.
