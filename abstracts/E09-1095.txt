Concept taxonomies offer a powerful means 
for organizing knowledge, but this organiza-
tion  must  allow  for  many  overlapping  and 
fine-grained perspectives if a general-purpose 
taxonomy is  to  reflect  concepts  as  they are 
actually employed and reasoned about in ev-
eryday  usage.  We present  here  a  means  of 
bootstrapping  finely-discriminating  tax-
onomies from a variety of different  starting 
points, or seeds, that are acquired from three 
different sources: WordNet, ConceptNet and 
the web at large.
