This paper proposes a novel approach for rela-
tion extraction from free text which is trained
to jointly use information from the text and
from existing knowledge. Our model is based
on scoring functions that operate by learning
low-dimensional embeddings of words, enti-
ties and relationships from a knowledge base.
We empirically show on New York Times ar-
ticles aligned with Freebase relations that our
approach is able to efficiently use the extra in-
formation provided by a large subset of Free-
base data (4M entities, 23k relationships) to
improve over methods that rely on text fea-
tures alone.
