 
Language learning is a relatively new appli- 
cation for natural language processing (NLP) 
and for intelligent tutoring and learning 
environments (ITLEs). NLP has a crucial role 
to play in foreign language ITLEs, whether they 
are designed for explicit or implicit learning of 
the vocabulary and grammar. FLUENT is an 
implicit approach, in which NLP and shared- 
control animation support a two-medium 
conversation, designed to foster implicit 
learning of language. This report highlights 
specific ways that FLUENT already uses NLP, 
suggests potential benefits from additional use 
of NLP and grounds the method in widely used 
language learning pedagogy. It concludes by 
describing and evaluating the system's use in 
the classroom, with a particularly challenging 
kind of learner.
