Syntactic features are useful for many
text classification tasks. Among these,
tree kernels (Collins and Duffy, 2001)
have been perhaps the most robust and
effective syntactic tool, appealing for
their empirical success, but also be-
cause they do not require an answer
to the difficult question of which tree
features to use for a given task. We
compare tree kernels to different ex-
plicit sets of tree features on five diverse
tasks, and find that explicit features of-
ten perform as well as tree kernels on
accuracy and always in orders of mag-
nitude less time, and with smaller mod-
els. Since explicit features are easy to
generate and use (with publicly avail-
able tools), we suggest they should al-
ways be included as baseline compar-
isons in tree kernel method evaluations.
