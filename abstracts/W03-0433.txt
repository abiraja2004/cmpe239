This paper investigates stacking and voting
methods for combining strong classifiers like
boosting, SVM, and TBL, on the named-entity
recognition task. We demonstrate several ef-
fective approaches, culminating in a model that
achieves error rate reductions on the develop-
ment and test sets of 63.6% and 55.0% (En-
glish) and 47.0% and 51.7% (German) over the
CoNLL-2003 standard baseline respectively,
and 19.7% over a strong AdaBoost baseline
model from CoNLL-2002.
