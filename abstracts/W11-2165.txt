A growing body of machine translation re-
search aims to exploit lexical patterns (e.g., n-
grams and phrase pairs) with gaps (Simard et
al., 2005; Chiang, 2005; Xiong et al, 2011).
Typically, these ?gappy patterns? are discov-
ered using heuristics based on word align-
ments or local statistics such as mutual infor-
mation. In this paper, we develop generative
models of monolingual and parallel text that
build sentences using gappy patterns of arbi-
trary length and with arbitrarily many gaps.
We exploit Bayesian nonparametrics and col-
lapsed Gibbs sampling to discover salient pat-
terns in a corpus. We evaluate the patterns
qualitatively and also add them as features to
an MT system, reporting promising prelimi-
nary results.
