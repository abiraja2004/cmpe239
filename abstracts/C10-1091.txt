 
The main task we address in our research 
is classification of text using fine-grained 
attitude labels. The developed @AM sys-
tem relies on the compositionality prin-
ciple and a novel approach based on the 
rules elaborated for semantically distinct 
verb classes. The evaluation of our me-
thod on 1000 sentences, that describe 
personal experiences, showed promising 
results: average accuracy on the fine-
grained level (14 labels) was 62%, on the 
middle level (7 labels) ? 71%, and on the 
top level (3 labels) ? 88%.
