Linguists use phylogenetic methods to
build evolutionary trees of languages
given lexical, phonological, and morpho-
logical data. Perfect phylogeny is too re-
strictive to explain most data sets. Con-
servative Dollo phylogeny is more permis-
sive, and has been used in biological ap-
plications. We propose the use of conser-
vative Dollo phylogeny as an alternative
or complementary approach for linguistic
phylogenetics. We test this approach on an
Indo-European dataset.
