This paper introduces a semi-supervised
learning framework for creating training
material, namely active annotation. The
main intuition is that an unsupervised
method is used to initially annotate imper-
fectly the data and then the errors made
are detected automatically and corrected
by a human annotator. We applied ac-
tive annotation to named entity recogni-
tion in the biomedical domain and encour-
aging results were obtained. The main
advantages over the popular active learn-
ing framework are that no seed annotated
data is needed and that the reusability of
the data is maintained. In addition to the
framework, an efficient uncertainty esti-
mation for Hidden Markov Models is pre-
sented.
