We present a named entity recognition (NER)
system for extracting product attributes and
values from listing titles. Information extrac-
tion from short listing titles present a unique
challenge, with the lack of informative con-
text and grammatical structure. In this work,
we combine supervised NER with bootstrap-
ping to expand the seed list, and output nor-
malized results. Focusing on listings from
eBay?s clothing and shoes categories, our
bootstrapped NER system is able to identify
new brands corresponding to spelling variants
and typographical errors of the known brands,
as well as identifying novel brands. Among
the top 300 new brands predicted, our system
achieves 90.33% precision. To output normal-
ized attribute values, we explore several string
comparison algorithms and found n-gram sub-
string matching to work well in practice.
