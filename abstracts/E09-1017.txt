Sentence fluency is an important compo-
nent of overall text readability but few
studies in natural language processing
have sought to understand the factors that
define it. We report the results of an ini-
tial study into the predictive power of sur-
face syntactic statistics for the task; we use
fluency assessments done for the purpose
of evaluating machine translation. We
find that these features are weakly but sig-
nificantly correlated with fluency. Ma-
chine and human translations can be dis-
tinguished with accuracy over 80%. The
performance of pairwise comparison of
fluency is also very high?over 90% for a
multi-layer perceptron classifier. We also
test the hypothesis that the learned models
capture general fluency properties applica-
ble to human-written text. The results do
not support this hypothesis: prediction ac-
curacy on the new data is only 57%. This
finding suggests that developing a dedi-
cated, task-independent corpus of fluency
judgments will be beneficial for further in-
vestigations of the problem.
