 
Parallel corpora are a crucial resource in 
research fields such as cross-lingual infor-
mation retrieval and statistical machine 
translation, but only a few parallel corpora 
with high quality are publicly available 
nowadays. In this paper, we try to solve the 
problem by developing a system that can 
automatically mine high quality parallel 
corpora from the World Wide Web. The 
system contains a three-step process. The 
system uses a web spider to crawl certain 
hosts at first. Then candidate parallel web 
page pairs are prepared from the 
downloaded page set. At last, each candi-
date pair is examined based on multiple 
standards. We develop novel strategies for 
the implementation of the system, which 
are then proved to be rather effective by the 
experiments towards a multilingual website.
