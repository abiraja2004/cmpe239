We describe Joshua, an open source
toolkit for statistical machine transla-
tion. Joshua implements all of the algo-
rithms required for synchronous context
free grammars (SCFGs): chart-parsing, n-
gram language model integration, beam-
and cube-pruning, and k-best extraction.
The toolkit also implements suffix-array
grammar extraction and minimum error
rate training. It uses parallel and dis-
tributed computing techniques for scala-
bility. We demonstrate that the toolkit
achieves state of the art translation per-
formance on the WMT09 French-English
translation task.
