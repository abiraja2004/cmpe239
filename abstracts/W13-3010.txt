The consistency method has been estab-
lished as the standard strategy for extract-
ing high quality translation rules in statis-
tical machine translation (SMT). However,
no attention has been drawn to why this
method is successful, other than empiri-
cal evidence. Using concepts from graph
theory, we identify the relation between
consistency and components of graphs that
represent word-aligned sentence pairs. It
can be shown that phrase pairs of interest
to SMT form a sigma-algebra generated
by components of such graphs. This con-
struction is generalized by allowing seg-
mented sentence pairs, which in turn gives
rise to a phrase-based generative model. A
by-product of this model is a derivation of
probability mass functions for random par-
titions. These are realized as cases of con-
strained, biased sampling without replace-
ment and we provide an exact formula for
the probability of a segmentation of a sen-
tence.
