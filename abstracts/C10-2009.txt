This paper presents a framework for com-
bining semantic relations extracted from
text to reveal even more semantics that
otherwise would be missed. A set of 26 re-
lations is introduced, with their arguments
defined on an ontology of sorts. A seman-
tic parser is used to extract these relations
from noun phrases and verb argument
structures. The method was successfully
used in two applications: rapid customiza-
tion of semantic relations to arbitrary do-
mains and recognizing entailments.
