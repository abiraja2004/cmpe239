Recurrent event queries (REQ) constitute a
special class of search queries occurring at
regular, predictable time intervals. The fresh-
ness of documents ranked for such queries is
generally of critical importance. REQ forms a
significant volume, as much as 6% of query
traffic received by search engines. In this
work, we develop an improved REQ classi-
fier that could provide significant improve-
ments in addressing this problem. We ana-
lyze REQ queries, and develop novel features
from multiple sources, and evaluate them us-
ing machine learning techniques. From histor-
ical query logs, we develop features utilizing
query frequency, click information, and user
intent dynamics within a search session. We
also develop temporal features by time series
analysis from query frequency. Other gener-
ated features include word matching with re-
current event seed words and time sensitiv-
ity of search result set. We use Naive Bayes,
SVM and decision tree based logistic regres-
sion model to train REQ classifier. The re-
sults on test data show that our models outper-
formed baseline approach significantly. Ex-
periments on a commercial Web search en-
gine also show significant gains in overall rel-
evance, and thus overall user experience.
