 
Bag-of-words (BOW) is now the most popular 
way to model text in machine learning based 
sentiment classification. However, the perfor-
mance of such approach sometimes remains 
rather limited due to some fundamental defi-
ciencies of the BOW model. In this paper, we 
focus on the polarity shift problem, and pro-
pose a novel approach, called dual training and 
dual prediction (DTDP), to address it. The 
basic idea of DTDP is to first generate artifi-
cial samples that are polarity-opposite to the 
original samples by polarity reversion, and 
then leverage both the original and opposite 
samples for (dual) training and (dual) predic-
tion. Experimental results on four datasets 
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed 
approach for polarity classification.
