In this paper, we test the applicability
of a stochastic user simulation technique
to generate dialogs which are similar to
real human-machine spoken interactions.
To do so, we present a comparison be-
tween two corpora employing a compre-
hensive set of evaluation measures. The
first corpus was acquired from real inter-
actions of users with a spoken dialog sys-
tem, whereas the second was generated by
means of the simulation technique, which
decides the next user answer taking into
account the previous user turns, the last
system answer and the objective of the di-
alog.
