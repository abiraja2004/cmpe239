Sentiment Word Identification (SWI) is a
basic technique in many sentiment analy-
sis applications. Most existing research-
es exploit seed words, and lead to low ro-
bustness. In this paper, we propose a novel
optimization-based model for SWI. Unlike
previous approaches, our model exploits
the sentiment labels of documents instead
of seed words. Several experiments on re-
al datasets show that WEED is effective
and outperforms the state-of-the-art meth-
ods with seed words.
