This paper proposes a method for identify-
ing synonymous relations in a bilingual lex-
icon, which is a set of translation-equivalent
term pairs. We train a classifier for identi-
fying those synonymous relations by using
spelling variations as main clues. We com-
pared two approaches: the direct identifi-
cation of bilingual synonym pairs, and the
merger of two monolingual synonyms. We
showed that our approach achieves a high
pair-wise precision and recall, and outper-
forms the baseline method.
