Distant supervision, heuristically labeling a
corpus using a knowledge base, has emerged
as a popular choice for training relation ex-
tractors. In this paper, we show that a sig-
nificant number of ?negative? examples gen-
erated by the labeling process are false neg-
atives because the knowledge base is incom-
plete. Therefore the heuristic for generating
negative examples has a serious flaw. Building
on a state-of-the-art distantly-supervised ex-
traction algorithm, we proposed an algorithm
that learns from only positive and unlabeled
labels at the pair-of-entity level. Experimental
results demonstrate its advantage over existing
algorithms.
