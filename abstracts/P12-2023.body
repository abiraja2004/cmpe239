We propose an approach that biases machine
translation systems toward relevant transla-
tions based on topic-specific contexts, where
topics are induced in an unsupervised way
using topic models; this can be thought of
as inducing subcorpora for adaptation with-
out any human annotation. We use these topic
distributions to compute topic-dependent lex-
ical weighting probabilities and directly in-
corporate them into our translation model as
features. Conditioning lexical probabilities
on the topic biases translations toward topic-
relevant output, resulting in significant im-
provements of up to 1 BLEU and 3 TER on
Chinese to English translation over a strong
baseline.
