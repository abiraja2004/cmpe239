SenseClusters is a freely available sys-
tem that clusters similar contexts. It can
be applied to a wide range of problems,
although here we focus on word sense
and name discrimination. It supports
several different measures for automati-
cally determining the number of clusters
in which a collection of contexts should
be grouped. These can be used to discover
the number of senses in which a word is
used in a large corpus of text, or the num-
ber of entities that share the same name.
There are three measures based on clus-
tering criterion functions, and another on
the Gap Statistic.
