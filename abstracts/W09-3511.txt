Transliteration of given parallel name en-
tities can be formulated as a phrase-based
statistical machine translation (SMT) pro-
cess, via its routine procedure compris-
ing training, optimization and decoding.
In this paper, we present our approach to
transliterating name entities using the log-
linear phrase-based SMT on character se-
quences. Our proposed work improves the
translation by using bidirectional models,
plus some heuristic guidance integrated in
the decoding process. Our evaluated re-
sults indicate that this approach performs
well in all standard runs in the NEWS2009
Machine Transliteration Shared Task.
