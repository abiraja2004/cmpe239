Obtaining high-quality machine transla-
tions is still a long way off. A post-
editing phase is required to improve the
output of a machine translation system.
An alternative is the so called computer-
assisted translation. In this framework, a
human translator interacts with the sys-
tem in order to obtain high-quality trans-
lations. A statistical phrase-based ap-
proach to computer-assisted translation is
described in this article. A new decoder al-
gorithm for interactive search is also pre-
sented, that combines monotone and non-
monotone search. The system has been
assessed in the TransType-2 project for
the translation of several printer manuals,
from (to) English to (from) Spanish, Ger-
man and French.
