 
Mandarin Chinese is a highly flexible and context-sensitive 
language. It is difficult to do the case marking and index 
assignment during the parsing of Chinese sentences. This 
paper proposes a logic-based Government-Binding approach to 
treat this problem. The grammar formalism is specified in a 
formal way. Uniform treatments of movements, arbitrary 
number of movement non-terminals, automatic detection of 
grammar errors beforehand, and clear declarative semantics are 
its specific features. Many common linguistic phenomena of
Chinese sentences are represented with this fornmlism. For 
example, topic-comment structures, the ba-constructions, the 
bei-constructions, relative clause constructions, appositive 
clause constructions, and serial verb constructions. A simple 
pronot,n resolution is touched upon. The expressive 
capabilities and the design methodologies show this mechanism 
is also suitable for other flexible and context-sensitive 
languages.
