In the eld of empirical natural language
processing, researchers constantly deal with
large amounts of marked-up data; whether
the markup is done by the researcher or
someone else, human nature dictates that it
will have errors in it. This paper will more
fully characterise the problem and discuss
whether and when (and how) to correct the
errors. The discussion is illustrated with
specic examples involving function tagging
in the Penn treebank.
