 
This paper introduces a system that simulates 
the transition from the one-word stage to the 
two-word stage in child language production.  
Two-word descriptions are syntactically 
generated and compete against one-word 
descriptions from the outset.  Two-word 
descriptions become dominant as word 
combinations are repeatedly recognised, 
forming syntactic categories; resulting in an 
emergent simple syntax.  The system 
demonstrates a similar maturation as children 
as evidenced by phenomena such as 
overextensions and mismatching, and the use 
of one-word descriptions being replaced by 
two-word descriptions over time.
