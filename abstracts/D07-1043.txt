We present V-measure, an external entropy-
based cluster evaluation measure. V-
measure provides an elegant solution to
many problems that affect previously de-
fined cluster evaluation measures includ-
ing 1) dependence on clustering algorithm
or data set, 2) the ?problem of matching?,
where the clustering of only a portion of data
points are evaluated and 3) accurate evalu-
ation and combination of two desirable as-
pects of clustering, homogeneity and com-
pleteness. We compare V-measure to a num-
ber of popular cluster evaluation measures
and demonstrate that it satisfies several de-
sirable properties of clustering solutions, us-
ing simulated clustering results. Finally, we
use V-measure to evaluate two clustering
tasks: document clustering and pitch accent
type clustering.
