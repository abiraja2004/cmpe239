 
We introduce the ACL Anthology Net-
work (AAN), a manually curated net-
worked database of citations, 
collaborations, and summaries in the field 
of Computational Linguistics. We also 
present a number of statistics about the 
network including the most cited authors, 
the most central collaborators, as well as 
network statistics about the paper citation, 
author citation, and author collaboration 
networks.
