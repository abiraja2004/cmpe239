 
This paper studies sentiment analysis 
from the user-generated content on the 
Web. In particular, it focuses on mining 
opinions from comparative sentences, i.e., 
to determine which entities in a compari-
son are preferred by its author. A typical 
comparative sentence compares two or 
more entities. For example, the sentence, 
?the picture quality of Camera X is better 
than that of Camera Y?, compares two 
entities ?Camera X? and ?Camera Y? 
with regard to their picture quality. Clear-
ly, ?Camera X? is the preferred entity. 
Existing research has studied the problem 
of extracting some key elements in a 
comparative sentence. However, there is 
still no study of mining opinions from 
comparative sentences, i.e., identifying 
preferred entities of the author. This pa-
per studies this problem, and proposes a 
technique to solve the problem. Our ex-
periments using comparative sentences 
from product reviews and forum posts 
show that the approach is effective.
