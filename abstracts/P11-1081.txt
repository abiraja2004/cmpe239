We present an ILP-based model of zero
anaphora detection and resolution that builds
on the joint determination of anaphoricity and
coreference model proposed by Denis and
Baldridge (2007), but revises it and extends it
into a three-way ILP problem also incorporat-
ing subject detection. We show that this new
model outperforms several baselines and com-
peting models, as well as a direct translation of
the Denis / Baldridge model, for both Italian
and Japanese zero anaphora. We incorporate
our model in complete anaphoric resolvers for
both Italian and Japanese, showing that our
approach leads to improved performance also
when not used in isolation, provided that sep-
arate classifiers are used for zeros and for ex-
plicitly realized anaphors.
