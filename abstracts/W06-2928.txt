We describe a parser used in the CoNLL
2006 Shared Task, ?Multingual Depen-
dency Parsing.? The parser first identi-
fies syntactic dependencies and then labels
those dependencies using a maximum en-
tropy classifier. We consider the impact of
feature engineering and the choice of ma-
chine learning algorithm, with particular
focus on Slovene, Spanish and Swedish.
