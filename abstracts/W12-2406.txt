We present an algorithm for extracting abbre-
viation definitions from biomedical text. Our
approach is based on an alignment HMM,
matching abbreviations and their definitions.
We report 98% precision and 93% recall on
a standard data set, and 95% precision and
91% recall on an additional test set. Our re-
sults show an improvement over previously re-
ported methods and our model has several ad-
vantages. Our model: (1) is simpler and faster
than a comparable alignment-based abbrevia-
tion extractor; (2) is naturally generalizable to
specific types of abbreviations, e.g., abbrevia-
tions of chemical formulas; (3) is trained on a
set of unlabeled examples; and (4) associates a
probability with each predicted definition. Us-
ing the abbreviation alignment model we were
able to extract over 1.4 million abbreviations
from a corpus of 200K full-text PubMed pa-
pers, including 455,844 unique definitions.
