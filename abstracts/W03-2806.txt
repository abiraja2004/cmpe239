A wide range of parser and/or grammar
evaluation methods have been reported
in the literature. However, in most cases
these evaluations take the parsers in-
dependently (intrinsic evaluations), and
only in a few cases has the effect
of different parsers in real applications
been measured (extrinsic evaluations).
This paper compares two evaluations
of the Link Grammar parser and the
Conexor Functional Dependency Gram-
mar parser. The parsing systems, de-
spite both being dependency-based, re-
turn different types of dependencies,
making a direct comparison impossi-
ble. In the intrinsic evaluation, the accu-
racy of the parsers is compared indepen-
dently by converting the dependencies
into grammatical relations and using the
methodology of Carroll et al (1998) for
parser comparison. In the extrinsic eval-
uation, the parsers? impact in a practi-
cal application is compared within the
context of answer extraction. The dif-
ferences in the results are significant.
