This paper presents an original approach to
semi-supervised learning of personal name
ethnicity from typed graphs of morphophone-
mic features and first/last-name co-occurrence
statistics. We frame this as a general solu-
tion to an inference problem over typed graphs
where the edges represent labeled relations be-
tween features that are parameterized by the
edge types. We propose a framework for
parameter estimation on different construc-
tions of typed graphs for this problem us-
ing a gradient-free optimization method based
on grid search. Results on both in-domain
and out-of-domain data show significant gains
over 30% accuracy improvement using the
techniques presented in the paper.
