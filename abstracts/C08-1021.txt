This paper presents a new fully auto-
matic method for building highly dense
and accurate knowledge bases from ex-
isting semantic resources. Basically, the
method uses a wide-coverage and accu-
rate knowledge-based Word Sense Dis-
ambiguation algorithm to assign the most
appropriate senses to large sets of topi-
cally related words acquired from the web.
KnowNet, the resulting knowledge-base
which connects large sets of semantically-
related concepts is a major step towards
the autonomous acquisition of knowledge
from raw corpora. In fact, KnowNet is sev-
eral times larger than any available knowl-
edge resource encoding relations between
synsets, and the knowledge KnowNet con-
tains outperform any other resource when
is empirically evaluated in a common
framework.
