Recent studies have shown the poten-
tial benefits of leveraging resources for
resource-rich languages to build tools for
similar, but resource-poor languages. We
examine what constitutes ?similarity? by
comparing traditional phylogenetic lan-
guage groups, which are motivated largely
by genetic relationships, with language
groupings formed by clustering methods
using typological features only. Using
data from the World Atlas of Language
Structures (WALS), our preliminary ex-
periments show that typologically-based
clusters look quite different from genetic
groups, but perform as good or better
when used to predict feature values of
member languages.
