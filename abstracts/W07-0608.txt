Naming requires recognition. Recognition requires
the ability to categorize objects and events. In-
fants under six months of age are capable of making
fine-grained discriminations of object boundaries and
three-dimensional space. At 8 to 10 months, a child?s
object categories are sufficiently stable and flexible to
be used as the foundation for labeling and referenc-
ing actions. What mechanisms in the brain underlie
the unfolding of these capacities? In this article, we
describe a neural network model which attempts to
simulate, in a biologically plausible way, the process
by which infants learn how to recognize objects and
words through exposure to visual stimuli and vocal
sounds.
