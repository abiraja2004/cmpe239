 
This paper addresses a new task in sentiment 
classification, called multi-domain sentiment 
classification, that aims to improve perform-
ance through fusing training data from multi-
ple domains. To achieve this, we propose two 
approaches of fusion, feature-level and classi-
fier-level, to use training data from multiple 
domains simultaneously. Experimental stud-
ies show that multi-domain sentiment classi-
fication using the classifier-level approach 
performs much better than single domain 
classification (using the training data indi-
vidually).
