Term translation probabilities proved an
effective method of semantic smoothing in
the language modelling approach to infor-
mation retrieval tasks. In this paper, we
use Generalized Latent Semantic Analysis
to compute semantically motivated term
and document vectors. The normalized
cosine similarity between the term vec-
tors is used as term translation probabil-
ity in the language modelling framework.
Our experiments demonstrate that GLSA-
based term translation probabilities cap-
ture semantic relations between terms and
improve performance on document classi-
fication.
