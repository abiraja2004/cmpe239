This paper describes our approach to rep-
resenting and querying multi-dimensional,
possibly overlapping text annotations, as
used in our question answering (QA) sys-
tem. We use a system extending XQuery,
the W3C-standard XML query language,
with new axes that allow one to jump eas-
ily between different annotations of the
same data. The new axes are formulated in
terms of (partial) overlap and containment.
All annotations are made using stand-off
XML in a single document, which can be
efficiently queried using the XQuery ex-
tension. The system is scalable to giga-
bytes of XML annotations. We show ex-
amples of the system in QA scenarios.
