Most existing systems for Chinese Seman-
tic Role Labeling (SRL) make use of full
syntactic parses. In this paper, we evalu-
ate SRL methods that take partial parses as
inputs. We first extend the study on Chi-
nese shallow parsing presented in (Chen
et al, 2006) by raising a set of addi-
tional features. On the basis of our shal-
low parser, we implement SRL systems
which cast SRL as the classification of
syntactic chunks with IOB2 representation
for semantic roles (i.e. semantic chunks).
Two labeling strategies are presented: 1)
directly tagging semantic chunks in one-
stage, and 2) identifying argument bound-
aries as a chunking task and labeling their
semantic types as a classification task. For
both methods, we present encouraging re-
sults, achieving significant improvements
over the best reported SRL performance
in the literature. Additionally, we put
forward a rule-based algorithm to auto-
matically acquire Chinese verb formation,
which is empirically shown to enhance
SRL.
