Machine translation of a source language
sentence involves selecting appropriate tar-
get language words and ordering the se-
lected words to form a well-formed tar-
get language sentence. Most of the pre-
vious work on statistical machine transla-
tion relies on (local) associations of target
words/phrases with source words/phrases
for lexical selection. In contrast, in this pa-
per, we present a novel approach to lexical
selection where the target words are associ-
ated with the entire source sentence (global)
without the need to compute local associa-
tions. Further, we present a technique for
reconstructing the target language sentence
from the selected words. We compare the re-
sults of this approach against those obtained
from a finite-state based statistical machine
translation system which relies on local lex-
ical associations.
