 
In this paper we present an extractive system that au-
tomatically generates gene summaries from the biomed-
ical literature. The proposed text summarization system 
selects and ranks sentences from multiple MEDLINE 
abstracts by exploiting gene-specific information and 
similarity relationships between sentences. We evaluate 
our system on a large dataset of 7,294 human genes and 
187,628 MEDLINE abstracts using Recall-Oriented 
Understudy for Gisting Evaluation (ROUGE), a widely 
used automatic evaluation metric in the text summariza-
tion community. Two baseline methods are used for 
comparison. Experimental results show that our system 
significantly outperforms the other two methods with 
regard to all ROUGE metrics. A demo website of our 
system is freely accessible at
