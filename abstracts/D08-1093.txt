Statistical parsers have become increasingly
accurate, to the point where they are useful in
many natural language applications. However,
estimating parsing accuracy on a wide variety
of domains and genres is still a challenge in
the absence of gold-standard parse trees.
In this paper, we propose a technique that au-
tomatically takes into account certain charac-
teristics of the domains of interest, and ac-
curately predicts parser performance on data
from these new domains. As a result, we have
a cheap (no annotation involved) and effective
recipe for measuring the performance of a sta-
tistical parser on any given domain.
