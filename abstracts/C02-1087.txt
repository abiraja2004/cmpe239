  
In this paper we propose an integration of a 
selforganizing map and semantic networks 
from WordNet for a text classification task 
using the new Reuters news corpus.  This 
neural model is based on significance vectors 
and benefits from the presentation of 
document clusters.  The Hypernym relation 
in WordNet supplements the neural model in 
classification.  We also analyse the 
relationships of news headlines and their 
contents of the new Reuters corpus by a 
series of experiments.  This hybrid approach 
of neural selforganization and symbolic 
hypernym relationships is successful to 
achieve good classification rates on 100,000 
full-text news articles.  These results 
demonstrate that this approach can scale up 
to a large real-world task and show a lot of 
potential for text classification.
