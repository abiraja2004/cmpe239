 
This paper proposes a new method for 
word translation disambiguation using 
a machine learning technique called 
?Bilingual Bootstrapping?. Bilingual 
Bootstrapping makes use of  in 
learning a small number of classified 
data and a large number of unclassified 
data in the source and the target 
languages in translation. It constructs 
classifiers in the two languages in 
parallel and repeatedly boosts the 
performances of the classifiers by 
further classifying data in each of the 
two languages and by exchanging 
between the two languages 
information regarding the classified 
data. Experimental results indicate that 
word translation disambiguation based 
on Bilingual Bootstrapping 
consistently and significantly 
outperforms the existing methods 
based on ?Monolingual 
Bootstrapping?.
