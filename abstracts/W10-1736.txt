English is a typical SVO (Subject-Verb-
Object) language, while Japanese is a typ-
ical SOV language. Conventional Statis-
tical Machine Translation (SMT) systems
work well within each of these language
families. However, SMT-based translation
from an SVO language to an SOV lan-
guage does not work well because their
word orders are completely different. Re-
cently, a few groups have proposed rule-
based preprocessing methods to mitigate
this problem (Xu et al, 2009; Hong et al,
2009). These methods rewrite SVO sen-
tences to derive more SOV-like sentences
by using a set of handcrafted rules. In this
paper, we propose an alternative single re-
ordering rule: Head Finalization. This
is a syntax-based preprocessing approach
that offers the advantage of simplicity. We
do not have to be concerned about part-
of-speech tags or rule weights because the
powerful Enju parser allows us to imple-
ment the rule at a general level. Our ex-
periments show that its result, Head Final
English (HFE), follows almost the same
order as Japanese. We also show that this
rule improves automatic evaluation scores.
