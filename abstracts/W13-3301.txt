We present a new approach to dialogue
processing in terms of ?meaning units?. In
our annotation task, we asked speakers of
English and Chinese to mark boundaries
where they could construct the maximal
concept using minimal words. We com-
pared English data across genres (news,
literature, and policy). We analyzed the
agreement for annotators using a state-of-
the-art segmentation similarity algorithm
and compared annotations with a random
baseline. We found that annotators are
able to identify meaning units systemati-
cally, even though they may disagree on
the quantity and position of units. Our
analysis includes an examination of phrase
structure for annotated units using con-
stituency parses.1
