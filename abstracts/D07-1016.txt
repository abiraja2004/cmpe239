Inclusions from other languages can be a
significant source of errors for monolin-
gual parsers. We show this for English in-
clusions, which are sufficiently frequent to
present a problem when parsing German.
We describe an annotation-free approach for
accurately detecting such inclusions, and de-
velop two methods for interfacing this ap-
proach with a state-of-the-art parser for Ger-
man. An evaluation on the TIGER cor-
pus shows that our inclusion entity model
achieves a performance gain of 4.3 points in
F-score over a baseline of no inclusion de-
tection, and even outperforms a parser with
access to gold standard part-of-speech tags.
