In this paper we introduce two methods for
deriving the intentional structure of complex
questions. Techniques that enable the deriva-
tion of implied information are also presented.
We show that both the intentional structure
and the implicatures enabled by it are essen-
tial components of Q/A systems capable of suc-
cessfully processing complex questions. The
results of our evaluation support the claim that
there are multiple interactions between the pro-
cess of answer finding and the coercion of in-
tentions and implicatures.
