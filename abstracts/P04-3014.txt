We present an improved method for automated word
alignment of parallel texts which takes advantage
of knowledge of syntactic divergences, while avoid-
ing the need for syntactic analysis of the less re-
source rich language, and retaining the robustness of
syntactically agnostic approaches such as the IBM
word alignment models. We achieve this by using
simple, easily-elicited knowledge to produce syntax-
based heuristics which transform the target lan-
guage (e.g. English) into a form more closely resem-
bling the source language, and then by using stan-
dard alignment methods to align the transformed
bitext. We present experimental results under vari-
able resource conditions. The method improves
word alignment performance for language pairs such
as English-Korean and English-Hindi, which exhibit
longer-distance syntactic divergences.
