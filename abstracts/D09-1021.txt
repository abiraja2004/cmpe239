We describe a novel approach for syntax-
based statistical MT, which builds on a
variant of tree adjoining grammar (TAG).
Inspired by work in discriminative depen-
dency parsing, the key idea in our ap-
proach is to allow highly flexible reorder-
ing operations during parsing, in combina-
tion with a discriminative model that can
condition on rich features of the source-
language string. Experiments on trans-
lation from German to English show im-
provements over phrase-based systems,
both in terms of BLEU scores and in hu-
man evaluations.
