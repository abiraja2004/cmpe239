Creative metaphor is a phenomenon that
stretches and bends the conventions of se-
mantic description, often to humorous and
poetic extremes. The computational mod-
eling of metaphor thus requires a knowl-
edge representation that is just as stretch-
able and semantically accommodating. We
present here a flexible knowledge repre-
sentation for metaphor interpretation and
generation, called Talking Points, and de-
scribe how talking points can be acquired
on a large scale from WordNet (Fellbaum,
1998) and from the web. We show how
talking points can be fluidly connected to
form a slipnet, and demonstrate that talk-
ing points provide an especially concise
representation for concepts in general.
