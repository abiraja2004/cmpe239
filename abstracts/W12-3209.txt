The ACL Anthology was revamped in 2012
to its second major version, encompassing
faceted navigation, social media use, as well
as author- and reader-generated content and
comments on published work as part of the re-
vised frontend user interface. At the backend,
the Anthology was updated to incorporate its
publication records into a database. We de-
scribe the ACL Anthology?s previous legacy,
redesign and revamp process and technolo-
gies, and its resulting functionality.
