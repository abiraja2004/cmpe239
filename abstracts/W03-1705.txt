 
Statistical methods for extracting Chinese 
unknown words usually suffer a problem 
that superfluous character strings with 
strong statistical associations are extracted 
as well. To solve this problem, this paper 
proposes to use a set of general morpho-
logical rules to broaden the coverage and 
on the other hand, the rules are appended 
with different linguistic and statistical 
constraints to increase the precision of the 
representation. To disambiguate rule ap-
plications and reduce the complexity of 
the rule matching, a bottom-up merging 
algorithm for extraction is proposed, 
which merges possible morphemes recur-
sively by consulting above the general 
rules and dynamically decides which rule 
should be applied first according to the 
priorities of the rules. Effects of different 
priority strategies are compared in our ex-
periment, and experimental results show 
that the performance of proposed method 
is very promising.
