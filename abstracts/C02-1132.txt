We evaluate probabilistic models of verb argument
structure trained on a corpus of verbs and their syn-
tactic arguments. Models designed to represent pat-
terns of verb alternation behavior are compared with
generic clustering models in terms of the perplexity
assigned to held-out test data. While the special-
ized models of alternation do not perform as well,
closer examination reveals alternation behavior rep-
resented implicitly in the generic models.
