In this work we examine user adaptation
to a dialog system?s choice of realiza-
tion of task-related concepts. We ana-
lyze forms of the time concept in the Let?s
Go! spoken dialog system. We find that
users adapt to the system?s choice of time
form. We also find that user adaptation
is affected by perceived system adapta-
tion. This means that dialog systems can
guide users? word choice and can adapt
their own recognition models to gain im-
proved ASR accuracy.
