 
Unification of disjunctive feature descriptions 
is important for efficient unification-based pars- 
ing. This paper presents constraint projection, 
a new method for unification of disjunctive fea- 
ture structures represented by logical constraints. 
Constraint projection is a generalization of con- 
straint unification, and is more efficient because 
constraint projection has a mechanism for aban- 
doning information irrelevant o a goal specified 
by a list of variables.
