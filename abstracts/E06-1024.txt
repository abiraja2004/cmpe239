In this paper, we address the problem
of reducing the unpredictability of user-
initiated dialogue contributions in human-
computer interaction without explicitly re-
stricting the user?s interactive possibili-
ties. We demonstrate that it is possible to
identify conditions under which particular
classes of user-initiated contributions will
occur and discuss consequences for dia-
logue system design.
