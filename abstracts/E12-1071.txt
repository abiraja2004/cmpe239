We propose an unsupervised, iterative
method for detecting downward-entailing
operators (DEOs), which are important for
deducing entailment relations between sen-
tences. Like the distillation algorithm of
Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil et al(2009), the
initialization of our method depends on the
correlation between DEOs and negative po-
larity items (NPIs). However, our method
trusts the initialization more and aggres-
sively separates likely DEOs from spuri-
ous distractors and other words, unlike dis-
tillation, which we show to be equivalent
to one iteration of EM prior re-estimation.
Our method is also amenable to a bootstrap-
ping method that co-learns DEOs and NPIs,
and achieves the best results in identifying
DEOs in two corpora.
