 
Measuring differences between near-
synonyms constitutes a major challenge in the 
development of electronic dictionaries and 
natural language processing systems. This pa-
per presents a pilot study on how Population 
Test Method (PTM) may be used as an effec-
tive, empirical tool to define near-synonyms 
in a quantifiable manner. Use of PTM pre-
sumes that all knowledge about lexical mean-
ing in a language resides collectively in the 
mind(s) of its native speakers, and that this in-
tersubjective understanding may be extracted 
via targeted surveys that encourage creative, 
thinking responses. In this paper we show (1) 
examples of such tests performed on a group 
of high school students in Finland, (2) result-
ing data from the tests that is surprisingly 
quantifiable, and (3) a web-based visualiza-
tion program we are developing to analyze 
and present the collected data.
