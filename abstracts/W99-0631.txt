 
This paper is concerned with using a se- 
mantic hierarchy to estimate the frequency 
with which a word sense appears as a given 
argument of a verb, assuming the data is 
not sense disambiguated. The standard ap- 
proach is to split the count for any noun ap- 
pearing in the data equally among the al- 
ternative senses of the noun. This can lead 
to inaccurate stimates. We describe a re- 
estimation process which uses the accumu- 
lated counts of hypernyms of the alternative 
senses in order to redistribute the count. In 
order to choose a hypernym for each alter- 
native sense, we employ a novel technique 
which uses a X 2 test to measure the homo- 
geneity of sets of concepts in the hierarchy.
