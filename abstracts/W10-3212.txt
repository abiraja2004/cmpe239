 
This paper presents a technique for word 
segmentation for the Urdu OCR system. 
Word segmentation or word tokeniza-
tion is a preliminary task for Urdu lan-
guage processing. Several techniques 
are available for word segmentation in 
other languages. A methodology is pro-
posed for word segmentation in this pa-
per which determines the boundaries of 
words given a sequence of ligatures, 
based on collocation of ligatures and 
words in the corpus. Using this tech-
nique, word identification rate of 
96.10% is achieved, using trigram prob-
abilities normalized over the number of 
ligatures and words in the sequence.
