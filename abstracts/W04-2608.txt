 
This paper proposes two decision trees for de-
termining the meanings of the prepositional 
uses of over by using the contextual informa-
tion. It first examines the meanings of the 
prepositional uses of over and then aims at 
identifying the contexts for interpreting the 
meanings. Some contexts are complementary 
features, and that makes the decision trees sim-
ple. The trees have been tested on a corpus, and 
the results are encouraging.
