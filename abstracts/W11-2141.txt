In this paper we describe our hybrid machine
translation system with which we participated
in the WMT11 shared translation task for the
English?German language pair. Our system
was able to outperform its RBMT baseline and
turned out to be the best-scored participating
system in the manual evaluation. To achieve
this, we extended an existing, rule-based MT
system with a module for stochastic selection
of analysis parse trees that allowed to better
cope with parsing errors during the system?s
analysis phase. Due to the integration into the
analysis phase of the RBMT engine, we are
able to preserve the benefits of a rule-based
translation system such as proper generation
of target language text. Additionally, we used
a statistical tool for terminology extraction to
improve the lexicon of the RBMT system.
We report results from both automated metrics
and human evaluation efforts, including exam-
ples which show how the proposed approach
can improve machine translation quality.
