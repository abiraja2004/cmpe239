SenseClusters is a freely available word sense
discrimination system that takes a purely unsu-
pervised clustering approach. It uses no knowl-
edge other than what is available in a raw un-
structured corpus, and clusters instances of a
given target word based only on their mutual
contextual similarities. It is a complete sys-
tem that provides support for feature selec-
tion from large corpora, several different con-
text representation schemes, various clustering
algorithms, and evaluation of the discovered
clusters.
