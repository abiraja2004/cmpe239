We apply a baseline approach to the
CoNLL-2010 shared task data sets on
hedge detection. Weights have been as-
signed to cue words marked in the train-
ing data based on their occurrences in
certain and uncertain sentences. New
sentences received scores that correspond
with those of their best scoring cue word,
if present. The best acceptance scores for
uncertain sentences were determined us-
ing 10-fold cross validation on the training
data. This approach performed reasonably
on the shared task?s biological (F=82.0)
and Wikipedia (F=62.8) data sets.
