The problem of identifying good features
for improving conventional language mod-
els like trigrams is presented as a classifica-
tion task in this paper. The idea is to use
various syntactic and semantic features ex-
tracted from a language for classifying be-
tween real-world articles and articles gener-
ated by sampling a trigram language model.
In doing so, a good accuracy obtained on the
classification task implies that the extracted
features capture those aspects of the lan-
guage that a trigram model may not. Such
features can be used to improve the exist-
ing trigram language models. We describe
the results of our experiments on the classi-
fication task performed on a Broadcast News
Corpus and discuss their effects on language
modeling in general.
