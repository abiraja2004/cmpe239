 
A minimally supervised machine learning 
framework is described for extracting rela-
tions of various complexity. Bootstrapping 
starts from a small set of n-ary relation in-
stances as ?seeds?, in order to automati-
cally learn pattern rules from parsed data, 
which then can extract new instances of the 
relation and its projections. We propose a 
novel rule representation enabling the 
composition of n-ary relation rules on top 
of the rules for projections of the relation. 
The compositional approach to rule con-
struction is supported by a bottom-up pat-
tern extraction method. In comparison to 
other automatic approaches, our rules can-
not only localize relation arguments but 
also assign their exact target argument 
roles. The method is evaluated in two 
tasks: the extraction of Nobel Prize awards 
and management succession events. Perfor-
mance for the new Nobel Prize task is 
strong. For the management succession 
task the results compare favorably with 
those of existing pattern acquisition ap-
proaches.
