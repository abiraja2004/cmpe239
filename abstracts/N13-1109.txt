In a meeting, it is often desirable to extract
keywords from each utterance as soon as it is
spoken. Thus, this paper proposes a just-in-
time keyword extraction from meeting tran-
scripts. The proposed method considers two
major factors that make it different from key-
word extraction from normal texts. The first
factor is the temporal history of preceding ut-
terances that grants higher importance to re-
cent utterances than old ones, and the sec-
ond is topic relevance that forces only the pre-
ceding utterances relevant to the current utter-
ance to be considered in keyword extraction.
Our experiments on two data sets in English
and Korean show that the consideration of the
factors results in performance improvement in
keyword extraction from meeting transcripts.
