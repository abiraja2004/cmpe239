The inherent robustness of a system might be an
important prerequisite for an incremental pars-
ing model to the effect that grammaticality re-
quirements on full sentences may be suspended
or allowed to be violated transiently. How-
ever, we present additional means that allow the
grammarian to model prefix-analyses by alter-
ing a grammar for non-incremental parsing in a
controlled way. This is done by introducing un-
derspecified dependency edges that model the
expected relation between already seen and yet
unseen words during parsing. Thus the basic
framework of weighted constraint dependency
parsing is extended by the notion of dynamic
dependency parsing.
