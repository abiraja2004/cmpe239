?Lightweight? semantic annotation of text
calls for a simple representation, ideally with-
out requiring a semantic lexicon to achieve
good coverage in the language and domain.
In this paper, we repurpose WordNet?s super-
sense tags for annotation, developing specific
guidelines for nominal expressions and ap-
plying them to Arabic Wikipedia articles in
four topical domains. The resulting corpus
has high coverage and was completed quickly
with reasonable inter-annotator agreement.
