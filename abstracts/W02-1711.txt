In this paper, we discuss a method to screen
inconsistencies in ontologies by applying a nat-
ural language processing (NLP) technique, es-
pecially, those used for word sense disambigua-
tion (WSD). In the database research field, it
is claimed that queries over target ontologies
should play a significant role because they rep-
resent every aspect of the terms described in
each ontology. According to (Calvanese et al,
2001), considering the global and the local on-
tologies, the terms in the global ontology can be
viewed as the query over the local ontology, and
the mapping between the global and the local
ontologies is given by associating each term in
the global ontology with a view. On the other
hand, ontology screening systems should be able
to take advantage of some popular techniques
for WSD, which is supposed to decide the right
sense where the target word is used in a specific
context. We present several examples regard-
ing inconsistencies in ontologies with the aid of
DAML+OIL notation(DAML+OIL, 2001), and
propose that WSD can be one of the promising
method to screen such as inconsistencies.
