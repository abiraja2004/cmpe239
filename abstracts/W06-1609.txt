Reordering is currently one of the most
important problems in statistical machine
translation systems. This paper presents
a novel strategy for dealing with it: sta-
tistical machine reordering (SMR). It con-
sists in using the powerful techniques de-
veloped for statistical machine translation
(SMT) to translate the source language
(S) into a reordered source language (S?),
which allows for an improved translation
into the target language (T). The SMT task
changes from S2T to S?2T which leads to a
monotonized word alignment and shorter
translation units. In addition, the use of
classes in SMR helps to infer new word
reorderings. Experiments are reported in
the EsEn WMT06 tasks and the ZhEn
IWSLT05 task and show significant im-
provement in translation quality.
