This paper summarizes the results of a
large-scale evaluation study of bag-of-
words distributional models on behavioral
data from three semantic priming experi-
ments. The tasks at issue are (i) identifi-
cation of consistent primes based on their
semantic relatedness to the target and (ii)
correlation of semantic relatedness with
latency times. We also provide an evalu-
ation of the impact of specific model pa-
rameters on the prediction of priming. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first
systematic evaluation of a wide range of
DSM parameters in all possible combina-
tions. An important result of the study
is that neighbor rank performs better than
distance measures in predicting semantic
priming.
