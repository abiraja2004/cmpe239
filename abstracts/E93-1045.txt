 
We study parsing of tree adjoining ram- 
mars with particular emphasis on the use 
of shared forests to represent all the parse 
trees deriving a well-formed string. We 
show that there are two distinct ways of 
representing the parse forest one of which 
involves the use of linear indexed grammars 
and the other the use of context-free gram- 
mars. The work presented in this paper is 
intended to give a general framework for 
studying tag parsing. The schemes using 
lig and cfg to represent parses can be seen 
to underly most of the existing tag parsing 
algorithms,
