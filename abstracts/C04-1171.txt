Even ambitious algorithms for the gener-
ation of referring expressions that iden-
tify sets of objects are restricted in terms

toire. In this paper, we report on a system 
that applies a best-first searching proce-
dure, enhancing both its effectiveness and 
the variety of expressions it can generate.
