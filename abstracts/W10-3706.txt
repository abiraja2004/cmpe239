 
This paper presents the automatic ex-
traction of Complex Predicates (CPs) 
in Bengali with a special focus on 
compound verbs (Verb + Verb) and 
conjunct verbs (Noun /Adjective + 
Verb). The lexical patterns of com-
pound and conjunct verbs are extracted 
based on the information of shallow 
morphology and available seed lists of 
verbs. Lexical scopes of compound and 
conjunct verbs in consecutive sequence 
of Complex Predicates (CPs) have 
been identified. The fine-grained error 
analysis through confusion matrix 
highlights some insufficiencies of lexi-
cal patterns and the impacts of different 
constraints that are used to identify the 
Complex Predicates (CPs). System 
achieves F-Scores of 75.73%, and 
77.92% for compound verbs and 
89.90% and 89.66% for conjunct verbs 
respectively on two types of Bengali 
corpus.
