We present a shallow approach to the sentence
ordering problem. The employed features are
based on discourse entities, shallow syntac-
tic analysis, and temporal precedence relations
retrieved from VerbOcean. We show that these
relatively simple features perform well in a
machine learning algorithm on datasets con-
taining sequences of events, and that the re-
sulting models achieve optimal performance
with small amounts of training data. The
model does not yet perform well on datasets
describing the consequences of events, such as
the destructions after an earthquake.
