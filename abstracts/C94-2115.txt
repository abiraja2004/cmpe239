 
A multimodal user interface allows users 
to communicate with computers using mul- 
tiple modalities, such as a mouse, a key- 
board or voice, in various combined ways. 
This paper discusses a multimodal drawing 
tool, whereby the user can use a mouse, 
a keyboard and voice effectively. Also, 
it describes an interpretation method, by 
which the system integrates voice inputs 
and pointing inputs using context.
