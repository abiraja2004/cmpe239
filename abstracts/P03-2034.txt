Speech interfaces to question-answering
systems offer significant potential for find-
ing information with phones and mo-
bile networked devices. We describe a
demonstration of spoken question answer-
ing using a commercial dictation engine
whose language models we have cus-
tomized to questions, a Web-based text-
prediction interface allowing quick cor-
rection of errors, and an open-domain
question-answering system, AnswerBus,
which is freely available on the Web. We
describe a small evaluation of the effect
of recognition errors on the precision of
the answers returned and make some con-
crete recommendations for modifying a
question-answering system for improving
robustness to spoken input.
