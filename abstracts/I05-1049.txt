. Recognition of Multi-word Expressions (MWEs) and their
relative compositionality are crucial to Natural Language Processing.
Various statistical techniques have been proposed to recognize MWEs.
In this paper, we integrate all the existing statistical features and in-
vestigate a range of classifiers for their suitability for recognizing the
non-compositional Verb-Noun (V-N) collocations. In the task of ranking
the V-N collocations based on their relative compositionality, we show
that the correlation between the ranks computed by the classifier and hu-
man ranking is significantly better than the correlation between ranking
of individual features and human ranking. We also show that the prop-
erties ?Distributed frequency of object? (as defined in [27]) and ?Nearest
Mutual Information? (as adapted from [18]) contribute greatly to the
recognition of the non-compositional MWEs of the V-N type and to the
ranking of the V-N collocations based on their relative compositionality.
