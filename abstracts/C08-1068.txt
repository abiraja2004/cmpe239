 
Finite-state Transducers (FST) can be 
very efficient to implement inter-dialectal 
transliteration. We illustrate this on the 
Hindi and Urdu language pair. FSTs can 
also be used for translation between sur-
face-close languages. We introduce UIT 
(universal intermediate transcription) for 
the same pair on the basis of their com-
mon phonetic repository in such a way 
that it can be extended to other languages 
like Arabic, Chinese, English, French, etc. 
We describe a transliteration model based 
on FST and UIT, and evaluate it on Hindi 
and Urdu corpora.
