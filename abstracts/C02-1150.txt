In order to respond correctly to a free form factual ques-
tion given a large collection of texts, one needs to un-
derstand the question to a level that allows determining
some of the constraints the question imposes on a pos-
sible answer. These constraints may include a semantic
classification of the sought after answer and may even
suggest using different strategies when looking for and
verifying a candidate answer.
This paper presents a machine learning approach to
question classification. We learn a hierarchical classi-
fier that is guided by a layered semantic hierarchy of an-
swer types, and eventually classifies questions into fine-
grained classes. We show accurate results on a large col-
lection of free-form questions used in TREC 10.
