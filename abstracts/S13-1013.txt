This paper describes a system for automat-
ically measuring the semantic similarity be-
tween two texts, which was the aim of the
2013 Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) task
(Agirre et al, 2013). For the 2012 STS task,
Heilman and Madnani (2012) submitted the
PERP system, which performed competitively
in relation to other submissions. However,
approaches including word and n-gram fea-
tures also performed well (Ba?r et al, 2012;
S?aric? et al, 2012), and the 2013 STS task fo-
cused more on predicting similarity for text
pairs from new domains. Therefore, for the
three variations of our system that we were al-
lowed to submit, we used stacking (Wolpert,
1992) to combine PERP with word and n-
gram features and applied the domain adapta-
tion approach outlined by Daume III (2007)
to facilitate generalization to new domains.
Our submissions performed well at most sub-
tasks, particularly at measuring the similarity
of news headlines, where one of our submis-
sions ranked 2nd among 89 from 34 teams, but
there is still room for improvement.
