Answer Validation is an emerging topic
in Question Answering, where open do-
main systems are often required to rank
huge amounts of candidate answers. We
present a novel approach to answer valida-
tion based on the intuition that the amount
of implicit knowledge which connects an
answer to a question can be quantitatively
estimated by exploiting the redundancy of
Web information. Experiments carried out
on the TREC-2001 judged-answer collec-
tion show that the approach achieves a
high level of performance (i.e. 81% suc-
cess rate). The simplicity and the effi-
ciency of this approach make it suitable to
be used as a module in Question Answer-
ing systems.
