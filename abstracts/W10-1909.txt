 
Here we explore mining data on gene expres-
sion from the biomedical literature and 
present Gene Expression Text Miner 
(GETM), a tool for extraction of information 
about the expression of genes and their ana-
tomical locations from text. Provided with 
recognized gene mentions, GETM identifies 
mentions of anatomical locations and cell 
lines, and extracts text passages where au-
thors discuss the expression of a particular 
gene in specific anatomical locations or cell 
lines. This enables the automatic construction 
of expression profiles for both genes and ana-
tomical locations. Evaluated against a ma-
nually extended version of the BioNLP '09 
corpus, GETM achieved precision and recall 
levels of 58.8% and 23.8%, respectively. Ap-
plication of GETM to MEDLINE and 
PubMed Central yielded over 700,000 gene 
expression mentions. This data set may be 
queried through a web interface, and should 
prove useful not only for researchers who are 
interested in the developmental regulation of 
specific genes of interest, but also for data-
base curators aiming to create structured re-
positories of gene expression information. 
The compiled tool, its source code, the ma-
nually annotated evaluation corpus and a 
search query interface to the data set ex-
tracted from MEDLINE and  PubMed Cen-
tral is available at http://getm-
project.sourceforge.net/.
