The paper presents the Position Specific
Posterior Lattice (PSPL), a novel lossy
representation of automatic speech recog-
nition lattices that naturally lends itself
to efficient indexing and subsequent rele-
vance ranking of spoken documents.
In experiments performed on a collec-
tion of lecture recordings ? MIT iCam-
pus data ? the spoken document rank-
ing accuracy was improved by 20% rela-
tive over the commonly used baseline of
indexing the 1-best output from an auto-
matic speech recognizer.
The inverted index built from PSPL lat-
tices is compact ? about 20% of the size
of 3-gram ASR lattices and 3% of the size
of the uncompressed speech ? and it al-
lows for extremely fast retrieval. Further-
more, little degradation in performance is
observed when pruning PSPL lattices, re-
sulting in even smaller indexes ? 5% of
the size of 3-gram ASR lattices.
