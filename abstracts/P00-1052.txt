Existing software systems for automated essay scor-
ing can provide NLP researchers with opportunities
to test certain theoretical hypotheses, including some
derived from Centering Theory. In this study we em-
ploy ETS's e-rater essay scoring system to examine
whether local discourse coherence, as dened by a
measure of Rough-Shift transitions, might be a sig-
nicant contributor to the evaluation of essays. Our
positive results indicate that Rough-Shifts do indeed
capture a source of incoherence, one that has not been
closely examined in the Centering literature. These re-
sults not only justify Rough-Shifts as a valid transition
type, but they also support the original formulation of
Centering as a measure of discourse continuity even in
pronominal-free text.
