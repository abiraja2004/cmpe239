 
We describe and motivate the design of a 
lexico-grammatical knowledgebase called 
StringNet and illustrate its significance for re-
search into constructional phenomena in Eng-
lish. StringNet consists of a massive archive 
of what we call hybrid n-grams. Unlike tradi-
tional n-grams, hybrid n-grams can consist of 
any co-occurring combination of POS tags, 
lexemes, and specific word forms. Further, we 
detect and represent superordinate and subor-
dinate relations among hybrid n-grams by 
cross-indexing, allowing the navigation of 
StringNet through these hierarchies, from spe-
cific fixed expressions (?It?s the thought that 
counts?) up to their hosting proto-
constructions (e.g. the It Cleft construction: 
?it?s the [noun] that [verb]?). StringNet sup-
ports discovery of grammatical dependencies 
(e.g., subject-verb agreement) in non-
canonical configurations as well as lexical de-
pendencies (e.g., adjective/noun collocations 
specific to families of constructions).
