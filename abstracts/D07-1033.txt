We cannot use non-local features with cur-
rent major methods of sequence labeling
such as CRFs due to concerns about com-
plexity. We propose a new perceptron algo-
rithm that can use non-local features. Our
algorithm allows the use of all types of
non-local features whose values are deter-
mined from the sequence and the labels. The
weights of local and non-local features are
learned together in the training process with
guaranteed convergence. We present experi-
mental results from the CoNLL 2003 named
entity recognition (NER) task to demon-
strate the performance of the proposed algo-
rithm.
