We discuss the properties of a collection of
news photos and captions, collected from the
Associated Press and Reuters. Captions have
a vocabulary dominated by proper names. We
have implemented various text clustering algo-
rithms to organize these items by topic, as well
as an iconic matcher that identifies articles that
share a picture. We have found that the spe-
cial structure of captions allows us to extract
some names of people actually portrayed in the
image quite reliably, using a simple syntactic
analysis. We have been able to build a directory
of face images of individuals from this collec-
tion.
