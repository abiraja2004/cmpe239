 
In this paper, the authors present a new ap-
proach to sentence level sentiment analysis. 
The aim is to determine whether a sentence 
expresses a positive, negative or neutral sen-
timent, as well as its intensity. The method 
performs WSD over the words in the sentence 
in order to work with concepts rather than 
terms, and makes use of the knowledge in an 
affective lexicon to label these concepts with 
emotional categories.  It also deals with the ef-
fect of negations and quantifiers on polarity 
and intensity analysis. An extensive evaluation 
in two different domains is performed in order 
to determine how the method behaves in 2-
classes (positive and negative), 3-classes (posi-
tive, negative and neutral) and 5-classes 
(strongly negative, weakly negative, neutral, 
weakly positive and strongly positive) classifi-
cation tasks. The results obtained compare fa-
vorably with those achieved by other systems 
addressing similar evaluations.
