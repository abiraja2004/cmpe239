This paper discusses automatic determina-
tion of case in Arabic. This task is a ma-
jor source of errors in full diacritization of
Arabic. We use a gold-standard syntac-
tic tree, and obtain an error rate of about
4.2%, with a machine learning based system
outperforming a system using hand-written
rules. A careful error analysis suggests that
when we account for annotation errors in the
gold standard, the error rate drops to 0.8%,
with the hand-written rules outperforming
the machine learning-based system.
