We demonstrate a dialogue system and the ac-
companying authoring tools that are designed
to allow authors with little or no experience
in building dialogue systems to rapidly build
advanced question-answering characters. To
date seven such virtual characters have been
built by non-experts using this architecture
and tools. Here we demonstrate one such char-
acter, PFC Sean Avery, which was developed
by a non-expert in 3 months.
