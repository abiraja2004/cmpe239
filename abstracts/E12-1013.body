The search space of Phrase-Based Statisti-
cal Machine Translation (PBSMT) systems
can be represented under the form of a di-
rected acyclic graph (lattice). The quality
of this search space can thus be evaluated
by computing the best achievable hypoth-
esis in the lattice, the so-called oracle hy-
pothesis. For common SMT metrics, this
problem is however NP-hard and can only
be solved using heuristics. In this work,
we present two new methods for efficiently
computing BLEU oracles on lattices: the
first one is based on a linear approximation
of the corpus BLEU score and is solved us-
ing the FST formalism; the second one re-
lies on integer linear programming formu-
lation and is solved directly and using the
Lagrangian relaxation framework. These
new decoders are positively evaluated and
compared with several alternatives from the
literature for three language pairs, using lat-
tices produced by two PBSMT systems.
