This paper describes a supervised,
knowledge-intensive approach to the auto-
matic identification of semantic relations
between nominals in English sentences.
The system employs different sets of new
and previously used lexical, syntactic, and
semantic features extracted from various
knowledge sources. At SemEval 2007 the
system achieved an F-measure of 72.4% and
an accuracy of 76.3%.
