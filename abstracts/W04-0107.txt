 
We propose a novel language-independent 
framework for inducing a collection of mor-
phological inflection classes from a monolin-
gual corpus of full form words.  Our approach 
involves two main stages.  In the first stage, 
we generate a large data structure of candidate 
inflection classes and their interrelationships.  
In the second stage, search and filtering tech-
niques are applied to this data structure, to 
identify a select collection of "true" inflection 
classes of the language.  We describe the basic 
methodology involved in both stages of our 
approach and present an evaluation of our 
baseline techniques applied to induction of 
major inflection classes of Spanish.  The pre-
liminary results on an initial training corpus 
already surpass an F1 of 0.5 against ideal 
Spanish inflectional morphology classes.
