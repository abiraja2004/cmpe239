 
This paper introduces conceptual frame-
work of an ontology for describing linguis-
tic services on network-based language in-
frastructures. The ontology defines a tax-
onomy of processing resources and the as-
sociated static language resources. It also 
develops a sub-ontology for abstract lin-
guistic objects such as expression, meaning, 
and description; these help define function-
alities of a linguistic service. The proposed 
ontology is expected to serve as a solid ba-
sis for the interoperability of technical ele-
ments in language infrastructures.
