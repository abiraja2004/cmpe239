We evaluate the effect of adding parse fea-
tures to a leading model of preposition us-
age. Results show a significant improve-
ment in the preposition selection task on
native speaker text and a modest increment
in precision and recall in an ESL error de-
tection task. Analysis of the parser output
indicates that it is robust enough in the face
of noisy non-native writing to extract use-
ful information.
