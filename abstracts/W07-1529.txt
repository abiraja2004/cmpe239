We seek to identify a limited amount of rep-
resentative corpora, suitable for annotation
by the computational linguistics annotation
community. Our hope is that a wide vari-
ety of annotation will be undertaken on the
same corpora, which would facilitate: (1)
the comparison of annotation schemes; (2)
the merging of information represented by
various annotation schemes; (3) the emer-
gence of NLP systems that use informa-
tion in multiple annotation schemes; and (4)
the adoption of various types of best prac-
tice in corpus annotation. Such best prac-
tices would include: (a) clearer demarca-
tion of phenomena being annotated; (b) the
use of particular test corpora to determine
whether a particular annotation task can fea-
sibly achieve good agreement scores; (c)
The use of underlying models for represent-
ing annotation content that facilitate merg-
ing, comparison, and analysis; and (d) To
the extent possible, the use of common an-
notation categories or a mapping among cat-
egories for the same phenomenon used by
different annotation groups.
This study will focus on the problem of
identifying such corpora as well as the suit-
ability of two candidate corpora: the Open
portion of the American National Corpus
(Ide and Macleod, 2001; Ide and Suder-
man, 2004) and the ?Controversial? portions
of the WikipediaXML corpus (Denoyer and
Gallinari, 2006).
