 
We report results of lexical accommodation studies 
involving three different interpretation settings: 
human-human monolingual; human-interpreted 
bilingual; and machine-interpreted bilingual. We 
found significant accommodation i  all three 
conversational settings, with the highest rate in the 
human-interpreted s tting. There is evidence for long- 
range mutual accommodation i that setting, as 
compared to short-range accommodation i the 
machine-interpreted s tting. Motivations discussed in 
the accommodation literature, including speakers' 
concern for social standing and communicational 
efficiency, are examined in the light of the results 
obtained. Finally, we draw implications for the 
design of multimedia human-computer interfaces.
