 
When two texts have an inclusion 
relation, the relationship between them is 
called entailment. The task of 
mechanically distinguishing such a 
relation is called recognising textual 
entailment (RTE), which is basically a 
kind of semantic analysis. A variety of 
methods have been proposed for RTE. 
However, when the previous methods 
were combined, the performances were 
not clear. So, we utilized each method as 
a feature of machine learning, in order to 
combine methods. We have dealt with 
the binary classification problem of two 
texts exhibiting inclusion, and proposed 
a method that uses machine learning to 
judge whether the two texts present the 
same content. We have built a program 
capable to perform entailment judgment 
on the basis of word overlap, i.e. the 
matching rate of the words in the two 
texts, mutual information, and similarity 
of the respective syntax trees (Subpath 
Set). Word overlap was calclated by 
utilizing BiLingual Evaluation 
Understudy (BLEU). Mutual information 
is based on co-occurrence frequency, and 
the Subpath Set was determined by using 
the Japanise WordNet. A Confidence-
Weighted Score of 68.6% was obtained 
in the mutual information experiment on 
RTE. Mutual information and the use of 
three methods of SVM were shown to be 
effective.
