We propose a novel semantic anno-
tation type of assigning truth values
to predicate occurrences, and present
TruthTeller, a standalone publicly-
available tool that produces such annota-
tions. TruthTeller integrates a range
of semantic phenomena, such as nega-
tion, modality, presupposition, implicativ-
ity, and more, which were dealt only partly
in previous works. Empirical evaluations
against human annotations show satisfac-
tory results and suggest the usefulness of
this new type of tool for NLP.
