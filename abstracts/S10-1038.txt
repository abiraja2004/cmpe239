We describe our method for extracting
keyphrases from scientific articles which
we participate in the shared task of
SemEval-2 Evaluation Exercise. Even
though general-purpose term extractors
along with linguistically-motivated analy-
sis allow us to extract elaborated morpho-
syntactic variation forms of terms, a na??ve
statistic approach proposed in this paper
is very simple and quite efficient for ex-
tracting keyphrases especially from well-
structured scientific articles. Based on
the characteristics of keyphrases with sec-
tion information, we obtain 18.34% for
f-measure using top 15 candidates. We
also show further improvement without
any complications and we discuss this at
the end of the paper.
