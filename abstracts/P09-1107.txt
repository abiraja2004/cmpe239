Inspired by the incremental TER align-
ment, we re-designed the Indirect HMM
(IHMM) alignment, which is one of the
best hypothesis alignment methods for
conventional MT system combination, in
an incremental manner. One crucial prob-
lem of incremental alignment is to align a
hypothesis to a confusion network (CN).
Our incremental IHMM alignment is im-
plemented in three different ways: 1) treat
CN spans as HMM states and define state
transition as distortion over covered n-
grams between two spans; 2) treat CN
spans as HMM states and define state tran-
sition as distortion over words in compo-
nent translations in the CN; and 3) use
a consensus decoding algorithm over one
hypothesis and multiple IHMMs, each of
which corresponds to a component trans-
lation in the CN. All these three ap-
proaches of incremental alignment based
on IHMM are shown to be superior to both
incremental TER alignment and conven-
tional IHMM alignment in the setting of
the Chinese-to-English track of the 2008
NIST Open MT evaluation.
