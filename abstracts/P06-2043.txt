 
Automatically acquired lexicons with 
subcategorization information have al-
ready proved accurate and useful enough 
for some purposes but their accuracy still 
shows room for improvement. By means 
of diathesis alternation, this paper pro-
poses a new filtering method, which im-
proved the performance of Korhonen?s 
acquisition system remarkably, with the 
precision increased to 91.18% and recall 
unchanged, making the acquired lexicon 
much more practical for further manual 
proofreading and other NLP uses.
