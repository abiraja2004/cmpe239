 
Excellent concordances can be produced by 
tools mounted on regular web search engines 
but these tools are not suitable for quick 
lookups on the web because it takes time to 
collect ad-hoc corpora with occurrences of a 
queried word or phrase. It is possible to get a 
web concordance in an instant if the amount of 
transferred data can be limited. One way to do 
it is to use snippets from a search engine as a 
basis for concordance lines, which is a 
solution adopted in Lexware Culler - a web 
concordance tool mounted on Google. It takes 
the same time to look up words and phrases in 
Lexware Culler as it takes for Google to 
deliver results for a search. The question is 
whether concordances based on snippets can 
be satisfactory for linguists or language 
learners. Our tests show that they actually can. 
With proper filtering concordances based on 
snippets can provide a good survey of current 
language use, which is particularly important 
as a complement to online dictionaries.
