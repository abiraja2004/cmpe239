We use ?2 to investigate the context de-
pendency of student affect in our com-
puter tutoring dialogues, targeting uncer-
tainty in student answers in 3 automati-
cally monitorable contexts. Our results
show significant dependencies between
uncertain answers and specific contexts.
Identification and analysis of these depen-
dencies is our first step in developing an
adaptive version of our dialogue system.
