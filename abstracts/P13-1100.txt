We propose a new optimization frame-
work for summarization by generalizing
the submodular framework of (Lin and
Bilmes, 2011). In our framework the sum-
marization desideratum is expressed as a
sum of a submodular function and a non-
submodular function, which we call dis-
persion; the latter uses inter-sentence dis-
similarities in different ways in order to
ensure non-redundancy of the summary.
We consider three natural dispersion func-
tions and show that a greedy algorithm
can obtain an approximately optimal sum-
mary in all three cases. We conduct ex-
periments on two corpora?DUC 2004
and user comments on news articles?and
show that the performance of our algo-
rithm outperforms those that rely only on
submodularity.
