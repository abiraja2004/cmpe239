We present tutorial dialogue systems in
two different domains that demonstrate
the use of dialogue management and deep
natural language processing techniques.
Generation techniques are used to produce
natural sounding feedback adapted to stu-
dent performance and the dialogue his-
tory, and context is used to interpret ten-
tative answers phrased as questions.
