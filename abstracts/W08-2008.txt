One of the main problems in research on
automatic summarization is the inaccu-
rate semantic interpretation of the source.
Using specific domain knowledge can con-
siderably alleviate the problem. In this pa-
per, we introduce an ontology-based ex-
tractive method for summarization. It is
based on mapping the text to concepts
and representing the document and its sen-
tences as graphs. We have applied our
approach to summarize biomedical litera-
ture, taking advantages of free resources as
UMLS. Preliminary empirical results are
presented and pending problems are iden-
tified.
