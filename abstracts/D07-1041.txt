We demonstrate an approach for inducing a
tagger for historical languages based on ex-
isting resources for their modern varieties.
Tags from Present Day English source text
are projected to Middle English text using
alignments on parallel Biblical text. We
explore the use of multiple alignment ap-
proaches and a bigram tagger to reduce the
noise in the projected tags. Finally, we train
a maximum entropy tagger on the output of
the bigram tagger on the target Biblical text
and test it on tagged Middle English text.
This leads to tagging accuracy in the low
80?s on Biblical test material and in the 60?s
on other Middle English material. Our re-
sults suggest that our bootstrapping meth-
ods have considerable potential, and could
be used to semi-automate an approach based
on incremental manual annotation.
