 
The development of FrameNet, a large 
database of semantically annotated sen-
tences, has primed research into statistical 
methods for semantic tagging.  We ad-
vance previous work by adopting a 
Maximum Entropy approach and by using 
previous tag information to find the high-
est probability tag sequence for a given 
sentence.  Further we examine the use of 
sentence level syntactic pattern features to 
increase performance.  We analyze our 
strategy on both human annotated and 
automatically identified frame elements, 
and compare performance to previous 
work on identical test data.  Experiments 
indicate a statistically significant im-
provement (p<0.01) of over 6%.
