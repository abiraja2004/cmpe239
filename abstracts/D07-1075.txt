We present an information extraction system
that decouples the tasks of finding relevant
regions of text and applying extraction pat-
terns. We create a self-trained relevant sen-
tence classifier to identify relevant regions,
and use a semantic affinity measure to au-
tomatically learn domain-relevant extraction
patterns. We then distinguish primary pat-
terns from secondary patterns and apply the
patterns selectively in the relevant regions.
The resulting IE system achieves good per-
formance on the MUC-4 terrorism corpus
and ProMed disease outbreak stories. This
approach requires only a few seed extraction
patterns and a collection of relevant and ir-
relevant documents for training.
