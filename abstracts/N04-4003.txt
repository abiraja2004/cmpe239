Conventional statistical machine translation
(SMT) approaches might not be able to find
a good translation due to problems in its sta-
tistical models (due to data sparseness dur-
ing the estimation of the model parameters) as
well as search errors during the decoding pro-
cess. This paper1 presents an example-based
rescoring method that validates SMT transla-
tion candidates and judges whether the selected
decoder output is good or not. Given such
a validation filter, defective translations can
be rejected. The experiments show a dras-
tic improvement in the overall system perfor-
mance compared to translation selection meth-
ods based on statistical scores only.
