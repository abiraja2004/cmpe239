without diacritics. This makes it difficult for 
performing Arabic text processing. Diacritiza-
tion helps clarify the meaning of words and 
disambiguate any vague spellings or pronun-
ciations, as some Arabic words are spelled the 
same but differ in meaning. In this paper, we 
address the issue of adding diacritics to undia-
critized Arabic text using a hybrid approach. 
The approach requires an Arabic lexicon and 
large corpus of fully diacritized text for train-
ing purposes in order to detect diacritics. Case-
Ending is treated as a separate post processing 
task using syntactic information. The hybrid 
approach relies on lexicon retrieval, bigram, 
and SVM-statistical prioritized techniques.  
We present results of an evaluation of the pro-
posed diacritization approach and discuss var-
ious modifications for improving the perfor-
mance of this approach.
