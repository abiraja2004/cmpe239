We present here the translation system we
used in this year?s WMT shared task. The
main objective of our participation was
to test RAMSES, an open source phrase-
based decoder. For that purpose, we used
the baseline system made available by the
organizers of the shared task1 to build the
necessary models. We then carried out a
pair-to-pair comparison of RAMSES with
PHARAOH on the six different translation
directions that we were asked to perform.
We present this comparison in this paper.
