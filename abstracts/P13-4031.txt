This work presents tSEARCH, a web-based
application that provides mechanisms for
doing complex searches over a collection
of translation cases evaluated with a large
set of diverse measures. tSEARCH uses the
evaluation results obtained with the ASIYA
toolkit for MT evaluation and it is connected
to its on-line GUI, which makes possible
a graphical visualization and interactive ac-
cess to the evaluation results. The search
engine offers a flexible query language al-
lowing to find translation examples match-
ing a combination of numerical and struc-
tural features associated to the calculation of
the quality metrics. Its database design per-
mits a fast response time for all queries sup-
ported on realistic-size test beds. In sum-
mary, tSEARCH, used with ASIYA, offers
developers of MT systems and evaluation
metrics a powerful tool for helping transla-
tion and error analysis.
