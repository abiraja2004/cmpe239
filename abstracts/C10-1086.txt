This paper investigates how to automat-
ically create a dialogue control compo-
nent of a listening agent to reduce the cur-
rent high cost of manually creating such
components. We collected a large number
of listening-oriented dialogues with their
user satisfaction ratings and used them to
create a dialogue control component using
partially observable Markov decision pro-
cesses (POMDPs), which can learn a pol-
icy to satisfy users by automatically find-
ing a reasonable reward function. A com-
parison between our POMDP-based com-
ponent and other similarly motivated sys-
tems using human subjects revealed that
POMDPs can satisfactorily produce a dia-
logue control component that can achieve
reasonable subjective assessment.
