In this paper, we propose a data-oriented
method for inferring the emotion of a
speaker conversing with a dialog system
from the semantic content of an utterance.
We first fully automatically obtain a huge
collection of emotion-provoking event in-
stances from the Web. With Japanese cho-
sen as a target language, about 1.3 million
emotion provoking event instances are ex-
tracted using an emotion lexicon and lexi-
cal patterns. We then decompose the emo-
tion classification task into two sub-steps:
sentiment polarity classification (coarse-
grained emotion classification), and emo-
tion classification (fine-grained emotion
classification). For each subtask, the
collection of emotion-proviking event in-
stances is used as labelled examples to
train a classifier. The results of our ex-
periments indicate that our method signif-
icantly outperforms the baseline method.
We also find that compared with the single-
step model, which applies the emotion
classifier directly to inputs, our two-step
model significantly reduces sentiment po-
larity errors, which are considered fatal er-
rors in real dialog applications.
