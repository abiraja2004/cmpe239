Pitch accent placement is a major
topic in intonational phonology re-
search and its application to speech
synthesis. What factors inuence
whether or not a word is made
intonationally prominent or not is
an open question. In this paper,
we investigate how one aspect of a
word's local context | its colloca-
tion with neighboring words | inu-
ences whether it is accented or not.
Results of experiments on two tran-
scribed speech corpora in a medical
domain show that such collocation
information is a useful predictor of
pitch accent placement.
