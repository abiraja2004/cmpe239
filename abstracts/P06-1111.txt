We investigate prototype-driven learning for pri-
marily unsupervised grammar induction. Prior
knowledge is specified declaratively, by providing a
few canonical examples of each target phrase type.
This sparse prototype information is then propa-
gated across a corpus using distributional similar-
ity features, which augment an otherwise standard
PCFG model. We show that distributional features
are effective at distinguishing bracket labels, but not
determining bracket locations. To improve the qual-
ity of the induced trees, we combine our PCFG in-
duction with the CCM model of Klein and Manning
(2002), which has complementary stengths: it iden-
tifies brackets but does not label them. Using only
a handful of prototypes, we show substantial im-
provements over naive PCFG induction for English
and Chinese grammar induction.
