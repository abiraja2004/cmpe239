We investigate the appropriateness of us-
ing a technique based on support vector
machines for identifying thematic struc-
ture of text streams. The thematic seg-
mentation task is modeled as a binary-
classification problem, where the different
classes correspond to the presence or the
absence of a thematic boundary. Exper-
iments are conducted with this approach
by using features based on word distri-
butions through text. We provide em-
pirical evidence that our approach is ro-
bust, by showing good performance on
three different data sets. In particu-
lar, substantial improvement is obtained
over previously published results of word-
distribution based systems when evalua-
tion is done on a corpus of recorded and
transcribed multi-party dialogs.
