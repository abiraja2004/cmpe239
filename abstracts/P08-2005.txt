 
This paper describes an extractive summarizer 
for educational science content called 
COGENT. COGENT extends MEAD based 
on strategies elicited from an empirical study 
with domain and instructional experts. 
COGENT implements a hybrid approach inte-
grating both domain independent sentence 
scoring features and domain-aware features. 
Initial evaluation results indicate that 
COGENT outperforms existing summarizers 
and generates summaries that closely resem-
ble those generated by human experts.
