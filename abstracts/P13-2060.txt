We propose the use of stacking, an ensem-
ble learning technique, to the statistical machine
translation (SMT) models. A diverse ensem-
ble of weak learners is created using the same
SMT engine (a hierarchical phrase-based sys-
tem) by manipulating the training data and a
strong model is created by combining the weak
models on-the-fly. Experimental results on two
language pairs and three different sizes of train-
ing data show significant improvements of up
to 4 BLEU points over a conventionally trained
SMT model.
