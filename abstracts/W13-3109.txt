In this paper we show the results of
our participation in the MultiLing 2013
summarisation tasks. We participated
with single-document and multi-document
corpus-based summarisers for both Ara-
bic and English languages. The sum-
marisers used word frequency lists and
log likelihood calculations to generate sin-
gle and multi document summaries. The
single and multi summaries generated by
our systems were evaluated by Arabic
and English native speaker participants
and by different automatic evaluation met-
rics, ROUGE, AutoSummENG, MeMoG
and NPowER. We compare our results to
other systems that participated in the same
tracks on both Arabic and English lan-
guages. Our single-document summaris-
ers performed particularly well in the auto-
matic evaluation with our English single-
document summariser performing better
on average than the results of the other
participants. Our Arabic multi-document
summariser performed well in the human
evaluation ranking second.
