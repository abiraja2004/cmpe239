The present paper describes procedures to
visualise diachronic language changes in
academic discourse to support analysis.
These changes are reflected in the distri-
bution of different lexico-grammatical fea-
tures according to register. Findings about
register differences are relevant for both lin-
guistic applications (e.g., discourse analysis
and translation studies) and NLP tasks (no-
tably automatic text classification).
