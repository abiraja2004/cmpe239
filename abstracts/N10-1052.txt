Hierarchical phrase-based translation (Hiero,
(Chiang, 2005)) provides an attractive frame-
work within which both short- and long-
distance reorderings can be addressed consis-
tently and efciently. However, Hiero is gen-
erally implemented with a constraint prevent-
ing the creation of rules with adjacent nonter-
minals, because such rules introduce compu-
tational and modeling challenges. We intro-
duce methods to address these challenges, and
demonstrate that rules with adjacent nontermi-
nals can improve Hiero's generalization power
and lead to signicant performance gains in
Chinese-English translation.
