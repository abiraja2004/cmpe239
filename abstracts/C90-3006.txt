To get his/her text translated into one or several 
languages, the writer would accept o cooperate with the 
system in order to standardize and clarify his/her

some of them (HyperText, distributed architecture, 
guided language, hybrid transfer/interlingua, the goes on 
to study in more detail the structure of the dialogue with 
the writer and the place of speech synthesis \[1\].
