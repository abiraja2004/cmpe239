The task of creating indicative sum-
maries that help a searcher decide
whether to read a particular document
is a difficult task. This paper exam-
ines the indicative summarization task
from a generation perspective, by first
analyzing its required content via pub-
lished guidelines and corpus analysis.
We show how these summaries can be
factored into a set of document features,
and how an implemented content plan-
ner uses the topicality document fea-
ture to create indicative multidocument
query-based summaries.
