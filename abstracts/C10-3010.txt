PanLex is a lemmatic translation re-
source which combines a large number of
translation dictionaries and other translin-
gual lexical resources. It currently covers
1353 language varieties and 12M expres-
sions, but aims to cover all languages and
up to 350M expressions. This paper de-
scribes the resource and current applica-
tions of it, as well as lextract, a new
effort to expand the coverage of PanLex
via semi-automatic dictionary scraping.
