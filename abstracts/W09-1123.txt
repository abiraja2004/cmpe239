Experimenting with different mathematical
objects for text representation is an important
step of building text classification models. In
order to be efficient, such objects of a for-
mal model, like vectors, have to reasonably re-
produce language-related phenomena such as
word meaning inherent in index terms. We in-
troduce an algorithm for sense-based seman-
tic ordering of index terms which approxi-
mates Cruse?s description of a sense spectrum.
Following semantic ordering, text classifica-
tion by support vector machines can benefit
from semantic smoothing kernels that regard
semantic relations among index terms while
computing document similarity. Adding ex-
pansion terms to the vector representation can
also improve effectiveness. This paper pro-
poses a new kernel which discounts less im-
portant expansion terms based on lexical re-
latedness.
