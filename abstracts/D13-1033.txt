Morphology and syntax interact considerably
in many languages and language processing
should pay attention to these interdependen-
cies. We analyze the effect of syntactic fea-
tures when used in automatic morphology pre-
diction on four typologically different lan-
guages. We show that predicting morphology
for languages with highly ambiguous word
forms profits from taking the syntactic context
of words into account and results in state-of-
the-art models.
