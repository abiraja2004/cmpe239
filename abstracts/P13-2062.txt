In this paper we introduce Translation Dif-
ficulty Index (TDI), a measure of diffi-
culty in text translation. We first de-
fine and quantify translation difficulty in
terms of TDI. We realize that any mea-
sure of TDI based on direct input by trans-
lators is fraught with subjectivity and ad-
hocism. We, rather, rely on cognitive ev-
idences from eye tracking. TDI is mea-
sured as the sum of fixation (gaze) and
saccade (rapid eye movement) times of
the eye. We then establish that TDI is
correlated with three properties of the in-
put sentence, viz. length (L), degree of
polysemy (DP) and structural complexity
(SC). We train a Support Vector Regres-
sion (SVR) system to predict TDIs for
new sentences using these features as in-
put. The prediction done by our frame-
work is well correlated with the empiri-
cal gold standard data, which is a repos-
itory of < L,DP, SC > and TDI pairs
for a set of sentences. The primary use of
our work is a way of ?binning? sentences
(to be translated) in ?easy?, ?medium? and
?hard? categories as per their predicted
TDI. This can decide pricing of any trans-
lation task, especially useful in a scenario
where parallel corpora for Machine Trans-
lation are built through translation crowd-
sourcing/outsourcing. This can also pro-
vide a way of monitoring progress of sec-
ond language learners.
