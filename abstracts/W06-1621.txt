Semantic lexical matching is a prominent
subtask within text understanding applica-
tions. Yet, it is rarely evaluated in a di-
rect manner. This paper proposes a def-
inition for lexical reference which cap-
tures the common goals of lexical match-
ing. Based on this definition we created
and analyzed a test dataset that was uti-
lized to directly evaluate, compare and im-
prove lexical matching models. We sug-
gest that such decomposition of the global
semantic matching task is critical in order
to fully understand and improve individual
components.
