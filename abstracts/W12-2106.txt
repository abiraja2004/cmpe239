What makes a tweet worth sharing? We
study the content of tweets to uncover linguis-
tic tendencies of shared microblog posts (re-
tweets), by examining surface linguistic fea-
tures, deeper parse-based features and Twitter-
specific conventions in tweet content. We
show how these features correlate with a func-
tional classification of tweets, thereby catego-
rizing people?s writing styles based on their
different intentions on Twitter. We find that
both linguistic features and functional classi-
fication contribute to re-tweeting. Our work
shows that opinion tweets favor originality
and pithiness and that update tweets favor di-
rect statements of a tweeter?s current activity.
Judicious use of #hashtags also helps to en-
courage retweeting.
