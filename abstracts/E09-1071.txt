Many methods are available for comput-
ing semantic similarity between individ-
ual words, but certain NLP tasks require
the comparison of word pairs. This pa-
per presents a kernel-based framework for
application to relational reasoning tasks of
this kind. The model presented here com-
bines information about two distinct types
of word pair similarity: lexical similarity
and relational similarity. We present an
efficient and flexible technique for imple-
menting relational similarity and show the
effectiveness of combining lexical and re-
lational models by demonstrating state-of-
the-art results on a compound noun inter-
pretation task.
