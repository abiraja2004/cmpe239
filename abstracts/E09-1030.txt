This paper presents a conditional ran-
dom field-based approach for identifying
speaker-produced disfluencies (i.e. if and
where they occur) in spontaneous speech
transcripts. We emphasize false start re-
gions, which are often missed in cur-
rent disfluency identification approaches
as they lack lexical or structural similar-
ity to the speech immediately following.
We find that combining lexical, syntac-
tic, and language model-related features
with the output of a state-of-the-art disflu-
ency identification system improves over-
all word-level identification of these and
other errors. Improvements are reinforced
under a stricter evaluation metric requiring
exact matches between cleaned sentences
annotator-produced reconstructions, and
altogether show promise for general re-
construction efforts.
