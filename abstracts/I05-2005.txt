 
A problem associated with current P2P (peer-to-peer) 
systems is that the consistency between copied contents 
is not guaranteed. Additionally, the limitation of full-
text search capability in most of the popular P2P 
systems hinders the scalability of P2P-based content 
sharing systems. We proposed a new P2P content 
sharing system in which the consistency of contents in 
the network is maintained after updates or modifications 
have been made to the contents. Links to the 
downloaded contents are maintained on a server. As a 
result, the updates and modifications to the contents can 
be instantly detected and hence get reflected in future 
P2P downloads. Natural language processing including 
morphological analysis is performed distributedly by the 
P2P clients and the update of the inverted index on the 
server is conducted concurrently to provide an efficient 
full-text search. The scheme and a preliminary 
experimental result have been mentioned
