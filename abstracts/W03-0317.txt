 
This paper presents a framework for extract-
ing English and Chinese transliterated word 
pairs from parallel texts. The approach is 
based on the statistical machine transliteration 
model to exploit the phonetic similarities be-
tween English words and corresponding Chi-
nese transliterations. For a given proper noun 
in English, the proposed method extracts the 
corresponding transliterated word from the 
aligned text in Chinese. Under the proposed 
approach, the parameters of the model are 
automatically learned from a bilingual proper 
name list. Experimental results show that the 
average rates of word and character precision 
are 86.0% and 94.4%, respectively. The rates 
can be further improved with the addition of 
simple linguistic processing.
