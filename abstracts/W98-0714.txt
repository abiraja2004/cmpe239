 
We lay the foundation for ontological mediation as a 
method for resolving communication difficulties result- 
ing from different ontologies. The notion of hierarchical 
relations enables a theory of orientadon or direction of 
ontoiogies to be presented. We describe an ontologcial 
mediator as being able to think about (or conceptualize) 
concepts from ontologies and find equivalences between 
them. Algorithms for finding the meanings of unfamiliar 
words by asking questions are introduced and evaluated 
experimentally.
