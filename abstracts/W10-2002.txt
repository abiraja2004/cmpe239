Natural language as well as other commu-
nication forms are constrained by cogni-
tive function and evolved through a social
process. Here, we examine whether hu-
man memory may be uniquely adapted to
the social structures prevalent in groups,
specifically small-world networks. The
emergence of domain languages is simu-
lated using an empirically evaluated ACT-
R-based cognitive model of agents in a
naming game played within communi-
ties. Several community structures are ex-
amined (grids, trees, random graphs and
small-world networks). We present pre-
liminary results from small-scale simula-
tions, showing relative robustness of cog-
nitive models to network structure.
