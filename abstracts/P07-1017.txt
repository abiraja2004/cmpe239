We present a novel method for predicting in-
flected word forms for generating morpho-
logically rich languages in machine trans-
lation. We utilize a rich set of syntactic
and morphological knowledge sources from
both source and target sentences in a prob-
abilistic model, and evaluate their contribu-
tion in generating Russian and Arabic sen-
tences. Our results show that the proposed
model substantially outperforms the com-
monly used baseline of a trigram target lan-
guage model; in particular, the use of mor-
phological and syntactic features leads to
large gains in prediction accuracy. We also
show that the proposed method is effective
with a relatively small amount of data.
