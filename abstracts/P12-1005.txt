We investigate the problem of acoustic mod-
eling in which prior language-specific knowl-
edge and transcribed data are unavailable. We
present an unsupervised model that simultane-
ously segments the speech, discovers a proper
set of sub-word units (e.g., phones) and learns
a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for each in-
duced acoustic unit. Our approach is formu-
lated as a Dirichlet process mixture model in
which each mixture is an HMM that repre-
sents a sub-word unit. We apply our model
to the TIMIT corpus, and the results demon-
strate that our model discovers sub-word units
that are highly correlated with English phones
and also produces better segmentation than the
state-of-the-art unsupervised baseline. We test
the quality of the learned acoustic models on a
spoken term detection task. Compared to the
baselines, our model improves the relative pre-
cision of top hits by at least 22.1% and outper-
forms a language-mismatched acoustic model.
