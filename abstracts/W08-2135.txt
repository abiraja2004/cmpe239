This paper describes a system to solve
the joint learning of syntactic and seman-
tic dependencies. An directed graphical
model is put forward to integrate depen-
dency relation classification and semantic
role labeling. We present a bilayer di-
rected graph to express probabilistic re-
lationships between syntactic and seman-
tic relations. Maximum Entropy Markov
Models are implemented to estimate con-
ditional probability distribution and to do
inference. The submitted model yields
76.28% macro-average F1 performance,
for the joint task, 85.75% syntactic depen-
dencies LAS and 66.61% semantic depen-
dencies F1.
