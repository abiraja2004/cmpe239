The theoretical study of the range
concatenation grammar [RCG] formal-
ism has revealed many attractive prop-
erties which may be used in NLP.
In particular, range concatenation lan-
guages [RCL] can be parsed in poly-
nomial time and many classical gram-
matical formalisms can be translated
into equivalent RCGs without increas-
ing their worst-case parsing time com-
plexity. For example, after transla-
tion into an equivalent RCG, any tree
adjoining grammar can be parsed in

	
time. In this paper, we study a
parsing technique whose purpose is to
improve the practical efficiency of RCL
parsers. The non-deterministic parsing
choices of the main parser for a lan-
guage  are directed by a guide which
uses the shared derivation forest output
by a prior RCL parser for a suitable su-
perset of  . The results of a practi-
cal evaluation of this method on a wide
coverage English grammar are given.
