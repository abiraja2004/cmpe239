 
This paper describes our experience in devel- 
oping the CRITIQUE system. It describes three 
application areas in which the system is being 
used and discusses some characteristics of 
CRITIQUE which we believe are applicable to 
large-scale natural language systems in general: 
performance, robustness, flexibility, presentation, 
and accuracy.
