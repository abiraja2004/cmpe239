A common problem for clustering tech-
niques is that clusters overlap, which
makes graphing the statistical structure in
the data difficult. A related problem is
that we often want to see the distribution
of factors (variables) as well as classes
(objects). Correspondence Analysis (CA)
offers a solution to both these problems.
The structure that CA discovers may be an
important step in representing similarity.
We have performed an analysis for Italian
verbs and nouns, and confirmed that simi-
lar structures are found for English.
