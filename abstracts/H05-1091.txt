We present a novel approach to relation
extraction, based on the observation that
the information required to assert a rela-
tionship between two named entities in
the same sentence is typically captured
by the shortest path between the two en-
tities in the dependency graph. Exper-
iments on extracting top-level relations
from the ACE (Automated Content Ex-
traction) newspaper corpus show that the
new shortest path dependency kernel out-
performs a recent approach based on de-
pendency tree kernels.
