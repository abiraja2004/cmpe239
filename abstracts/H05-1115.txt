We consider the problem of question-
focused sentence retrieval from complex
news articles describing multi-event sto-
ries published over time. Annotators gen-
erated a list of questions central to under-
standing each story in our corpus. Be-
cause of the dynamic nature of the stories,
many questions are time-sensitive (e.g.
?How many victims have been found??)
Judges found sentences providing an an-
swer to each question. To address the
sentence retrieval problem, we apply a
stochastic, graph-based method for com-
paring the relative importance of the tex-
tual units, which was previously used suc-
cessfully for generic summarization. Cur-
rently, we present a topic-sensitive version
of our method and hypothesize that it can
outperform a competitive baseline, which
compares the similarity of each sentence
to the input question via IDF-weighted
word overlap. In our experiments, the
method achieves a TRDR score that is sig-
nificantly higher than that of the baseline.
