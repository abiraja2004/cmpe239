The goal of my dissertation research is
to investigate the combination of new ev-
idence sources for improving informa-
tion retrieval on speech collections. The
utility of these evidence sources is ex-
pected to vary depending on how well they
are matched to a collection?s domain. I
outline several new evidence sources for
speech retrieval, situate them in the con-
text of this domain dependency, and de-
tail several methods for their combination
with speech recognition output. Secondly,
I highlight completed and proposed work
for the production of this evidence.
