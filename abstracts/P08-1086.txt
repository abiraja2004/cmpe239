In statistical language modeling, one technique
to reduce the problematic effects of data spar-
sity is to partition the vocabulary into equiva-
lence classes. In this paper we investigate the
effects of applying such a technique to higher-
order n-gram models trained on large corpora.
We introduce a modification of the exchange
clustering algorithm with improved efficiency
for certain partially class-based models and a
distributed version of this algorithm to effi-
ciently obtain automatic word classifications
for large vocabularies (>1 million words) us-
ing such large training corpora (>30 billion to-
kens). The resulting clusterings are then used
in training partially class-based language mod-
els. We show that combining them with word-
based n-gram models in the log-linear model
of a state-of-the-art statistical machine trans-
lation system leads to improvements in trans-
lation quality as indicated by the BLEU score.
