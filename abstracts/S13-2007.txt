This paper describes the SemEval-2013 Task
5: ?Evaluating Phrasal Semantics?. Its first
subtask is about computing the semantic simi-
larity of words and compositional phrases of
minimal length. The second one addresses
deciding the compositionality of phrases in a
given context. The paper discusses the impor-
tance and background of these subtasks and
their structure. In succession, it introduces the
systems that participated and discusses evalu-
ation results.
