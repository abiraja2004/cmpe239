This paper introduces a new approach to rank-
ing speech utterances by a system?s confi-
dence that they contain a spoken word. Multi-
ple alternate pronunciations, or degradations,
of a query word?s phoneme sequence are hy-
pothesized and incorporated into the ranking
function. We consider two methods for hy-
pothesizing these degradations, the best of
which is constructed using factored phrase-
based statistical machine translation. We show
that this approach is able to significantly im-
prove upon a state-of-the-art baseline tech-
nique in an evaluation on held-out speech.
We evaluate our systems using three differ-
ent methods for indexing the speech utter-
ances (using phoneme, phoneme multigram,
and word recognition), and find that degrada-
tion modeling shows particular promise for lo-
cating out-of-vocabulary words when the un-
derlying indexing system is constructed with
standard word-based speech recognition.
