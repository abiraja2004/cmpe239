In this paper, we study the problem of
using an annotated corpus in English for
the same natural language processing task
in another language. While various ma-
chine translation systems are available, au-
tomated translation is still far from per-
fect. To minimize the noise introduced
by translations, we propose to use only
key ?reliable? parts from the translations
and apply structural correspondence learn-
ing (SCL) to find a low dimensional rep-
resentation shared by the two languages.
We perform experiments on an English-
Chinese sentiment classification task and
compare our results with a previous co-
training approach. To alleviate the prob-
lem of data sparseness, we create ex-
tra pseudo-examples for SCL by making
queries to a search engine. Experiments
on real-world on-line review data demon-
strate the two techniques can effectively
improve the performance compared to pre-
vious work.
