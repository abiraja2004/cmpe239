 
Multi-word terms are traditionally identified using 
statistical techniques or, more recently, using hybrid 
techniques combining statistics with shallow linguis- 
tic information. Al)proaches to word sense disam- 
biguation and machine translation have taken ad- 
vantage of contextual information in a more mean- 
ingflfl way, but terminology has rarely followed suit. 
We present an approach to term recognition which 
identifies salient parts of the context and measures 
their strength of association to relevant candidate 
terms. The resulting list of ranked terms is shown 
to improve on that produced by traditional method- 
s, in terms of precision and distribution, while the 
information acquired in the process can also be used 
for a variety of other applications, such as disam- 
biguation, lexical tuning and term clustering.
