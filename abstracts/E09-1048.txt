This paper addresses the problem of ex-
tracting the most important facts from a
news article. Our approach uses syntac-
tic, semantic, and general statistical fea-
tures to identify the most important sen-
tences in a document. The importance
of the individual features is estimated us-
ing generalized iterative scaling methods
trained on an annotated newswire corpus.
The performance of our approach is evalu-
ated against 300 unseen news articles and
shows that use of these features results in
statistically significant improvements over
a provenly robust baseline, as measured
using metrics such as precision, recall and
ROUGE.
