. This paper introduces a new 
technology for collocation extraction in Chinese. 
Sketch Engine (Kilgarriff et al, 2004) has 
proven to be a very effective tool for automatic 
description of lexical information, including 
collocation extraction, based on large-scale 
corpus. The original work of Sketch Engine was 
based on BNC. We extend Sketch Engine to 
Chinese based on Gigaword corpus from LDC. 
We discuss the available functions of the 
prototype Chinese Sketch Engine (CSE) as well 
as the robustness of language-independent 
adaptation of Sketch Engine. We conclude by 
discussing how Chinese-specific linguistic 
information can be incorporated to improve the 
CSE prototype.
