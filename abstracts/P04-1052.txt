We present an algorithm for generating referring
expressions in open domains. Existing algorithms
work at the semantic level and assume the avail-
ability of a classification for attributes, which is
only feasible for restricted domains. Our alterna-
tive works at the realisation level, relies on Word-
Net synonym and antonym sets, and gives equiva-
lent results on the examples cited in the literature
and improved results for examples that prior ap-
proaches cannot handle. We believe that ours is
also the first algorithm that allows for the incremen-
tal incorporation of relations. We present a novel
corpus-evaluation using referring expressions from
the Penn Wall Street Journal Treebank.
