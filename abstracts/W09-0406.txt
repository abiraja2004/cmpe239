This paper describes the CMU entry for
the system combination shared task at
WMT?09. Our combination method is hy-
pothesis selection, which uses information
from n-best lists from several MT systems.
The sentence level features are indepen-
dent from the MT systems involved. To
compensate for various n-best list sizes in
the workshop shared task including first-
best-only entries, we normalize one of our
high-impact features for varying sub-list
size. We combined restricted data track
entries in French - English, German - En-
glish and Hungarian - English using pro-
vided data only.
