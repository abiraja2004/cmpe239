Text document clustering can greatly simplify
browsing large collections of documents by re-
organizing them into a smaller number of man-
ageable clusters. Algorithms to solve this task
exist; however, the algorithms are only as good
as the data they work on. Problems include am-
biguity and synonymy, the former allowing for
erroneous groupings and the latter causing sim-
ilarities between documents to go unnoticed. In
this research, na??ve, syntax-based disambigua-
tion is attempted by assigning each word a
part-of-speech tag and by enriching the ?bag-of-
words? data representation often used for docu-
ment clustering with synonyms and hypernyms
from WordNet.
