In this paper, we describe our system for the
2009 CoNLL shared task for joint parsing of
syntactic and semantic dependency structures
of multiple languages. Our system combines
and implements efficient parsing techniques to
get a high accuracy as well as very good pars-
ing and training time. For the applications
of syntactic and semantic parsing, the pars-
ing time and memory footprint are very im-
portant. We think that also the development of
systems can profit from this since one can per-
form more experiments in the given time. For
the subtask of syntactic dependency parsing,
we could reach the second place with an ac-
curacy in average of 85.68 which is only 0.09
points behind the first ranked system. For this
task, our system has the highest accuracy for
English with 89.88, German with 87.48 and
the out-of-domain data in average with 78.79.
The semantic role labeler works not as well as
our parser and we reached therefore the fourth
place (ranked by the macro F1 score) in the
joint task for syntactic and semantic depen-
dency parsing.
