 
This paper presents a word-pair (WP) 
identifier that can be used to resolve 
homonym/segmentation ambiguities 
and perform syllable-to-word (STW) 
conversion effectively for improving 
Chinese input systems. The experi-
ment results show the following: (1) 
the WP identifier is able to achieve to-
nal (syllables with four tones) and 
toneless (syllables without four tones) 
STW accuracies of 98.5% and 90.7%, 
respectively, among the identified 
word-pairs; (2) while applying the WP 
identifier, together with the Microsoft 
input method editor 2003 and an opti-
mized bigram model, the tonal and 
toneless STW improvements of the 
two input systems are 27.5%/18.9% 
and 22.1%/18.8%, respectively.
