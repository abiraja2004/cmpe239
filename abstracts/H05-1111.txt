We develop an unsupervised semantic role
labelling system that relies on the direct
application of information in a predicate
lexicon combined with a simple probabil-
ity model. We demonstrate the usefulness
of predicate lexicons for role labelling,
as well as the feasibility of modifying an
existing role-labelled corpus for evaluat-
ing a different set of semantic roles. We
achieve a substantial improvement over an
informed baseline.
