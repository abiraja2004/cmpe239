 
This paper presents a method for automati- 
cally generating an association thesaurus 
from a text corpus, and demonstrates it ap- 
plication to information retrieval. The the- 
saurus generation method .consists of ex- 
tracting tenns and co-occurrence data from a 
corpus and analyzing the correlation between 
terms statistically. A new method for dis- 
ambiguating the structure of compound 
nouns, which is a key component for term 
extraction, is also proposed. The automati- 
cally generated thesaurus i  effectively used 
as a tool for exploring infonnation. A the- 
saurus navigator having novel functions uch 
as term clustering, thesaurus overview, and 
zooming-in is proposed.
