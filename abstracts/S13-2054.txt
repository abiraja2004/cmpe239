This paper describes the details of our system
submitted to the SemEval-2013 shared task on
sentiment analysis in Twitter. Our approach to
predicting the sentiment of Tweets and SMS
is based on supervised machine learning tech-
niques and task-specific feature engineering.
We used a linear classifier trained by stochas-
tic gradient descent with hinge loss and elas-
tic net regularization to make our predictions,
which were ranked first or second in three of
the four experimental conditions of the shared
task. Furthermore, our system makes use of
social media specific text preprocessing and
linguistically motivated features, such as word
stems, word clusters and negation handling.
