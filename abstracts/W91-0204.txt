 
I suggest that Geoffrey Nunberg's work can make two contributions to the issue 
of the relationship of lexical semantics to knowledge representation. The first is 
the claim that Lexical Semantics and Knowledge Representation are the same. The 
second (which is both more controversial and more difficult to implement) is that the 
connection between this world knowledge and lexical items must be quite flexible, if 
not, in fact, non-existent and constructed anew for each interpretive act. I outline 
several arguments for this position and present a formal method of incorporating 
this within a standard Montague-grammar framework.
