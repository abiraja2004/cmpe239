This paper presents recent extensions to
Poliqarp, an open source tool for index-
ing and searching morphosyntactically an-
notated corpora, which turn it into a tool for
indexing and searching certain kinds of tree-
banks, complementary to existing treebank
search engines. In particular, the paper dis-
cusses the motivation for such a new tool,
the extended query syntax of Poliqarp and
implementation and efficiency issues.
