This paper presents an unsupervised opin-
ion analysis method for debate-side clas-
sification, i.e., recognizing which stance a
person is taking in an online debate. In
order to handle the complexities of this
genre, we mine the web to learn associa-
tions that are indicative of opinion stances
in debates. We combine this knowledge
with discourse information, and formu-
late the debate side classification task as
an Integer Linear Programming problem.
Our results show that our method is sub-
stantially better than challenging baseline
methods.
