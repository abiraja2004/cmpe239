Over the last fifty years, the ?Big Five?
model of personality traits has become a
standard in psychology, and research has
systematically documented correlations be-
tween a wide range of linguistic variables
and the Big Five traits. A distinct line of
research has explored methods for automati-
cally generating language that varies along
personality dimensions. We present PER-
SONAGE (PERSONAlity GEnerator), the
first highly parametrizable language gener-
ator for extraversion, an important aspect
of personality. We evaluate two personal-
ity generation methods: (1) direct genera-
tion with particular parameter settings sug-
gested by the psychology literature; and (2)
overgeneration and selection using statistical
models trained from judge?s ratings. Results
show that both methods reliably generate ut-
terances that vary along the extraversion di-
mension, according to human judges.
