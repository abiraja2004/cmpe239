Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) has been
used successfully in several stages of auto-
mated Question Answering (QA) systems
but its inherent slow procedures make it
difficult to use at the indexing stage of the
document retrieval component. In this pa-
per we confirm the intuition that SRL at
indexing stage improves the performance
of QA and propose a simplified technique
named the Question Prediction Language
Model (QPLM), which provides similar in-
formation with a much lower cost. The
methods were tested on four different QA
systems and the results suggest that QPLM
can be used as a good compromise be-
tween speed and accuracy.
