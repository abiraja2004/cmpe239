This paper describes a probabilistic model
for coordination disambiguation integrated
into syntactic and case structure analy-
sis. Our model probabilistically assesses
the parallelism of a candidate coordinate
structure using syntactic/semantic similari-
ties and cooccurrence statistics. We inte-
grate these probabilities into the framework
of fully-lexicalized parsing based on large-
scale case frames. This approach simulta-
neously addresses two tasks of coordination
disambiguation: the detection of coordinate
conjunctions and the scope disambiguation
of coordinate structures. Experimental re-
sults on web sentences indicate the effective-
ness of our approach.
