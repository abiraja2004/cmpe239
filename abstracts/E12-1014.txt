We estimate the parameters of a phrase-
based statistical machine translation sys-
tem from monolingual corpora instead of a
bilingual parallel corpus. We extend exist-
ing research on bilingual lexicon induction
to estimate both lexical and phrasal trans-
lation probabilities for MT-scale phrase-
tables. We propose a novel algorithm to es-
timate reordering probabilities from mono-
lingual data. We report translation results
for an end-to-end translation system us-
ing these monolingual features alone. Our
method only requires monolingual corpora
in source and target languages, a small
bilingual dictionary, and a small bitext for
tuning feature weights. In this paper, we ex-
amine an idealization where a phrase-table
is given. We examine the degradation in
translation performance when bilingually
estimated translation probabilities are re-
moved and show that 80%+ of the loss can
be recovered with monolingually estimated
features alone. We further show that our
monolingual features add 1.5 BLEU points
when combined with standard bilingually
estimated phrase table features.
