We investigate a number of simple methods for
improving the word-alignment accuracy of IBM
Model 1. We demonstrate reduction in alignment
error rate of approximately 30% resulting from (1)
giving extra weight to the probability of alignment
to the null word, (2) smoothing probability esti-
mates for rare words, and (3) using a simple heuris-
tic estimation method to initialize, or replace, EM
training of model parameters.
