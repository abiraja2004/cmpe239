A number of results in the study of real-
time sentence comprehension have been
explained by computational models as re-
sulting from the rational use of probabilis-
tic linguistic information. Many times,
these hypotheses have been tested in read-
ing by linking predictions about relative
word difficulty to word-aggregated eye
tracking measures such as go-past time. In
this paper, we extend these results by ask-
ing to what extent reading is well-modeled
as rational behavior at a finer level of anal-
ysis, predicting not aggregate measures,
but the duration and location of each fix-
ation. We present a new rational model of
eye movement control in reading, the cen-
tral assumption of which is that eye move-
ment decisions are made to obtain noisy
visual information as the reader performs
Bayesian inference on the identities of the
words in the sentence. As a case study,
we present two simulations demonstrating
that the model gives a rational explanation
for between-word regressions.
