 
Although direct orthographic mapping has 
been shown to outperform phoneme-based 
methods in English-to-Chinese (E2C) translit-
eration, it is observed that phonological con-
text plays an important role in resolving gra-
phemic ambiguity.  In this paper, we investi-
gate the use of surface graphemic features to 
approximate local phonological context for 
E2C.  In the absence of an explicit phonemic 
representation of the English source names, 
experiments show that the previous and next 
character of a given English segment could ef-
fectively capture the local context affecting its 
expected pronunciation, and thus its rendition 
in Chinese.
