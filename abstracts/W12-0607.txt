To what extend can one use Twitter in opin-
ion polls for political elections? Merely
counting Twitter messages mentioning po-
litical party names is no guarantee for ob-
taining good election predictions. By im-
proving the quality of the document col-
lection and by performing sentiment anal-
ysis, predictions based on entity counts in
tweets can be considerably improved, and
become nearly as good as traditionally ob-
tained opinion polls.
