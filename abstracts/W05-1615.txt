 
Post-editing is commonly performed on computer-
generated texts, whether from Machine Translation 
(MT) or NLG systems, to make the texts accept-
able to end users. MT systems are often evaluated 
using post-edit data.  In this paper we describe our 
experience of using post-edit data to evaluate 
SUMTIME-MOUSAM, an NLG system that pro-
duces marine weather forecasts.
