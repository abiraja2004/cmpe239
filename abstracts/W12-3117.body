This paper describes the features and the ma-
chine learning methods used by Dublin City
University (DCU) and SYMANTEC for the
WMT 2012 quality estimation task. Two sets
of features are proposed: one constrained, i.e.
respecting the data limitation suggested by the
workshop organisers, and one unconstrained,
i.e. using data or tools trained on data that was
not provided by the workshop organisers. In
total, more than 300 features were extracted
and used to train classifiers in order to predict
the translation quality of unseen data. In this
paper, we focus on a subset of our feature set
that we consider to be relatively novel: fea-
tures based on a topic model built using the
Latent Dirichlet Allocation approach, and fea-
tures based on source and target language syn-
tax extracted using part-of-speech (POS) tag-
gers and parsers. We evaluate nine feature
combinations using four classification-based
and four regression-based machine learning
techniques.
