 
A range of research as explored the problem of 
generating referring expressions that uniquely iden- 
tify a single entity from the shared context. But 
what about expressions that identify sets of enti- 
ties? In this paper, I adapt recent semantic re- 
search on plural descriptions--using covers to ab- 
stract collective and distributive readings and us- 
ing sets of assignments o represent dependencies 
among references--to describe asearch problem for 
set-identifying expressions that largely mirrors the 
search problem for singular referring expressions. 
By structuring the search space only in terms of 
the words that can be added to the description, the 
proposal defuses potential combinatorial explosions 
that might otherwise arise with reference to sets.
