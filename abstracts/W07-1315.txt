 
Paradigms provide an inherent 
organizational structure to natural language 
morphology. ParaMor, our minimally 
supervised morphology induction 
algorithm, retrusses the word forms of raw 
text corpora back onto their paradigmatic 
skeletons; performing on par with state-of-
the-art minimally supervised morphology 
induction algorithms at morphological 
analysis of English and German. ParaMor 
consists of two phases. Our algorithm first 
constructs sets of affixes closely mimicking 
the paradigms of a language. And with 
these structures in hand, ParaMor then 
annotates word forms with morpheme 
boundaries. To set ParaMor?s few free 
parameters we analyze a training corpus of 
Spanish. Without adjusting parameters, we 
induce the morphological structure of 
English and German. Adopting the 
evaluation methodology of Morpho 
Challenge 2007 (Kurimo et al, 2007), we 
compare ParaMor?s morphological 
analyses with Morfessor (Creutz, 2006), a 
modern minimally supervised morphology 
induction system. ParaMor consistently 
achieves competitive F1 measures.
