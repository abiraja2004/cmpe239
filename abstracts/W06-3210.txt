We present a novel approach to the unsu-
pervised detection of affixes, that is, to ex-
tract a set of salient prefixes and suffixes
from an unlabeled corpus of a language.
The underlying theory makes no assump-
tions on whether the language uses a lot
of morphology or not, whether it is pre-
fixing or suffixing, or whether affixes are
long or short. It does however make the
assumption that 1. salient affixes have to
be frequent, i.e occur much more often
that random segments of the same length,
and that 2. words essentially are vari-
able length sequences of random charac-
ters, e.g a character should not occur in
far too many words than random without
a reason, such as being part of a very fre-
quent affix. The affix extraction algorithm
uses only information from fluctation of
frequencies, runs in linear time, and is free
from thresholds and untransparent itera-
tions. We demonstrate the usefulness of
the approach with example case studies on
typologically distant languages.
