We describe our experiments with hier-
archical phrase-based machine translation
for the WMT 2011 Shared Task. We
trained a system for all 8 translation di-
rections between English on one side and
Czech, German, Spanish or French on
the other side, though we focused slightly
more on the English-to-Czech direction.
We provide a detailed description of our
configuration and data so the results are
replicable.
