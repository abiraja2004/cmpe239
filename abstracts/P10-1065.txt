 
We observe that (1) how a given named en-
tity (NE) is translated (i.e., either semanti-
cally or phonetically) depends greatly on its 
associated entity type, and (2) entities within 
an aligned pair should share the same type. 
Also, (3) those initially detected NEs are an-
chors, whose information should be used to 
give certainty scores when selecting candi-
dates. From this basis, an integrated model is 
thus proposed in this paper to jointly identify 
and align bilingual named entities between 
Chinese and English. It adopts a new map-
ping type ratio feature (which is the propor-
tion of NE internal tokens that are semanti-
cally translated), enforces an entity type con-
sistency constraint, and utilizes additional 
monolingual candidate certainty factors 
(based on those NE anchors). The experi-
ments show that this novel approach has sub-
stantially raised the type-sensitive F-score of 
identified NE-pairs from 68.4% to 81.7% 
(42.1% F-score imperfection reduction) in 
our Chinese-English NE alignment task.
