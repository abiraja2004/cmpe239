We describe in detail a method for translit-
erating an English string to a foreign
language string evaluated on five differ-
ent languages, including Tamil, Hindi,
Russian, Chinese, and Kannada. Our
method involves deriving substring align-
ments from the training data and learning a
weighted finite state transducer from these
alignments. We define an ?-extension Hid-
den Markov Model to derive alignments
between training pairs and a heuristic to
extract the substring alignments. Our
method involves only two tunable parame-
ters that can be optimized on held-out data.
