Scholars of Chinese literature note that
China?s tumultuous literary history in the
20th century centered around the uncomfort-
able tensions between tradition and modernity.
In this corpus study, we develop and auto-
matically extract three features to show that
the classical character of Chinese poetry de-
creased across the century. We also find that
Taiwan poets constitute a surprising excep-
tion to the trend, demonstrating an unusually
strong connection to classical diction in their
work as late as the ?50s and ?60s.
