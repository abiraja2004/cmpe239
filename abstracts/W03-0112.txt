We describe a basic Geo-coding service en-
compassing a geo-parsing tool and integrated
digital gazetteer service. The development of
a geo-parser comes from the need to explicitly
georeference large resource collections such as
the Statistical Accounts of Scotland which cur-
rently only contain implicit georeferences in
the form of placennames thus making such col-
lections inherently geographically searchable.
