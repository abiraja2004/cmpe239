 
This paper describes a method for ?boot-
strapping? a Reinforcement Learning-
based dialog manager using a Wizard-of-
Oz trial.  The state space and action set 
are discovered through the annotation, 
and an initial policy is generated using a 
Supervised Learning algorithm.  The 
method is tested and shown to create an 
initial policy which performs significantly 
better and with less effort than a hand-
crafted policy, and can be generated using 
a small number of dialogs.
