Abstract
Consumers have to often wade
through a large number of on-line re-
views in order to make an informed
product choice. We introduce OPINE,
an unsupervised, high-precision in-
formation extraction system which
mines product reviews in order to
build a model of product features and
their evaluation by reviewers.
