 
This paper proposes a general theory of conversational 
inferences which distinguishes two kinds of inferences: 
the hard way and the easy way.  The theory accounts for 
a wider range of non-literal utterance meanings than 
Gricean and relevance theories and is motivated by the 
types of utterances in which the hearer fails to infer non-
literal meanings.
