Sets of lexical items sharing a significant
aspect of their meaning (concepts) are fun-
damental for linguistics and NLP. Unsuper-
vised concept acquisition algorithms have
been shown to produce good results, and are
preferable over manual preparation of con-
cept resources, which is labor intensive, er-
ror prone and somewhat arbitrary. Some ex-
isting concept mining methods utilize super-
vised language-specific modules such as POS
taggers and computationally intensive parsers.
In this paper we present an efficient fully
unsupervised concept acquisition algorithm
that uses syntactic information obtained from
a fully unsupervised parser. Our algorithm
incorporates the bracketings induced by the
parser into the meta-patterns used by a sym-
metric patterns and graph-based concept dis-
covery algorithm. We evaluate our algorithm
on very large corpora in English and Russian,
using both human judgments and WordNet-
based evaluation. Using similar settings as
the leading fully unsupervised previous work,
we show a significant improvement in con-
cept quality and in the extraction of multiword
expressions. Our method is the first to use
fully unsupervised parsing for unsupervised
concept discovery, and requires no language-
specific tools or pattern/word seeds.
