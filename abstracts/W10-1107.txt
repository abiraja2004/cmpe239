 
Acronyms are increasingly prevalent in bio-
medical text, and the task of acronym disam-
biguation is fundamentally important for 
biomedical natural language processing sys-
tems. Several groups have generated sense in-
ventories of acronym long form expansions 
from the biomedical literature. Long form 
sense inventories, however, may contain con-
ceptually redundant expansions that negative-
ly affect their quality. Our approach to 
improving sense inventories consists of map-
ping long form expansions to concepts in the 
Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) 
with subsequent application of a semantic si-
milarity algorithm based upon conceptual 
overlap. We evaluated this approach on a ref-
erence standard developed for ten acronyms. 
A total of 119 of 155 (78%) long forms 
mapped to concepts in the UMLS. Our ap-
proach identified synonymous long forms 
with a sensitivity of 70.2% and a positive pre-
dictive value of 96.3%. Although further re-
finements are needed, this study demonstrates 
the potential value of using automated tech-
niques to merge synonymous biomedical 
acronym long forms to improve the quality of 
biomedical acronym sense inventories.
