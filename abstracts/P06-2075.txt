 
This paper addresses the problem of acquir-
ing lexical semantic relationships, applied to 
the lexical entailment relation. Our main con-
tribution is a novel conceptual integration 
between the two distinct acquisition para-
digms for lexical relations ? the pattern-
based and the distributional similarity ap-
proaches. The integrated method exploits 
mutual complementary information of the 
two approaches to obtain candidate relations 
and informative characterizing features. 
Then, a small size training set is used to con-
struct a more accurate supervised classifier, 
showing significant increase in both recall 
and precision over the original approaches.
