 
This paper addresses two major prob-
lems in closed task of Chinese word 
segmentation (CWS): tagging sentences 
interspersed with non-Chinese words, 
and long named entity (NE) identifica-
tion. To resolve the former, we apply K-
means clustering to identify non-Chinese 
characters, and then adopt a two-tagger 
architecture: one for Chinese text and the 
other for non-Chinese text. For the latter 
problem, we apply postprocessing to our 
CWS output using automatically gener-
ated templates. The experiment results 
show that, when non-Chinese characters 
are sparse in the training corpus, our 
two-tagger method significantly im-
proves the segmentation of sentences 
containing non-Chinese words. Identifi-
cation of long NEs and long words is 
also enhanced by template-based post-
processing. In the closed task of 
SIGHAN 2006 CWS, our system 
achieved F-scores of 0.957, 0.972, and 
0.955 on the CKIP, CTU, and MSR cor-
pora respectively.
