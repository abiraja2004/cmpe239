Predicting the success of literary works is a
curious question among publishers and aspir-
ing writers alike. We examine the quantitative
connection, if any, between writing style and
successful literature. Based on novels over
several different genres, we probe the predic-
tive power of statistical stylometry in discrim-
inating successful literary works, and identify
characteristic stylistic elements that are more
prominent in successful writings. Our study
reports for the first time that statistical stylom-
etry can be surprisingly effective in discrim-
inating highly successful literature from less
successful counterpart, achieving accuracy up
to 84%. Closer analyses lead to several new
insights into characteristics of the writing style
in successful literature, including findings that
are contrary to the conventional wisdom with
respect to good writing style and readability.
