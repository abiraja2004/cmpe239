 
In this type-II demo, we introduce SIDE1 (the 
Summarization Integrated Development Envi-
ronment), an infrastructure that facilitates 
construction of summaries tailored to the 
needs of the user. It aims to address the issue 
that there is no such thing as the perfect sum-
mary for all purposes. Rather, the quality of a 
summary is subjective, task dependent, and 
possibly specific to a user. The SIDE frame-
work allows users flexibility in determining 
what they find more useful in a summary, 
both in terms of structure and content. As an 
educational tool, it has been successfully user 
tested by a class of 21 students in a graduate 
course on Summarization and Personal Infor-
mation Management.
