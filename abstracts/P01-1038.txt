We present conditions under which
verb phrases are elided based on a cor-
pus of positive and negative examples.
Factor that affect verb phrase ellipsis in-
clude: the distance between antecedent
and ellipsis site, the syntactic relation
between antecedent and ellipsis site,
and the presence or absence of adjuncts.
Building on these results, we exam-
ine where in the generation architec-
ture a trainable algorithm for VP ellip-
sis should be located. We show that
the best performance is achieved when
the trainable module is located after
the realizer and has access to surface-
oriented features (error rate of 7.5%).
