In this paper we investigate the use of surface
text patterns for a Maximum Entropy based
Question Answering (QA) system. These text
patterns are collected automatically in an un-
supervised fashion using a collection of trivia
question and answer pairs as seeds. These pat-
terns are used to generate features for a statis-
tical question answering system. We report our
results on the TREC-10 question set.
