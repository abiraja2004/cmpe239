 
The Quran is a significant religious text written in a 
unique literary style, close to very poetic language 
in nature. Accordingly it is significantly richer and 
more complex than the newswire style used in the 
previously released Arabic PropBank (Zaghouani 
et al, 2010; Diab et al, 2008). We present prelimi-
nary work on the creation of a unique Arabic prop-
osition repository for Quranic Arabic. We annotate 
the semantic roles for the 50 most frequent verbs in 
the Quranic Arabic Dependency Treebank (QATB) 
(Dukes and Buckwalter 2010). The Quranic Arabic 
PropBank (QAPB) will be a unique new resource 
of its kind for the Arabic NLP research community 
as it will allow for interesting insights into the 
semantic use of classical Arabic, poetic literary 
Arabic, as well as significant religious texts. More-
over, on a pragmatic level QAPB will add approx-
imately 810 new verbs to the existing Arabic 
PropBank (APB). In this pilot experiment, we 
leverage our knowledge and experience from our 
involvement in the APB project. All the QAPB 
annotations will be made freely available for re-
search purposes.
