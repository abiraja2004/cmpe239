It is necessary to have a (large) annotated cor-
pus to build a statistical parser. Acquisition of
such a corpus is costly and time-consuming.
This paper presents a method to reduce this
demand using active learning, which selects
what samples to annotate, instead of annotating
blindly the whole training corpus.
Sample selection for annotation is based upon
?representativeness? and ?usefulness?. A
model-based distance is proposed to measure
the difference of two sentences and their most
likely parse trees. Based on this distance, the
active learning process analyzes the sample dis-
tribution by clustering and calculates the den-
sity of each sample to quantify its representa-
tiveness. Further more, a sentence is deemed as
useful if the existing model is highly uncertain
about its parses, where uncertainty is measured
by various entropy-based scores.
Experiments are carried out in the shallow se-
mantic parser of an air travel dialog system.
Our result shows that for about the same pars-
ing accuracy, we only need to annotate a third
of the samples as compared to the usual random
selection method.
