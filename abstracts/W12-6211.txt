This paper presents an application of finite-
state transducers to the domain of medicine.
The objective is to assign disease codes to
each Diagnostic Term in the medical records
generated by the Basque Health Hospital Sys-
tem. As a starting point, a set of manually
coded medical records were collected in order
to code new medical records on the basis of
this set of positive samples. Since the texts
are written in natural language by doctors, the
same Diagnostic Term might show alternative
forms. Hence, trying to code a new medical
record by exact matching the samples in the
set is not always feasible due to sparsity of
data. In an attempt to increase the coverage
of the data, our work centered on applying a
set of finite-state transducers that helped the
matching process between the positive sam-
ples and a set of new entries. That is, these
transducers allowed not only exact matching
but also approximate matching. While there
are related works in languages such as En-
glish, this work presents the first results on au-
tomatic assignment of disease codes to medi-
cal records written in Spanish.
