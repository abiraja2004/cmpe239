We develop a framework for formaliz-
ing semantic construction within gram-
mars expressed in typed feature struc-
ture logics, including HPSG. The ap-
proach provides an alternative to the
lambda calculus; it maintains much of
the desirable flexibility of unification-
based approaches to composition, while
constraining the allowable operations in
order to capture basic generalizations
and improve maintainability.
