 
One problem in the design of a lexicon for natural language processing is the repre- 
sentation of semantic knowledge. We examine the adequacy of knowledge representa- 
tion formalisms developed in artificial intelligence, in particular of term subsumption 
languages for these issues. In order to derive some basic requirements for a suitable 
representation language we analyze a number of definitions of a monolingual dictio- 
nary.
