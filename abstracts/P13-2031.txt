This paper presents a semi-supervised
Chinese word segmentation (CWS) ap-
proach that co-regularizes character-based
and word-based models. Similarly to
multi-view learning, the ?segmentation
agreements? between the two differen-
t types of view are used to overcome the
scarcity of the label information on unla-
beled data. The proposed approach train-
s a character-based and word-based mod-
el on labeled data, respectively, as the ini-
tial models. Then, the two models are con-
stantly updated using unlabeled examples,
where the learning objective is maximiz-
ing their segmentation agreements. The a-
greements are regarded as a set of valuable
constraints for regularizing the learning of
both models on unlabeled data. The seg-
mentation for an input sentence is decod-
ed by using a joint scoring function com-
bining the two induced models. The e-
valuation on the Chinese tree bank reveals
that our model results in better gains over
the state-of-the-art semi-supervised mod-
els reported in the literature.
