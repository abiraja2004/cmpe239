This paper describes the Aalto submission
for the German-to-English and the Czech-
to-English translation tasks of the ACL
2010 Joint Fifth Workshop on Statistical
Machine Translation and MetricsMATR.
Statistical machine translation has focused
on using words, and longer phrases con-
structed from words, as tokens in the sys-
tem. In contrast, we apply different mor-
phological decompositions of words using
the unsupervised Morfessor algorithms.
While translation models trained using the
morphological decompositions did not im-
prove the BLEU scores, we show that the
Minimum Bayes Risk combination with
a word-based translation model produces
significant improvements for the German-
to-English translation. However, we did
not see improvements for the Czech-to-
English translations.
