Previous works on question classification are
based on complex natural language process-
ing techniques: named entity extractors,
parsers, chunkers, etc. While these ap-
proaches have proven to be effective they
have the disadvantage of being targeted to a
particular language. We present here a sim-
ple approach that exploits lexical features
and the Internet to train a classifier, namely
a Support Vector Machine. The main fea-
ture of this method is that it can be applied
to different languages without requiring ma-
jor modifications. Experimental results of
this method on English, Italian and Span-
ish show that this approach can be a prac-
tical tool for question answering systems,
reaching a classification accuracy as high as
88.92%.
