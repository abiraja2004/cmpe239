 
In this paper we examine some issues pertaining to the task 
of selection in text planning. We attempt o distinguish 
salience and relevance, and characterize their role as 
important fundamental notions governing selection. We also 
formulate the problem of selection of text content in terms of 
the coupling between domain-level tasks and text planning 
tasks. We describe our research on generating bus route 
descriptions.
