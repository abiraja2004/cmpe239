Amazon's  Mechanical  Turk service  has  been 
successfully applied to many natural language 
processing tasks. However, the task of named 
entity recognition presents unique challenges. 
In  a  large  annotation  task  involving  over 
20,000 emails, we demonstrate that a compet?
itive bonus system and inter?annotator agree?
ment  can  be  used  to  improve the  quality  of 
named  entity  annotations  from  Mechanical 
Turk.  We also build several statistical named 
entity  recognition  models  trained  with  these 
annotations, which compare favorably to sim?
ilar models trained on expert annotations.
