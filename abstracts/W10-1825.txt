This paper describes the creation of a re-
source of German sentences with multi-
ple automatically created alternative syn-
tactic analyses (parses) for the same text,
and how qualitative and quantitative inves-
tigations of this resource can be performed
using ANNIS, a tool for corpus querying
and visualization. Using the example of
PP attachment, we show how parsing can
benefit from the use of such a resource.
