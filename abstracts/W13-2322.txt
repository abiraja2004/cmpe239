Abstract
We describe Abstract Meaning Represen-
tation (AMR), a semantic representation
language in which we are writing down
the meanings of thousands of English sen-
tences. We hope that a sembank of simple,
whole-sentence semantic structures will
spur new work in statistical natural lan-
guage understanding and generation, like
the Penn Treebank encouraged work on
statistical parsing. This paper gives an
overview of AMR and tools associated
with it.
