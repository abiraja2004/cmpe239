While the corpus-based research relies on hu-
man annotated corpora, it is often said that a
non-negligible amount of errors remain even in
frequently used corpora such as Penn Treebank.
Detection of errors in annotated corpora is im-
portant for corpus-based natural language pro-
cessing. In this paper, we propose a method
to detect errors in corpora using support vec-
tor machines (SVMs). This method is based
on the idea of extracting exceptional elements
that violate consistency. We propose a method
of using SVMs to assign a weight to each ele-
ment and to find errors in a POS tagged corpus.
We apply the method to English and Japanese
POS-tagged corpora and achieve high precision
in detecting errors.
