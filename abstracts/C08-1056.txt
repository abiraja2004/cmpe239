Electronic written texts used in computer-
mediated interactions (e-mails, blogs,
chats, etc) present major deviations from
the norm of the language. This paper
presents an comparative study of systems
aiming at normalizing the orthography of
French SMS messages: after discussing
the linguistic peculiarities of these mes-
sages, and possible approaches to their au-
tomatic normalization, we present, evalu-
ate and contrast two systems, one draw-
ing inspiration from the Machine Transla-
tion task; the other using techniques that
are commonly used in automatic speech
recognition devices. Combining both ap-
proaches, our best normalization system
achieves about 11% Word Error Rate on a
test set of about 3000 unseen messages.
