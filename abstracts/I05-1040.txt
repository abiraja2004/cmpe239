. Machine transliteration is an automatic method to generate characters 
or words in one alphabetical system for the corresponding characters in another 
alphabetical system. There has been increasing concern on machine translitera-
tion as an assistant of machine translation and information retrieval. Three ma-
chine transliteration models, including ?grapheme-based model?, ?phoneme-
based model?, and ?hybrid model?, have been proposed. However, there are 
few works trying to make use of correspondence between source grapheme and 
phoneme, although the correspondence plays an important role in machine 
transliteration. Furthermore there are few works, which dynamically handle 
source grapheme and phoneme. In this paper, we propose a new transliteration 
model based on an ensemble of grapheme and phoneme. Our model makes use 
of the correspondence and dynamically uses source grapheme and phoneme. 
Our method shows better performance than the previous works about 15~23% 
in English-to-Korean transliteration and about 15~43% in English-to-Japanese 
transliteration.
