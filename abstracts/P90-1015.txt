 
This paper presents an implemented, psychologically plau- 
sible parsing model for Government Binding theory gram- 
mars. I make use of two main ideas: (1) a generaliza- 
tion of the licensing relations of \[Abney, 1986\] allows for 
the direct encoding of certain principles of grammar (e.g. 
Theta Criterion, Case Filter) which drive structure build- 
ing; (2) the working space of the parser is constrained 
to the domain determined by a Tree Adjoining Grammar 
elementary tree. All dependencies and constraints are lo- 
caiized within this bounded structure. The resultant parser 
operates in linear time and allows for incremental semantic 
interpretation a d determination f grammaticaiity.
