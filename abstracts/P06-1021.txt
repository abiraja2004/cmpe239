A grammatical method of combining two
kinds of speech repair cues is presented.
One cue, prosodic disjuncture, is detected
by a decision tree-based ensemble clas-
sifier that uses acoustic cues to identify
where normal prosody seems to be inter-
rupted (Lickley, 1996). The other cue,
syntactic parallelism, codifies the expec-
tation that repairs continue a syntactic
category that was left unfinished in the
reparandum (Levelt, 1983). The two cues
are combined in a Treebank PCFG whose
states are split using a few simple tree
transformations. Parsing performance on
the Switchboard and Fisher corpora sug-
gests that these two cues help to locate
speech repairs in a synergistic way.
