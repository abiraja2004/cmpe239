Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) ap-
proaches have reported good accuracies in
recent years. However, these approaches can
be classified as weak AI systems. According
to the classical definition, a strong AI based
WSD system should perform the task of sense
disambiguation in the same manner and with
similar accuracy as human beings. In order
to accomplish this, a detailed understanding
of the human techniques employed for sense
disambiguation is necessary. Instead of
building yet another WSD system that uses
contextual evidence for sense disambiguation,
as has been done before, we have taken a step
back - we have endeavored to discover the
cognitive faculties that lie at the very core of
the human sense disambiguation technique.
In this paper, we present a hypothesis regard-
ing the cognitive sub-processes involved in the
task ofWSD.We support our hypothesis using
the experiments conducted through the means
of an eye-tracking device. We also strive to
find the levels of difficulties in annotating vari-
ous classes of words, with senses. We believe,
once such an in-depth analysis is performed,
numerous insights can be gained to develop a
robust WSD system that conforms to the prin-
ciple of strong AI.
