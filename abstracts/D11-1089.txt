Word boundaries within noun compounds are
not marked by white spaces in a number of
languages, unlike in English, and it is benefi-
cial for various NLP applications to split such
noun compounds. In the case of Japanese,
noun compounds made up of katakana words
(i.e., transliterated foreign words) are par-
ticularly difficult to split, because katakana
words are highly productive and are often out-
of-vocabulary. To overcome this difficulty,
we propose using monolingual and bilingual
paraphrases of katakana noun compounds for
identifying word boundaries. Experiments
demonstrated that splitting accuracy is sub-
stantially improved by extracting such para-
phrases from unlabeled textual data, the Web
in our case, and then using that information for
constructing splitting models.
