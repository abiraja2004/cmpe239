This paper presents a method of acquiring
knowledge from the Web for noun sense
disambiguation. Words, called selectors,
are acquired which take the place of an
instance of a target word in its local con-
text. The selectors serve for the system to
essentially learn the areas or concepts of
WordNet that the sense of a target word
should be a part of. The correct sense
is chosen based on a combination of the
strength given from similarity and related-
ness measures over WordNet and the prob-
ability of a selector occurring within the lo-
cal context. Our method is evaluated using
the coarse-grained all-words task from Se-
mEval 2007. Experiments reveal that path-
based similarity measures perform just as
well as information content similarity mea-
sures within our system. Overall, the re-
sults show our system is out-performed
only by systems utilizing training data or
substantially more annotated data.
