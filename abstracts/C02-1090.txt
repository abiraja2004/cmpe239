  
The paper examines different possibilities 
to take advantage of the taxonomic or-
ganization of a thesaurus to improve the 
accuracy of classifying new words into its 
classes. The results of the study demon-
strate that taxonomic similarity between 
nearest neighbors, in addition to their dis-
tributional similarity to the new word, 
may be useful evidence on which classifi-
cation decision can be based.
