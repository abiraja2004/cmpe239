In this paper, we present the methods
we used to extract bacteria and biotopes
names and then to identify the relation
between those entities while participating
to the BioNLP?13 Bacteria and Biotopes
Shared Task. We used machine-learning
based approaches for this task, namely
a CRF to extract bacteria and biotopes
names and a simple matching algorithm to
predict the relations. We achieved poor re-
sults: an SER of 0.66 in sub-task 1, and a
0.06 F-measure in both sub-tasks 2 and 3.
