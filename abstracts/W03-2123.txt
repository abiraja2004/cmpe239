The DIPPER architecture is a collection
of software agents for prototyping spoken
dialogue systems. Implemented on top
of the Open Agent Architecture (OAA),
it comprises agents for speech input and
output, dialogue management, and fur-
ther supporting agents. We define a for-
mal syntax and semantics for the DIP-
PER information state update language.
The language is independent of particular
programming languages, and incorporates
procedural attachments for access to ex-
ternal resources using OAA.
