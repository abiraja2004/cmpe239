We introduce dependency relations into deci-
phering foreign languages and show that de-
pendency relations help improve the state-of-
the-art deciphering accuracy by over 500%.
We learn a translation lexicon from large
amounts of genuinely non parallel data with
decipherment to improve a phrase-based ma-
chine translation system trained with limited
parallel data. In experiments, we observe
BLEU gains of 1.2 to 1.8 across three different
test sets.
