We present a new word-alignment ap-
proach that learns errors made by ex-
isting word alignment systems and cor-
rects them. By adapting transformation-
based learning to the problem of word
alignment, we project new alignment links
from already existing links, using features
such as POS tags. We show that our align-
ment link projection approach yields a sig-
nificantly lower alignment error rate than
that of the best performing alignment sys-
tem (22.6% relative reduction on English-
Spanish data and 23.2% relative reduction
on English-Chinese data).
