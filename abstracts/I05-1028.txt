. We propose a novel type of document classification task that
quantifies how much a given document (review) appreciates the target
object using not binary polarity (good or bad) but a continuous mea-
sure called sentiment polarity score (sp-score). An sp-score gives a very
concise summary of a review and provides more information than binary
classification. The difficulty of this task lies in the quantification of po-
larity. In this paper we use support vector regression (SVR) to tackle
the problem. Experiments on book reviews with five-point scales show
that SVR outperforms a multi-class classification method using support
vector machines and the results are close to human performance.
