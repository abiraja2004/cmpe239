 
Two problematic issues in most lexi- 
con systems today are their size and re- 
stricted domain of use. In this paper, we 
introduce a new approach to lexical or- 
ganization that leads to more compact 
and flexible lexicons. The lexical en- 
tries are conceptual/phonological fr mes 
rather than word entries, and a num- 
ber of expansion rules are used to gen- 
erate entries of actual words from these 
frames. A single frame supports not only 
all forms of a word, but also words of dif- 
ferent categories that are derived from 
the same semantic basis. The whole 
theory is now being implemented in the 
TROLL lexicon project.
