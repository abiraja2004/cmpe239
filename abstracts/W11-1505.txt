 
The paper describes a tool developed to 
process historical (Slovene) text, which an-
notates words in a TEI encoded corpus 
with their modern-day equivalents, mor-
phosyntactic tags and lemmas. Such a tool 
is useful for developing historical corpora 
of highly-inflecting languages, enabling 
full text search in digital libraries of histor-
ical texts, for modernising such texts for 
today's readers and making it simpler to 
correct OCR transcriptions.
