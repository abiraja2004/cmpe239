Abstract
We propose a novel end-to-end frame-
work for abstractive meeting summariza-
tion. We cluster sentences in the in-
put into communities and build an entail-
ment graph over the sentence communi-
ties to identify and select the most relevant
sentences. We then aggregate those se-
lected sentences by means of a word graph
model. We exploit a ranking strategy to
select the best path in the word graph as
an abstract sentence. Despite not relying
on the syntactic structure, our approach
significantly outperforms previous models
for meeting summarization in terms of in-
formativeness. Moreover, the longer sen-
tences generated by our method are com-
petitive with shorter sentences generated
by the previous word graph model in terms
of grammaticality.
