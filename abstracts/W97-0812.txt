 
We describe a method for acquiring semantic 
cooccurrence r strictions for tuples of syntacti- 
cally related words (e.g. verb-object pairs) from 
text corpora utomatically. This method uses the 
notion of semantic similarity to assign a sense 
from a dictionary database (e.g. WordNet) to 
ambiguous words occurring in a syntactic de- 
pendency. Semantic similarity is also used to 
merge disambiguated word tuples into classes of 
cooccurrence r strictions. This encoding makes 
it possible to reduce subsequent disambiguation 
events to simple table lookups.
