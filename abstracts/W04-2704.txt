 
The PropBank project is creating a corpus of 
text annotated with information about basic 
semantic propositions. PropBank I (Kingsbury 
& Palmer, 2002) added a layer of predicate-
argument information, or semantic roles, to 
the syntactic structures of the English Penn 
Treebank.   This paper presents an overview 
of the second phase of PropBank Annotation, 
PropBank II, which is being applied to Eng-
lish and Chinese, and includes (Neodavid-
sonian) eventuality variables, nominal 
references, sense tagging, and connections to 
the Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB), a pro-
ject for annotating discourse connectives and 
their arguments.
