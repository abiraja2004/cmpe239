In this paper, we address the problem of
estimating question difficulty in community
question answering services. We propose a
competition-based model for estimating ques-
tion difficulty by leveraging pairwise compar-
isons between questions and users. Our ex-
perimental results show that our model sig-
nificantly outperforms a PageRank-based ap-
proach. Most importantly, our analysis shows
that the text of question descriptions reflects
the question difficulty. This implies the pos-
sibility of predicting question difficulty from
the text of question descriptions.
