In this paper, we introduce a WordNet-
based measure of semantic relatedness
by combining the structure and content
of WordNet with co?occurrence informa-
tion derived from raw text. We use the
co?occurrence information along with the
WordNet definitions to build gloss vectors
corresponding to each concept in Word-
Net. Numeric scores of relatedness are as-
signed to a pair of concepts by measuring
the cosine of the angle between their re-
spective gloss vectors. We show that this
measure compares favorably to other mea-
sures with respect to human judgments
of semantic relatedness, and that it per-
forms well when used in a word sense dis-
ambiguation algorithm that relies on se-
mantic relatedness. This measure is flex-
ible in that it can make comparisons be-
tween any two concepts without regard to
their part of speech. In addition, it can
be adapted to different domains, since any
plain text corpus can be used to derive the
co?occurrence information.
