This work presents a study to bridge topic
modeling and personalized search. A
probabilistic topic model is used to extract
topics from user search history. These
topics can be seen as a roughly summary
of user preferences and further treated as
feedback within the KL-Divergence re-
trieval model to estimate a more accurate
query model. The topics more relevant
to current query contribute more in updat-
ing the query model which helps to dis-
tinguish between relevant and irrelevant
parts and filter out noise in user search
history. We designed task oriented user
study and the results show that: (1) The
extracted topics can be used to cluster
queries according to topics. (2) The pro-
posed approach improves ranking qual-
ity consistently for queries matching user
past interests and is robust for queries not
matching past interests.
