This paper proposes a machine learning ap-
proach to the task of assigning the inter-
national standard on classification of dis-
eases ICD-9-CM codes to clinical records.
By treating the task as a text categorisa-
tion problem, a classification system was
built which explores a variety of features in-
cluding negation, different strategies of mea-
suring gloss overlaps between the content
of clinical records and ICD-9-CM code de-
scriptions together with expansion of the
glosses from the ICD-9-CM hierarchy. The
best classifier achieved an overall F1 value
of 88.2 on a data set of 978 free text clinical
records, and was better than the performance
of two out of three human annotators.
