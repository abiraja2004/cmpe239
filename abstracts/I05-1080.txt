. This paper describes a novel method for a word sense disam-
biguation that utilizes relatives (i.e. synonyms, hypernyms, meronyms,
etc in WordNet) of a target word and raw corpora. The method disam-
biguates senses of a target word by selecting a relative that most prob-
ably occurs in a new sentence including the target word. Only one co-
occurrence frequency matrix is utilized to efficiently disambiguate senses
of many target words. Experiments on several English datum present
that our proposed method achieves a good performance.
