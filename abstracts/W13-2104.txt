We show that Nakatsu & White?s (2010)
proposed enhancements to the SPaRKy
Restaurant Corpus (SRC; Walker et al,
2007) for better expressing contrast do in-
deed make it possible to generate better
texts, including ones that make effective
and varied use of contrastive connectives
and discourse adverbials. After first pre-
senting a validation experiment for natu-
ralness ratings of SRC texts gathered using
Amazon?s Mechanical Turk, we present
an initial experiment suggesting that such
ratings can be used to train a realization
ranker that enables higher-rated texts to be
selected when the ranker is trained on a
sample of generated restaurant recommen-
dations with the contrast enhancements
than without them. We conclude with a
discussion of possible ways of improving
the ranker in future work.
