We present CoocViewer, a graphical analy-
sis tool for the purpose of quantitative lit-
erary analysis, and demonstrate its use on
a corpus of crime novels. The tool dis-
plays words, their significant co-occurrences,
and contains a new visualization for signif-
icant concordances. Contexts of words and
co-occurrences can be displayed. After re-
viewing previous research and current chal-
lenges in the newly emerging field of quan-
titative literary research, we demonstrate how
CoocViewer allows comparative research on
literary corpora in a project-specific study, and
how we can confirm or enhance our hypothe-
ses through quantitative literary analysis.
