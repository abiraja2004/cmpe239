 
This paper describes a useful set of NLP tools 
which has been successfully applied to many 
different kinds of industrial requirements 
spanning multiple domains and applications at 
Boeing. The tools can be combined to 
constitute a full-spectrum natural language 
system and can be customized for new 
domains relatively easily. To date, this array 
of formal and natural language processing 
technologies has been used to perform mass 
changes to legacy textual databases and to 
facilitate user interfacing to relational 
databases and software applications.
