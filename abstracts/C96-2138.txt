 
We have developed a technique that catego- 
rizes document images based on their con- 
tent. Unlike conventional methods that use 
optical character recognition (OCR), we con- 
vert document images into word shape 
tokens, a shape-based representation of 
words. Because we have only to recognize 
simple graphical features from image, this 
process is much faster than OCR. Although 
the mapping between word shape tokens and 
words is one-to-many, they are a rich source 
of information for content characterization. 
Using a vector space classifier with a 
scanned ocument image database, we show 
that the word shape token-based approach is 
quite adequate for content-oriented categori- 
zation in terms of accuracy compared with 
conventional OCR-based approaches.
