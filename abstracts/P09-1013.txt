Empirical studies on corpora involve mak-
ing measurements of several quantities for
the purpose of comparing corpora, creat-
ing language models or to make general-
izations about specific linguistic phenom-
ena in a language. Quantities such as av-
erage word length are stable across sam-
ple sizes and hence can be reliably esti-
mated from large enough samples. How-
ever, quantities such as vocabulary size
change with sample size. Thus measure-
ments based on a given sample will need
to be extrapolated to obtain their estimates
over larger unseen samples. In this work,
we propose a novel nonparametric estima-
tor of vocabulary size. Our main result is
to show the statistical consistency of the
estimator ? the first of its kind in the lit-
erature. Finally, we compare our proposal
with the state of the art estimators (both
parametric and nonparametric) on large
standard corpora; apart from showing the
favorable performance of our estimator,
we also see that the classical Good-Turing
estimator consistently underestimates the
vocabulary size.
