 
A crucial problem in topic recognition is how 
to identify topic continuation. Domain knowl- 
edge is generally indispensable for this. How~ 
ever, knowledge-based approaches are imprac- 
tical because not all domain knowledge needed 
for the identification can be prepared in advance. 
This paper presents a topic recognition model 
using dialogue interaction structures. The model 
can deal with both task-oriented and non-task- 
oriented ialogues in any language. Topic con- 
tinuation is identified without domain knowl- 
edge because utterances of relevant opics are 
indicated by certain interaction structures. The 
model avoids the weak point of knowledge- 
based approaches. The model is validated by 
the result of a topic recognition experiment.
