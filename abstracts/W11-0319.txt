In this paper we present methods for automat-
ically acquiring training examples for the task
of entity extraction. Experimental evidence
show that: (1) our methods compete with a
current heavily supervised state-of-the-art sys-
tem, within 0.04 absolute mean average pre-
cision; and (2) our model significantly out-
performs other supervised and unsupervised
baselines by between 0.15 and 0.30 in abso-
lute mean average precision.
