This paper discusses local alignment ker-
nels in the context of the relation extrac-
tion task. We define a local alignment
kernel based on the Smith-Waterman mea-
sure as a sequence similarity metric and
proceed with a range of possibilities for
computing a similarity between elements
of sequences. We propose to use distri-
butional similarity measures on elements
and by doing so we are able to incorporate
extra information from the unlabeled data
into a learning task. Our experiments sug-
gest that a LA kernel provides promising
results on some biomedical corpora largely
outperforming a baseline.
