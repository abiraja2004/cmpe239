The paper addresses the challenge of con-
verting MIDT, an existing dependency?
based Italian treebank resulting from the
harmonization and merging of smaller re-
sources, into the Stanford Dependencies
annotation formalism, with the final aim
of constructing a standard?compliant re-
source for the Italian language. Achieved
results include a methodology for con-
verting treebank annotations belonging
to the same dependency?based family,
the Italian Stanford Dependency Treebank
(ISDT), and an Italian localization of the
Stanford Dependency scheme.
