 
We present the diverse research activities on 
Philippine languages from all over the country, 
with focus on the Center for Language Tech-
nologies of the College of Computer Studies, 
De La Salle University, Manila, where major-
ity of the work are conducted.  These projects 
include the formal representation of Philippine 
languages and the processes involving these 
languages.  Language representation entails 
the manual and automatic development of lan-
guage resources such as lexicons and corpora 
for various human languages including Philip-
pine languages, across various forms such as 
text, speech and video files.  Tools and appli-
cations on languages that we have worked on 
include morphological processes, part of 
speech tagging, language grammars, machine 
translation, sign language processing and 
speech systems.  Future directions are also 
presented.
