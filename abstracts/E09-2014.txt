The growing popularity of multimedia
documents requires language technologies
to approach automatic language analysis
and generation from yet another perspec-
tive: that of its use in multimodal commu-
nication. In this paper, we present a sup-
port tool for COSMOROE, a theoretical
framework for modelling multimedia di-
alectics. The tool is a text-based search in-
terface that facilitates the exploration of a
corpus of audiovisual files, annotated with
the COSMOROE relations.
