In this paper we present a study on the
interpretation of weekday names in texts.
Our algorithm for assigning a date to a
weekday name achieves 95.91% accuracy
on a test data set based on the ACE
2005 Training Corpus, outperforming pre-
viously reported techniques run against
this same data. We also provide the first
detailed comparison of various approaches
to the problem using this test data set, em-
ploying re-implementations of key tech-
niques from the literature and a range of
additional heuristic-based approaches.
