Previous work demonstrated that web counts
can be used to approximate bigram frequen-
cies, and thus should be useful for a wide va-
riety of NLP tasks. So far, only two gener-
ation tasks (candidate selection for machine
translation and confusion-set disambiguation)
have been tested using web-scale data sets. The
present paper investigates if these results gener-
alize to tasks covering both syntax and seman-
tics, both generation and analysis, and a larger
range of n-grams. For the majority of tasks, we
find that simple, unsupervised models perform
better when n-gram frequencies are obtained
from the web rather than from a large corpus.
However, in most cases, web-based models fail
to outperform more sophisticated state-of-the-
art models trained on small corpora. We ar-
gue that web-based models should therefore be
used as a baseline for, rather than an alternative
to, standard models.
