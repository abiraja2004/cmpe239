 
It has been known that a combination of 
multiple kernels and addition of various 
resources are the best options for im-
proving effectiveness of kernel-based 
PPI extraction methods. These supple-
ments, however, involve extensive ker-
nel adaptation and feature selection 
processes, which attenuate the original 
benefits of the kernel methods. This pa-
per shows that we are able to achieve 
the best performance among the state-
of-the-art methods by using only a sin-
gle kernel, convolution parse tree kernel. 
In-depth analyses of the kernel reveal 
that the keys to the improvement are the 
tree pruning method and consideration 
of tree kernel decay factors. It is note-
worthy that we obtained the perfor-
mance without having to use any addi-
tional features, kernels or corpora.
