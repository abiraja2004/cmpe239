A fundamental task in sentence compre-
hension is to assign semantic roles to sen-
tence constituents. The structure-mapping
account proposes that children start with
a shallow structural analysis of sentences:
children treat the number of nouns in the
sentence as a cue to its semantic predicate-
argument structure, and represent language
experience in an abstract format that per-
mits rapid generalization to new verbs. In
this paper, we tested the consequences of
these representational assumptions via ex-
periments with a system for automatic se-
mantic role labeling (SRL), trained on a
sample of child-directed speech. When
the SRL was presented with representa-
tions of sentence structure consisting sim-
ply of an ordered set of nouns, it mim-
icked experimental findings with toddlers,
including a striking error found in children.
Adding features representing the position
of the verb increased accuracy and elim-
inated the error. We show the SRL sys-
tem can use incremental knowledge gain
to switch from error-prone noun order fea-
tures to a more accurate representation,
demonstrating a possible mechanism for
this process in child development.
