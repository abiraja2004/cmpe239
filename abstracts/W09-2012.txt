We demonstrate that subjective creativity in
sentence-writing can in part be predicted us-
ing computable quantities studied in Com-
puter Science and Cognitive Psychology. We
introduce a task in which a writer is asked to
compose a sentence given a keyword. The
sentence is then assigned a subjective creativ-
ity score by human judges. We build a linear
regression model which, given the keyword
and the sentence, predicts the creativity score.
The model employs features on statistical lan-
guage models from a large corpus, psycholog-
ical word norms, and WordNet.
