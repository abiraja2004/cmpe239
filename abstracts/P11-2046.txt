State-of-the-art bootstrapping systems rely on
expert-crafted semantic constraints such as
negative categories to reduce semantic drift.
Unfortunately, their use introduces a substan-
tial amount of supervised knowledge. We
present the Relation Guided Bootstrapping
(RGB) algorithm, which simultaneously ex-
tracts lexicons and open relationships to guide
lexicon growth and reduce semantic drift.
This removes the necessity for manually craft-
ing category and relationship constraints, and
manually generating negative categories.
