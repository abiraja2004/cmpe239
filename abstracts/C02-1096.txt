In word prediction systems for augmentative and al-
ternative communication (AAC), productive word-
formation processes such as compounding pose a
serious problem. We present a model that predicts
German nominal compounds by splitting them into
their modifier and head components, instead of try-
ing to predict them as a whole. The model is im-
proved further by the use of class-based modifier-
head bigrams constructed using semantic classes
automatically extracted from a corpus. The eval-
uation shows that the split compound model with
class bigrams leads to an improvement in keystroke
savings of more than 15% over a no split compound
baseline model. We also present preliminary results
obtained with a word prediction model integrating
compound and simple word prediction.
