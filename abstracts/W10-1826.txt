 
The paper presents an architecture for connecting 
annotated linguistic data with a computational gram-
mar system. Pivotal to the architecture is an annota-
tional interlingua ? called the Construction Labeling 
system (CL) - which is notationally very simple, de-
scriptively finegrained, cross-typologically applica-
ble, and formally well-defined enough to map to a 
state-of-the-art computational model of grammar. In 
the present instantiation of the architecture, the com-
putational grammar is an HPSG-based system called 
TypeGram.  Underlying the architecture is a research 
program of enhancing the interconnectivity between 
linguistic analytic subsystems such as grammar for-
malisms and text annotation systems.
