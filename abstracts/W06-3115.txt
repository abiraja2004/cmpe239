We present two translation systems ex-
perimented for the shared-task of ?Work-
shop on Statistical Machine Translation,?
a phrase-based model and a hierarchical
phrase-based model. The former uses a
phrasal unit for translation, whereas the
latter is conceptualized as a synchronous-
CFG in which phrases are hierarchically
combined using non-terminals. Experi-
ments showed that the hierarchical phrase-
based model performed very comparable
to the phrase-based model. We also report
a phrase/rule extraction technique differ-
entiating tokenization of corpora.
