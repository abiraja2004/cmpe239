The objective of this work is to
disambiguate transducers which have
the following form: T = R ?D and to
be able to apply the determinization
algorithm described in (Mohri, 1997).
Our approach to disambiguating
T = R ?D consists first of computing
the composition T and thereafter to
disambiguate the transducer T . We
will give an important consequence of
this result that allows us to compose
any number of transducers R with
the transducer D, in contrast to the
previous approach which consisted in
first disambiguating transducers D
and R to produce respectively D? and
R? , then computing T ? = R? ?D? where
T ? is unambiguous. We will present
results in the case of a transducer
D representing a dictionary and R
representing phonological rules.
Keywords: ambiguity, determinis-
tic, dictionary, transducer.
