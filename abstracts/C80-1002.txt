 
An automatic processor of written French 
language is described. This processor 
uses syntactic and semantic informations 
about words in order to construct a se- 
mantic net representing the meaning of 
the sentences. The structure of the net- 
work and the principles of the parser 
are explained. An application to the pro- 
cessing of the medical records is then 
discussed.
