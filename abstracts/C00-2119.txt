 
We describe a method of word segmentation i
Japanese in which a broad-coverage parser selects 
the best word sequence while producing a syntactic 
analysis. This technique is substantially different 
from traditional statistics- or heuristics-based 
models which attempt o select the best word 
sequence before handing it to the syntactic 
component. By breaking up the task of finding the 
best word sequence into the identification of words 
(in the word-breaking component) and the selection 
of the best sequence (a by-product of parsing), we 
have been able to simplify the task of each 
component and achieve high accuracy over a wide 
varicty of data. Word-breaking accuracy of our 
system is currently around 97-98%.
