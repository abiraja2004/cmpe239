 
Named entity recognition (NER) is nowa-
days an important task, which is responsi-
ble for the identification of proper names in 
text and their classification as different 
types of named entity such as people, loca-
tions, and organizations. In this paper, we 
present our attempt at the recognition and 
extraction of the most important proper 
name entity, that is, the person name, for 
the Arabic language. We developed the 
system, Person Name Entity Recognition 
for Arabic (PERA), using a rule-based ap-
proach. The system consists of a lexicon, in 
the form of gazetteer name lists, and a 
grammar, in the form of regular expres-
sions, which are responsible for recogniz-
ing person name entities. The PERA sys-
tem is evaluated using a corpus that is 
tagged in a semi-automated way. The sys-
tem performance results achieved were sat-
isfactory and confirm to the targets set 
forth for the precision, recall, and f-
measure.
