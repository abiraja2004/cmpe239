Strictly Piecewise (SP) languages are a
subclass of regular languages which en-
code certain kinds of long-distance de-
pendencies that are found in natural lan-
guages. Like the classes in the Chom-
sky and Subregular hierarchies, there are
many independently converging character-
izations of the SP class (Rogers et al, to
appear). Here we define SP distributions
and show that they can be efficiently esti-
mated from positive data.
