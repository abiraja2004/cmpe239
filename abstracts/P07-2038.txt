The ability to detect similarity in conjunct
heads is potentially a useful tool in help-
ing to disambiguate coordination structures
- a difficult task for parsers. We propose a
distributional measure of similarity designed
for such a task. We then compare several dif-
ferent measures of word similarity by testing
whether they can empirically detect similar-
ity in the head nouns of noun phrase con-
juncts in the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) tree-
bank. We demonstrate that several measures
of word similarity can successfully detect
conjunct head similarity and suggest that the
measure proposed in this paper is the most
appropriate for this task.
