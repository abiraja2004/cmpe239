  
Ambiguity is very high for location names. For 
example, there are 23 cities named ?Buffalo? in the 
U.S.  Based on our previous work, this paper presents 
a refined hybrid approach to geographic references 
using our information extraction engine InfoXtract. 
The InfoXtract location normalization module 
consists of local pattern matching and discourse 
co-occurrence analysis as well as default senses.  
Multiple knowledge sources are used in a number of 
ways: (i) pattern matching driven by local context, 
(ii) maximum spanning tree search for discourse 
analysis, and (iii) applying default sense heuristics 
and extracting default senses from the web. The 
results are benchmarked with 96% accuracy on our 
test collections that consist of both news articles and 
tourist guides. The performance contribution for each 
component of the module is also benchmarked and 
discussed.
