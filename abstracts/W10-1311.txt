Modern automatic speech recognition is inef-
fective at understanding relatively unintelligi-
ble speech caused by neuro-motor disabilities
collectively called dysarthria. Since dysarthria
is primarily an articulatory phenomenon, we
are collecting a database of vocal tract mea-
surements during speech of individuals with
cerebral palsy. In this paper, we demonstrate
that articulatory knowledge can remove am-
biguities in the acoustics of dysarthric speak-
ers by reducing entropy relatively by 18.3%,
on average. Furthermore, we demonstrate
that dysarthric speech is more precisely por-
trayed as a noisy-channel distortion of an
abstract representation of articulatory goals,
rather than as a distortion of non-dysarthric
speech. We discuss what implications these
results have for our ongoing development of
speech systems for dysarthric speakers.
