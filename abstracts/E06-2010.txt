This demo abstract describes the SmartWeb
Ontology-based Annotation system (SOBA).
A key feature of SOBA is that all informa-
tion is extracted and stored with respect to
the SmartWeb Integrated Ontology
(SWIntO). In this way, other components of
the systems, which use the same ontology,
can access this information in a straightfor-
ward way. We will show how information
extracted by SOBA is visualized within its
original context, thus enhancing the browsing
experience of the end user.
