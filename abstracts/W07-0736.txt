The paper proposes formulating MT evalu-
ation as a ranking problem, as is often done
in the practice of assessment by human. Un-
der the ranking scenario, the study also in-
vestigates the relative utility of several fea-
tures. The results show greater correlation
with human assessment at the sentence level,
even when using an n-gram match score as
a baseline feature. The feature contributing
the most to the rank order correlation be-
tween automatic ranking and human assess-
ment was the dependency structure relation
rather than BLEU score and reference lan-
guage model feature.
