Statistical language modeling remains a challeng-
ing task, in particular for morphologically rich lan-
guages. Recently, new approaches based on factored
language models have been developed to address
this problem. These models provide principled ways
of including additional conditioning variables other
than the preceding words, such as morphological or
syntactic features. However, the number of possible
choices for model parameters creates a large space of
models that cannot be searched exhaustively. This
paper presents an entirely data-driven model selec-
tion procedure based on genetic search, which is
shown to outperform both knowledge-based and ran-
dom selection procedures on two different language
modeling tasks (Arabic and Turkish).
