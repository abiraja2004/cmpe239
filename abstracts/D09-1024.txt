We present a method to align words in
a bitext that combines elements of a tra-
ditional statistical approach with linguis-
tic knowledge. We demonstrate this ap-
proach for Arabic-English, using an align-
ment lexicon produced by a statistical
word aligner, as well as linguistic re-
sources ranging from an English parser
to heuristic alignment rules for function
words. These linguistic heuristics have
been generalized from a development cor-
pus of 100 parallel sentences. Our aligner,
UALIGN, outperforms both the commonly
used GIZA++ aligner and the state-of-the-
art LEAF aligner on F-measure and pro-
duces superior scores in end-to-end sta-
tistical machine translation, +1.3 BLEU
points over GIZA++, and +0.7 over LEAF.
