This paper introduces a machine learning
method based on bayesian networks which
is applied to the mapping between deep se-
mantic representations and lexical semantic
resources. A probabilistic model comprising
Minimal Recursion Semantics (MRS) struc-
tures and lexicalist oriented semantic features
is acquired. Lexical semantic roles enrich-
ing the MRS structures are inferred, which are
useful to improve the accuracy of deep seman-
tic parsing. Verb classes inference was also
investigated, which, together with lexical se-
mantic information provided by VerbNet and
PropBank resources, can be substantially ben-
eficial to the parse disambiguation task.
