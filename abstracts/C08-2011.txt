We propose a supervised word sense
disambiguation (WSD) method using
tree-structured conditional random fields
(TCRFs). By applying TCRFs to a
sentence described as a dependency tree
structure, we conduct WSD as a labeling
problem on tree structures. To incorpo-
rate dependencies between word senses,
we introduce a set of features on tree
edges, in combination with coarse-grained
tagsets, and show that these contribute
to an improvement in WSD accuracy.
We also show that the tree-structured
model outperforms the linear-chain model.
Experiments on the SENSEVAL-3 data
set show that our TCRF model performs
comparably with state-of-the-art WSD
systems.
