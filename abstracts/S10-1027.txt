We describe the University of Heidelberg
(UHD) system for the Cross-Lingual Word
Sense Disambiguation SemEval-2010 task
(CL-WSD). The system performs CL-
WSD by applying graph algorithms pre-
viously developed for monolingual Word
Sense Disambiguation to multilingual co-
occurrence graphs. UHD has participated
in the BEST and out-of-five (OOF) eval-
uations and ranked among the most com-
petitive systems for this task, thus indicat-
ing that graph-based approaches represent
a powerful alternative for this task.
