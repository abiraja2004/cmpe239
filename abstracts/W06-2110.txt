This paper presents a method for identify-
ing token instances of verb particle con-
structions (VPCs) automatically, based on
the output of the RASP parser. The pro-
posed method pools together instances of
VPCs and verb-PPs from the parser out-
put and uses the sentential context of each
such instance to differentiate VPCs from
verb-PPs. We show our technique to per-
form at an F-score of 97.4% at identifying
VPCs in Wall Street Journal and Brown
Corpus data taken from the Penn Tree-
bank.
