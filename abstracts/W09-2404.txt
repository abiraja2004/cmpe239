We revisit the one sense per discourse hypoth-
esis of Gale et al in the context of machine
translation. Since a given sense can be lex-
icalized differently in translation, do we ob-
serve one translation per discourse? Analy-
sis of manual translations reveals that the hy-
pothesis still holds when using translations in
parallel text as sense annotation, thus con-
firming that translational differences repre-
sent useful sense distinctions. Analysis of
Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) out-
put showed that despite ignoring document
structure, the one translation per discourse hy-
pothesis is strongly supported in part because
of the low variability in SMT lexical choice.
More interestingly, cases where the hypoth-
esis does not hold can reveal lexical choice
errors. A preliminary study showed that en-
forcing the one translation per discourse con-
straint in SMT can potentially improve trans-
lation quality, and that SMT systems might
benefit from translating sentences within their
entire document context.
