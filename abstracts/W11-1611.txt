This work surveys existing evaluation
methodologies for the task of sentence
compression, identifies their shortcomings,
and proposes alternatives. In particular,
we examine the problems of evaluating
paraphrastic compression and comparing the
output of different models. We demonstrate
that compression rate is a strong predictor
of compression quality and that perceived
improvement over other models is often a side
effect of producing longer output.
