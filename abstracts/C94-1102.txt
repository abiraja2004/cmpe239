 
We show the application of an optimisation technique to 
natural language processing: genetic algorithms, thanks 
to the definition of a data structure called board and 
a formal distance. The system hms two interesting 
features: non-directionality, whict~ Ls more than hi- 
directionality, and self-assessment, independently of the 
inner knowledge. Results of experiments are presented 
and discussed.
