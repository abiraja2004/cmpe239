The paper describes the overall design of a 
new two stage constraint based hybrid ap-
proach to dependency parsing. We define 
the  two  stages  and  show  how  different 
grammatical construct are parsed at appro-
priate stages. This division leads to selec-
tive identification and resolution of specif-
ic dependency relations at the two stages. 
Furthermore,  we  show  how  the  use  of 
hard constraints and soft constraints helps 
us  build  an  efficient  and  robust  hybrid 
parser.  Finally,  we  evaluate  the  imple-
mented parser on Hindi and compare the 
results with that of two data driven depen-
dency parsers.
