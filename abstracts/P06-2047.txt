Various kinds of scored dependency
graphs are proposed as packed shared data
structures in combination with optimum
dependency tree search algorithms. This
paper classifies the scored dependency
graphs and discusses the specific features
of the ?Dependency Forest? (DF) which is
the packed shared data structure adopted
in the ?Preference Dependency Grammar?
(PDG), and proposes the ?Graph Branch
Algorithm? for computing the optimum
dependency tree from a DF. This paper
also reports the experiment showing the
computational amount and behavior of the
graph branch algorithm.
