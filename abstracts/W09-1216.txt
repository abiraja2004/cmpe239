I describe a fast multilingual parser for seman-
tic dependencies. The parser is implemented
as a pipeline of linear classifiers trained with
support vector machines. I use only first or-
der features, and no pair-wise feature combi-
nations in order to reduce training and pre-
diction times. Hyper-parameters are carefully
tuned for each language and sub-problem.
The system is evaluated on seven different
languages: Catalan, Chinese, Czech, English,
German, Japanese and Spanish. An analysis
of learning rates and of the reliance on syn-
tactic parsing quality shows that only modest
improvements could be expected for most lan-
guages given more training data; Better syn-
tactic parsing quality, on the other hand, could
greatly improve the results. Individual tun-
ing of hyper-parameters is crucial for obtain-
ing good semantic parsing quality.
