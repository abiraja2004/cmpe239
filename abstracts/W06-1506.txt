In relative clauses, the wh relative pro-
noun can be embedded in a larger phrase,
as in a boy [whose brother] Mary hit.
In such examples, we say that the larger
phrase has pied-piped along with the wh-
word. In this paper, using a similar syntac-
tic analysis for wh pied-piping as in Han
(2002) and further developed in Kallmeyer
and Scheffler (2004), I propose a composi-
tional semantics for relative clauses based
on Synchronous Tree Adjoining Gram-
mar. It will be shown that (i) the elemen-
tary tree representing the logical form of
a wh-word provides a generalized quanti-
fier, and (ii) the semantic composition of
the pied-piped material and the wh-word is
achieved through adjoining in the seman-
tics of the former onto the latter.
