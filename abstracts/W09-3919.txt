For a spoken dialog system to make good
use of a speech recognition N-Best list, it is
essential to know how much trust to place
in each entry. This paper presents a method
for assigning a probability of correctness to
each of the items on the N-Best list, and to
the hypothesis that the correct answer is not
on the list. We find that both multinomial lo-
gistic regression and support vector machine
models yields meaningful, useful probabili-
ties across different tasks and operating con-
ditions.
