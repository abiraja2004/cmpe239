 
In this paper we discuss a study of the expression of 
procedural relations in multilingual user instructions~ in 
particular the relations of Gene,ution and Enablement. 
These procedural relations are defined in terms of a plan 
representation model, and applied in a corpus study of 
English, French, and Portuguese instructions. The re- 
sults of our analysis indicate specific guidelines for the 
tactical realisation of expressions of these relations in 
multilingual instructional text.
