This paper evaluates the LinGO Grammar Ma-
trix, a cross-linguistic resource for the de-
velopment of precision broad coverage gram-
mars, by applying it to the Australian language
Wambaya. Despite large typological differ-
ences between Wambaya and the languages
on which the development of the resource was
based, the Grammar Matrix is found to pro-
vide a significant jump-start in the creation of
the grammar for Wambaya: With less than 5.5
person-weeks of development, the Wambaya
grammar was able to assign correct seman-
tic representations to 76% of the sentences in
a naturally occurring text. While the work
on Wambaya identified some areas of refine-
ment for the Grammar Matrix, 59% of the
Matrix-provided types were invoked in the fi-
nal Wambaya grammar, and only 4% of the
Matrix-provided types required modification.
