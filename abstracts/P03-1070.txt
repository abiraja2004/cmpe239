 
We investigate the verbal and nonverbal 
means for grounding, and propose a design 
for embodied conversational agents that re-
lies on both kinds of signals to establish 
common ground in human-computer inter-
action. We analyzed eye gaze, head nods 
and attentional focus in the context of a di-
rection-giving task. The distribution of 
nonverbal behaviors differed depending on 
the type of dialogue move being grounded, 
and the overall pattern reflected a monitor-
ing of lack of negative feedback. Based on 
these results, we present an ECA that uses 
verbal and nonverbal grounding acts to up-
date dialogue state.
