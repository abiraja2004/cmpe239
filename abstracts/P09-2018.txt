Distributional word similarity is most
commonly perceived as a symmetric re-
lation. Yet, one of its major applications
is lexical expansion, which is generally
asymmetric. This paper investigates the
nature of directional (asymmetric) similar-
ity measures, which aim to quantify distri-
butional feature inclusion. We identify de-
sired properties of such measures, specify
a particular one based on averaged preci-
sion, and demonstrate the empirical bene-
fit of directional measures for expansion.
