We present a toolkit for manipulating and
visualising time-aligned linguistic data
such as dialogue transcripts or language
processing data. The package comple-
ments existing editing tools by allowing
for conversion between their formats, in-
formation extraction from the raw files,
and by adding sophisticated, and easily ex-
tended methods for visualising the dynam-
ics of dialogue processing. To illustrate
the versatility of the package, we describe
its use in three different projects at our site.
