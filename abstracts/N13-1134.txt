In this paper, we present a novel method for the
computation of compositionality within a distri-
butional framework. The key idea is that com-
positionality is modeled as a multi-way interac-
tion between latent factors, which are automat-
ically constructed from corpus data. We use
our method to model the composition of sub-
ject verb object triples. The method consists
of two steps. First, we compute a latent factor
model for nouns from standard co-occurrence
data. Next, the latent factors are used to induce
a latent model of three-way subject verb object
interactions. Our model has been evaluated on
a similarity task for transitive phrases, in which
it exceeds the state of the art.
