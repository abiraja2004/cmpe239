Large lexical resources, such as corpora
and databases of Web ngrams, are a rich
source of pre-fabricated phrases that can be
reused in many different contexts. How-
ever, one must be careful in how these re-
sources are used, and noted writers such as
George Orwell have argued that the use of
canned phrases encourages sloppy thinking
and results in poor communication. None-
theless, while Orwell prized home-made
phrases over the readymade variety, there
is a vibrant movement in modern art which
shifts artistic creation from the production
of novel artifacts to the clever reuse of
readymades or objets trouv?s. We describe
here a system that makes creative reuse of
the linguistic readymades in the Google
ngrams. Our system, the Jigsaw Bard, thus
owes more to Marcel Duchamp than to
George Orwell. We demonstrate how tex-
tual readymades can be identified and har-
vested on a large scale, and used to drive a
modest form of linguistic creativity.
