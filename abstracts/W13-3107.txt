The paper describes our participation in
the Multi-document summarization task of
Multiling-2013. The community initiative
was born as a pilot task for the Text Analy-
sis Conference in 2011. This year the cor-
pus was extended by new three languages
and another five topics, covering in total
15 topics in 10 languages. Our summariser
is based on latent semantic analysis and it
is in principle language independent. Its
results on the Multiling-2011 corpus were
promising. The generated summaries were
ranked first in several languages based on
various metrics. The summariser with mi-
nor changes was run on the updated 2013
corpus. Although we do not have the man-
ual evaluation results yet the ROUGE-2
score indicates good results again. The
summariser produced best summaries in 6
from 10 considered languages according
to the ROUGE-2 metric.
