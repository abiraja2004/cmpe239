 
We present the results of an experiment 
on extending the automatic method of 
Machine Translation evaluation BLUE 
with statistical weights for lexical items, 
such as tf.idf scores. We show that this 
extension gives additional information 
about evaluated texts; in particular it al-
lows us to measure translation Adequacy, 
which, for statistical MT systems, is often 
overestimated by the baseline BLEU 
method. The proposed model uses a sin-
gle human reference translation, which 
increases the usability of the proposed 
method for practical purposes. The model 
suggests a linguistic interpretation which 
relates frequency weights and human in-
tuition about translation Adequacy and 
Fluency.
