This paper presents the first step in de-
signing a speech-enabled robot that is ca-
pable of natural management of mis-
communication. It describes the methods
and results of two WOz studies, in which 
dyads of na?ve participants interacted in a 
collaborative task. The first WOz study 
explored human miscommunication 
management. The second study investi-
gated how shared visual space and moni-
toring shape the processes of feedback 
and communication in task-oriented inte-
ractions. The results provide insights for
the development of human-inspired and
robust natural language interfaces in ro-
bots.
