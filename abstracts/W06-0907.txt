Current research in developmental biology
aims to link developmental genetic path-
ways with the processes going on at cel-
lular and tissue level. Normal processes
will only take place under specific sequen-
tial conditions at the level of the pathways.
Disrupting or altering pathways may mean
disrupted or altered development.
This paper is part of a larger work explor-
ing methods of detecting and extracting in-
formation on developmental events from
free text and on their relations in space and
time.
