At present, the population of non-native
speakers is twice that of native speak-
ers. It is necessary to explore the
text generation strategies for non-native
users. However, little has been done
in this field. This study investigates
the features that affect the placement
(where to place a cue) of because for
non-native speakers. A machine learn-
ing program ? C4.5 was applied to in-
duce the classification models of the
placement.
