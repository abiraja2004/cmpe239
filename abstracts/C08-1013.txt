We present ParaMetric, an automatic eval-
uation metric for data-driven approaches to
paraphrasing. ParaMetric provides an ob-
jective measure of quality using a collec-
tion of multiple translations whose para-
phrases have been manually annotated.
ParaMetric calculates precision and recall
scores by comparing the paraphrases dis-
covered by automatic paraphrasing tech-
niques against gold standard alignments of
words and phrases within equivalent sen-
tences. We report scores for several estab-
lished paraphrasing techniques.
