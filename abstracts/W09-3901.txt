Recent work on information presenta-
tion in dialogue systems combines user
modelling (UM) and stepwise refine-
ment through clustering and summarisa-
tion (SR) in the UMSR approach. An eval-
uation in which participants rated dialogue
transcripts showed that UMSR presents
complex trade-offs understandably, pro-
vides users with a good overview of their
options, and increases users? confidence
that all relevant options have been pre-
sented (Demberg and Moore, 2006). In
this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness
of the UMSR approach in a more realis-
tic setting, by incorporating this informa-
tion presentation technique into a full end-
to-end dialogue system in the city infor-
mation domain, and comparing it with the
traditional approach of presenting infor-
mation sequentially. Our results suggest
that despite complications associated with
a real dialogue system setting, the UMSR
model retains its advantages.
