Distance-based (windowless) word asso-
cation measures have only very recently
appeared in the NLP literature and their
performance compared to existing win-
dowed or frequency-based measures is
largely unknown. We conduct a large-
scale empirical comparison of a variety of
distance-based and frequency-based mea-
sures for the reproduction of syntagmatic
human assocation norms. Overall, our
results show an improvement in the pre-
dictive power of windowless over win-
dowed measures. This provides support
to some of the previously published the-
oretical advantages and makes window-
less approaches a promising avenue to
explore further. This study also serves
as a first comparison of windowed meth-
ods across numerous human association
datasets. During this comparison we
also introduce some novel variations of
window-based measures which perform as
well as or better in the human association
norm task than established measures.
