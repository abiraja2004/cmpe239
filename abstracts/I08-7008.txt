 
This paper presents a cross platform multi-
lingual multimedia Indian Sign Language 
(ISL) dictionary building tool. ISL is a lin-
guistically under-investigated language 
with no source of well documented elec-
tronic data. Research on ISL linguistics 
also gets hindered due to a lack of ISL 
knowledge and the unavailability of any 
educational tools. Our system can be used 
to associate signs corresponding to a given 
text. The current system also facilitates the 
phonological annotation of Indian signs in 
the form of HamNoSys structure. The gen-
erated HamNoSys string can be given as 
input to an avatar module to produce an 
animated sign representation.
