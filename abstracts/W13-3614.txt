We describe the ?TILB? team entry for
the CONLL-2013 Shared Task. Our sys-
tem consists of five memory-based classi-
fiers that generate correction suggestions
for center positions in small text windows
of two words to the left and to the right.
Trained on the Google Web 1T corpus, the
first two classifiers determine the presence
of a determiner or a preposition between
all words in a text. The second pair of clas-
sifiers determine which is the most likely
correction of an occurring determiner or
preposition. The fifth classifier is a general
word predictor which is used to suggest
noun and verb form corrections. We re-
port on the scores attained and errors cor-
rected and missed. We point out a num-
ber of obvious improvements to boost the
scores obtained by the system.
