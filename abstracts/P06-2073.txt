Dialogue systems are one of the most chal-
lenging applications of Natural Language
Processing. In recent years, some statis-
tical dialogue models have been proposed
to cope with the dialogue problem. The
evaluation of these models is usually per-
formed by using them as annotation mod-
els. Many of the works on annotation
use information such as the complete se-
quence of dialogue turns or the correct
segmentation of the dialogue. This in-
formation is not usually available for dia-
logue systems. In this work, we propose a
statistical model that uses only the infor-
mation that is usually available and per-
forms the segmentation and annotation at
the same time. The results of this model
reveal the great influence that the availabil-
ity of a correct segmentation has in ob-
taining an accurate annotation of the dia-
logues.
