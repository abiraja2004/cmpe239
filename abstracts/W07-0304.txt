 
The goal of this paper is to give a description 
of the state of the art, the issues, the problems, 
and the solutions related to industrial dialog 
systems for the automation of technical sup-
port. After a general description of the evolu-
tion of the spoken dialog industry, and the 
challenges in the development of technical 
support applications, we will discuss two spe-
cific problems through a series of experimental 
results.    The first problem is the identification 
of the call reason, or symptom, from loosely 
constrained user utterances. The second is the 
use of data for the experimental optimization 
of the Voice User Interface (VUI).
