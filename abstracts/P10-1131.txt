We present an approach to multilin-
gual grammar induction that exploits a
phylogeny-structured model of parameter
drift. Our method does not require any
translated texts or token-level alignments.
Instead, the phylogenetic prior couples
languages at a parameter level. Joint in-
duction in the multilingual model substan-
tially outperforms independent learning,
with larger gains both from more articu-
lated phylogenies and as well as from in-
creasing numbers of languages. Across
eight languages, the multilingual approach
gives error reductions over the standard
monolingual DMV averaging 21.1% and
reaching as high as 39%.
