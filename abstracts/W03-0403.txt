We describe new features and algorithms for
HPSG parse selection models and address the
task of creating annotated material to train
them. We evaluate the ability of several sam-
ple selection methods to reduce the number
of annotated sentences necessary to achieve a
given level of performance. Our best method
achieves a 60% reduction in the amount of
training material without any loss in accuracy.
