 
This paper reports the present results of a 
research on unsupervised Persian mor-
pheme discovery. In this paper we pre-
sent a method for discovering the mor-
phemes of Persian language through 
automatic analysis of corpora. We util-
ized a Minimum Description Length 
(MDL) based algorithm with some im-
provements and applied it to Persian cor-
pus. Our improvements include enhanc-
ing the cost function using some heuris-
tics, preventing the split of high fre-
quency chunks, exploiting penalty for 
first and last letters and distinguishing 
pre-parts and post-parts. Our improved 
approach has raised the precision, recall 
and f-measure of discovery by respec-
tively %32, %17 and %23.
