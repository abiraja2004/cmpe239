 
This paper reports the progress of the French 
text-to-speech system being developed at AT&T 
Bell Laboratories as part of a larger project for 
multil ingual text-to-speech systems, including lan- 
guages such as Spanish, Italian, German, Rus- 
sian, and Chinese. These systems, based on di- 
phone and triphone concatenation, follow the gen- 
eral framework of the Bell Laboratories English 
TTS system \[?\], \[?\]. This paper provides a de- 
scription of the approach, the current status of the 
French text-to-speech project, and some problems 
particular to French.
