Current speech scoring systems assess speech by pri-marily using acoustic features such as fluency and pronunciation; however content features are barely involved. Motivated by this limita-tion, the study aims to investigate the use of content features in speech scoring systems. For content features, a central question is how speech content can be represented in appro-priate means to facilitate automated speech scoring. The study proposes using ontology-based representation to perform concept level representation on speech transcripts, and fur-thermore the content features computed from ontology-based representation may facilitate speech scoring. One baseline and two ontolo-gy-based representations are compared in ex-periments. Preliminary results show that ontology-based representation slightly im-proves performance of one content feature for automated scoring over the baseline system.
