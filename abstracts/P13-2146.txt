In this paper, we address the problem for
predicting cQA answer quality as a clas-
sification task. We propose a multimodal
deep belief nets based approach that op-
erates in two stages: First, the joint rep-
resentation is learned by taking both tex-
tual and non-textual features into a deep
learning network. Then, the joint repre-
sentation learned by the network is used
as input features for a linear classifier. Ex-
tensive experimental results conducted on
two cQA datasets demonstrate the effec-
tiveness of our proposed approach.
