This paper presents a multi-modal feature-
based system for extracting salient keywords
from transcripts of instructional videos. Specif-
ically, we propose to extract domain-specific
keywords for videos by integrating various
cues from linguistic and statistical knowledge,
as well as derived sound classes and charac-
teristic visual content types. The acquisition
of such salient keywords will facilitate video
indexing and browsing, and significantly im-
prove the quality of current video search en-
gines. Experiments on four government in-
structional videos show that 82% of the salient
keywords appear in the top 50% of the highly
ranked keywords. In addition, the audiovisual
cues improve precision and recall by 1.1% and
1.5% respectively.
