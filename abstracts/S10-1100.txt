 
This paper presents the HIT_CITYU systems 
in Semeval-2 Task 18, namely, disambiguat-
ing sentiment ambiguous adjectives. The base-
line system (HITSZ_CITYU_3) incorporates 
bi-gram and n-gram collocations of sentiment 
adjectives, and other context words as features 
in a one-class Support Vector Machine (SVM) 
classifier. To enhance the baseline system, col-
location set expansion and characteristics 
learning based on word similarity and semi-
supervised learning are investigated, respec-
tively. The final system (HITSZ_CITYU_1/2) 
combines collocations, context words and 
neighboring sentence sentiment in a two-class 
SVM classifier to determine the polarity of 
sentiment adjectives. The final systems 
achieved 0.957 and 0.953 (ranked 1st and 2nd) 
macro accuracy, and 0.936 and 0.933 (ranked 
2nd and 3rd) micro accuracy, respectively.
