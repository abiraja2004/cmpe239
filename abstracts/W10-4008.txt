 
In this paper, we describe a voting 
mechanism for accurate named entity 
(NE) translation in English?Chinese 
question answering (QA). This mecha-
nism involves translations from three 
different sources: machine translation, 
online encyclopaedia, and web docu-
ments. The translation with the highest 
number of votes is selected. We evalu-
ated this approach using test collection, 
topics and assessment results from the 
NTCIR-8 evaluation forum. This 
mechanism achieved 95% accuracy in 
NEs translation and 0.3756 MAP in 
English?Chinese cross-lingual infor-
mation retrieval of QA.
