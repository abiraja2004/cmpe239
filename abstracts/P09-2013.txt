We describe an algorithm for Japanese
analysis that does both base phrase chunk-
ing and dependency parsing simultane-
ously in linear-time with a single scan of a
sentence. In this paper, we show a pseudo
code of the algorithm and evaluate its per-
formance empirically on the Kyoto Uni-
versity Corpus. Experimental results show
that the proposed algorithm with the voted
perceptron yields reasonably good accu-
racy.
