While belief tracking is known to be im-
portant in allowing statistical dialog sys-
tems to manage dialogs in a highly robust
manner, until recently little attention has
been given to analysing the behaviour of
belief tracking techniques. The Dialogue
State Tracking Challenge has allowed for
such an analysis, comparing multiple be-
lief tracking approaches on a shared task.
Recent success in using deep learning for
speech research motivates the Deep Neu-
ral Network approach presented here. The
model parameters can be learnt by directly
maximising the likelihood of the training
data. The paper explores some aspects of
the training, and the resulting tracker is
found to perform competitively, particu-
larly on a corpus of dialogs from a system
not found in the training.
