This paper presents the particular use of
?Jibiki? (Papillon?s web server develop-
ment platform) for the LexALP1 project.
LexALP?s goal is to harmonise the ter-
minology on spatial planning and sustain-
able development used within the Alpine
Convention2, so that the member states
are able to cooperate and communicate
efficiently in the four official languages
(French, German, Italian and Slovene). To
this purpose, LexALP uses the Jibiki plat-
form to build a term bank for the con-
trastive analysis of the specialised termi-
nology used in six different national legal
systems and four different languages. In
this paper we present how a generic plat-
form like Jibiki can cope with a new kind
of dictionary.
