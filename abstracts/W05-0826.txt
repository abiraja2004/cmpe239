We describe the Spanish-to-English LDV-
COMBO system for the Shared Task 2:
?Exploiting Parallel Texts for Statistical
Machine Translation? of the ACL-2005
Workshop on ?Building and Using Par-
allel Texts: Data-Driven Machine Trans-
lation and Beyond?. Our approach ex-
plores the possibility of working with
alignments at different levels of abstrac-
tion, using different degrees of linguistic
annotation. Several phrase-based trans-
lation models are built out from these
alignments. Their combination significa-
tively outperforms any of them in isola-
tion. Moreover, we have built a word-
based translation model based on Word-
Net which is used for unknown words.
