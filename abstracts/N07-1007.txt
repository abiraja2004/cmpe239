 
We study the use of rich syntax-based 
statistical models for generating gram-
matical case for the purpose of machine 
translation from a language which does 
not indicate case explicitly (English) to a 
language with a rich system of surface 
case markers (Japanese). We propose an 
extension of n-best re-ranking as a 
method of integrating such models into a 
statistical MT system and show that this 
method substantially outperforms stan-
dard n-best re-ranking. Our best perform-
ing model achieves a statistically signifi-
cant improvement over the baseline MT 
system according to the BLEU metric. 
Human evaluation also confirms the re-
sults.
