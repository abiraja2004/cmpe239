We describe the design of a comparable cor-
pus that spans all of the world?s languages and
facilitates large-scale cross-linguistic process-
ing. This Universal Corpus consists of text
collections aligned at the document and sen-
tence level, multilingual wordlists, and a small
set of morphological, lexical, and syntactic an-
notations. The design encompasses submis-
sion, storage, and access. Submission pre-
serves the integrity of the work, allows asyn-
chronous updates, and facilitates scholarly ci-
tation. Storage employs a cloud-hosted file-
store containing normalized source data to-
gether with a database of texts and annota-
tions. Access is permitted to the filestore, the
database, and an application programming in-
terface. All aspects of the Universal Corpus
are open, and we invite community participa-
tion in its design and implementation, and in
supplying and using its data.
