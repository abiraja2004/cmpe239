Continuous space word representations ex-
tracted from neural network language mod-
els have been used effectively for natural lan-
guage processing, but until recently it was not
clear whether the spatial relationships of such
representations were interpretable. Mikolov
et al (2013) show that these representations
do capture syntactic and semantic regularities.
Here, we push the interpretation of continuous
space word representations further by demon-
strating that vector offsets can be used to de-
rive adjectival scales (e.g., okay < good < ex-
cellent). We evaluate the scales on the indirect
answers to yes/no questions corpus (de Marn-
effe et al, 2010). We obtain 72.8% accuracy,
which outperforms previous results (?60%)
on this corpus and highlights the quality of the
scales extracted, providing further support that
the continuous space word representations are
meaningful.
