Resource scarcity along with diversity?
both in dialect and script?are the two pri-
mary challenges in Kurdish language pro-
cessing. In this paper we aim at addressing
these two problems by (i) building a text
corpus for Sorani and Kurmanji, the two
main dialects of Kurdish, and (ii) high-
lighting some of the orthographic, phono-
logical, and morphological differences be-
tween these two dialects from statistical
and rule-based perspectives.
