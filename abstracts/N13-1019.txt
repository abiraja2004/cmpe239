We present a new hierarchical Bayesian model
for unsupervised topic segmentation. This new
model integrates a point-wise boundary sam-
pling algorithm used in Bayesian segmenta-
tion into a structured topic model that can cap-
ture a simple hierarchical topic structure latent
in documents. We develop an MCMC infer-
ence algorithm to split/merge segment(s). Ex-
perimental results show that our model out-
performs previous unsupervised segmentation
methods using only lexical information on
Choi?s datasets and two meeting transcripts
and has performance comparable to those pre-
vious methods on two written datasets.
