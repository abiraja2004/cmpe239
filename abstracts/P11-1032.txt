Consumers increasingly rate, review and re-
search products online (Jansen, 2010; Litvin
et al, 2008). Consequently, websites con-
taining consumer reviews are becoming tar-
gets of opinion spam. While recent work
has focused primarily on manually identifi-
able instances of opinion spam, in this work
we study deceptive opinion spam?fictitious
opinions that have been deliberately written to
sound authentic. Integrating work from psy-
chology and computational linguistics, we de-
velop and compare three approaches to detect-
ing deceptive opinion spam, and ultimately
develop a classifier that is nearly 90% accurate
on our gold-standard opinion spam dataset.
Based on feature analysis of our learned mod-
els, we additionally make several theoretical
contributions, including revealing a relation-
ship between deceptive opinions and imagina-
tive writing.
