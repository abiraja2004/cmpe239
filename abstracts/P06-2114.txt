 
This paper describes an architecture to 
convert Sinhala Unicode text into pho-
nemic specification of pronunciation. The 
study was mainly focused on disambigu-
ating schwa-/\/ and /a/ vowel epenthesis 
for consonants, which is one of the sig-
nificant problems found in Sinhala. This 
problem has been addressed by formulat-
ing a set of rules. The proposed set of 
rules was tested using 30,000 distinct 
words obtained from a corpus and com-
pared with the same words manually 
transcribed to phonemes by an expert. 
The Grapheme-to-Phoneme (G2P) con-
version model achieves 98 % accuracy.
