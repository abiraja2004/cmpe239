This paper describes the TALP participa-
tion in the WMT13 evaluation campaign.
Our participation is based on the combi-
nation of several statistical machine trans-
lation systems: based on standard phrase-
based Moses systems. Variations include
techniques such as morphology genera-
tion, training sentence filtering, and do-
main adaptation through unit derivation.
The results show a coherent improvement
on TER, METEOR, NIST, and BLEU
scores when compared to our baseline sys-
tem.
