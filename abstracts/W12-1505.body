We describe preliminary work on generat-
ing contextualized text for nature conservation
volunteers. This Natural Language Genera-
tion (NLG) differs from other ways of describ-
ing spatio-temporal data, in that it deals with
abstractions on data across large geographi-
cal spaces (total projected area 20,600 km2),
as well as temporal trends across longer time
frames (ranging from one week up to a year).
We identify challenges at all stages of the clas-
sical NLG pipeline.
