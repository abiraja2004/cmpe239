This paper presents a method for build-
ing genetic language taxonomies based
on a new approach to comparing lexi-
cal forms. Instead of comparing forms
cross-linguistically, a matrix of language-
internal similarities between forms is cal-
culated. These matrices are then com-
pared to give distances between languages.
We argue that this coheres better with
current thinking in linguistics and psy-
cholinguistics. An implementation of this
approach, called PHILOLOGICON, is de-
scribed, along with its application to Dyen
et al?s (1992) ninety-five wordlists from
Indo-European languages.
