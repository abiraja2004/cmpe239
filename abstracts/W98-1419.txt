 
We focus on the production of efficient descriptions ofobjects, actions and events. We define atype of 
efficiency, textual economy, that exploits the hearer's recognition ofinferential links to material elsewhere 
within a sentence. Textual economy leads to efficient descriptions because the material that supports such 
inferences has been included to satisfy independent communicative goals, and is therefore overloaded 
in the sense of Pollack \[18\]. We argue that achieving textual economy imposes trong requirements 
on the representation and reasoning used in generating sentences. ? The representation must support the 
generator's simultaneous consideration f syntax and semantics. Reasoningmust enable the generator 
to assess quickly and reliably at any stage how the hearer will interpret the current sentence, with its 
-(inc0mplete)syntax,andsemantics. We show that hese representational and reasoning requirements are 
met in the SPUD system for sentence planning and realization.
