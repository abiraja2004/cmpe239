This paper describes a machine learning ap-
proach to classifying n-best speech recogni-
tion hypotheses as either correctly or incor-
rectly recognised. The learners are trained on
a combination of acoustic confidence features
and move evaluation scores in a chess-playing
scenario. The results show significant improve-
ments over sharp baselines that use confidence
rejection thresholds for classification.
