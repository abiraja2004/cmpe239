There are lexical, syntactic, semantic and
discourse variations amongst the languages
used in various biomedical subdomains. It
is important to recognise such differences
and understand that biomedical tools that
work well on some subdomains may not
work as well on others. We report here
on the semantic variations that occur in
the sublanguages of two biomedical subdo-
mains, i.e. cell biology and pharmacology,
at the level of named entity information. By
building a classifier using ratios of named
entities as features, we show that named en-
tity information can discriminate between
documents from each subdomain. More
specifically, our classifier can distinguish
between documents belonging to each sub-
domain with an accuracy of 91.1% F-score.
