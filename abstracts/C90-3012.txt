 
We will attempt to show how human performance 
limitations on various types of syntactic embedding 
constructions in Germanic languages can be modelled 
in a relational network linguistic framework. After 
arguing against centralized ata stores such as 
pushdown stacks and queues, we will demonstrate how 
interconnections among levels of linguistic structure 
can account for many of the psycholinguistic facts.
