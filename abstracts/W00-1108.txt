 
We propose a new approach to text 
categorization based upon the ideas of 
summarization. It combines word-based 
frequency and position method to get 
categorization k owledge from the title field 
only. Experimental results indicate that 
summarization-based categorization can 
achieve acceptable performance on Reuters 
news corpus.
