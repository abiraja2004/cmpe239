With increasing opportunities to learn on-
line, the problem of positioning learners
in an educational network of content of-
fers new possibilities for the utilisation of
geometry-based natural language process-
ing techniques.
In this article, the adoption of latent se-
mantic analysis (LSA) for guiding learners
in their conceptual development is investi-
gated. We propose five new algorithmic
derivations of LSA and test their validity
for positioning in an experiment in order to
draw back conclusions on the suitability of
machine learning from previously accred-
ited evidence. Special attention is thereby
directed towards the role of distractors and
the calculation of thresholds when using
similarities as a proxy for assessing con-
ceptual closeness.
Results indicate that learning improves po-
sitioning. Distractors are of low value and
seem to be replaceable by generic noise
to improve threshold calculation. Fur-
thermore, new ways to flexibly calculate
thresholds could be identified.
