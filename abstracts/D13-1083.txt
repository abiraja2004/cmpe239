MIRA based tuning methods have been
widely used in statistical machine translation
(SMT) system with a large number of fea-
tures. Since the corpus-level BLEU is not de-
composable, these MIRA approaches usually
define a variety of heuristic-driven sentence-
level BLEUs in their model losses. Instead,
we present a new MIRA method, which em-
ploys an exact corpus-level BLEU to com-
pute the model loss. Our method is simpler in
implementation. Experiments on Chinese-to-
English translation show its effectiveness over
two state-of-the-art MIRA implementations.
