We present some experiments conducted
within the context of one of the shared
tasks of the ACL 2005 Workshop on
Building and Using Parallel Texts. We
have employed a new model for finding
the alignments. This new model takes
a recursive approach in order to find the
alignments. As its computational costs are
quite high, a method for splitting the train-
ing sentences in smaller parts is used.
