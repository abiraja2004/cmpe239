We report on the role of the Urdu grammar in the
Parallel Grammar (ParGram) project (Butt et al,
1999; Butt et al, 2002).1 The ParGram project was
designed to use a single grammar development plat-
form and a unified methodology of grammar writ-
ing to develop large-scale grammars for typologi-
cally different languages. At the beginning of the
project, three typologically similar European gram-
mars were implemented. The addition of two Asian
languages, Urdu and Japanese, has shown that the
basic analysis decisions made for the European lan-
guages can be applied to typologically distinct lan-
guages. However, the Asian languages required the
addition of a small number of new standard analy-
ses to cover constructions and analysis techniques
not found in the European languages. With these ad-
ditional standards, the ParGram project can now be
applied to other typologically distinct languages.
