Measuring semantic similarity between
words is vital for various applications
in natural language processing, such as
language modeling, information retrieval,
and document clustering. We propose a
method that utilizes the information avail-
able on the Web to measure semantic sim-
ilarity between a pair of words or entities.
We integrate page counts for each word in
the pair and lexico-syntactic patterns that
occur among the top ranking snippets for
the AND query using support vector ma-
chines. Experimental results on Miller-
Charles? benchmark data set show that the
proposed measure outperforms all the ex-
isting web based semantic similarity mea-
sures by a wide margin, achieving a cor-
relation coefficient of 0.834. Moreover,
the proposed semantic similarity measure
significantly improves the accuracy (F -
measure of 0.78) in a named entity cluster-
ing task, proving the capability of the pro-
posed measure to capture semantic simi-
larity using web content.
