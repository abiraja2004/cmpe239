In this paper, we present an integrated
model of the two central tasks of dialog
management: interpreting user actions and
generating system actions. We model the
interpretation task as a classi?cation prob-
lem and the generation task as a predic-
tion problem. These two tasks are inter-
leaved in an incremental parsing-based di-
alog model. We compare three alterna-
tive parsing methods for this dialog model
using a corpus of human-human spoken
dialog from a catalog ordering domain
that has been annotated for dialog acts
and task/subtask information. We contrast
the amount of context provided by each
method and its impact on performance.
