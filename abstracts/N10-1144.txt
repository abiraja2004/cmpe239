In this paper we report a behavioural ex-
periment documenting that different lexico-
syntactic formulations of the discourse rela-
tion of causation are deemed more or less ac-
ceptable by different categories of readers. We
further report promising results for automati-
cally selecting the formulation that is most ap-
propriate for a given category of reader using
supervised learning. This investigation is em-
bedded within a longer term research agenda
aimed at summarising scientific writing for lay
readers using appropriate paraphrasing.
