We present a novel approach to automatic
metaphor identification, that discovers both
metaphorical associations and metaphorical
expressions in unrestricted text. Our sys-
tem first performs hierarchical graph factor-
ization clustering (HGFC) of nouns and then
searches the resulting graph for metaphorical
connections between concepts. It then makes
use of the salient features of the metaphori-
cally connected clusters to identify the actual
metaphorical expressions. In contrast to pre-
vious work, our method is fully unsupervised.
Despite this fact, it operates with an encour-
aging precision (0.69) and recall (0.61). Our
approach is also the first one in NLP to exploit
the cognitive findings on the differences in or-
ganisation of abstract and concrete concepts in
the human brain.
