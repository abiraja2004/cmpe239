The paper presents a semi-automatic approach
to creating sentiment dictionaries in many lan-
guages. We first produced high-level gold-
standard sentiment dictionaries for two lan-
guages and then translated them automatically
into third languages. Those words that can
be found in both target language word lists
are likely to be useful because their word
senses are likely to be similar to that of the
two source languages. These dictionaries can
be further corrected, extended and improved.
In this paper, we present results that verify
our triangulation hypothesis, by evaluating tri-
angulated lists and comparing them to non-
triangulated machine-translated word lists.
