This paper introduces a new parser eval-
uation corpus containing around 700 sen-
tences annotated with unbounded depen-
dencies, from seven different grammatical
constructions. We run a series of off-the-
shelf parsers on the corpus to evaluate how
well state-of-the-art parsing technology is
able to recover such dependencies. The
overall results range from 25% accuracy
to 59%. These low scores call into ques-
tion the validity of using Parseval scores
as a general measure of parsing capability.
We discuss the importance of parsers be-
ing able to recover unbounded dependen-
cies, given their relatively low frequency
in corpora. We also analyse the various er-
rors made on these constructions by one of
the more successful parsers.
