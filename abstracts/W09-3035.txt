 
Treebank is an important resource for 
both research and application of natural 
language processing. For Vietnamese, we 
still lack such kind of corpora. This paper 
presents up-to-date results of a project for 
Vietnamese treebank construction. Since 
Vietnamese is an isolating language and 
has no word delimiter, there are many 
ambiguities in sentence analysis. We sys-
tematically applied a lot of linguistic 
techniques to handle such ambiguities. 
Annotators are supported by automatic-
labeling tools and a tree-editor tool. Raw 
texts are extracted from Tuoi Tre 
(Youth), an online Vietnamese daily 
newspaper. The current annotation 
agreement is around 90 percent.
