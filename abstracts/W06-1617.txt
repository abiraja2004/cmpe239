This paper describes our attempt at
NomBank-based automatic Semantic Role
Labeling (SRL). NomBank is a project at
New York University to annotate the ar-
gument structures for common nouns in
the Penn Treebank II corpus. We treat
the NomBank SRL task as a classifica-
tion problem and explore the possibility
of adapting features previously shown use-
ful in PropBank-based SRL systems. Var-
ious NomBank-specific features are ex-
plored. On test section 23, our best sys-
tem achieves F1 score of 72.73 (69.14)
when correct (automatic) syntactic parse
trees are used. To our knowledge, this
is the first reported automatic NomBank
SRL system.
