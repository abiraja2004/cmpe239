We propose a novel approach for improv-
ing Feature Selection for Word Sense Dis-
ambiguation by incorporating a feature
relevance prior for each word indicating
which features are more likely to be se-
lected. We use transfer of knowledge from
similar words to learn this prior over the
features, which permits us to learn higher
accuracy models, particularly for the rarer
word senses. Results on the ONTONOTES
verb data show significant improvement
over the baseline feature selection algo-
rithm and results that are comparable to or
better than other state-of-the-art methods.
