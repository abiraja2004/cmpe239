Given the great amount of definite noun
phrases that introduce an entity into the
text for the first time, this paper presents a
set of linguistic features that can be used
to detect this type of definites in Span-
ish. The efficiency of the different fea-
tures is tested by building a rule-based and
a learning-based chain-starting classifier.
Results suggest that the classifier, which
achieves high precision at the cost of re-
call, can be incorporated as either a filter
or an additional feature within a corefer-
ence resolution system to boost its perfor-
mance.
