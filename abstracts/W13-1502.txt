Persons affected by Autism Spectrum Dis-
orders (ASD) present impairments in so-
cial interaction. A significant percentile of
them have inadequate reading comprehension
skills. In the ongoing FIRST project we build
a multilingual tool called Open Book that
helps the ASD people to better understand the
texts. The tool applies a series of automatic
transformations to user documents to identify
and remove the reading obstacles to compre-
hension. We focus on three semantic compo-
nents: an Image component that retrieves im-
ages for the concepts in the text, an idiom de-
tection component and a topic model compo-
nent. Moreover, we present the personaliza-
tion component that adapts the system output
to user preferences.
