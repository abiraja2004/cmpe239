Metonymic language is a pervasive phe-
nomenon. Metonymic type shifting, or ar-
gument type coercion, results in a selectional
restriction violation where the argument?s se-
mantic class differs from the class the predi-
cate expects. In this paper we present an un-
supervised method that learns the selectional
restriction of arguments and enables the de-
tection of argument coercion. This method
also generates an enhanced probabilistic reso-
lution of logical metonymies. The experimen-
tal results indicate substantial improvements
the detection of coercions and the ranking of
metonymic interpretations.
