We present a new approach to intrinsic sum-
mary evaluation, based on initial experiments
in van Halteren and Teufel (2003), which com-
bines two novel aspects: comparison of infor-
mation content (rather than string similarity)
in gold standard and system summary, mea-
sured in shared atomic information units which
we call factoids, and comparison to more than
one gold standard summary (in our data: 20
and 50 summaries respectively). In this paper,
we show that factoid annotation is highly re-
producible, introduce a weighted factoid score,
estimate how many summaries are required for
stable system rankings, and show that the fac-
toid scores cannot be sufficiently approximated
by unigrams and the DUC information overlap
measure.
