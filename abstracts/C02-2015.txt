electronic dictionary that provides transla-
tions for any piece of text displayed on a 
computer screen, without requiring user in-
teraction. This is achieved through a process 
of three phases: text acquisition from the 
screen, morpho-syntactic analysis of the 
context of the selected word, and the dic-
tionary lookup. As with other similar tools 
available, this program usually works with 
dictionaries adapted from one or more prin-
ted dictionaries. To implement context sen-
sitive features, however, traditional diction-
ary entries need to be restructured. By split-
ting up entries into smaller pieces and in-
dexing them in a special way, the program is 
able to display a restricted set of information 
that is relevant to the context. Based on the 
information in the dictionaries, the program 
is able to recognize?even discontinu-
ous?multiword expressions on the screen. 
The program has three major features which 
we believe make it unique for the time being, 
and which the development focused on: lin-
guistic flexibility (stemming, morphological 
analysis and shallow parsing), open archi-
tecture (three major architectural blocks, all 
replaceable along public documented APIs), 
and flexible user interface (replaceable dic-
tionaries, direct user feedback). 
In this paper, we assess the functional re-
quirements of a context-sensitive dictionary 
as a start; then we explain the program?s 
three phases of operation, focusing on the 
implementation of the lexicons and the con-
text-sensitive features. We conclude the pa-
per by comparing our tool to other similar 
publicly available products, and summarize 
plans for future development.
