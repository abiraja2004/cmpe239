We describe our system to extract genia
events that was developed for the BioNLP
2013 Shared Task. Our system uses a su-
pervised information extraction platform
based on Support Vector Machines (SVM)
and separates the process of event clas-
sification into multiple stages. For each
event type the SVM parameters are ad-
justed and feature selection carried out.
We find that this optimisation improves
the performance of our approach. Overall
our system achieved the highest precision
score of all systems and was ranked 6th
of 10 participating systems on F-measure
(strict matching).
