This paper describes the experiments devel-
oped and the results obtained in the partic-
ipation of UNED in the Third Recognising
Textual Entailment (RTE) Challenge. The
experiments are focused on the study of the
effect of named entities in the recognition
of textual entailment. While Named Entity
Recognition (NER) provides remarkable re-
sults (accuracy over 70%) for RTE on QA
task, IE task requires more sophisticated
treatment of named entities such as the iden-
tification of relations between them.
