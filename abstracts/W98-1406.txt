  
We argue that the current, predominantly task-oriented, approaz~hes to modularizing text 
? generation, while plausible and useful conceptually, set up spurious conceptual nd operational 
constraints. We propose a data-driven approach to modularization a d illustrate how it elimi- 
nates ? ?the previously ubiquitous constraints on combination ofevidence across modules and on 
? control. We also briefly overview the constraint-based control architecture that enables such an 
approach and facilitates near linear-time processing with realistic texts.
