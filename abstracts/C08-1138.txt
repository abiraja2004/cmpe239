 
This paper presents a general platform, 
namely synchronous tree sequence sub-
stitution grammar (STSSG), for the 
grammar comparison study in Transla-
tional Equivalence Modeling (TEM) and 
Statistical Machine Translation (SMT). 
Under the STSSG platform, we compare 
the expressive abilities of various gram-
mars through synchronous parsing and a 
real translation platform on a variety of 
Chinese-English bilingual corpora. Ex-
perimental results show that the STSSG 
is able to better explain the data in paral-
lel corpora than other grammars. Our 
study further finds that the complexity of 
structure divergence is much higher than 
suggested in literature, which imposes a 
big challenge to syntactic transformation-
based SMT.
