 
This paper introduced the main features of the 
UAM CorpusTool, software for human and 
semi-automatic annotation of text and images. 
The demonstration will show how to set up an 
annotation project, how to annotate text files 
at multiple annotation levels, how to auto-
matically assign tags to segments matching 
lexical patterns, and how to perform cross-
layer searches of the corpus.
