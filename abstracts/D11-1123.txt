Based on analysis of on-line review corpus
we observe that most sentences have compli-
cated opinion structures and they cannot be
well represented by existing methods, such as
frame-based and feature-based ones. In this
work, we propose a novel graph-based rep-
resentation for sentence level sentiment. An
integer linear programming-based structural
learning method is then introduced to produce
the graph representations of input sentences.
Experimental evaluations on a manually la-
beled Chinese corpus demonstrate the effec-
tiveness of the proposed approach.
