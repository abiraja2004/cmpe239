Sentence compression is the task of pro-
ducing a summary at the sentence level.
This paper focuses on three aspects of
this task which have not received de-
tailed treatment in the literature: train-
ing requirements, scalability, and auto-
matic evaluation. We provide a novel com-
parison between a supervised constituent-
based and an weakly supervised word-
based compression algorithm and exam-
ine how these models port to different do-
mains (written vs. spoken text). To achieve
this, a human-authored compression cor-
pus has been created and our study high-
lights potential problems with the auto-
matically gathered compression corpora
currently used. Finally, we assess whether
automatic evaluation measures can be
used to determine compression quality.
