We propose a new unsupervised method
for topic detection that automatically iden-
tifies the different facets of an event. We
use pointwise Kullback-Leibler divergence
along with the Jaccard coefficient to build
a topic graph which represents the com-
munity structure of the different facets.
The problem is formulated as a weighted
set cover problem with dynamically vary-
ing weights. The algorithm is domain-
independent and generates a representa-
tive set of informative and discriminative
phrases that cover the entire event. We
evaluate this algorithm on a large collec-
tion of blog postings about different news
events and report promising results.
