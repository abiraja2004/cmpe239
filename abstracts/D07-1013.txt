We present a comparative error analysis
of the two dominant approaches in data-
driven dependency parsing: global, exhaus-
tive, graph-based models, and local, greedy,
transition-based models. We show that, in
spite of similar performance overall, the two
models produce different types of errors, in
a way that can be explained by theoretical
properties of the two models. This analysis
leads to new directions for parser develop-
ment.
