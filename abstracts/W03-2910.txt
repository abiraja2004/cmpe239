This paper demonstrates the modelling
of morphological knowledge in Bulgar-
ian and applications of the created data
sets in an integrated framework for pro-
duction and manipulation of language
resources. The production scenario is
exemplified by the Bulgarian verb as the
morphologically richest and most prob-
lematic part-of-speech category. The
definition of the set of morphosyntactic
specifications for verbs in the lexicon is
described. The application of the tagset
in the automatic morphological analy-
sis of text corpora is accounted for. A
Type Model of Bulgarian verbs handling
the attachment of short pronominal ele-
ments to verbs, is presented.
