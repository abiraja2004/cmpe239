This paper is based on our efforts on
automatic multi-word terms extraction
and its conceptual structure for multi-
ple languages. At present, we mainly
focus on English and the major Ro-
mance languages such as French, Span-
ish, Portuguese, and Italian. This pa-
per is a case study for Italian language.
We present how to build automatically
conceptual structure of automatically ex-
tracted multi-word terms from domain
specific corpora for Italian. We show
the experimental results for extracting
multi-word terms from two domain cor-
pora (?natural area? and ?organic agri-
culture?). Since this work is still on-
going, we discuss our future direction at
the end of the paper.
