We provide a general algorithmic schema
for translation rule extraction and show that
several popular extraction methods (includ-
ing phrase pair extraction, hierarchical phrase
pair extraction, and GHKM extraction) can be
viewed as specific instances of this schema.
This work is primarily intended as a survey of
the dominant extraction paradigms, in which
we make explicit the close relationship be-
tween these approaches, and establish a lan-
guage for future hybridizations. This facili-
tates a generic and extensible implementation
of alignment-based extraction methods.
