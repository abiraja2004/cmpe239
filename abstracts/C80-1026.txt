 
AMBER is a model of first language 
acquisit ion that improves its 
performance through a process of error 
recovery. The model is implemented in 
ACTG, an adaptive production system 
language. AMBER starts with the abil ity 
to say only one word at a time, but adds 
rules for inserting additional words in 
the correct order, based on comparisons 
between predicted and observed 
sentences. These insertion rules may be 
overly general and lead to errors of 
commission; in turn, these lead to more 
conservative rules with additional 
conditions. AMBER's learning mechanisms 
account for many of the developments 
observed in children's speech.
