 
Language classification is a preliminary step for most natural-language related processes. The significant quantity of multilingual doc-uments poses a problem for traditional lan-guage-classification schemes and requires segmentation of the document to monolingual sections. This phenomenon is characteristic of classical and medieval Jewish literature, which frequently mixes Hebrew, Aramaic, Judeo-Arabic and other Hebrew-script lan-guages. We propose a method for classifica-tion and segmentation of multi-lingual texts in the Hebrew character set, using bigram sta-tistics. For texts, such as the manuscripts found in the Cairo Genizah, we are also forced to deal with a significant level of noise in OCR-processed text. 1.
