This paper presents novel improvements
to the induction of translation lexicons
from monolingual corpora using multilin-
gual dependency parses. We introduce a
dependency-based context model that in-
corporates long-range dependencies, vari-
able context sizes, and reordering. It pro-
vides a 16% relative improvement over
the baseline approach that uses a fixed
context window of adjacent words. Its
Top 10 accuracy for noun translation is
higher than that of a statistical translation
model trained on a Spanish-English par-
allel corpus containing 100,000 sentence
pairs. We generalize the evaluation to
other word-types, and show that the per-
formance can be increased to 18% rela-
tive by preserving part-of-speech equiva-
lencies during translation.
