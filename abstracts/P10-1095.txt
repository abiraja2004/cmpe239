Automated summarization methods can
be defined as ?language-independent,? if
they are not based on any language-
specific knowledge. Such methods can
be used for multilingual summarization
defined by Mani (2001) as ?processing
several languages, with summary in the
same language as input.? In this pa-
per, we introduce MUSE, a language-
independent approach for extractive sum-
marization based on the linear optimiza-
tion of several sentence ranking measures
using a genetic algorithm. We tested our
methodology on two languages?English
and Hebrew?and evaluated its perfor-
mance with ROUGE-1 Recall vs. state-
of-the-art extractive summarization ap-
proaches. Our results show that MUSE
performs better than the best known multi-
lingual approach (TextRank1) in both lan-
guages. Moreover, our experimental re-
sults on a bilingual (English and Hebrew)
document collection suggest that MUSE
does not need to be retrained on each lan-
guage and the same model can be used
across at least two different languages.
