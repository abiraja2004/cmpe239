We introduce alignment models for Machine Trans-
lation that take into account the context of a source
word when determining its translation. Since the use
of these contexts alone causes data sparsity prob-
lems, we develop a decision tree algorithm for clus-
tering the contexts based on optimisation of the
EM auxiliary function. We show that our context-
dependent models lead to an improvement in align-
ment quality, and an increase in translation quality
when the alignments are used in Arabic-English and
Chinese-English translation.
