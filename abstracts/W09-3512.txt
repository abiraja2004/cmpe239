We address the issues of transliteration be-
tween Indian languages and English, es-
pecially for named entities. We use an
EM algorithm to learn the alignment be-
tween the languages. We find that there
are lot of ambiguities in the rules map-
ping the characters in the source language
to the corresponding characters in the tar-
get language. Some of these ambiguities
can be handled by capturing context by
learning multi-character based alignments
and use of character n-gram models. We
observed that a word in the source script
may have actually originated from differ-
ent languages. Instead of learning one
model for the language pair, we propose
that one may use multiple models and a
classifier to decide which model to use. A
contribution of this work is that the models
and classifiers are learned in a completely
unsupervised manner. Using our system
we were able to get quite accurate translit-
eration models.
