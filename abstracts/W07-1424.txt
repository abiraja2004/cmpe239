We describe a preliminary version of Mu-
taphrase, a system that generates para-
phrases of semantically labeled input sen-
tences using the semantics and syntax en-
coded in FrameNet, a freely available lexico-
semantic database. The algorithm generates
a large number of paraphrases with a wide
range of syntactic and semantic distances
from the input. For example, given the in-
put ?I like eating cheese?, the system out-
puts the syntactically distant ?Eating cheese
is liked by me?, the semantically distant ?I
fear sipping juice?, and thousands of other
sentences. The wide range of generated
paraphrases makes the algorithm ideal for a
range of statistical machine learning prob-
lems such as machine translation and lan-
guage modeling as well as other semantics-
dependent tasks such as query and language
generation.
