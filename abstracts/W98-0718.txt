 
WordNet has rarely been applied to natural lan- 
guage generation, despite of its wide applica- 
tion in other fields. In this paper, we address 
three issues in the usage of WordNet in gener- 
ation: adapting a general lexicon like WordNet 
to a specific application domain, how the infor- 
mation in WordNet can be used in generation, 
and augmenting WordNet with other types of 
knowledge that are helpful for generation. We 
propose a three step procedure to tailor Word- 
Net to a specific domain, and carried out ex- 
periments on a basketball corpus (1,015 game 
reports, 1.TMB).
