General characteristics of a pragmatic
metric for the production evaluation of
speech-to-speech translations are dis-
cussed. While these characteristics con-
strain the space of allowable metrics,
infinite definition space remains from
which to select and define any particular
metric. The recommended characteistics
are drawn from the author?s experience
as primary developer of a text-based
translation quality metric used in a pro-
duction environment. The primary contri-
bution is that of strict category ordering
and two meta-rules that reduce the
variance in assignment of errors to
categories.
