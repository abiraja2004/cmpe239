Psycholinguistic studies of metaphor process-
ing must control their stimuli not just for
word frequency but also for the frequency
with which a term is used metaphorically.
Thus, we consider the task of metaphor fre-
quency estimation, which predicts how often
target words will be used metaphorically. We
develop metaphor classifiers which represent
metaphorical domains through Latent Dirich-
let Allocation, and apply these classifiers to
the target words, aggregating their decisions to
estimate the metaphorical frequencies. Train-
ing on only 400 sentences, our models are able
to achieve 61.3% accuracy on metaphor clas-
sification and 77.8% accuracy on HIGH vs.
LOW metaphorical frequency estimation.
