We address the modeling, parameter estima-
tion and search challenges that arise from the
introduction of reordering models that capture
non-local reordering in alignment modeling.
In particular, we introduce several reordering
models that utilize (pairs of) function words
as contexts for alignment reordering. To ad-
dress the parameter estimation challenge, we
propose to estimate these reordering models
from a relatively small amount of manually-
aligned corpora. To address the search chal-
lenge, we devise an iterative local search al-
gorithm that stochastically explores reorder-
ing possibilities. By capturing non-local re-
ordering phenomena, our proposed alignment
model bears a closer resemblance to state-
of-the-art translation model. Empirical re-
sults show significant improvements in align-
ment quality as well as in translation perfor-
mance over baselines in a large-scale Chinese-
English translation task.
