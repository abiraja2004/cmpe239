We present a method for automatically learn-
ing inflectional classes and associated lem-
mas from morphologically annotated corpora.
The method consists of a core language-
independent algorithm, which can be opti-
mized for specific languages. The method is
demonstrated on Egyptian Arabic and Ger-
man, two morphologically rich languages.
Our best method for Egyptian Arabic pro-
vides an error reduction of 55.6% over a sim-
ple baseline; our best method for German
achieves a 66.7% error reduction.
