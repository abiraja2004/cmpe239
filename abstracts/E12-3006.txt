Language identification of written text has
been studied for several decades. Despite
this fact, most of the research is focused
on a few most spoken languages, whereas
the minor ones are ignored. The identi-
fication of a larger number of languages
brings new difficulties that do not occur
for a few languages. These difficulties are
causing decreased accuracy. The objective
of this paper is to investigate the sources
of such degradation. In order to isolate
the impact of individual factors, 5 differ-
ent algorithms and 3 different number of
languages are used. The Support Vector
Machine algorithm achieved an accuracy of
98% for 90 languages and the YALI algo-
rithm based on a scoring function had an
accuracy of 95.4%. The YALI algorithm
has slightly lower accuracy but classifies
around 17 times faster and its training is
more than 4000 times faster.
Three different data sets with various num-
ber of languages and sample sizes were pre-
pared to overcome the lack of standardized
data sets. These data sets are now publicly
available.
