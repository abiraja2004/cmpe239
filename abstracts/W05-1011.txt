Distributional similarity requires large
volumes of data to accurately represent
infrequent words. However, the nearest-
neighbour approach to finding synonyms
suffers from poor scalability. The Spa-
tial Approximation Sample Hierarchy
(SASH), proposed by Houle (2003b), is
a data structure for approximate nearest-
neighbour queries that balances the effi-
ciency/approximation trade-off. We have
intergrated this into an existing distribu-
tional similarity system, tripling efficiency
with a minor accuracy penalty.
