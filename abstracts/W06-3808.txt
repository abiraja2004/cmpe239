We present a graph-based semi-supervised
learning algorithm to address the senti-
ment analysis task of rating inference.
Given a set of documents (e.g., movie
reviews) and accompanying ratings (e.g.,
?4 stars?), the task calls for inferring nu-
merical ratings for unlabeled documents
based on the perceived sentiment ex-
pressed by their text. In particular, we
are interested in the situation where la-
beled data is scarce. We place this task
in the semi-supervised setting and demon-
strate that considering unlabeled reviews
in the learning process can improve rating-
inference performance. We do so by creat-
ing a graph on both labeled and unlabeled
data to encode certain assumptions for this
task. We then solve an optimization prob-
lem to obtain a smooth rating function
over the whole graph. When only lim-
ited labeled data is available, this method
achieves significantly better predictive ac-
curacy over other methods that ignore the
unlabeled examples during training.
