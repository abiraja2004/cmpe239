Chinese word segmentation is a difficult, im-
portant and widely-studied sequence modeling
problem. This paper demonstrates the abil-
ity of linear-chain conditional random fields
(CRFs) to perform robust and accurate Chi-
nese word segmentation by providing a prin-
cipled framework that easily supports the in-
tegration of domain knowledge in the form of
multiple lexicons of characters and words. We
also present a probabilistic new word detection
method, which further improves performance.
Our system is evaluated on four datasets used
in a recent comprehensive Chinese word seg-
mentation competition. State-of-the-art perfor-
mance is obtained.
