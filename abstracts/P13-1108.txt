We describe a new probabilistic model
for extracting events between major polit-
ical actors from news corpora. Our un-
supervised model brings together famil-
iar components in natural language pro-
cessing (like parsers and topic models)
with contextual political information?
temporal and dyad dependence?to in-
fer latent event classes. We quantita-
tively evaluate the model?s performance
on political science benchmarks: recover-
ing expert-assigned event class valences,
and detecting real-world conflict. We also
conduct a small case study based on our
model?s inferences.
