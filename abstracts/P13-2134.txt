Lexical resources such as WordNet and
VerbNet are widely used in a multitude
of NLP tasks, as are annotated corpora
such as treebanks. Often, the resources
are used as-is, without question or exam-
ination. This practice risks missing sig-
nificant performance gains and even entire
techniques.
This paper addresses the importance of
resource quality through the lens of a
challenging NLP task: detecting selec-
tional preference violations. We present
DAVID, a simple, lexical resource-based
preference violation detector. With as-
is lexical resources, DAVID achieves an
F1-measure of just 28.27%. When the
resource entries and parser outputs for
a small sample are corrected, however,
the F1-measure on that sample jumps
from 40% to 61.54%, and performance
on other examples rises, suggesting that
the algorithm becomes practical given re-
fined resources. More broadly, this pa-
per shows that resource quality matters
tremendously, sometimes even more than
algorithmic improvements.
