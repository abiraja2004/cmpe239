We address the task of automatically pre-
dicting if summarization system perfor-
mance will be good or bad based on fea-
tures derived directly from either single- or
multi-document inputs. Our labelled cor-
pus for the task is composed of data from
large scale evaluations completed over the
span of several years. The variation of data
between years allows for a comprehensive
analysis of the robustness of features, but
poses a challenge for building a combined
corpus which can be used for training and
testing. Still, we find that the problem can
be mitigated by appropriately normalizing
for differences within each year. We ex-
amine different formulations of the classi-
fication task which considerably influence
performance. The best results are 84%
prediction accuracy for single- and 74%
for multi-document summarization.
