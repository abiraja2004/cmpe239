In this paper we present a cognitively plau-
sible approach to word segmentation that
segments in an online fashion using only
local information and a lexicon of pre-
viously segmented words. Unlike popu-
lar statistical optimization techniques, the
learner uses structural information of the
input syllables rather than distributional
cues to segment words. We develop a
memory model for the learner that like a
child learner does not recall previously hy-
pothesized words perfectly. The learner at-
tains an F-score of 86.69% in ideal condi-
tions and 85.05% when word recall is un-
reliable and stress in the input is reduced.
These results demonstrate the power that a
simple learner can have when paired with
appropriate structural constraints on its hy-
potheses.
