We present preliminary experiments of a
binary-switch, static-grid typing interface
making use of varying language model contri-
butions. Our motivation is to quantify the de-
gree to which language models can make the
simplest scanning interfaces ? such as show-
ing one symbol at a time rather than a scan-
ning a grid ? competitive in terms of typing
speed. We present a grid scanning method
making use of optimal Huffman binary codes,
and demonstrate the impact of higher order
language models on its performance. We also
investigate the scanning methods of highlight-
ing just one cell in a grid at any given time
or showing one symbol at a time without a
grid, and show that they yield commensurate
performance when using higher order n-gram
models, mainly due to lower error rate and a
lower rate of missed targets.
