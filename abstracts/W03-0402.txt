This paper introduces a novel Support Vec-
tor Machines (SVMs) based voting algorithm
for reranking, which provides a way to solve
the sequential models indirectly. We have
presented a risk formulation under the PAC
framework for this voting algorithm. We have
applied this algorithm to the parse reranking
problem, and achieved labeled recall and pre-
cision of 89.4%/89.8% on WSJ section 23 of
Penn Treebank.
