This paper presents the contribution of our
team at task 2 of SemEval 2013: Sentiment
Analysis in Twitter. We submitted a con-
strained run for each of the two subtasks. In the
Contextual Polarity Disambiguation subtask,
we use a sentiment lexicon approach combined
with polarity shift detection and tree kernel
based classifiers. In the Message Polarity Clas-
sification subtask, we focus on the influence
of domain information on sentiment classifica-
tion.
