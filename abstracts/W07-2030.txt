 
Entity disambiguation resolves the many-
to-many correspondence between mentions 
of entities in text and unique real-world en-
tities.  Fair Isaac?s entity disambiguation 
uses language-independent entity context 
to agglomeratively resolve mentions with 
similar names to unique entities.  This pa-
per describes Fair Isaac?s automatic entity 
disambiguation capability and assesses its 
performance on the SemEval 2007 Web 
People Search task.
