Set expansion refers to expanding a par-
tial set of ?seed? objects into a more com-
plete set. One system that does set ex-
pansion is SEAL (Set Expander for Any
Language), which expands entities auto-
matically by utilizing resources from the
Web in a language-independent fashion.
In this paper, we illustrated in detail the
construction of character-level wrappers
for set expansion implemented in SEAL.
We also evaluated several kinds of wrap-
pers for set expansion and showed that
character-based wrappers perform better
than HTML-based wrappers. In addition,
we demonstrated a technique that extends
SEAL to learn binary relational concepts
(e.g., ?x is the mayor of the city y?) from
only two seeds. We also show that the
extended SEAL has good performance on
our evaluation datasets, which includes
English and Chinese, thus demonstrating
language-independence.
