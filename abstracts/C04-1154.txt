Data-Oriented Translation (DOT), based on Data-
Oriented Parsing (DOP), is a language-independent
MT engine which exploits parsed, aligned bitexts
to produce very high quality translations. How-
ever, data acquisition constitutes a serious bottleneck
as DOT requires parsed sentences aligned at both
sentential and sub-structural levels. Manual sub-
structural alignment is time-consuming, error-prone
and requires considerable knowledge of both source
and target languages and how they are related. Au-
tomating this process is essential in order to carry out
the large-scale translation experiments necessary to
assess the full potential of DOT.
We present a novel algorithm which automatically in-
duces sub-structural alignments between context-free
phrase structure trees in a fast and consistent fash-
ion requiring little or no knowledge of the language
pair. We present results from a number of experi-
ments which indicate that our method provides a se-
rious alternative to manual alignment.
