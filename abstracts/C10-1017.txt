We describe a novel approach to coref-
erence resolution which implements a
global decision via hypergraph partition-
ing. In constrast to almost all previ-
ous approaches, we do not rely on sep-
arate classification and clustering steps,
but perform coreference resolution glob-
ally in one step. Our hypergraph-based
global model implemented within an end-
to-end coreference resolution system out-
performs two strong baselines (Soon et al,
2001; Bengtson & Roth, 2008) using sys-
tem mentions only.
