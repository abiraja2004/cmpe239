On a pilot corpus of Dutch medical encyclopedia texts, we focus
on the mechanism of taxonomic inference that involves the extraction
of co-hyponym terms, and the taxonomic or domain-specific lexico-
semantic relation in the form of a textual hypothesis, which coordinates
these. An initial set of inference elements can be acquired by syntactic
and semantic alignment, additionally driven by document structure.
From the terms and the related hypothesis we can harvest lexical pat-
terns, which are linked to annotated domain concepts. The aim of the
process is to learn inference patterns and apply the system to short
as well as unstructured documents where fewer or no discourse-level
cues are available, in order to acquire new co-hyponyms linked to their
coordinating term via a specified relation.
