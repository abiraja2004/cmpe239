Statistical machine translation (SMT)
models require bilingual corpora for train-
ing, and these corpora are often multi-
lingual with parallel text in multiple lan-
guages simultaneously. We introduce an
active learning task of adding a new lan-
guage to an existing multilingual set of
parallel text and constructing high quality
MT systems, from each language in the
collection into this new target language.
We show that adding a new language using
active learning to the EuroParl corpus pro-
vides a significant improvement compared
to a random sentence selection baseline.
We also provide new highly effective sen-
tence selection methods that improve AL
for phrase-based SMT in the multilingual
and single language pair setting.
