We address the problem of construct-
ing hybrid translation systems by inter-
secting a Hiero-style hierarchical sys-
tem with a phrase-based system and
present formal techniques for doing so.
We model the phrase-based component
by introducing a variant of weighted
finite-state automata, called ?-automata,
provide a self-contained description
of a general algorithm for intersect-
ing weighted synchronous context-free
grammars with finite-state automata, and
extend these constructs to ?-automata.
We end by briefly discussing complexity
properties of the presented algorithms.
