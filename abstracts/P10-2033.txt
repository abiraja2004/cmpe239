We study the challenges raised by Ara-
bic verb and subject detection and re-
ordering in Statistical Machine Transla-
tion (SMT). We show that post-verbal sub-
ject (VS) constructions are hard to trans-
late because they have highly ambiguous
reordering patterns when translated to En-
glish. In addition, implementing reorder-
ing is difficult because the boundaries of
VS constructions are hard to detect accu-
rately, even with a state-of-the-art Arabic
dependency parser. We therefore propose
to reorder VS constructions into SV or-
der for SMT word alignment only. This
strategy significantly improves BLEU and
TER scores, even on a strong large-scale
baseline and despite noisy parses.
