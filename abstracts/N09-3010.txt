We demonstrate that a supervised annotation
learning approach using structured features
derived from tokens and prior annotations per-
forms better than a bag of words approach.
We present a general graph representation for
automatically deriving these features from la-
beled data. Automatic feature selection based
on class association scores requires a large
amount of labeled data and direct voting can
be difficult and error-prone for structured fea-
tures, even for language specialists. We show
that highlighted rationales from the user can
be used for indirect feature voting and same
performance can be achieved with less labeled
data.We present our results on two annotation
learning tasks for opinion mining from prod-
uct and movie reviews.
