A maximum entropy (ME) model is usu-
ally estimated so that it conforms to equal-
ity constraints on feature expectations.
However, the equality constraint is inap-
propriate for sparse and therefore unre-
liable features. This study explores an
ME model with box-type inequality con-
straints, where the equality can be vio-
lated to reflect this unreliability. We eval-
uate the inequality ME model using text
categorization datasets. We also propose
an extension of the inequality ME model,
which results in a natural integration with
the Gaussian MAP estimation. Experi-
mental results demonstrate the advantage
of the inequality models and the proposed
extension.
