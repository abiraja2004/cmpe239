This paper describes our system for
SemEval-2010 Task 8 on multi-way clas-
sification of semantic relations between
nominals. First, the type of semantic re-
lation is classified. Then a relation type-
specific classifier determines the relation
direction. Classification is performed us-
ing SVM classifiers and a number of fea-
tures that capture the context, semantic
role affiliation, and possible pre-existing
relations of the nominals. This approach
achieved an F1 score of 82.19% and an ac-
curacy of 77.92%.
