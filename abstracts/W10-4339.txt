This paper presents a spoken dialogue frame-
work that helps users in making decisions.
Users often do not have a definite goal or cri-
teria for selecting from a list of alternatives.
Thus the system has to bridge this knowledge
gap and also provide the users with an appro-
priate alternative together with the reason for
this recommendation through dialogue. We
present a dialogue state model for such deci-
sion making dialogue. To evaluate this model,
we implement a trial sightseeing guidance sys-
tem and collect dialogue data. Then, we opti-
mize the dialogue strategy based on the state
model through reinforcement learning with a
natural policy gradient approach using a user
simulator trained on the collected dialogue
corpus.
