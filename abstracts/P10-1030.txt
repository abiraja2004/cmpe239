Many researchers are trying to use information
extraction (IE) to create large-scale knowl-
edge bases from natural language text on the
Web. However, the primary approach (su-
pervised learning of relation-specific extrac-
tors) requires manually-labeled training data
for each relation and doesn?t scale to the thou-
sands of relations encoded in Web text.
This paper presents LUCHS, a self-supervised,
relation-specific IE system which learns 5025
relations ? more than an order of magnitude
greater than any previous approach ? with an
average F1 score of 61%. Crucial to LUCHS?s
performance is an automated system for dy-
namic lexicon learning, which allows it to
learn accurately from heuristically-generated
training data, which is often noisy and sparse.
