 
Recently, NLP researches have advanced 
using F-scores, precisions, and recalls with 
gold standard data as evaluation measures. 
However, such evaluations cannot capture 
the different behaviors of varying NLP 
tools or the different behaviors of a NLP 
tool that depends on the data and domain in 
which it works. Because an increasing 
number of tools are available nowadays, it 
has become increasingly important to grasp 
these behavioral differences, in order to 
select a suitable set of tools, which forms a 
complex workflow for a specific purpose. 
In order to observe such differences, we 
need to integrate available combinations of 
tools into a workflow and to compare the 
combinatorial results. Although generic 
frameworks like UIMA (Unstructured 
Information Management Architecture) 
provide interoperability to solve this 
problem, the solution they provide is only 
partial. In order for truly interoperable 
toolkits to become a reality, we also need 
sharable and comparable type systems with 
an automatic combinatorial comparison 
generator, which would allow systematic 
comparisons of available tools. In this 
paper, we describe such an environment, 
which we developed based on UIMA, and 
we show its feasibility through an example 
of a protein-protein interaction (PPI) 
extraction system.
