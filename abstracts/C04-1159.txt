This paper describes a project to detect dependen-
cies between Japanese phrasal units called bunsetsus,
and sentence boundaries in a spontaneous speech
corpus. In monologues, the biggest problem with de-
pendency structure analysis is that sentence bound-
aries are ambiguous. In this paper, we propose
two methods for improving the accuracy of sentence
boundary detection in spontaneous Japanese speech:
One is based on statistical machine translation us-
ing dependency information and the other is based
on text chunking using SVM. An F-measure of 84.9
was achieved for the accuracy of sentence bound-
ary detection by using the proposed methods. The
accuracy of dependency structure analysis was also
improved from 75.2% to 77.2% by using automat-
ically detected sentence boundaries. The accuracy
of dependency structure analysis and that of sen-
tence boundary detection were also improved by in-
teractively using both automatically detected depen-
dency structures and sentence boundaries.
