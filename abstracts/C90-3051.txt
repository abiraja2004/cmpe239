 
The purpose of this paper is to compare different 
ways of adopting reason-maintenance techniques in 
incremental parsing (and interpretation). A reason- 
maintenance system supports incremental tbrmation 
and revision of beliefs. By viewing the construction 
of partial analyses of a text as analogous to form- 
ing beliefs about the meanings of its parts, a rela- 
tion between parsing and reason maintenance can be 
conceived. In line with this, reason maintenance can 
bc used for realizing a strong notion of incremental 
parsing, allowing for revisions of previous analyses. 
Moreover, an assumption-based reason-maintenance 
system (ATMS) can be used to support eftieicnt com- 
parisons of (competing) interpretations. The paper 
argues for an approach which is an extension of chart 
parsing, but which also can be seen as a system con- 
sisting of an inference ngine (the parser proper) cou- 
pled with a simplified ATMS.
