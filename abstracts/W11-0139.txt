In this paper, we describe the Baseball Announcers? Language Linked with General Annotation of
Meaningful Events (BALLGAME) project ? a text corpus for research in computional semantics.
We collected pitch-by-pitch event data for a sample of baseball games and used this data to build an
annotated corpus composed of transcripts of radio broadcasts of these games. Our annotation links
text from the broadcast to events in a formal representation of the semantics of the baseball game. We
describe our corpus model, the annotation tool used to create the corpus, and conclude by discussing
applications of this corpus in semantics research and natural language processing.
