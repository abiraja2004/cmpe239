We investigated using structural events, e.g.,
clause and disfluency structure, from tran-
scriptions of spontaneous non-native speech,
to compute features for measuring speaking
proficiency. Using a set of transcribed au-
dio files collected from the TOEFL Practice
Test Online (TPO), we conducted a sophisti-
cated annotation of structural events, includ-
ing clause boundaries and types, as well as
disfluencies. Based on words and the anno-
tated structural events, we extracted features
related to syntactic complexity, e.g., the mean
length of clause (MLC) and dependent clause
frequency (DEPC), and a feature related to
disfluencies, the interruption point frequency
per clause (IPC). Among these features, the
IPC shows the highest correlation with holis-
tic scores (r = ?0.344). Furthermore, we in-
creased the correlation with human scores by
normalizing IPC by (1) MLC (r = ?0.386),
(2) DEPC (r = ?0.429), and (3) both (r =
?0.462). In this research, the features derived
from structural events of speech transcriptions
are found to predict holistic scores measuring
speaking proficiency. This suggests that struc-
tural events estimated on speech word strings
provide a potential way for assessing non-
native speech.
