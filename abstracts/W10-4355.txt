We develop a method to detect erroneous
interpretation results of user utterances
by exploiting utterance histories of indi-
vidual users in spoken dialogue systems
that were deployed for the general pub-
lic and repeatedly utilized. More specifi-
cally, we classify barge-in utterances into
correctly and erroneously interpreted ones
by using features of individual users? utter-
ance histories such as their barge-in rates
and estimated automatic speech recogni-
tion (ASR) accuracies. Online detection
is enabled by making these features ob-
tainable without any manual annotation
or labeling. We experimentally compare
classification accuracies for several cases
when an ASR confidence measure is used
alone or in combination with the features
based on the user?s utterance history. The
error reduction rate was 15% when the ut-
terance history was used.
