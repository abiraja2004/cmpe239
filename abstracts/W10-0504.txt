In  this  paper  we  propose  the  IR-LM
(Information  Retrieval  Language  Model)
which is an approach to carrying out language
modeling  based  on  large  volumes  of
constantly  changing  data  as  is  the  case  of
social  media  data.  Our  approach  addresses
specific  characteristics  of  social  data:   large
volume of constantly generated content as well
as  the  need  to  frequently  integrating  and
removing data from the model.
