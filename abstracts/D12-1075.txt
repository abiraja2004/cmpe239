Past work on learning part-of-speech taggers
from tag dictionaries and raw data has re-
ported good results, but the assumptions made
about those dictionaries are often unrealistic:
due to historical precedents, they assume ac-
cess to information about labels in the raw
and test sets. Here, we demonstrate ways to
learn hidden Markov model taggers from in-
complete tag dictionaries. Taking the MIN-
GREEDY algorithm (Ravi et al2010) as a
starting point, we improve it with several intu-
itive heuristics. We also define a simple HMM
emission initialization that takes advantage of
the tag dictionary and raw data to capture both
the openness of a given tag and its estimated
prevalence in the raw data. Altogether, our
augmentations produce improvements to per-
formance over the original MIN-GREEDY al-
gorithm for both English and Italian data.
