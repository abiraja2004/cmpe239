We present a novel, type-logical analysis of po-
larity sensitivity: how negative polarity items
(like any and ever) or positive ones (like some)
are licensed or prohibited. It takes not just
scopal relations but also linear order into ac-
count, using the programming-language no-
tions of delimited continuations and evaluation
order, respectively. It thus achieves greater em-
pirical coverage than previous proposals.
