This paper discusses a modular and open-
source focused crawler (ILSP-FC) for the
automatic acquisition of domain-specific
monolingual and bilingual corpora from
the Web. Besides describing the main
modules integrated in the crawler (dealing
with page fetching, normalization, clean-
ing, text classification, de-duplication and
document pair detection), we evaluate sev-
eral of the system functionalities in an ex-
periment for the acquisition of pairs of par-
allel documents in German and Italian for
the "Health & Safety at work" domain.
