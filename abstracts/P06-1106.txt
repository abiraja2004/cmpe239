This paper presents a hybrid approach
to question answering in the clinical
domain that combines techniques from
summarization and information retrieval.
We tackle a frequently-occurring class of
questions that takes the form ?What is
the best drug treatment for X?? Starting
from an initial set of MEDLINE citations,
our system first identifies the drugs un-
der study. Abstracts are then clustered us-
ing semantic classes from the UMLS on-
tology. Finally, a short extractive sum-
mary is generated for each abstract to pop-
ulate the clusters. Two evaluations?a
manual one focused on short answers and
an automatic one focused on the support-
ing abstracts?demonstrate that our sys-
tem compares favorably to PubMed, the
search system most widely used by physi-
cians today.
