 
Sentiment Analysis in Twitter has become an 
important task due to the huge user-generated 
content published over such media. Such 
analysis could be useful for many domains 
such as Marketing, Finance, Politics, and So-
cial. We propose to use many features in order 
to improve a trained classifier of Twitter mes-
sages; these features extend the feature vector 
of uni-gram model by the concepts extracted 
from DBpedia, the verb groups and the similar 
adjectives extracted from WordNet, the Senti-
features extracted using SentiWordNet and 
some useful domain specific features. We also 
built a dictionary for emotion icons, abbrevia-
tion and slang words in tweets which is useful 
before extending the tweets with different fea-
tures. Adding these features has improved the 
f-measure accuracy 2% with SVM and 4% 
with NaiveBayes.
