Named entity disambiguation concerns
linking a potentially ambiguous mention
of named entity in text to an unambigu-
ous identifier in a standard database. One
approach to this task is supervised classifi-
cation. However, the availability of train-
ing data is often limited, and the avail-
able data sets tend to be imbalanced and,
in some cases, heterogeneous. We pro-
pose a new method that distinguishes a
named entity by finding the informative
keywords in its surrounding context, and
then trains a model to predict whether each
keyword indicates the semantic class of
the entity. While maintaining a compara-
ble performance to supervised classifica-
tion, this method avoids using expensive
manually annotated data for each new do-
main, and thus achieves better portability.
