 
Aspect extraction is one of the key tasks in 
sentiment analysis. In recent years, statistical 
models have been used for the task. However, 
such models without any domain knowledge 
often produce aspects that are not interpreta-
ble in applications. To tackle the issue, some 
knowledge-based topic models have been 
proposed, which allow the user to input some 
prior domain knowledge to generate coherent 
aspects. However, existing knowledge-based 
topic models have several major shortcom-
ings, e.g., little work has been done to incor-
porate the cannot-link type of knowledge or 
to automatically adjust the number of topics 
based on domain knowledge. This paper pro-
poses a more advanced topic model, called 
MC-LDA (LDA with m-set and c-set), to ad-
dress these problems, which is based on an 
Extended generalized P?lya urn (E-GPU) 
model (which is also proposed in this paper).  
Experiments on real-life product reviews 
from a variety of domains show that MC-
LDA outperforms the existing state-of-the-art 
models markedly.
