 
Current graph-based approaches to auto-
matic text summarization, such as Le-
xRank and TextRank, assume a static 
graph which does not model how the in-
put texts emerge. A suitable evolutionary 
text graph model may impart a better un-
derstanding of the texts and improve the 
summarization process. We propose a 
timestamped graph (TSG) model that is 
motivated by human writing and reading 
processes, and show how text units in this 
model emerge over time. In our model, 
the graphs used by LexRank and Tex-
tRank are specific instances of our time-
stamped graph with particular parameter 
settings. We apply timestamped graphs on 
the standard DUC multi-document text 
summarization task and achieve compara-
ble results to the state of the art.
