Spoken dialog systems frameworks fill a cru-
cial role in the spoken dialog systems com-
munity by providing resources to lower bar-
riers to entry. However, different user groups
have different requirements and expectations

ticular needs for spoken dialog systems toolk-
its within an instructional setting. We discuss
the challenges for existing systems in meet-
ing these needs and propose strategies to over-
come them.
