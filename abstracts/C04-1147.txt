We present a framework for the fast compu-
tation of lexical affinity models. The frame-
work is composed of a novel algorithm to effi-
ciently compute the co-occurrence distribution
between pairs of terms, an independence model,
and a parametric affinity model. In compari-
son with previous models, which either use ar-
bitrary windows to compute similarity between
words or use lexical affinity to create sequential
models, in this paper we focus on models in-
tended to capture the co-occurrence patterns of
any pair of words or phrases at any distance in
the corpus. The framework is flexible, allowing
fast adaptation to applications and it is scalable.
We apply it in combination with a terabyte cor-
pus to answer natural language tests, achieving
encouraging results.
