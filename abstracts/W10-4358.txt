In this paper, which addresses smooth spo-
ken interaction between human users and
conversational agents, we present an ex-
perimental study that evaluates a method
for user-adaptive coordination of agent
communicative behavior. Our method
adapts the pause duration preceding agent
utterances and the agent gaze duration to
reduce the discomfort perceived by indi-
vidual users during interaction. The exper-
imental results showed a statistically sig-
nificant tendency: the duration of the agent
pause and the gaze converged during inter-
action with the method. The method also
significantly improved the perceived rele-
vance of the agent communicative behav-
ior.
