In this paper we present a statistical translit-
eration technique that is language indepen-
dent. This technique uses Hidden Markov
Model (HMM) alignment and Conditional
Random Fields (CRF), a discriminative
model. HMM alignment maximizes the
probability of the observed (source, target)
word pairs using the expectation maximiza-
tion algorithm and then the character level
alignments (n-gram) are set to maximum
posterior predictions of the model. CRF
has efficient training and decoding processes
which is conditioned on both source and
target languages and produces globally op-
timal solutions. We apply this technique
for Hindi-English transliteration task. The
results show that our technique perfoms
better than the existing transliteration sys-
tem which uses HMM alignment and con-
ditional probabilities derived from counting
the alignments.
