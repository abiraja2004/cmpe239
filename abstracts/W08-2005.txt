This paper presents a method for seman-
tic classi?cation of onomatopoetic words
like ??????? (hum)? and ????
??? (clip clop)? which exist in ev-
ery language, especially Japanese being
rich in onomatopoetic words. We used
a graph-based clustering algorithm called
Newman clustering. The algorithm cal-
culates a simple quality function to test
whether a particular division is meaning-
ful. The quality function is calculated
based on the weights of edges between
nodes. We combined two different sim-
ilarity measures, distributional similarity,
and orthographic similarity to calculate
weights. The results obtained by using
the Web data showed a 9.0% improvement
over the baseline single distributional sim-
ilarity measure.
