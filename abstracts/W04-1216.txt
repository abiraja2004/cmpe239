 
Although there exists a huge number of 
biomedical texts online, there is a lack of tools 
good enough to help people get information or 
knowledge from them. Named entity 
Recognition (NER) becomes very important 
for further processing like information 
retrieval, information extraction and 
knowledge discovery. We introduce a Hidden 
Markov Model (HMM) for NER, with a word 
similarity-based smoothing. Our experiment 
shows that the word similarity-based 
smoothing can improve the performance by 
using huge unlabeled data. While many 
systems have laboriously hand-coded rules for 
all kinds of word features, we show that word 
similarity is a potential method to 
automatically get word formation, prefix, 
suffix and abbreviation information 
automatically from biomedical texts, as well 
as useful word distribution information.
