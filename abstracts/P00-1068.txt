As an application of NLP to
computer-assisted language learn-
ing(CALL) , we propose a diag-
nostic processing of Japanese be-
ing able to detect errors and inap-
propriateness of sentences composed
by the students in the given situ-
ation and the context of the exer-
cise texts. Using LTAG(Lexicalized
Tree Adjoining Grammar) formal-
ism, we have implemented a proto-
type of such a diagnostic parser as a
component of a CALL system being
developed.
