 
Abstract Stub This paper talks about a new 
approach to     recognize named entities for 
Indian languages. Phonetic matching tech-
nique is used to match the strings of differ-
ent languages on the basis of their similar 
sounding property. We have tested our sys-
tem with a comparable corpus of English 
and Hindi language data. This approach is 
language independent and requires only a 
set of rules appropriate for a language.
