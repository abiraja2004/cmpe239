This paper describes the machine learning
algorithm and the features used by LIMSI
for the Quality Estimation Shared Task.
Our submission mainly aims at evaluating
the usefulness for quality estimation of n-
gram posterior probabilities that quantify
the probability for a given n-gram to be
part of the system output.
