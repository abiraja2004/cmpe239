In this paper we propose a new graph-
based method that uses the knowledge in
a LKB (based on WordNet) in order to
perform unsupervised Word Sense Disam-
biguation. Our algorithm uses the full
graph of the LKB efficiently, performing
better than previous approaches in English
all-words datasets. We also show that the
algorithm can be easily ported to other lan-
guages with good results, with the only re-
quirement of having a wordnet. In addi-
tion, we make an analysis of the perfor-
mance of the algorithm, showing that it is
efficient and that it could be tuned to be
faster.
