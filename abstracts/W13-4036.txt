This paper describes a new approach to
automatic learning of strategies for social
multi-user human-robot interaction. Us-
ing the example of a robot bartender that
tracks multiple customers, takes their or-
ders, and serves drinks, we propose a
model consisting of a Social State Recog-
niser (SSR) which processes audio-visual
input and maintains a model of the social
state, together with a Social Skills Execu-
tor (SSE) which takes social state updates
from the SSR as input and generates robot
responses as output. The SSE is modelled
as two connected Markov Decision Pro-
cesses (MDPs) with action selection poli-
cies that are jointly optimised in interaction
with a Multi-User Simulation Environment
(MUSE). The SSR and SSE have been in-
tegrated in the robot bartender system and
evaluated with human users in hand-coded
and trained SSE policy variants. The re-
sults indicate that the trained policy out-
performed the hand-coded policy in terms
of both subjective (+18%) and objective
(+10.5%) task success.
