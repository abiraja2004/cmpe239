We present a sentence compression system based
on synchronous context-free grammars (SCFG),
following the successful noisy-channel approach
of (Knight and Marcu, 2000). We define a head-
driven Markovization formulation of SCFG dele-
tion rules, which allows us to lexicalize probabili-
ties of constituent deletions. We also use a robust
approach for tree-to-tree alignment between arbi-
trary document-abstract parallel corpora, which lets
us train lexicalized models with much more data
than previous approaches relying exclusively on
scarcely available document-compression corpora.
Finally, we evaluate different Markovized models,
and find that our selected best model is one that ex-
ploits head-modifier bilexicalization to accurately
distinguish adjuncts from complements, and that
produces sentences that were judged more gram-
matical than those generated by previous work.
