 
Terminology development in education, 
science and technology is a key to formu-
lating a knowledge society. The authors 
are developing a multilingual engineering 
terminology dictionary consisting of more 
than ten thousand engineering terms each 
for ten Asian languages and English. The 
dictionary is primarily designed to support 
foreign students who are studying engi-
neering subjects at Japanese higher educa-
tional institutions in the Japanese language. 
Analysis of the lexical terms could provide 
useful knowledge for language resource 
creators. There are two adoption ap-
proaches, ?phonetic adoption? (translitera-
tion of borrowed terms) and ?semantic 
adoption? (where the meaning is expressed 
using native words). The proportion of the 
two options found in the terminology set of 
each country (or language) shows a sub-
stantial difference and seems to reflecti 
language policies of the country and the in-
fluence of foreign languages on the host 
language. This paper presents preliminary 
results of our investigation on this question 
based on a comparative study of three lan-
guages: Japanese, Vietnamese and Thai.
