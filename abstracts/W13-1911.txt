We present a set of new measures designed
to reveal latent information of language
use in children at the lexico-syntactic
level. We used these metrics to analyze
linguistic patterns in spontaneous narra-
tives from children developing typically
and children identified as having a lan-
guage impairment. We observed signif-
icant differences in the z-scores of both
populations for most of the metrics. These
findings suggest we can use these metrics
to aid in the task of language assessment
in children.
