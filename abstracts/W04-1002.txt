Information graphics (non-pictorial graphics such
as bar charts or line graphs) are an important
component of multimedia documents. Often such
graphics convey information that is not contained
elsewhere in the document. Thus document summa-
rization must be extended to include summarization
of information graphics. This paper addresses our
work on graphic summarization. It argues that the
message that the graphic designer intended to con-
vey must play a major role in determining the con-
tent of the summary, and it outlines our approach
to identifying this intended message and using it to
construct the summary.
