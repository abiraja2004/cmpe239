Syntactic parsing requires a fine balance
between expressivity and complexity, so
that naturally occurring structures can be
accurately parsed without compromising
efficiency. In dependency-based parsing,
several constraints have been proposed that
restrict the class of permissible structures,
such as projectivity, planarity, multi-pla-
narity, well-nestedness, gap degree, and
edge degree. While projectivity is gener-
ally taken to be too restrictive for natural
language syntax, it is not clear which of the
other proposals strikes the best balance be-
tween expressivity and complexity. In this
paper, we review and compare the different
constraints theoretically, and provide an ex-
perimental evaluation using data from two
treebanks, investigating how large a propor-
tion of the structures found in the treebanks
are permitted under different constraints.
The results indicate that a combination of
the well-nestedness constraint and a para-
metric constraint on discontinuity gives a
very good fit with the linguistic data.
