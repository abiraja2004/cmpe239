 
We present our work in generating Karmina, 
an old Malay poetic form for Indonesian lan-
guage. Karmina is a poem with two lines that 
consists of a hook (sampiran) on the first line 
and a message on the second line. One of the 
unique aspects of Karmina is in the absence of 
discourse relation between its hook and mes-
sage. We approached the problem by generat-
ing the hooks and the messages in separate 
processes using predefined schemas and a 
manually built knowledge base. The Karminas 
were produced by randomly pairing the mes-
sages with the hooks, subject to the con-
straints imposed on the rhymes and on the 
structure similarity. Syllabifications were per-
formed on the cue words of the hooks and 
messages to ensure the generated pairs have 
matching rhymes. We were able to generate a 
number of positive examples while still leav-
ing room for improvement, particularly in the 
generation of the messages, which currently 
are still limited, and in filtering the negative 
results.
