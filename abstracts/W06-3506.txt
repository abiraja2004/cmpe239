Metaphors are ubiquitous in language and
developing methods to identify and deal
with metaphors is an open problem in
Natural Language Processing (NLP). In
this paper we describe results from us-
ing a maximum entropy (ME) classifier
to identify metaphors. Using the Wall
Street Journal (WSJ) corpus, we anno-
tated all the verbal targets associated with
a set of frames which includes frames of
spatial motion, manipulation, and health.
One surprising finding was that over 90%
of annotated targets from these frames
are used metaphorically, underscoring the
importance of processing figurative lan-
guage. We then used this labeled data and
each verbal target?s PropBank annotation
to train a maximum entropy classifier to
make this literal vs. metaphoric distinc-
tion. Using the classifier, we reduce the
final error in the test set by 5% over the
verb-specific majority class baseline and
31% over the corpus-wide majority class
baseline.
