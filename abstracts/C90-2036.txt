 
This paper describes a new program, correct, 
which takes words rejected by the Unix? spell 
program, proposes a list of candidate corrections, 
and sorts them by probability. The probability 
scores are the novel contribution of this work. 
Probabilities are based on a noisy channel model. 
It is assumed that the typist knows what words 
he or she wants to type but some noise is added 
on the way to the keyboard (in the form of typos 
and spelling errors). Using a classic Bayesian 
argument of the kind that is popular in the 
speech recognition literature (Jelinek, 1985), one 
can often recover the intended correction, c, from 
a typo, t, by finding the correction c that 
maximizes Pr (c )Pr ( t l c ) .  The first factor, 
Pr(c), is a prior model of word probabilities; the 
second factor, Pr(t\[c), is a model of the noisy 
channel that accounts for spelling 
transformations on letter sequences (e.g., 
insertions, deletions, substitutions and reversals). 
Both sets of probabilities were trained on data 
collected from the Associated Press (AP) 
newswire. This text is ideally suited for this 
purpose since it contains a large number of typos 
(about wo thousand per month).
