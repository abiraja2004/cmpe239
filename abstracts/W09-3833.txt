We present an approach for smoothing
treebank-PCFG lexicons by interpolating
treebank lexical parameter estimates with
estimates obtained from unannotated data
via the Inside-outside algorithm. The
PCFG has complex lexical categories,
making relative-frequency estimates from
a treebank very sparse. This kind of
smoothing for complex lexical categories
results in improved parsing performance,
with a particular advantage in identify-
ing obligatory arguments subcategorized
by verbs unseen in the treebank.
