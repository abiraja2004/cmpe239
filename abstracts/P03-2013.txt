 
This paper describes our preliminary at-
tempt to automatically recognize zero ad-
nominals, a subgroup of zero pronouns, in 
Japanese discourse.  Based on the corpus 
study, we define and classify what we call 
?argument-taking nouns (ATNs),? i.e., 
nouns that can appear with zero adnomi-
nals.  We propose an ATN recognition al-
gorithm that consists of lexicon-based 
heuristics, drawn from the observations of 
our analysis.  We finally present the result 
of the algorithm evaluation and discuss 
future directions.
