In this paper, we present initial experi-
ments in the recognition of deceptive lan-
guage. We introduce three data sets of true
and lying texts collected for this purpose,
and we show that automatic classification
is a viable technique to distinguish be-
tween truth and falsehood as expressed in
language. We also introduce a method for
class-based feature analysis, which sheds
some light on the features that are charac-
teristic for deceptive text.
You should not trust the devil, even if he tells the truth.
