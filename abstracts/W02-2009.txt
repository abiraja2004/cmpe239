  
We present a method for identifying 
corresponding themes across several corpora 
that are focused on related, but distinct, 
domains. This task is approached through 
simultaneous clustering of keyword sets 
extracted from the analyzed corpora.  Our 
algorithm extends the information-
bottleneck soft clustering method for a 
suitable setting consisting of several 
datasets.  Experimentation with topical 
corpora reveals similar aspects of three 
distinct religions.  The evaluation is by way 
of comparison to clusters constructed 
manually by an expert.
