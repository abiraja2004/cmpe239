This paper describes the joint submission
of two systems to the all-words WSD sub-
task of SemEval-2007 task 17. The main
goal of this work was to build a competitive
unsupervised system by combining hetero-
geneous algorithms. As a secondary goal,
we explored the integration of unsupervised
predictions into a supervised system by dif-
ferent means.
