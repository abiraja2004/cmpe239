 
In this paper we discuss the performance 
of a text-based classification approach by 
comparing different types of features. We 
consider the automatic classification of 
gene names from the molecular biology 
literature, by using a support-vector ma-
chine method. Classification features 
range from words, lemmas and stems, to 
automatically extracted terms. Also, sim-
ple co-occurrences of genes within docu-
ments are considered. The preliminary 
experiments performed on a set of 3,000 
S. cerevisiae gene names and 53,000 
Medline abstracts have shown that using 
domain-specific terms can improve the 
performance compared to the standard 
bag-of-words approach, in particular for 
genes classified with higher confidence, 
and for under-represented classes.
