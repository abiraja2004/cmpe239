Robustness is a key requirement in spoken lan-
guage understanding (SLU) systems. Human
speech is often ungrammatical and ill-formed,
and there will frequently be a mismatch be-
tween training and test data. This paper dis-
cusses robustness and adaptation issues in a
statistically-based SLU system which is en-
tirely data-driven. To test robustness, the sys-
tem has been tested on data from the Air Travel
Information Service (ATIS) domain which has
been artificially corrupted with varying levels
of additive noise. Although the speech recog-
nition performance degraded steadily, the sys-
tem did not fail catastrophically. Indeed, the
rate at which the end-to-end performance of
the complete system degraded was significantly
slower than that of the actual recognition com-
ponent. In a second set of experiments, the
ability to rapidly adapt the core understanding
component of the system to a different appli-
cation within the same broad domain has been
tested. Using only a small amount of training
data, experiments have shown that a semantic
parser based on the Hidden Vector State (HVS)
model originally trained on the ATIS corpus
can be straightforwardly adapted to the some-
what different DARPA Communicator task us-
ing standard adaptation algorithms. The paper
concludes by suggesting that the results pre-
sented provide initial support to the claim that
an SLU system which is statistically-based and
trained entirely from data is intrinsically robust
and can be readily adapted to new applications.
