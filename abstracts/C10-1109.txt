 
The interpretation of a multiple-domain 
text corpus as a single ontology leads to 
misconceptions. This is because some 
concepts may be syntactically equal; 
though, they are semantically lopsided in 
different domains. Also, the occurrences 
of a domain concept in a large multiple-
domain corpus may not gauge correctly 
the concept significance. This paper 
tackles the mentioned problems and pro-
poses a novel ontology builder to extract 
separate domain specific ontologies from 
such a corpus. The builder contribution is 
to sustain each domain specific concepts 
and relations to get precise answers for 
user questions. We extend a single ontol-
ogy builder named Text2Onto to apply 
our thought. We fruitfully enhance it to 
answer, more precisely, questions on a 
subset of AQUAINT corpus.
