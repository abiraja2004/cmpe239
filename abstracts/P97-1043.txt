 
Results of computational complexity exist for 
a wide range of phrase structure-based gram- 
mar formalisms, while there is an apparent 
lack of such results for dependency-based for-
malisms. We here adapt a result on the com- 
plexity of ID/LP-grammars tothe dependency 
framework. Contrary to previous tudies on 
heavily restricted ependency grammars, we 
prove that recognition (and thus, parsing) of 
linguistically adequate dependency grammars 
is~A/T'-complete.
