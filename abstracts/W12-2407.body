In the English clinical and biomedical text do-
mains, negation and certainty usage are two
well-studied phenomena. However, few stud-
ies have made an in-depth characterization
of uncertainties expressed in a clinical set-
ting, and compared this between different an-
notation efforts. This preliminary, qualita-
tive study attempts to 1) create a clinical un-
certainty and negation taxonomy, 2) develop
a translation map to convert annotation la-
bels from an English schema into a Swedish
schema, and 3) characterize and compare two
data sets using this taxonomy. We define
a clinical uncertainty and negation taxonomy
and a translation map for converting annota-
tion labels between two schemas and report
observed similarities and differences between
the two data sets.
