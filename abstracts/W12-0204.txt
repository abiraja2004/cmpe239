 
Each expanding and developing system 
requires some feedback to evaluate the 
normal trends of the system and also the 
unsystematic steps. In this paper two lexical-
semantic databases ? Princeton WordNet 
(PrWN) and Estonian Wordnet (EstWN)- are 
being examined from the visualization point 
of view. The visualization method is 
described and the aim is to find and to point 
to possible problems of synsets and their 
semantic relations.
