The IDEX system is a prototype of an interactive dynamic Information Extraction (IE) system. A user of the system
expresses an information request in the form of a topic description, which is used for an initial search in order to retrieve
a relevant set of documents. On basis of this set of documents, unsupervised relation extraction and clustering is done by
the system. The results of these operations can then be interactively inspected by the user. In this paper we describe the
relation extraction and clustering components of the IDEX system. Preliminary evaluation results of these components are
presented and an overview is given of possible enhancements to improve the relation extraction and clustering components.
