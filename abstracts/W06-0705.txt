This paper describes a novel framework
for using scenario knowledge in open-
domain Question Answering (Q/A) appli-
cations that uses a state-of-the-art textual
entailment system (Hickl et al, 2006b) in
order to discover textual information rele-
vant to the set of topics associated with a
scenario description. An intrinsic and an
extrinsic evaluation of this method is pre-
sented in the context of an automatic Q/A
system and results from several user sce-
narios are discussed.
