The optimal combination of language model
(LM) and language understanding model
(LUM) varies depending on available training
data and utterances to be handled. Usually, a
lot of effort and time are needed to find the op-
timal combination. Instead, we have designed
and developed a new framework that uses
multiple LMs and LUMs to improve speech
understanding accuracy under various situa-
tions. As one implementation of the frame-
work, we have developed a method for select-
ing the most appropriate speech understand-
ing result from several candidates. We use
two LMs and three LUMs, and thus obtain six
combinations of them. We empirically show
that our method improves speech understand-
ing accuracy. The performance of the oracle
selection suggests further potential improve-
ments in our system.
