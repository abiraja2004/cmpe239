 
This paper presents a maximum entropy 
method for the disambiguation of word 
senses as defined in HowNet. With the 
release of this bilingual (Chinese and 
English) knowledge base in 1999, a corpus 
of 30,000 words was sense tagged and 
released in January 2002. Concepts 
meanings in HowNet are constructed by a 
closed set of sememes, the smallest meaning 
units, which can be treated as semantic tags. 
The maximum entropy model treats 
semantic tags like parts-of-speech tags and 
achieves an overall accuracy of 89.39%, 
outperforming a baseline system, which 
picks the most frequent sense.
