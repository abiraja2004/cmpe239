Most coreference resolution models determine
if two mentions are coreferent using a single
function over a set of constraints or features.
This approach can lead to incorrect decisions
as lower precision features often overwhelm
the smaller number of high precision ones. To
overcome this problem, we propose a simple
coreference architecture based on a sieve that
applies tiers of deterministic coreference mod-
els one at a time from highest to lowest preci-
sion. Each tier builds on the previous tier?s
entity cluster output. Further, our model prop-
agates global information by sharing attributes
(e.g., gender and number) across mentions in
the same cluster. This cautious sieve guar-
antees that stronger features are given prece-
dence over weaker ones and that each deci-
sion is made using all of the information avail-
able at the time. The framework is highly
modular: new coreference modules can be
plugged in without any change to the other
modules. In spite of its simplicity, our ap-
proach outperforms many state-of-the-art su-
pervised and unsupervised models on several
standard corpora. This suggests that sieve-
based approaches could be applied to other
NLP tasks.
