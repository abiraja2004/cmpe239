QACIAD (Question Answering Chal-
lenge for Information Access Dialogue)
is an evaluation framework for measur-
ing interactive question answering (QA)
technologies. It assumes that users inter-
actively collect information using a QA
system for writing a report on a given
topic and evaluates, among other things,
the capabilities needed under such cir-
cumstances. This paper reports an ex-
periment for examining the assumptions
made by QACIAD. In this experiment, di-
alogues under the situation that QACIAD
assumes are collected using WoZ (Wiz-
ard of Oz) simulating, which is frequently
used for collecting dialogue data for de-
signing speech dialogue systems, and then
analyzed. The results indicate that the set-
ting of QACIAD is real and appropriate
and that one of the important capabilities
for future interactive QA systems is pro-
viding cooperative and helpful responses.
