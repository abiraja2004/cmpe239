Though data-driven in nature, emotion analy-
sis based on latent semantic analysis still relies
on some measure of expert knowledge in or-
der to isolate the emotional keywords or key-
sets necessary to the construction of affective
categories. This makes it vulnerable to any
discrepancy between the ensuing taxonomy of
affective states and the underlying domain of
discourse. This paper proposes a more gen-
eral strategy which leverages two distincts se-
mantic levels, one that encapsulates the foun-
dations of the domain considered, and one that
specifically accounts for the overall affective
fabric of the language. Exposing the emergent
relationship between these two levels advan-
tageously informs the emotion classification
process. Empirical evidence suggests that this
is a promising solution for automatic emotion
detection in text.
