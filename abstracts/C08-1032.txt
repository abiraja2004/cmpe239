In contrast to LFG and HPSG, there is to
date no large scale Tree Adjoining Gram-
mar (TAG) equiped with a compositional
semantics. In this paper, we report on
the integration of a unification-based se-
mantics into a Feature-Based Lexicalised
TAG for French consisting of around 6 000
trees. We focus on verb semantics and
show how factorisation can be used to sup-
port a compact and principled encoding of
the semantic information that needs to be
associated with each of the verbal elemen-
tary trees. The factorisation is made possi-
ble by the use of XMG, a high-level linguis-
tic formalism designed to specify and com-
pile computational grammars and in partic-
ular, grammars based on non-local trees or
tree descriptions.
