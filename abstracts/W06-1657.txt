We present an investigation of recently
proposed character and word sequence
kernels for the task of authorship attribu-
tion based on relatively short texts. Per-
formance is compared with two corre-
sponding probabilistic approaches based
on Markov chains. Several configurations
of the sequence kernels are studied on a
relatively large dataset (50 authors), where
each author covered several topics. Utilis-
ing Moffat smoothing, the two probabilis-
tic approaches obtain similar performance,
which in turn is comparable to that of char-
acter sequence kernels and is better than
that of word sequence kernels. The results
further suggest that when using a realistic
setup that takes into account the case of
texts which are not written by any hypoth-
esised authors, the amount of training ma-
terial has more influence on discrimination
performance than the amount of test mate-
rial. Moreover, we show that the recently
proposed author unmasking approach is
less useful when dealing with short texts.
