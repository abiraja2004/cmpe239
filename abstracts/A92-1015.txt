 
This paper presents a system which detects and 
corrects morpho-syntactic errors in Dutch texts. It 
includes aspelling corrector and a shift-reduce 
parser for Augmented Context-free Grammars. 
The spelling corrector isbased on trigram and 
triphone analysis. The parser is an extension of 
the well-known Tomita algorithm (Tomita, 1986). 
The parser interacts with the spelling corrector 
and handles certain types of structural errors. 
Both modules have been integrated with a 
compound analyzer and a dictionary of 275,000 
word forms into a program for stand-alone 
proof-reading ofDutch texts on a large scale. The 
system is in its final testing phase and will be 
commercially available as from 1992.
