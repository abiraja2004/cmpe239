 
In this paper we introduce a modal lan- 
guage L T for imposing constraints on trees, 
and an extension LT(L r) for imposing con- 
straints on trees decorated with feature 
structures. The motivation for introducing 
these languages is to provide tools for for- 
malising grammatical frameworks perspic- 
uously, and the paper illustrates this by 
showing how the leading ideas of GPS6 can 
be captured in LT(LF). 
In addition, the role of modal languages 
(and in particular, what we have called 
layered modal anguages) as constraint for- 
malisms for linguistic theorising is discussed 
in some detail.
