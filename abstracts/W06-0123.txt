 
This paper describes our word segmenta-
tion system and named entity recognition 
(NER) system for participating in the 
third SIGHAN Bakeoff. Both of them are 
based on character tagging, but use dif-
ferent tag sets and different features. 
Evaluation results show that our word 
segmentation system achieved 93.3% and 
94.7% F-score in UPUC and MSRA open 
tests, and our NER system got 70.84% 
and 81.32% F-score in LDC and MSRA 
open tests.
