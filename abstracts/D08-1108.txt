We present a novel method for discovering
and modeling the relationship between in-
formal Chinese expressions (including collo-
quialisms and instant-messaging slang) and
their formal equivalents. Specifically, we pro-
posed a bootstrapping procedure to identify
a list of candidate informal phrases in web
corpora. Given an informal phrase, we re-
trieve contextual instances from the web us-
ing a search engine, generate hypotheses of
formal equivalents via this data, and rank
the hypotheses using a conditional log-linear
model. In the log-linear model, we incorpo-
rate as feature functions both rule-based intu-
itions and data co-occurrence phenomena (ei-
ther as an explicit or indirect definition, or
through formal/informal usages occurring in
free variation in a discourse). We test our
system on manually collected test examples,
and find that the (formal-informal) relation-
ship discovery and extraction process using
our method achieves an average 1-best preci-
sion of 62%. Given the ubiquity of informal
conversational style on the internet, this work
has clear applications for text normalization
in text-processing systems including machine
translation aspiring to broad coverage.
