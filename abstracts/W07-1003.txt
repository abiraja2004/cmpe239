This paper investigates the roles of named
entities (NE?s) in annotated biomedical text
classification. In the annotation schema of
BioCaster, a text mining system for pub-
lic health protection, important concepts that
reflect information about infectious diseases
were conceptually analyzed with a formal
ontological methodology. Concepts were
classified as Types, while others were iden-
tified as being Roles. Types are specified
as NE classes and Roles are integrated into
NEs as attributes. We focus on the Roles
of NEs by extracting and using them in
different ways as features in the classifier.
Experimental results show that: 1) Roles
for each NE greatly helped improve perfor-
mance of the system, 2) combining informa-
tion about NE classes with their Roles con-
tribute significantly to the improvement of
performance. We discuss in detail the effect
of each Role on the accuracy of text classifi-
cation.
