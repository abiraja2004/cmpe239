 
In this paper, we report on our experi-
ment to extract Chinese multiword ex-
pressions from corpus resources as part 
of a larger research effort to improve a 
machine translation (MT) system. For ex-
isting MT systems, the issue of multi-
word expression (MWE) identification 
and accurate interpretation from source to 
target language remains an unsolved 
problem. Our initial test on the Chinese-
to-English translation functions of 
Systran and CCID?s Huan-Yu-Tong MT 
systems reveal that, where MWEs are in-
volved, MT tools suffer in terms of both 
comprehensibility and adequacy of the 
translated texts. For MT systems to be-
come of further practical use, they need 
to be enhanced with MWE processing 
capability. As part of our study towards 
this goal, we test and evaluate a statistical 
tool, which was developed for English, 
for identifying and extracting Chinese 
MWEs. In our evaluation, the tool 
achieved precisions ranging from 61.16% 
to 93.96% for different types of MWEs.  
Such results demonstrate that it is feasi-
ble to automatically identify many Chi-
nese MWEs using our tool, although it 
needs further improvement.
