Abstract
This paper presents a novel approach to semantic role annotation implementing an entailment-
based view of the concept of semantic role. I propose to represent arguments of predicates with
grammatically relevant primitive properties entailed by the semantics of predicates. Such meaning
components generalise over a range of semantic relations which humans tend to express systemati-
cally through language. In a preliminary study, I show that we can model linguistic knowledge at a
general, principled syntax-semantics interface by incorporating a layer of skeletal, entailment-based
representation of word meaning in large-scale corpus annotation.
