We analyze adaptive model weight-
ing techniques for reranking using in-
stance scores obtained by L1 regular-
ized transductive regression. Compet-
itive statistical machine translation is
an on-line learning technique for se-
quential translation tasks where we
try to select the best among com-
peting statistical machine translators.
The competitive predictor assigns a
probability per model weighted by
the sequential performance. We de-
fine additive, multiplicative, and loss-
based weight updates with exponential
loss functions for competitive statisti-
cal machine translation. Without any
pre-knowledge of the performance of
the translation models, we succeed in
achieving the performance of the best
model in all systems and surpass their
performance in most of the language
pairs we considered.
