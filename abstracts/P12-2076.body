This paper presents grammar error correction
for Japanese particles that uses discrimina-
tive sequence conversion, which corrects erro-
neous particles by substitution, insertion, and
deletion. The error correction task is hindered
by the difficulty of collecting large error cor-
pora. We tackle this problem by using pseudo-
error sentences generated automatically. Fur-
thermore, we apply domain adaptation, the
pseudo-error sentences are from the source
domain, and the real-error sentences are from
the target domain. Experiments show that sta-
ble improvement is achieved by using domain
adaptation.
