We propose CMSMs, a novel type of
generic compositional models for syntac-
tic and semantic aspects of natural lan-
guage, based on matrix multiplication. We
argue for the structural and cognitive plau-
sibility of this model and show that it is
able to cover and combine various com-
mon compositional NLP approaches rang-
ing from statistical word space models to
symbolic grammar formalisms.
