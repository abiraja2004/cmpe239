We develop a method for effective extraction
of linguistic patterns that are differentially ex-
pressed based on the native language of the
author. This method uses multiple corpora
to allow for the removal of data set specific
patterns, and addresses both feature relevancy
and redundancy. We evaluate different rel-
evancy ranking metrics and show that com-
mon measures of relevancy can be inappro-
priate for data with many rare features. Our
feature set is a broad class of syntactic pat-
terns, and to better capture the signal we ex-
tend the Bayesian Tree Substitution Grammar
induction algorithm to a supervised mixture of
latent grammars. We show that this extension
can be used to extract a larger set of relevant
features.
