The question of how to compose meaning in distributional representations of meaning has re-
cently been recognised as a central issue in computational linguistics. In this paper we describe
three general and powerful tools that can be used to describe composition in distributional seman-
tics: quotient algebras, learning of finite dimensional algebras, and the construction of algebras from
semigroups.
