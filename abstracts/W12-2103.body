We present an approach to detecting hate
speech in online text, where hate speech is
defined as abusive speech targeting specific
group characteristics, such as ethnic origin, re-
ligion, gender, or sexual orientation. While
hate speech against any group may exhibit
some common characteristics, we have ob-
served that hatred against each different group
is typically characterized by the use of a small
set of high frequency stereotypical words;
however, such words may be used in either
a positive or a negative sense, making our
task similar to that of words sense disambigua-
tion. In this paper we describe our definition
of hate speech, the collection and annotation
of our hate speech corpus, and a mechanism
for detecting some commonly used methods
of evading common ?dirty word? filters. We
describe pilot classification experiments in
which we classify anti-semitic speech reach-
ing an accuracy 94%, precision of 68% and
recall at 60%, for an F1 measure of .6375.
