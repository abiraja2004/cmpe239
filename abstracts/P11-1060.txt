Compositional question answering begins by
mapping questions to logical forms, but train-
ing a semantic parser to perform this mapping
typically requires the costly annotation of the
target logical forms. In this paper, we learn
to map questions to answers via latent log-
ical forms, which are induced automatically
from question-answer pairs. In tackling this
challenging learning problem, we introduce a
new semantic representation which highlights
a parallel between dependency syntax and effi-
cient evaluation of logical forms. On two stan-
dard semantic parsing benchmarks (GEO and
JOBS), our system obtains the highest pub-
lished accuracies, despite requiring no anno-
tated logical forms.
