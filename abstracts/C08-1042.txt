This paper explores the relationship be-
tween various measures of unsupervised
part-of-speech tag induction and the per-
formance of both supervised and unsuper-
vised parsing models trained on induced
tags. We find that no standard tagging
metrics correlate well with unsupervised
parsing performance, and several metrics
grounded in information theory have no
strong relationship with even supervised
parsing performance.
