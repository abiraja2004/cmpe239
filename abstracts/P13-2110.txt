 
For the cascaded task of Chinese word seg-
mentation, POS tagging and parsing, the pipe-
line approach suffers from error propagation 
while the joint learning approach suffers from 
inefficient decoding due to the large combined 
search space. In this paper, we present a novel 
lattice-based framework in which a Chinese 
sentence is first segmented into a word lattice, 
and then a lattice-based POS tagger and a lat-
tice-based parser are used to process the lattice 
from two different viewpoints: sequential POS 
tagging and hierarchical tree building. A strat-
egy is designed to exploit the complementary 
strengths of the tagger and parser, and encour-
age them to predict agreed structures. Experi-
mental results on Chinese Treebank show that 
our lattice-based framework significantly im-
proves the accuracy of the three sub-tasks.
