Automatic text extraction techniques
have proved robust, but very often their
summaries are not coherent. In this
paper, we propose a new extraction
method which uses local coherence as a
means to improve the overall quality of
automatic summaries. Two algorithms
for sentence selection are proposed
and evaluated on scientific documents.
Evaluation showed that the method
ameliorates the quality of summaries,
noticeable improvements being obtained
for longer summaries produced by an
algorithm which selects sentences using
an evolutionary algorithm.
