The linguistic annotation of noun-verb com-
plex predicates (also termed as light verb con-
structions) is challenging as these predicates
are highly productive in Hindi. For semantic
role labelling, each argument of the noun-verb
complex predicate must be given a role la-
bel. For complex predicates, frame files need
to be created specifying the role labels for
each noun-verb complex predicate. The cre-
ation of frame files is usually done manually,
but we propose an automatic method to expe-
dite this process. We use two resources for
this method: Hindi PropBank frame files for
simple verbs and the annotated Hindi Tree-
bank. Our method perfectly predicts 65% of
the roles in 3015 unique noun-verb combi-
nations, with an additional 22% partial pre-
dictions, giving us 87% useful predictions to
build our annotation resource.
