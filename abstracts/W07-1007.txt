We present a corpus-driven method for
building a lexicon of semantically equiva-
lent pairs of technical and lay medical terms.
Using a parallel corpus of abstracts of clin-
ical studies and corresponding news sto-
ries written for a lay audience, we identify
terms which are good semantic equivalents
of technical terms for a lay audience. Our
method relies on measures of association.
Results show that, despite the small size of
our corpus, a promising number of pairs are
identified.
