This paper describes a graph-based unsu-
pervised system for induction and clas-
sification. The system performs a two
stage graph based clustering where a co-
occurrence graph is first clustered to com-
pute similarities against contexts. The con-
text similarity matrix is pruned and the re-
sulting associated graph is clustered again
by means of a random-walk type algorithm.
The system relies on a set of parameters that
have been tuned to fit the corpus data. The
system has participated in tasks 2 and 13
of the SemEval-2007 competition, on word
sense induction and Web people search, re-
spectively, with mixed results.
