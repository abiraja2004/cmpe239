This paper addresses recent progress in
speaker-independent, large vocabulary,
continuous speech recognition, which
has opened up a wide range of near and
mid-term applications. One rapidly ex-
panding application area is the process-
ing of broadcast audio for information
access. At LIMSI, broadcast news tran-
scription systems have been developed
for English, French, German, Mandarin
and Portuguese, and systems for other
languages are under development. Au-
dio indexation must take into account
the specificities of audio data, such as
needing to deal with the continuous
data stream and an imperfect word tran-
scription. Some near-term applications
areas are audio data mining, selective
dissemination of information and me-
dia monitoring.
