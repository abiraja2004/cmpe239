 
The goal of the on-going project de-
scribed in this paper is evaluation of the 
utility of Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) 
for unsupervised word sense discrimina-
tion. The hypothesis is that LSA can be 
used to compute context vectors for am-
biguous words that can be clustered to-
gether ? with each cluster corresponding 
to a different sense of the word. In this 
paper we report first experimental result 
on tightness, separation and purity of 
sense-based clusters as a function of vec-
tor space dimensionality and using differ-
ent distance metrics.
