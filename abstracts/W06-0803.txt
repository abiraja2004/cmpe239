Assume that you are looking for informa-
tion about a particular person. A search
engine returns many pages for that per-
son?s name. Some of these pages may
be on other people with the same name.
One method to reduce the ambiguity in the
query and filter out the irrelevant pages, is
by adding a phrase that uniquely identi-
fies the person we are interested in from
his/her namesakes. We propose an un-
supervised algorithm that extracts such
phrases from the Web. We represent each
document by a term-entity model and clus-
ter the documents using a contextual sim-
ilarity metric. We evaluate the algorithm
on a dataset of ambiguous names. Our
method outperforms baselines, achieving
over 80% accuracy and significantly re-
duces the ambiguity in a web search task.
