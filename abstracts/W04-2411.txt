Semantic similarity measures have focused on
individual word senses. However, in many ap-
plications, it may be informative to compare
the overall sense distributions for two differ-
ent contexts. We propose a new method for
comparing two probability distributions over
WordNet, which captures in a single measure
the aggregate semantic distance of the com-
ponent nodes, weighted by their probability.
Previous such measures compute only the dis-
tributional distance, and do not take into ac-
count the semantic similarity between Word-
Net senses across the distributions. To in-
corporate semantic similarity, we calculate the
(dis)similarity between two probability distri-
butions as a weighted distance ?travelled? from
one to the other through the WordNet hierar-
chy. We evaluate the measure by applying it
to the acquisition of verb argument alternation
knowledge, and find that overall it outperforms
existing distance measures.
