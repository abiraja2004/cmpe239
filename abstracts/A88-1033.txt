 
The disambiguation of sentences i a combinatorial 
problem. This paper describes a method for treating 
it as such, directly, by adapting standard combinatorial 
search optimizations. Traditional disambiguation heu- 
ristics are applied but, instead of being embedded in 
individual decision procedures for specific types of 
ambiguities, they contribute to numerical weights that 
are considered by a single global optimizer. The result 
is increased power and simpler code. The method is 
being implemented for a machine translation projecl, 
but could be adapted to any natural language system.
