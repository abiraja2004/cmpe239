VSEM is an open library for visual se-
mantics. Starting from a collection of
tagged images, it is possible to auto-
matically construct an image-based rep-
resentation of concepts by using off-the-
shelf VSEM functionalities. VSEM is en-
tirely written in MATLAB and its object-
oriented design allows a large flexibility
and reusability. The software is accompa-
nied by a website with supporting docu-
mentation and examples.
