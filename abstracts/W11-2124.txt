In past Evaluations for Machine Translation of
European Languages, it could be shown that
the translation performance of SMT systems
can be increased by integrating a bilingual lan-
guage model into a phrase-based SMT system.
In the bilingual language model, target words
with their aligned source words build the to-
kens of an n-gram based language model. We
analyzed the effect of bilingual language mod-
els and show where they could help to bet-
ter model the translation process. We could
show improvements of translation quality on
German-to-English and Arabic-to-English. In
addition, for the Arabic-to-English task, train-
ing an extra bilingual language model on the
POS tags instead of the surface word forms
led to further improvements.
