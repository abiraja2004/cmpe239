In this paper, we provide a theoretical
framework for feature selection in tree ker-
nel spaces based on gradient-vector com-
ponents of kernel-based machines. We
show that a huge number of features can
be discarded without a significant decrease
in accuracy. Our selection algorithm is as
accurate as and much more efficient than
those proposed in previous work. Com-
parative experiments on three interesting
and very diverse classification tasks, i.e.
Question Classification, Relation Extrac-
tion and Semantic Role Labeling, support
our theoretical findings and demonstrate
the algorithm performance.
