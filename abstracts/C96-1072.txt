 
The development of natural anguage pro- 
ccssing (NLP) systems that perform ma- 
chine translation (MT) and information re- 
trieval (IR) has highlighted the need for the 
automatic recognition of proper names. 
While various name recognizers have been 
developed, they suffer from being too lim- 
ited; some only recognize one name class, 
and all are language specific. This work 
develops an approach to multilingual name 
recognition that allows a system optimized 
for one language to be ported to another 
with little additional effort and resources. 
An initial core set of linguistic features, 
useful for name recognition in most lan- 
guages, is identified. When porting to a 
new language, these features need to be 
converted (partly by hand, partly by on-line 
lists), after which point machine learning 
(ML) techniques build decision trees that 
map features to name classes. A system 
initially optimized for English has been 
successfully ported to Spanish and Japa- 
nese. Only a few days of human effort for 
each new language results in performance 
levels comparable to that of the best cur- 
rent English systems.
