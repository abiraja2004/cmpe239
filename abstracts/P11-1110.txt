We analyze collective discourse, a collective
human behavior in content generation, and
show that it exhibits diversity, a property of
general collective systems. Using extensive
analysis, we propose a novel paradigm for de-
signing summary generation systems that re-
flect the diversity of perspectives seen in real-
life collective summarization. We analyze 50
sets of summaries written by human about the
same story or artifact and investigate the diver-
sity of perspectives across these summaries.
We show how different summaries use vari-
ous phrasal information units (i.e., nuggets) to
express the same atomic semantic units, called
factoids. Finally, we present a ranker that em-
ploys distributional similarities to build a net-
work of words, and captures the diversity of
perspectives by detecting communities in this
network. Our experiments show how our sys-
tem outperforms a wide range of other docu-
ment ranking systems that leverage diversity.
