Previous work has shown that Chinese word seg-
mentation is useful for machine translation to En-
glish, yet the way different segmentation strategies
affect MT is still poorly understood. In this pa-
per, we demonstrate that optimizing segmentation
for an existing segmentation standard does not al-
ways yield better MT performance. We find that
other factors such as segmentation consistency and
granularity of Chinese ?words? can be more impor-
tant for machine translation. Based on these find-
ings, we implement methods inside a conditional
random field segmenter that directly optimize seg-
mentation granularity with respect to the MT task,
providing an improvement of 0.73 BLEU. We also
show that improving segmentation consistency us-
ing external lexicon and proper noun features yields
a 0.32 BLEU increase.
