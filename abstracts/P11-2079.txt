In most statistical machine translation sys-
tems, the phrase/rule extraction algorithm uses
alignments in the 1-best form, which might
contain spurious alignment points. The usage
of weighted alignment matrices that encode all
possible alignments has been shown to gener-
ate better phrase tables for phrase-based sys-
tems. We propose two algorithms to generate
the well known MSD reordering model using
weighted alignment matrices. Experiments on
the IWSLT 2010 evaluation datasets for two
language pairs with different alignment algo-
rithms show that our methods produce more
accurate reordering models, as can be shown
by an increase over the regular MSD models
of 0.4 BLEU points in the BTEC French to
English test set, and of 1.5 BLEU points in the
DIALOG Chinese to English test set.
