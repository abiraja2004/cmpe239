 
This paper describes a computational model of human 
sentence processing based on the principles and pa- 
rameters paradigm of current linguistic theory. The 
syntactic processing model posits four modules, re- 
covering phrase structure, long-distance dependencies, 
coreference, and thematic structure. These four mod- 
ules are implemented as recta-interpreters over their 
relevant components of the grammar, permitting vari- 
ation in the deductive strategies employed by each 
module. These four interpreters are also 'coroutined' 
via the freeze directive of constraint logic program- 
ruing to achieve incremental interpretation across the 
modules.
