This paper introduces a general method to in-
corporate the LDA Topic Model into text seg-
mentation algorithms. We show that seman-
tic information added by Topic Models signifi-
cantly improves the performance of two word-
based algorithms, namely TextTiling and C99.
Additionally, we introduce the new TopicTil-
ing algorithm that is designed to take better
advantage of topic information. We show con-
sistent improvements over word-based meth-
ods and achieve state-of-the art performance
on a standard dataset.
