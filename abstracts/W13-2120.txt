We present the results from an elicitation
experiment in which human speakers were
asked to produced quantified referring ex-
pressions (QREs), as in ?The crate with
10 apples?, ?The crate with many apples?,
etc. These results suggest that some sub-
tle contextual factors govern the choice be-
tween different types of QREs, and that
numerals are highly preferred for subitiz-
able quantities despite the availability of
coarser-grained expressions.
