This paper focuses on a subtask of natu-
ral language generation (NLG), voice se-
lection, which decides whether a clause is
realised in the active or passive voice ac-
cording to its contextual information. Au-
tomatic voice selection is essential for re-
alising more sophisticated MT and sum-
marisation systems, because it impacts
the readability of generated texts. How-
ever, to the best of our knowledge, the
NLG community has been less concerned
with explicit voice selection. In this pa-
per, we propose an automatic voice se-
lection model based on various linguistic
information, ranging from lexical to dis-
course information. Our empirical evalua-
tion using a manually annotated corpus in
Japanese demonstrates that the proposed
model achieved 0.758 in F-score, outper-
forming the two baseline models.
