In statistical machine translation, cor-
respondences between the words in
the source and the target language are
learned from bilingual corpora on the
basis of so called alignment models.
Existing statistical systems for MT of-
ten treat different derivatives of the
same lemma as if they were indepen-
dent of each other. In this paper we
argue that a better exploitation of the
bilingual training data can be achieved
by explicitly taking into account the in-
terdependencies of the different deriva-
tives. We do this along two direc-
tions: Usage of hierarchical lexicon
models and the introduction of equiv-
alence classes in order to ignore in-
formation not relevant for the trans-
lation task. The improvement of the
translation results is demonstrated on a
German-English corpus.
