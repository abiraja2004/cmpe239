 
In this paper, we introduce a methodology 
for analyzing judgment opinions. We de-
fine a judgment opinion as consisting of a 
valence, a holder, and a topic. We decom-
pose the task of opinion analysis into four 
parts: 1) recognizing the opinion; 2) iden-
tifying the valence; 3) identifying the 
holder; and 4) identifying the topic. In this 
paper, we address the first three parts and 
evaluate our methodology using both in-
trinsic and extrinsic measures.
