We report on the re-annotation of selected
types of named entities from the MUC7
corpus where our focus lies on record-
ing the time it takes to annotate these
entities given two basic annotation units
? sentences vs. complex noun phrases.
Such information may be helpful to lay
the empirical foundations for the develop-
ment of cost measures for annotation pro-
cesses based on the investment in time for
decision-making per entity mention.
