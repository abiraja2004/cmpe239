This document proposes a new taxon-
omy for describing the quality of services
which are based on spoken dialogue sys-
tems (SDSs), and operated via a telephone
interface. It is used to classify instru-
mentally or expert?derived dialogue and
system measures, as well as quality fea-
tures perceived by the user of the service.
A comparison is drawn to the quality of
human?to?human telephone services, and
implications for the development of evalu-
ation frameworks such as PARADISE are
discussed.
