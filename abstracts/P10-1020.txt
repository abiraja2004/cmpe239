One goal of natural language generation is
to produce coherent text that presents in-
formation in a logical order. In this pa-
per, we show that topological fields, which
model high-level clausal structure, are an
important component of local coherence
in German. First, we show in a sen-
tence ordering experiment that topologi-
cal field information improves the entity
grid model of Barzilay and Lapata (2008)
more than grammatical role and simple
clausal order information do, particularly
when manual annotations of this informa-
tion are not available. Then, we incor-
porate the model enhanced with topolog-
ical fields into a natural language gen-
eration system that generates constituent
orders for German text, and show that
the added coherence component improves
performance slightly, though not statisti-
cally significantly.
