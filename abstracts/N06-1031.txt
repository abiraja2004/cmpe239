We identify problems with the Penn Tree-
bank that render it imperfect for syntax-
based machine translation and propose
methods of relabeling the syntax trees to
improve translation quality. We develop a
system incorporating a handful of relabel-
ing strategies that yields a statistically sig-
nificant improvement of 2.3 BLEU points
over a baseline syntax-based system.
