This paper presents the Entity Relations
(REL) task, a supporting task of the BioNLP
Shared Task 2011. The task concerns the ex-
traction of two types of part-of relations be-
tween a gene/protein and an associated en-
tity. Four teams submitted final results for the
REL task, with the highest-performing system
achieving 57.7% F-score. While experiments
suggest use of the data can help improve event
extraction performance, the task data has so
far received only limited use in support of
event extraction. The REL task continues as
an open challenge, with all resources available
from the shared task website.
