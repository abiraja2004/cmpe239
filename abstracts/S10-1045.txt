 
This article presents the experiments carried 
out at Jadavpur University as part of the 
participation in Multi-Way Classification of 
Semantic Relations between Pairs of Nomi-
nals in the SemEval 2010 exercise. Separate 
rules for each type of the relations are iden-
tified in the baseline model based on the 
verbs and prepositions present in the seg-
ment between each pair of nominals. Inclu-
sion of WordNet features associated with 
the paired nominals play an important role 
in distinguishing the relations from each 
other. The Conditional Random Field (CRF) 
based machine-learning framework is 
adopted for classifying the pair of nominals.  
Application of dependency relations, 
Named Entities (NE) and various types of 
WordNet features along with several com-
binations of these features help to improve 
the performance of the system. Error analy-
sis suggests that the performance can be im-
proved by applying suitable strategies to 
differentiate each paired nominal in an al-
ready identified relation. Evaluation result 
gives an overall macro-averaged F1 score of 
52.16%.
