We report on the TOR system that partic-
ipated in the 2013 CoNLL shared task on
grammatical correction. The system was
a provisional implementation of a beam
search correction over a noisy channel
model. Although the results on the shared
task test set were poor, the approach may
still be promising, as there are many as-
pects of the current implementation that
could be optimised. Grammatical correc-
tion is inherently difficult both to perform
and to evaluate. As such, possible im-
provements to the evaluation are also dis-
cussed.
