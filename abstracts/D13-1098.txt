We present an approach for building multi-
document event threads from a large corpus
of newswire articles. An event thread is basi-
cally a succession of events belonging to the
same story. It helps the reader to contextual-
ize the information contained in a single arti-
cle, by navigating backward or forward in the
thread from this article. A specific effort is
also made on the detection of reactions to a
particular event.
In order to build these event threads, we use a
cascade of classifiers and other modules, tak-
ing advantage of the redundancy of informa-
tion in the newswire corpus.
We also share interesting comments con-
cerning our manual annotation procedure for
building a training and testing set1.
