A classical Chinese Natural Language Under-
standing (NLU) architecture usually includes
several NLU components which are executed
with some mechanism. A new Multilayer Search
Mechanism (MSM) which integrates and quan-
tifies these components into a uniform multi-
layer treelike architecture is presented in this
paper. The mechanism gets the optimal re-
sult with search algorithms. The components
in MSM affect each other. At last, the per-
formance of each component is enhanced. We
built a practical system ? CUP (Chinese Under-
standing Platform) based on MSM with three
layers. By the experiments on Word Segmen-
tation, a better performance was achieved. In
theory the normal cascade and feedback mech-
anism are just some special cases of MSM.
