 
Chinese Named entity recognition is one of 
the most important tasks in NLP. Two 
kinds of Challenges we confront are how to 
improve the performance in one corpus and 
keep its performance in another different 
corpus. We use a combination of statistical 
models, i.e. a language model to recognize 
person names and two CRFs models to 
recognize Location names and 
Organization names respectively. We also 
incorporate an efficient heuristic named 
entity list searching process into the 
framework of statistical model in order to 
improve both the performance and the 
adaptability of the statistical NER system. 
We participate in the NER tests on open 
tracks of MSRA. The testing results show 
that our system can performs well.
