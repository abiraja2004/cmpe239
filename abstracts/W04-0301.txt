The goal of this paper is to explore some conse-
quences of the dichotomy between competence
and performance from the point of view of in-
crementality. We introduce a TAG?based for-
malism that encodes a strong notion of incre-
mentality directly into the operations of the
formal system. A left-associative operation is
used to build a lexicon of extended elementary
trees. Extended elementary trees allow deriva-
tions in which a single fully connected struc-
ture is mantained through the course of a left-
to-right word-by-word derivation. In the paper,
we describe the consequences of this view for
semantic interpretation, and we also evaluate
some of the computational consequences of en-
larging the lexicon in this way.
