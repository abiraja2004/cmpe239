The paper describes our experiments with
English-Czech machine translation for
WMT101 in 2010. Focusing primarily
on the translation to Czech, our additions
to the standard Moses phrase-based MT
pipeline include two-step translation to
overcome target-side data sparseness and
optimization towards SemPOS, a metric
better suited for evaluating Czech. Unfor-
tunately, none of the approaches bring a
significant improvement over our standard
setup.
