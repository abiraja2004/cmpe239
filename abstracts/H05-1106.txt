We here propose a new method which sets
apart domain-specific terminology from
common non-specific noun phrases. It
is based on the observation that termino-
logical multi-word groups reveal a con-
siderably lesser degree of distributional
variation than non-specific noun phrases.
We define a measure for the observable
amount of paradigmatic modifiability of
terms and, subsequently, test it on bigram,
trigram and quadgram noun phrases ex-
tracted from a 104-million-word biomedi-
cal text corpus. Using a community-wide
curated biomedical terminology system as
an evaluation gold standard, we show that
our algorithm significantly outperforms
a variety of standard term identification
measures. We also provide empirical ev-
idence that our methodolgy is essentially
domain- and corpus-size-independent.
