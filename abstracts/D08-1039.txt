This paper describes a lexical trigger model
for statistical machine translation. We present
various methods using triplets incorporating
long-distance dependencies that can go be-
yond the local context of phrases or n-gram
based language models. We evaluate the pre-
sented methods on two translation tasks in a
reranking framework and compare it to the re-
lated IBM model 1. We show slightly im-
proved translation quality in terms of BLEU
and TER and address various constraints to
speed up the training based on Expectation-
Maximization and to lower the overall num-
ber of triplets without loss in translation per-
formance.
