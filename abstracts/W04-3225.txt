We describe experiments carried out with adaptive
language and translation models in the context of an
interactive computer-assisted translation program.
We developed cache-based language models which
were then extended to the bilingual case for a cache-
based translation model. We present the improve-
ments we obtained in two contexts: in a theoretical
setting, we achieved a drop in perplexity for the new
models and, in a more practical situation simulat-
ing a user working with the system, we showed that
fewer keystrokes would be needed to enter a trans-
lation.
