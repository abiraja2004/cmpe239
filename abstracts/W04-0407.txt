 
This paper describes the representation of 
Basque Multiword Lexical Units and the 
automatic processing of Multiword 
Expressions. After discussing and stating 
which kind of multiword expressions we 
consider to be processed at the current 
stage of the work, we present the 
representation schema of the 
corresponding lexical units in a general-
purpose lexical database. Due to its 
expressive power, the schema can deal 
not only with fixed expressions but also 
with morphosyntactically flexible 
constructions. It also allows us to 
lemmatize word combinations as a unit 
and yet to parse the components 
individually if necessary. Moreover, we 
describe HABIL, a tool for the automatic 
processing of these expressions, and we 
give some evaluation results. This work 
must be placed in a general framework of 
written Basque processing tools, which 
currently ranges from the tokenization 
and segmentation of single words up to 
the syntactic tagging of general texts.
