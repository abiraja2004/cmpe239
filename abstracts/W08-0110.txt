 
Humans produce speech incrementally and 
on-line as the dialogue progresses using in-
formation from several different sources in 
parallel. A dialogue system that generates 
output in a stepwise manner and not in pre-
planned syntactically correct sentences needs 
to signal how new dialogue contributions re-
late to previous discourse. This paper de-
scribes a data collection which is the 
foundation for an effort towards more human-
like language generation in DEAL, a spoken 
dialogue system developed at KTH. Two an-
notators labelled cue phrases in the corpus 
with high inter-annotator agreement (kappa 
coefficient 0.82).
