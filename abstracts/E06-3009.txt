Metonymy recognition is generally ap-
proached with complex algorithms that
rely heavily on the manual annotation of
training and test data. This paper will re-
lieve this complexity in two ways. First,
it will show that the results of the cur-
rent learning algorithms can be replicated
by the ?lazy? algorithm of Memory-Based
Learning. This approach simply stores all
training instances to its memory and clas-
sifies a test instance by comparing it to all
training examples. Second, this paper will
argue that the number of labelled training
examples that is currently used in the lit-
erature can be reduced drastically. This
finding can help relieve the knowledge ac-
quisition bottleneck in metonymy recog-
nition, and allow the algorithms to be ap-
plied on a wider scale.
