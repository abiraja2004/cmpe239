 
In this paper we present a logical treatment of semi- 
free word order and bounded i scont inuous  
constituency. We extend standard feature value 
logics to treat word order in a single formalism with 
a rigorous semantics without phrase structure rules. 
The elimination of phrase structure rules allows a 
natural general isat ion of the approach to 
nonconfigurational word order and bounded 
discontinuous continuency via sequence union. 
Sequence union formalises the notions of clause 
union and scrambling by providing a mechanism for 
describing word order domains larger than the local 
tree. The formalism incorporates the distinction 
between bounded and unbounded forms of 
discontinuous constituency. Grammars are  
organised as algebraic theories. This means that 
linguistic generalisations are stated as axioms about 
the structure of signs. This permits a natural 
interpretation of implicational universals in terms of 
theories, subtheories and implicational axioms. The 
accompanying linguistic analysis is eclectic, 
borrowing insights from many current linguistic 
theories.
