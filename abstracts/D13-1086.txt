Multi-Domain learning (MDL) assumes that
the domain labels in the dataset are known.
However, when there are multiple metadata at-
tributes available, it is not always straightfor-
ward to select a single best attribute for do-
main partition, and it is possible that combin-
ing more than one metadata attributes (includ-
ing continuous attributes) can lead to better
MDL performance. In this work, we propose
an automatic domain partitioning approach
that aims at providing better domain identi-
ties for MDL. We use a supervised clustering
approach that learns the domain distance be-
tween data instances , and then cluster the data
into better domains for MDL. Our experiment
on real multi-domain datasets shows that us-
ing our automatically generated domain parti-
tion improves over popular MDL methods.
