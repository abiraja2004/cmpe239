In current statistical machine translation
(SMT), erroneous word reordering is one of
the most serious problems. To resolve this
problem, many word-reordering constraint
techniques have been proposed. The inver-
sion transduction grammar (ITG) is one of
these constraints. In ITG constraints, target-
side word order is obtained by rotating nodes
of the source-side binary tree. In these node
rotations, the source binary tree instance is
not considered. Therefore, stronger con-
straints for word reordering can be obtained
by imposing further constraints derived from
the source tree on the ITG constraints. For
example, for the source word sequence { a
b c d }, ITG constraints allow a total of
twenty-two target word orderings. How-
ever, when the source binary tree instance ((a
b) (c d)) is given, our proposed ?imposing
source tree on ITG? (IST-ITG) constraints
allow only eight word orderings. The re-
duction in the number of word-order permu-
tations by our proposed stronger constraints
efficiently suppresses erroneous word order-
ings. In our experiments with IST-ITG using
the NIST MT08 English-to-Chinese transla-
tion track?s data, the proposed method re-
sulted in a 1.8-points improvement in char-
acter BLEU-4 (35.2 to 37.0) and a 6.2%
lower CER (74.1 to 67.9%) compared with
our baseline condition.
