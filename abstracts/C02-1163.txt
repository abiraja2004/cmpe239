A machine translation model has been pro-
posed where an input is translated through
both source-language and target-language para-
phrasing processes. We have implemented our
prototype model for the Japanese-Chinese lan-
guage pair. This paper describes our core idea
of translation, where a source language para-
phraser and a language transfer cooperates in
translation by exchanging information about
the source input.
