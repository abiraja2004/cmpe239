This paper presents a paradigm for
evaluating the context-sensitive under-
standing capability of any spoken lan-
guage dialog system: PEACE (French
acronym for Paradigme d?Evaluation
Automatique de la Compre?hension hors
et En-contexte). This paradigm will be
the basis of the French Technolangue
MEDIA project, in which dialog sys-
tems from various academic and indus-
trial sites will be tested in an evaluation
campaign coordinated by ELRA/ELDA
(over the next two years). Despite pre-
vious efforts such as EAGLES, DISC,
AUPELF ARCB2 or the ongoing Ameri-
can DARPA COMMUNICATOR project,
the spoken dialog community still lacks
common reference tasks and widely
agreed upon methods for comparing
and diagnosing systems and techniques.
Automatic solutions are nowadays be-
ing sought both to make possible the
comparison of different approaches by
means of reliable indicators with generic
evaluation methodologies and also to re-
duce system development costs. How-
ever achieving independence from both
the dialog system and the task per-
formed seems to be more and more a
utopia. Most of the evaluations have
up to now either tackled the system as
a whole, or based the measurements
on dialog-context-free information. The
PEACE proposal aims at bypassing some
of these shortcomings by extracting,
from real dialog corpora, test sets that
synthesize contextual information.
