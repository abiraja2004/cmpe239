Locating documents carrying positive or neg-
ative favourability is an important application
within media analysis. This paper presents
some empirical results on the challenges fac-
ing a machine-learning approach to this kind
of opinion mining. Some of the challenges in-
clude: the often considerable imbalance in the
distribution of positive and negative samples;
changes in the documents over time; and ef-
fective training and quantification procedures
for reporting results. This paper begins with
three datasets generated by a media-analysis
company, classifying documents in two ways:
detecting the presence of favourability, and as-
sessing negative vs. positive favourability. We
then evaluate a machine-learning approach to
automate the classification process. We ex-
plore the effect of using five different types of
features, the robustness of the models when
tested on data taken from a later time period,
and the effect of balancing the input data by
undersampling. We find varying choices for
the optimum classifier, feature set and training
strategy depending on the task and dataset.
