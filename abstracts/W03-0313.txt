The term translation spotting (TS) refers to
the task of identifying the target-language (TL)
words that correspond to a given set of source-
language (SL) words in a pair of text segments
known to be mutual translations. This arti-
cle examines this task within the context of a
sub-sentential translation-memory system, i.e.
a translation support tool capable of proposing
translations for portions of a SL sentence, ex-
tracted from an archive of existing translations.
Different methods are proposed, based on a sta-
tistical translation model. These methods take
advantage of certain characteristics of the ap-
plication, to produce TL segments submitted
to constraints of contiguity and composition-
ality. Experiments show that imposing these
constraints allows important gains in accuracy,
with regard to the most probable alignments
predicted by the model.
