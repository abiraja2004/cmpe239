We present a rule extractor for SCFG-based
MT that generalizes many of the contraints
present in existing SCFG extraction algo-
rithms. Our method?s increased rule coverage
comes from allowing multiple alignments, vir-
tual nodes, and multiple tree decompositions
in the extraction process. At decoding time,
we improve automatic metric scores by signif-
icantly increasing the number of phrase pairs
that match a given test set, while our experi-
ments with hierarchical grammar filtering in-
dicate that more intelligent filtering schemes
will also provide a key to future gains.
