 We describe a generation-oriented workbench for the Performance Grammar (PG) formalism, highlighting the treatment of certain word order and movement constraints in Dutch and German. PG enables a simple and uni-form treatment of a heterogeneous col-lection of linear order phenomena in the domain of verb constructions (variably known as Cross-serial De-pendencies, Verb Raising, Clause Un-ion, Extraposition, Third Construction, Particle Hopping, etc.). The central data structures enabling this feature are clausal ?topologies?: one-dimensional arrays associated with clauses, whose cells (?slots?) provide landing sites for the constituents of the clause. Move-ment operations are enabled by unifica-tion of lateral slots of topologies at ad-jacent levels of the clause hierarchy. The PGW generator assists the gram-mar developer in testing whether the implemented syntactic knowledge al-lows all and only the well-formed per-mutations of constituents. 1
