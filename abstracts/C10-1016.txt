 
Multi-document summarization aims to 
produce a concise summary that contains 
salient information from a set of source 
documents. In this field, sentence ranking 
has hitherto been the issue of most concern. 
Since documents often cover a number of 
topic themes with each theme represented 
by a cluster of highly related sentences, 
sentence clustering was recently explored in 
the literature in order to provide more 
informative summaries. Existing cluster-
based ranking approaches applied clustering 
and ranking in isolation. As a result, the 
ranking performance will be inevitably 
influenced by the clustering result. In this 
paper, we propose a reinforcement approach 
that tightly integrates ranking and clustering 
by mutually and simultaneously updating 
each other so that the performance of both 
can be improved. Experimental results on 
the DUC datasets demonstrate its 
effectiveness and robustness.
