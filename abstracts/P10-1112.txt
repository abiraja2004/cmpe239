We present a simple but accurate parser
which exploits both large tree fragments
and symbol refinement. We parse with
all fragments of the training set, in con-
trast to much recent work on tree se-
lection in data-oriented parsing and tree-
substitution grammar learning. We re-
quire only simple, deterministic grammar
symbol refinement, in contrast to recent
work on latent symbol refinement. More-
over, our parser requires no explicit lexi-
con machinery, instead parsing input sen-
tences as character streams. Despite its
simplicity, our parser achieves accuracies
of over 88% F1 on the standard English
WSJ task, which is competitive with sub-
stantially more complicated state-of-the-
art lexicalized and latent-variable parsers.
Additional specific contributions center on
making implicit all-fragments parsing effi-
cient, including a coarse-to-fine inference
scheme and a new graph encoding.
