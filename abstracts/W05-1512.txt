Although state-of-the-art parsers for nat-
ural language are lexicalized, it was re-
cently shown that an accurate unlexical-
ized parser for the Penn tree-bank can be
simply read off a manually refined tree-
bank. While lexicalized parsers often suf-
fer from sparse data, manual mark-up is
costly and largely based on individual lin-
guistic intuition. Thus, across domains,
languages, and tree-bank annotations, a
fundamental question arises: Is it possible
to automatically induce an accurate parser
from a tree-bank without resorting to full
lexicalization? In this paper, we show how
to induce head-driven probabilistic parsers
with latent heads from a tree-bank. Our
automatically trained parser has a perfor-
mance of 85.7% (LP/LR F1), which is al-
ready better than that of early lexicalized
ones.
