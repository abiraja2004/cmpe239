 
We analyze a collection of 3208 reported errors 
of Chinese words. Among these errors, 7.2% in-
volved rarely used character, and 98.4% were 
assigned common classifications of their causes 
by human subjects. In particular, 80% of the er-
rors observed in the writings of middle school 
students were related to the pronunciations and 
30% were related to the logographs of the words. 
We conducted experiments that shed light on us-
ing the Web-based statistics to correct the errors, 
and we designed a software environment for pre-
paring test items whose authors intentionally re-
place correct characters with wrong ones. Ex-
perimental results show that using Web-based 
statistics can help us correct only about 75% of 
these errors. In contrast, Web-based statistics are 
useful for recommending incorrect characters for 
composing test items for ?incorrect character 
identification? tests about 93% of the time.
