In this paper, we propose a method for
learning a classifier which combines out-
puts of more than one Japanese named
entity extractors. The proposed combi-
nation method belongs to the family of
stacked generalizers, which is in principle
a technique of combining outputs of sev-
eral classifiers at the first stage by learn-
ing a second stage classifier to combine
those outputs at the first stage. Individ-
ual models to be combined are based on
maximum entropy models, one of which
always considers surrounding contexts of
a fixed length, while the other consid-
ers those of variable lengths according to
the number of constituent morphemes of
named entities. As an algorithm for learn-
ing the second stage classifier, we employ
a decision list learning method. Experi-
mental evaluation shows that the proposed
method achieves improvement over the
best known results with Japanese named
entity extractors based on maximum en-
tropy models.
