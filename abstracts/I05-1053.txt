. We propose a phrase-based context-dependent joint probability 
model for Named Entity (NE) translation. Our proposed model consists of a 
lexical mapping model and a permutation model. Target phrases are generated 
by the context-dependent lexical mapping model, and word reordering is per-
formed by the permutation model at the phrase level. We also present a two-
step search to decode the best result from the models. Our proposed model is 
evaluated on the LDC Chinese-English NE translation corpus. The experiment 
results show that our proposed model is high effective for NE translation.
