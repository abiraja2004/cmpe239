This paper presents novel methods for
modeling numerical common sense: the
ability to infer whether a given number
(e.g., three billion) is large, small, or nor-
mal for a given context (e.g., number of
people facing a water shortage). We first
discuss the necessity of numerical com-
mon sense in solving textual entailment
problems. We explore two approaches for
acquiring numerical common sense. Both
approaches start with extracting numeri-
cal expressions and their context from the
Web. One approach estimates the distribu-
tion of numbers co-occurring within a con-
text and examines whether a given value is
large, small, or normal, based on the distri-
bution. Another approach utilizes textual
patterns with which speakers explicitly ex-
presses their judgment about the value of
a numerical expression. Experimental re-
sults demonstrate the effectiveness of both
approaches.
