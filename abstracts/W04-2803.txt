In this paper we present an evaluation of
Carmel-Tools, a novel behavior oriented ap-
proach to authoring and maintaining do-
main specific knowledge sources for ro-
bust sentence-level language understanding.
Carmel-Tools provides a layer of abstraction
between the author and the knowledge sources,
freeing up the author to focus on the desired
language processing behavior that is desired in
the target system rather than the linguistic de-
tails of the knowledge sources that would make
this behavior possible. Furthermore, Carmel-
Tools offers greater flexibility in output rep-
resentation than the context-free rewrite rules
produced by previous semantic authoring tools,
allowing authors to design their own predicate
language representations.
