A syntax-directed translator first parses
the source-language input into a parse-
tree, and then recursively converts the tree
into a string in the target-language. We
model this conversion by an extended tree-
to-string transducer that have multi-level
trees on the source-side, which gives our
system more expressive power and flexi-
bility. We also define a direct probabil-
ity model and use a linear-time dynamic
programming algorithm to search for the
best derivation. The model is then ex-
tended to the general log-linear frame-
work in order to rescore with other fea-
tures like n-gram language models. We
devise a simple-yet-effective algorithm to
generate non-duplicate k-best translations
for n-gram rescoring. Initial experimen-
tal results on English-to-Chinese transla-
tion are presented.
