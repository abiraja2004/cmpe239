Dictionary-based protein name recogni-
tion is the first step for practical infor-
mation extraction from biomedical doc-
uments because it provides ID informa-
tion of recognized terms unlike machine
learning based approaches. However, dic-
tionary based approaches have two se-
rious problems: (1) a large number of
false recognitions mainly caused by short
names. (2) low recall due to spelling vari-
ation. In this paper, we tackle the for-
mer problem by using a machine learning
method to filter out false positives. We
also present an approximate string search-
ing method to alleviate the latter prob-
lem. Experimental results using the GE-
NIA corpus show that the filtering using
a naive Bayes classifier greatly improves
precision with slight loss of recall, result-
ing in a much better F-score.
