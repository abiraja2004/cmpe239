The paper is concerned with automatic
classification of new lexical items into
synonymic sets on the basis of their co-
occurrence data obtained from a corpus. Our
goal is to examine the impact that different
types of linguistic preprocessing of the co-
occurrence material have on the classification
accuracy. The paper comparatively studies
several preprocessing techniques frequently
used for this and similar tasks and makes
conclusions about their relative merits. We
find that a carefully chosen preprocessing
procedure achieves a relative effectiveness
improvement of up to 88% depending on the
classification method in comparison to the
window-based context delineation, along with
using much smaller feature space.
