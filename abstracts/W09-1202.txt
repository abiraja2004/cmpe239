 
We propose a system to carry out the joint pars-
ing of syntactic and semantic dependencies in 
multiple languages for our participation in the 
shared task of CoNLL-2009. We present an it-
erative approach for dependency parsing and 
semantic role labeling. We have participated in 
the closed challenge, and our system achieves 
73.98% on labeled macro F1 for the complete 
problem, 77.11% on labeled attachment score 
for syntactic dependencies, and 70.78% on la-
beled F1 for semantic dependencies. The cur-
rent experimental results  show that our method 
effectively improves system performance.
