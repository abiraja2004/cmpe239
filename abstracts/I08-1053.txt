This paper presents an approach to the
translation of compound words without the
need for bilingual training text, by mod-
eling the mapping of literal component
word glosses (e.g. ?iron-path?) into flu-
ent English (e.g. ?railway?) across mul-
tiple languages. Performance is improved
by adding component-sequence and learned-
morphology models along with context sim-
ilarity from monolingual text and optional
combination with traditional bilingual-text-
based translation discovery.
