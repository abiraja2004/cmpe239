This paper describes the online demo of the
QuALiM Question Answering system. While
the system actually gets answers from the web
by querying major search engines, during pre-
sentation answers are supplemented with rel-
evant passages from Wikipedia. We believe
that this additional information improves a
user?s search experience.
