We present a novel approach to discovering re-
lations and their instantiations from a collec-
tion of documents in a single domain. Our
approach learns relation types by exploiting
meta-constraints that characterize the general
qualities of a good relation in any domain.
These constraints state that instances of a
single relation should exhibit regularities at
multiple levels of linguistic structure, includ-
ing lexicography, syntax, and document-level
context. We capture these regularities via the
structure of our probabilistic model as well
as a set of declaratively-specified constraints
enforced during posterior inference. Across
two domains our approach successfully recov-
ers hidden relation structure, comparable to
or outperforming previous state-of-the-art ap-
proaches. Furthermore, we find that a small
set of constraints is applicable across the do-
mains, and that using domain-specific con-
straints can further improve performance. 1
