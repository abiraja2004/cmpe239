Paraphrases have proved to be useful in many
applications, including Machine Translation,
Question Answering, Summarization, and In-
formation Retrieval. Paraphrase acquisition
methods that use a single monolingual corpus
often produce only syntactic paraphrases. We
present a method for obtaining surface para-
phrases, using a 150GB (25 billion words)
monolingual corpus. Our method achieves an
accuracy of around 70% on the paraphrase ac-
quisition task. We further show that we can
use these paraphrases to generate surface pat-
terns for relation extraction. Our patterns are
much more precise than those obtained by us-
ing a state of the art baseline and can extract
relations with more than 80% precision for
each of the test relations.
