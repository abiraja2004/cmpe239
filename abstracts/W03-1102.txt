In this paper, we propose a practical ap-
proach for extracting the most relevant
paragraphs from the original document
to form a summary for Thai text. The
idea of our approach is to exploit both
the local and global properties of para-
graphs. The local property can be consid-
ered as clusters of significant words within
each paragraph, while the global property
can be though of as relations of all para-
graphs in a document. These two proper-
ties are combined for ranking and extract-
ing summaries. Experimental results on
real-world data sets are encouraging.
