To date, work on Non-Local Dependencies
(NLDs) has focused almost exclusively on
English and it is an open research question
how well these approaches migrate to other
languages. This paper surveys non-local de-
pendency constructions in Chinese as repre-
sented in the Penn Chinese Treebank (CTB)
and provides an approach for generating
proper predicate-argument-modifier struc-
tures including NLDs from surface context-
free phrase structure trees. Our approach re-
covers non-local dependencies at the level
of Lexical-Functional Grammar f-structures,
using automatically acquired subcategorisa-
tion frames and f-structure paths linking an-
tecedents and traces in NLDs. Currently our
algorithm achieves 92.2% f-score for trace
insertion and 84.3% for antecedent recovery
evaluating on gold-standard CTB trees, and
64.7% and 54.7%, respectively, on CTB-
trained state-of-the-art parser output trees.
