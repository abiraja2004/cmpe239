This paper describes the right-to-left decoding
method, which translates an input string by gen-
erating in right-to-left direction. In addition, pre-
sented is the bidirectional decoding method, that
can take both of the advantages of left-to-right and
right-to-left decoding method by generating output
in both ways and by merging hypothesized partial
outputs of two directions. The experimental results
on Japanese and English translation showed that
the right-to-left was better for Englith-to-Japanese
translation, while the left-to-right was suitable for
Japanese-to-English translation. It was also ob-
served that the bidirectional method was better for
English-to-Japanese translation.
