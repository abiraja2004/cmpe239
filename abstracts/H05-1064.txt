We describe a new method for the repre-
sentation of NLP structures within rerank-
ing approaches. We make use of a condi-
tional log?linear model, with hidden vari-
ables representing the assignment of lexi-
cal items to word clusters or word senses.
The model learns to automatically make
these assignments based on a discrimina-
tive training criterion. Training and de-
coding with the model requires summing
over an exponential number of hidden?
variable assignments: the required sum-
mations can be computed efficiently and
exactly using dynamic programming. As
a case study, we apply the model to
parse reranking. The model gives an F?
measure improvement of ? 1.25% be-
yond the base parser, and an ? 0.25%
improvement beyond the Collins (2000)
reranker. Although our experiments are
focused on parsing, the techniques de-
scribed generalize naturally to NLP struc-
tures other than parse trees.
