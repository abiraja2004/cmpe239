This paper proposes a novel approach
for predicting user satisfaction transitions
during a dialogue only from the ratings
given to entire dialogues, with the aim
of reducing the cost of creating refer-
ence ratings for utterances/dialogue-acts
that have been necessary in conventional
approaches. In our approach, we first
train hidden Markov models (HMMs) of
dialogue-act sequences associated with
each overall rating. Then, we combine
such rating-related HMMs into a single
HMM to decode a sequence of dialogue-
acts into state sequences representing to
which overall rating each dialogue-act is
most related, which leads to our rating pre-
dictions. Experimental results in two di-
alogue domains show that our approach
can make reasonable predictions; it signif-
icantly outperforms a baseline and nears
the upper bound of a supervised approach
in some evaluation criteria. We also
show that introducing states that represent
dialogue-act sequences that occur com-
monly in all ratings into an HMM signifi-
cantly improves prediction accuracy.
