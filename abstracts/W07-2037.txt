This paper describes the implementation
of our three systems at SemEval-2007, for
task 2 (word sense discrimination), task 5
(Chinese word sense disambiguation), and
the first subtask in task 17 (English word
sense disambiguation). For task 2, we ap-
plied a cluster validation method to esti-
mate the number of senses of a target word
in untagged data, and then grouped the in-
stances of this target word into the esti-
mated number of clusters. For both task 5
and task 17, We used the label propagation
algorithm as the classifier for sense disam-
biguation. Our system at task 2 achieved
63.9% F-score under unsupervised evalua-
tion, and 71.9% supervised recall with su-
pervised evaluation. For task 5, our sys-
tem obtained 71.2% micro-average preci-
sion and 74.7% macro-average precision.
For the lexical sample subtask for task
17, our system achieved 86.4% coarse-
grained precision and recall.
