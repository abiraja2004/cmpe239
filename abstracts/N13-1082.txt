Social media users who post bullying related
tweets may later experience regret, potentially
causing them to delete their posts. In this pa-
per, we construct a corpus of bullying tweets
and periodically check the existence of each
tweet in order to infer if and when it becomes
deleted. We then conduct exploratory analy-
sis in order to isolate factors associated with
deleted posts. Finally, we propose the con-
struction of a regrettable posts predictor to
warn users if a tweet might cause regret.
