In this paper we propose and investigate
Ontology Population from Textual Mentions
(OPTM), a sub-task of Ontology Population
from text where we assume that mentions for
several kinds of entities (e.g. PERSON,
O R G A N I Z A T I O N , LO C A T I O N , GEO-
POLITICAL_ ENTITY) are already extracted
from a document collection. On the one
hand, OPTM simplifies the general Ontology
Population task, limiting the input textual
material; on the other hand, it introduces
challenging extensions to Ontology Popula-
tion restricted to named entities, being open
to a wider spectrum of linguistic phenomena.
We describe a manually created benchmark
for OPTM and discuss several factors which
determine the difficulty of the task.
