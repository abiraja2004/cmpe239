In this paper, we present an unlexical-
ized parser for German which employs
smoothing and suffix analysis to achieve
a labelled bracket F-score of 76.2, higher
than previously reported results on the
NEGRA corpus. In addition to the high
accuracy of the model, the use of smooth-
ing in an unlexicalized parser allows us
to better examine the interplay between
smoothing and parsing results.
