This paper proposes an approach of process-
ing Japanese compound functional expressions
by identifying them and analyzing their depen-
dency relations through a machine learning tech-
nique. First, we formalize the task of identify-
ing Japanese compound functional expressions
in a text as a machine learning based chunking
problem. Next, against the results of identify-
ing compound functional expressions, we apply
the method of dependency analysis based on the
cascaded chunking model. The results of ex-
perimental evaluation show that, the dependency
analysis model achieves improvements when ap-
plied after identifying compound functional ex-
pressions, compared with the case where it is ap-
plied without identifying compound functional
expressions.
