This paper summarizes our approach to the
Semeval 2007 shared task on ?Classifica-
tion of Semantic Relations between Nom-
inals?. Our overall strategy is to develop
machine-learning classifiers making use of
a few easily computable and effective fea-
tures, selected independently for each clas-
sifier in wrapper experiments. We train two
types of classifiers for each of the seven re-
lations: with and without WordNet informa-
tion.
