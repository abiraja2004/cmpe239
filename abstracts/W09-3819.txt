We describe a newly available Hebrew
Dependency Treebank, which is extracted
from the Hebrew (constituency) Tree-
bank. We establish some baseline un-
labeled dependency parsing performance
on Hebrew, based on two state-of-the-art
parsers, MST-parser and MaltParser. The
evaluation is performed both in an artifi-
cial setting, in which the data is assumed
to be properly morphologically segmented
and POS-tagged, and in a real-world set-
ting, in which the parsing is performed on
automatically segmented and POS-tagged
text. We present an evaluation measure
that takes into account the possibility of
incompatible token segmentation between
the gold standard and the parsed data.
Results indicate that (a) MST-parser per-
forms better on Hebrew data than Malt-
Parser, and (b) both parsers do not make
good use of morphological information
when parsing Hebrew.
