 
We discuss those techniques which, in the 
opinion of the authors, are needed to support 
robust automatic summarization. Many of 
these methods are already incorporated in a 
multi-lingual summarization system, MINDS, 
developed at CRL. The approach is sentence 
selection, but includes techniques to improve 
coherence and also to perform sentence reduc- 
tion. Our methods are in distinct contrast o 
those approaches to summarization by deep 
analysis of a document followed by text gener- 
ation.
