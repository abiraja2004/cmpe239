Given multiple translations of the same
source sentence, how to combine them to
produce a translation that is better than any
single system output? We propose a hier-
archical system combination framework for
machine translation. This framework inte-
grates multiple MT systems? output at the
word-, phrase- and sentence- levels. By
boosting common word and phrase trans-
lation pairs, pruning unused phrases, and
exploring decoding paths adopted by other
MT systems, this framework achieves bet-
ter translation quality with much less re-
decoding time. The full sentence translation
hypotheses from multiple systems are addi-
tionally selected based on N-gram language
models trained on word/word-POS mixed
stream, which further improves the transla-
tion quality. We consistently observed sig-
nificant improvements on several test sets in
multiple languages covering different gen-
res.
