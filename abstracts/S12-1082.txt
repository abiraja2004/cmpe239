We estimate the semantic similarity between
two sentences using regression models with
features: 1) n-gram hit rates (lexical matches)
between sentences, 2) lexical semantic sim-
ilarity between non-matching words, and 3)
sentence length. Lexical semantic similarity is
computed via co-occurrence counts on a cor-
pus harvested from the web using a modified
mutual information metric. State-of-the-art re-
sults are obtained for semantic similarity com-
putation at the word level, however, the fusion
of this information at the sentence level pro-
vides only moderate improvement on Task 6
of SemEval?12. Despite the simple features
used, regression models provide good perfor-
mance, especially for shorter sentences, reach-
ing correlation of 0.62 on the SemEval test set.
