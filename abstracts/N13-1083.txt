We investigate two systems for automatic dis-
fluency detection on English and Mandarin
conversational speech data. The first system
combines various lexical and prosodic fea-
tures in a Conditional Random Field model for
detecting edit disfluencies. The second system
combines acoustic and language model scores
for detecting filled pauses through constrained
speech recognition. We compare the contri-
butions of different knowledge sources to de-
tection performance between these two lan-
guages.
