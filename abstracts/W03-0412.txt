This paper introduces PhraseNet, a context-
sensitive lexical semantic knowledge base sys-
tem. Based on the supposition that seman-
tic proximity is not simply a relation between
two words in isolation, but rather a relation
between them in their context, English nouns
and verbs, along with contexts they appear in,
are organized in PhraseNet into Consets; Con-
sets capture the underlying lexical concept, and
are connected with several semantic relations
that respect contextually sensitive lexical infor-
mation. PhraseNet makes use of WordNet as
an important knowledge source. It enhances
a WordNet synset with its contextual informa-
tion and refines its relational structure by main-
taining only those relations that respect con-
textual constraints. The contextual informa-
tion allows for supporting more functionali-
ties compared with those of WordNet. Nat-
ural language researchers as well as linguists
and language learners can gain from accessing
PhraseNet with a word token and its context, to
retrieve relevant semantic information.
We describe the design and construction of
PhraseNet and give preliminary experimental
evidence to its usefulness for NLP researches.
