This work investigates the variation in a word?s dis-
tributionally nearest neighbours with respect to the
similarity measure used. We identify one type of
variation as being the relative frequency of the neigh-
bour words with respect to the frequency of the tar-
get word. We then demonstrate a three-way connec-
tion between relative frequency of similar words, a
concept of distributional gnerality and the seman-
tic relation of hyponymy. Finally, we consider the
impact that this has on one application of distribu-
tional similarity methods (judging the composition-
ality of collocations).
