We investigate the possibility of exploit-
ing character-based dependency for Chi-
nese information processing. As Chinese
text is made up of character sequences
rather than word sequences, word in Chi-
nese is not so natural a concept as in En-
glish, nor is word easy to be defined with-
out argument for such a language. There-
fore we propose a character-level depen-
dency scheme to represent primary lin-
guistic relationships within a Chinese sen-
tence. The usefulness of character depen-
dencies are verified through two special-
ized dependency parsing tasks. The first
is to handle trivial character dependencies
that are equally transformed from tradi-
tional word boundaries. The second fur-
thermore considers the case that annotated
internal character dependencies inside a
word are involved. Both of these results
from character-level dependency parsing
are positive. This study provides an alter-
native way to formularize basic character-
and word-level representation for Chinese.
