In this paper, we address the task of
mapping high-level instructions to se-
quences of commands in an external en-
vironment. Processing these instructions
is challenging?they posit goals to be
achieved without specifying the steps re-
quired to complete them. We describe
a method that fills in missing informa-
tion using an automatically derived envi-
ronment model that encodes states, tran-
sitions, and commands that cause these
transitions to happen. We present an ef-
ficient approximate approach for learning
this environment model as part of a policy-
gradient reinforcement learning algorithm
for text interpretation. This design enables
learning for mapping high-level instruc-
tions, which previous statistical methods
cannot handle.1
