Grammatical relationships (GRs)
form an important level of natu-
ral language processing, but dier-
ent sets of GRs are useful for dier-
ent purposes. Therefore, one may of-
ten only have time to obtain a small
training corpus with the desired GR
annotations. To boost the perfor-
mance from using such a small train-
ing corpus on a transformation rule
learner, we use existing systems that
nd related types of annotations.
