 
Alternative paths to linguistic annotation, such as those utilizing games or exploiting the web users, are becoming popular in recent times owing to their very high benefit-to-cost ratios. In this paper, however, we report a case study on POS annotation for Bangla and Hindi, where we observe that reliable linguis-tic annotation requires not only expert anno-tators, but also a great deal of supervision. For our hierarchical POS annotation scheme, we find that close supervision and training is necessary at every level of the hierarchy, or equivalently, complexity of the tagset. Never-theless, an intelligent annotation tool can sig-nificantly accelerate the annotation process and increase the inter-annotator agreement for both expert and non-expert annotators. These findings lead us to believe that reliable annotation requiring deep linguistic knowl-edge (e.g., POS, chunking, Treebank, seman-tic role labeling) requires expertise and su-pervision. The focus, therefore, should be on design and development of appropriate anno-tation tools equipped with machine learning based predictive modules that can signifi-cantly boost the productivity of the annota-tors.1  1
