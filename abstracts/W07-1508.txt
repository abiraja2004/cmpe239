  In this paper, we argue that clustering WordNet senses into more coarse-grained groupings results in higher inter-annotator agreement and increased system performance. Clustering of verb senses involves examining syntactic and semantic features of verbs and arguments on a case-by-case basis rather than applying a strict methodology. Determining appropriate criteria for clustering is based primarily on the needs of annotators.  1  Credits  We gratefully acknowledge the support of the National Science Foundation Grant NSF-0415923, Word Sense Disambiguation, and the GALE program of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, Contract No. HR0011-06-C-0022, a subcontract from the BBN-AGILE Team.  2
