Readability formulas are methods used to
match texts with the readers? reading level.
Several methodological paradigms have pre-
viously been investigated in the field. The
most popular paradigm dates several decades
back and gave rise to well known readability
formulas such as the Flesch formula (among
several others). This paper compares this ap-
proach (henceforth ?classic?) with an emerg-
ing paradigm which uses sophisticated NLP-
enabled features and machine learning tech-
niques. Our experiments, carried on a corpus
of texts for French as a foreign language, yield
four main results: (1) the new readability for-
mula performed better than the ?classic? for-
mula; (2) ?non-classic? features were slightly
more informative than ?classic? features; (3)
modern machine learning algorithms did not
improve the explanatory power of our read-
ability model, but allowed to better classify
new observations; and (4) combining ?classic?
and ?non-classic? features resulted in a signif-
icant gain in performance.
