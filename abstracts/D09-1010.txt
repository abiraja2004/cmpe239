In this paper, we propose a novel class
of graphs, the tripartite directed acyclic
graphs (tDAGs), to model first-order rule
feature spaces for sentence pair classifi-
cation. We introduce a novel algorithm
for computing the similarity in first-order
rewrite rule feature spaces. Our algorithm
is extremely efficient and, as it computes
the similarity of instances that can be rep-
resented in explicit feature spaces, it is a
valid kernel function.
