The Ngram Statistics Package (Text::NSP)
is freely available open-source software that
identifies ngrams, collocations and word as-
sociations in text. It is implemented in Perl
and takes advantage of regular expressions to
provide very flexible tokenization and to allow
for the identification of non-adjacent ngrams.
It includes a wide range of measures of associ-
ation that can be used to identify collocations.
