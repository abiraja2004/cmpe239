The paper proposes a new method of linear text segmentation based on
lexical cohesion of a text. Namely, first a single chain of disambiguated
words in a text is established, then the rips of this single chain are consid-
ered as boundaries for the segments of the cohesion text structure (Cohe-
sion TextTiling or CTT). The summaries of arbitrarily length are obtained
by extraction using three different methods applied to the obtained seg-
ments. The informativeness of the obtained summaries is compared with
the informativeness of the pair summaries of the same length obtained us-
ing an earlier method of logical segmentation by text entailment (Logical
TextTiling or LTT). Some experiments about CTT and LTT methods are
carried out for four ?classical" texts in summarization literature showing
that the quality of the summarization using cohesion segmentation (CTT)
is better than the quality using logical segmentation (LTT).
