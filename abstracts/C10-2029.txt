Recent work on distributional methods for
similarity focuses on using the context
in which a target word occurs to derive
context-sensitive similarity computations.
In this paper we present a method for com-
puting similarity which builds vector rep-
resentations for words in context by mod-
eling senses as latent variables in a large
corpus. We apply this to the Lexical Sub-
stitution Task and we show that our model
significantly outperforms typical distribu-
tional methods.
