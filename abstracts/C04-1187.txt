 
While research on question answering has be-
come popular in recent years, the problem of ef-
ficiently locating a complete set of distinct 
answers to list questions in huge corpora or the 
Web is still far from being solved. This paper ex-
ploits the wealth of freely available text and link 
structures on the Web to seek complete answers 
to list questions. We introduce our system, 
FADA, which relies on question parsing, web 
page classification/clustering, and content extrac-
tion to find reliable distinct answers with high re-
call.
