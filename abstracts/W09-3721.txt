Term selection methods typically employ a statistical measure to
filter or weight terms. Term expansion for IR may also depend on
statistics, or use some other, non-metric method based on a lexical
resource. At the same time, a wide range of semantic similarity mea-
sures have been developed to support natural language processing tasks
such as word sense disambiguation. This paper combines the two ap-
proaches and proposes an algorithm that provides a semantic order of
terms based on a semantic relatedness measure. This semantic order
can be exploited by term weighting and term expansion methods.
