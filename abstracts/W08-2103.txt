Combination of features contributes to a
significant improvement in accuracy on
tasks such as part-of-speech (POS) tag-
ging and text chunking, compared with us-
ing atomic features. However, selecting
combination of features on learning with
large-scale and feature-rich training data
requires long training time. We propose a
fast boosting-based algorithm for learning
rules represented by combination of fea-
tures. Our algorithm constructs a set of
rules by repeating the process to select sev-
eral rules from a small proportion of can-
didate rules. The candidate rules are gen-
erated from a subset of all the features with
a technique similar to beam search. Then
we propose POS tagging and text chunk-
ing based on our learning algorithm. Our
tagger and chunker use candidate POS tags
or chunk tags of each word collected from
automatically tagged data. We evaluate
our methods with English POS tagging and
text chunking. The experimental results
show that the training time of our algo-
rithm are about 50 times faster than Sup-
port Vector Machines with polynomial ker-
nel on the average while maintaining state-
of-the-art accuracy and faster classification
speed.
