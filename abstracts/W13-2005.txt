The Genia Event (GE) extraction task of
the BioNLP Shared Task addresses the ex-
traction of biomedical events from the nat-
ural language text of the published litera-
ture. In our submission, we modified an
existing system for learning of event pat-
terns via dependency parse subgraphs to
utilise a more accurate parser and signifi-
cantly more, but noisier, training data. We
explore the impact of these two aspects of
the system and conclude that the change in
parser limits recall to an extent that cannot
be offset by the large quantities of training
data. However, our extensions of the sys-
tem to extract modification events shows
promise.
