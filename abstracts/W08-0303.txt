In this paper a new discriminative word align-
ment method is presented. This approach
models directly the alignment matrix by a con-
ditional random field (CRF) and so no restric-
tions to the alignments have to be made. Fur-
thermore, it is easy to add features and so all
available information can be used. Since the
structure of the CRFs can get complex, the in-
ference can only be done approximately and
the standard algorithms had to be adapted. In
addition, different methods to train the model
have been developed. Using this approach the
alignment quality could be improved by up
to 23 percent for 3 different language pairs
compared to a combination of both IBM4-
alignments. Furthermore the word alignment
was used to generate new phrase tables. These
could improve the translation quality signifi-
cantly.
