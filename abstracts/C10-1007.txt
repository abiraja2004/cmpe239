We propose a series of learned arc fil-
ters to speed up graph-based dependency
parsing. A cascade of filters identify im-
plausible head-modifier pairs, with time
complexity that is first linear, and then
quadratic in the length of the sentence.
The linear filters reliably predict, in con-
text, words that are roots or leaves of de-
pendency trees, and words that are likely
to have heads on their left or right. We
use this information to quickly prune arcs
from the dependency graph. More than
78% of total arcs are pruned while retain-
ing 99.5% of the true dependencies. These
filters improve the speed of two state-of-
the-art dependency parsers, with low over-
head and negligible loss in accuracy.
