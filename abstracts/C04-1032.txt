In this paper, we address the word
alignment problem for statistical machine
translation. We aim at creating a sym-
metric word alignment allowing for reli-
able one-to-many and many-to-one word
relationships. We perform the iterative
alignment training in the source-to-target
and the target-to-source direction with
the well-known IBM and HMM alignment
models. Using these models, we robustly
estimate the local costs of aligning a source
word and a target word in each sentence
pair. Then, we use efficient graph algo-
rithms to determine the symmetric align-
ment with minimal total costs (i. e. max-
imal alignment probability). We evalu-
ate the automatic alignments created in
this way on the German?English Verb-
mobil task and the French?English Cana-
dian Hansards task. We show statistically
significant improvements of the alignment
quality compared to the best results re-
ported so far. On the Verbmobil task,
we achieve an improvement of more than
1% absolute over the baseline error rate of
4.7%.
