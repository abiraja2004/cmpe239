We apply the Stat-XFER statistical transfer
machine translation framework to the task of
translating from French and German into En-
glish. We introduce statistical methods within
our framework that allow for the principled
extraction of syntax-based transfer rules from
parallel corpora given word alignments and
constituency parses. Performance is evaluated
on test sets from the 2007 WMT shared task.
