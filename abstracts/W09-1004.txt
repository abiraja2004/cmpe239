The phenomenon of meaning-preserving
corrections given by an adult to a child
involves several aspects: (1) the child
produces an incorrect utterance, which
the adult nevertheless understands, (2) the
adult produces a correct utterance with the
same meaning and (3) the child recognizes
the adult utterance as having the same
meaning as its previous utterance, and
takes that as a signal that its previous ut-
terance is not correct according to the adult
grammar. An adequate model of this phe-
nomenon must incorporate utterances and
meanings, account for how the child and
adult can understand each other?s mean-
ings, and model how meaning-preserving
corrections interact with the child?s in-
creasing mastery of language production.
In this paper we are concerned with how
a learner who has learned to comprehend
utterances might go about learning to pro-
duce them.
We consider a model of language com-
prehension and production based on finite
sequential and subsequential transducers.
Utterances are modeled as finite sequences
of words and meanings as finite sequences
of predicates. Comprehension is inter-
preted as a mapping of utterances to mean-
ings and production as a mapping of mean-
ings to utterances. Previous work (Castel-
lanos et al, 1993; Pieraccini et al, 1993)
has applied subsequential transducers and
the OSTIA algorithm to the problem of
learning to comprehend language; here we
apply them to the problem of learning to
produce language. For ten natural lan-
guages and a limited domain of geomet-
ric shapes and their properties and rela-
tions we define sequential transducers to
produce pairs consisting of an utterance
in that language and its meaning. Using
this data we empirically explore the prop-
erties of the OSTIA and DD-OSTIA al-
gorithms for the tasks of learning compre-
hension and production in this domain, to
assess whether they may provide a basis
for a model of meaning-preserving correc-
tions.
