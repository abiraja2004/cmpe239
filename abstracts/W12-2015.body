 
This paper describes a novel Arabic Reading 
Enhancement Tool (ARET) for classroom use, 
which has been built using corpus-based Natu-
ral Language Processing in combination with 
expert linguistic annotation. The NLP tech-
niques include a widely used morphological 
analyzer for Modern Standard Arabic to pro-
vide word-level grammatical details, and a rela-
tional database index of corpus texts to provide 
word concordances. ARET also makes use of a 
commercial Arabic text-to-speech (TTS) sys-
tem to add a speech layer (with male and fe-
male voices) to the Al-Kitaab language 
textbook resources. The system generates test 
questions and distractors, offering teachers and 
students an interesting computer-aided lan-
guage learning tool. We describe the back-
ground and the motivation behind the building 
of ARET, presenting the various components 
and the method used to build the tools.
