This paper presents our approach to dialog
state tracking for the Dialog State Track-
ing Challenge task. In our approach we
use discriminative general structured con-
ditional random fields, instead of tradi-
tional generative directed graphic models,
to incorporate arbitrary overlapping fea-
tures. Our approach outperforms the sim-
ple 1-best tracking approach.
