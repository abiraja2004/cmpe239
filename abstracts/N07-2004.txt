We compare the effect of joint modeling
of phonological features to independent
feature detectors in a Conditional Random
Fields framework. Joint modeling of fea-
tures is achieved by deriving phonological
feature posteriors from the posterior prob-
abilities of the phonemes. We find that
joint modeling provides superior perfor-
mance to the independent models on the
TIMIT phone recognition task. We ex-
plore the effects of varying relationships
between phonological features, and sug-
gest that in an ASR system, phonological
features should be handled as correlated,
rather than independent.
