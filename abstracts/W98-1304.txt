 .  Recent approaches to statistical parsing include those that estimate an approxi- 
mation of a stochastic, lexicalised gr~mm~x directly from a treebank and others that rebuild 
trees with a number of trse-coustructing operators, which are applied in order according 
to a stochastic model when parsing a sentence. In this paper we take an ehtirely di~erent 
approach to statistical parsing, as we propose a method for parsing using a Hidden Markov 
Model. We describe the stochastic model and the tree construction procedure, and we report 
results on the Wall Street Journal Corpus.
