 
This paper describes the participation of 
Universidad Carlos III de Madrid in Task A of 
the TempEval-2 evaluation. The UC3M 
system was originally developed for the 
temporal expressions recognition and 
normalization (TERN task) in Spanish texts, 
according to the TIDES standard. Current 
version supposes an almost-total refactoring of 
the earliest system. Additionally, it has been 
adapted to the TimeML annotation schema 
and a considerable effort has been done with 
the aim of increasing its coverage. It takes a 
rule-based design both in the identification and 
the resolution phases. It adopts an inductive 
approach based on the empirical study of 
frequency of temporal expressions in Spanish 
corpora. Detecting the extent of the temporal 
expressions the system achieved a 
Precision/Recall of 0.90/0.87 whereas, in 
determining the TYPE and VALUE of those 
expressions, system results were 0.91 and 
0.83, respectively.
