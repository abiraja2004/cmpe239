This paper presents a new approach to
phrase-level sentiment analysis that first
determines whether an expression is neu-
tral or polar and then disambiguates the
polarity of the polar expressions. With this
approach, the system is able to automat-
ically identify the contextual polarity for
a large subset of sentiment expressions,
achieving results that are significantly bet-
ter than baseline.
