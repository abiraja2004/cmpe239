This paper presents a machine learning approach
to bare sluice disambiguation in dialogue. We ex-
tract a set of heuristic principles from a corpus-based
sample and formulate them as probabilistic Horn
clauses. We then use the predicates of such clauses
to create a set of domain independent features to an-
notate an input dataset, and run two different ma-
chine learning algorithms: SLIPPER, a rule-based
learning algorithm, and TiMBL, a memory-based
system. Both learners perform well, yielding simi-
lar success rates of approx 90%. The results show
that the features in terms of which we formulate our
heuristic principles have significant predictive power,
and that rules that closely resemble our Horn clauses
can be learnt automatically from these features.
