. Recently, researchers have applied text- and web-mining algorithms 
to mine semantic resources. The result is often a noisy graph of relations be-
tween words. We propose a mathematically rigorous refinement framework, 
which uses path-based analysis, updating the likelihood of a relation between a 
pair of nodes using evidence provided by multiple indirect paths between the 
nodes. Evaluation on refining temporal verb relations in a semantic resource 
called VERBOCEAN showed a 16.1% error reduction after refinement.
