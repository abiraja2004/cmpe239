Compound terms play a surprisingly key role 
in the organization of lexical ontologies. 
However, their inclusion forces one to address 
the issues of completeness and consistency 
that naturally arise from this organizational 
role. In this paper we show how creative 
exploration in the space of literal compounds 
can reveal not only additional compound 
terms to systematically balance an ontology, 
but can also discover new and potentially 
innovative concepts in their own right.
