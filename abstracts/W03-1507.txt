 
Progress in human language technology 
requires increasing amounts of data and 
annotation in a growing variety of lan-
guages.  Research in Named Entity ex-
traction is no exception.  Linguistic Data 
Consortium is creating annotated corpora 
to support information extraction in Eng-
lish, Chinese, Arabic, and other languages 
for a variety of US Government-
sponsored programs.  This paper covers 
the scope of annotation and research tasks 
within these programs, describes some of 
the challenges of multilingual corpus de-
velopment for entity extraction, and con-
cludes with a description of the corpora 
developed to support this research.
