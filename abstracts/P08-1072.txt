This work presents an agenda-based approach
to improve the robustness of the dialog man-
ager by using dialog examples and n-best
recognition hypotheses. This approach sup-
ports n-best hypotheses in the dialog man-
ager and keeps track of the dialog state us-
ing a discourse interpretation algorithm with
the agenda graph and focus stack. Given
the agenda graph and n-best hypotheses, the
system can predict the next system actions
to maximize multi-level score functions. To
evaluate the proposed method, a spoken dia-
log system for a building guidance robot was
developed. Preliminary evaluation shows this
approach would be effective to improve the ro-
bustness of example-based dialog modeling.
