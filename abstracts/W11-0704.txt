Microtexts, like SMS messages, Twitter posts,
and Facebook status updates, are a popular
medium for real-time communication. In this
paper, we investigate the writing conventions
that different groups of users use to express
themselves in microtexts. Our empirical study
investigates properties of lexical transforma-
tions as observed within Twitter microtexts.
The study reveals that different populations of
users exhibit different amounts of shortened
English terms and different shortening styles.
The results reveal valuable insights into how
human language technologies can be effec-
tively applied to microtexts.
