For meaning representations in NLP, we focus
our attention on thematic aspects and concep-
tual vectors. The learning strategy of concep-
tual vectors relies on a morphosyntaxic analy-
sis of human usage dictionary definitions linked
to vector propagation. This analysis currently
doesn?t take into account negation phenomena.
This work aims at studying the antonymy as-
pects of negation, in the larger goal of its inte-
gration into the thematic analysis. We present a
model based on the idea of symmetry compat-
ible with conceptual vectors. Then, we define
antonymy functions which allows the construc-
tion of an antonymous vector and the enumer-
ation of its potentially antinomic lexical items.
Finally, we introduce a measure which evaluates
how a given word is an acceptable antonym for
a term.
