We present an efficient algorithm for the
redundancy elimination problem: Given
an underspecified semantic representation
(USR) of a scope ambiguity, compute an
USR with fewer mutually equivalent read-
ings. The algorithm operates on underspec-
ified chart representations which are de-
rived from dominance graphs; it can be ap-
plied to the USRs computed by large-scale
grammars. We evaluate the algorithm on
a corpus, and show that it reduces the de-
gree of ambiguity significantly while tak-
ing negligible runtime.
