 
Identifying named entities is essential in 
understanding plain texts. Moreover, the 
categories of the named entities are indicative 
of their roles in the texts. In this paper, we 
propose a novel approach, Deep Belief Nets 
(DBN), for the Chinese entity mention 
categorization problem. DBN has very strong 
representation power and it is able to 
elaborately self-train for discovering 
complicated feature combinations. The 
experiments conducted on the Automatic 
Context Extraction (ACE) 2004 data set 
demonstrate the effectiveness of DBN. It 
outperforms the state-of-the-art learning 
models such as SVM or BP neural network.
