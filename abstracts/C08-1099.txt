Psycholinguistic studies suggest a model
of human language processing that 1) per-
forms incremental interpretation of spo-
ken utterances or written text, 2) preserves
ambiguity by maintaining competing anal-
yses in parallel, and 3) operates within
a severely constrained short-term memory
store ? possibly constrained to as few
as four distinct elements. This paper de-
scribes a relatively simple model of lan-
guage as a factored statistical time-series
process that meets all three of the above
desiderata; and presents corpus evidence
that this model is sufficient to parse natu-
rally occurring sentences using human-like
bounds on memory.
