The purpose of this work is to explore
the integration of morphosyntactic infor-
mation into the translation model itself, by
enriching words with their morphosyntac-
tic categories. We investigate word dis-
ambiguation using morphosyntactic cate-
gories, n-best hypotheses reranking, and
the combination of both methods with
word or morphosyntactic n-gram lan-
guage model reranking. Experiments
are carried out on the English-to-Spanish
translation task. Using the morphosyn-
tactic language model alone does not
results in any improvement in perfor-
mance. However, combining morphosyn-
tactic word disambiguation with a word
based 4-gram language model results in a
relative improvement in the BLEU score
of 2.3% on the development set and 1.9%
on the test set.
