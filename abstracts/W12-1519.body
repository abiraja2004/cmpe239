Question answering is an age old AI chal-
lenge. How we approach this challenge is de-
termined by decisions regarding the linguis-
tic and domain knowledge our system will
need, the technical and business acumen of
our users, the interface used to input ques-
tions, and the form in which we should present
answers to a user?s questions. Our approach
to question answering involves the interactive
construction of natural language queries. We
describe and evaluate a question answering
system that provides a point-and-click, web-
based interface in conjunction with a seman-
tic grammar to support user-controlled natural
language question generation. A preliminary
evaluation is performed using a selection of 12
questions based on the Adventure Works sam-
ple database.
