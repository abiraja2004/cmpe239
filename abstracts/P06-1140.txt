This paper presents a method for adapting
a language generator to the strengths and
weaknesses of a synthetic voice, thereby
improving the naturalness of synthetic
speech in a spoken language dialogue sys-
tem. The method trains a discriminative
reranker to select paraphrases that are pre-
dicted to sound natural when synthesized.
The ranker is trained on realizer and syn-
thesizer features in supervised fashion, us-
ing human judgements of synthetic voice
quality on a sample of the paraphrases rep-
resentative of the generator?s capability.
Results from a cross-validation study indi-
cate that discriminative paraphrase rerank-
ing can achieve substantial improvements
in naturalness on average, ameliorating the
problem of highly variable synthesis qual-
ity typically encountered with today?s unit
selection synthesizers.
