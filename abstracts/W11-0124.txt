This paper presents a discourse processing framework based on weighted abduction. We elabo-
rate on ideas described in Hobbs et al (1993) and implement the abductive inference procedure in a
system called Mini-TACITUS. Particular attention is paid to constructing a large and reliable knowl-
edge base for supporting inferences. For this purpose we exploit such lexical-semantic resources as
WordNet and FrameNet. We test the proposed procedure and the obtained knowledge base on the
Recognizing Textual Entailment task using the data sets from the RTE-2 challenge for evaluation. In
addition, we provide an evaluation of the semantic role labeling produced by the system taking the
Frame-Annotated Corpus for Textual Entailment as a gold standard.
