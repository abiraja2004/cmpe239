 
Temporal expressions in texts contain 
significant temporal information. Under-
standing temporal information is very 
useful in many NLP applications, such as 
information extraction, documents sum-
marization and question answering. 
Therefore, the temporal expression nor-
malization which is used for transform-
ing temporal expressions to temporal in-
formation has absorbed many research-
ers? attentions. But previous works, 
whatever the hand-crafted rules-based or 
the machine-learnt rules-based, all can 
not address the actual problem about 
temporal reference in real texts effective-
ly. More specifically, the reference time 
choosing mechanism employed by these 
works is not adaptable to the universal 
implicit times in normalization. Aiming 
at this issue, we introduce a new refer-
ence time choosing mechanism for tem-
poral expression normalization, called 
reference time dynamic-choosing, which 
assigns the appropriate reference times to 
different classes of implicit temporal ex-
pressions dynamically when normalizing. 
And then, the solution to temporal ex-
pression defuzzification by scenario de-
pendences among temporal expressions 
is discussed. Finally, we evaluate the 
system on a substantial corpus collected 
by Chinese news articles and obtained 
more promising results than compared 
methods.
