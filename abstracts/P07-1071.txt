We describe a novel neural network archi-
tecture for the problem of semantic role la-
beling. Many current solutions are compli-
cated, consist of several stages and hand-
built features, and are too slow to be applied
as part of real applications that require such
semantic labels, partly because of their use
of a syntactic parser (Pradhan et al, 2004;
Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002). Our method in-
stead learns a direct mapping from source
sentence to semantic tags for a given pred-
icate without the aid of a parser or a chun-
ker. Our resulting system obtains accuracies
comparable to the current state-of-the-art at
a fraction of the computational cost.
