In this paper we explore the benefits from
and shortcomings of entity-driven noun
phrase rewriting for multi-document sum-
marization of news. The approach leads to
20% to 50% different content in the sum-
mary in comparison to an extractive sum-
mary produced using the same underlying
approach, showing the promise the tech-
nique has to offer. In addition, summaries
produced using entity-driven rewrite have
higher linguistic quality than a comparison
non-extractive system. Some improvement
is also seen in content selection over extrac-
tive summarization as measured by pyramid
method evaluation.
