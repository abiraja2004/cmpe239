We describe a new approach to SMT adapta-
tion that weights out-of-domain phrase pairs
according to their relevance to the target do-
main, determined by both how similar to it
they appear to be, and whether they belong to
general language or not. This extends previ-
ous work on discriminative weighting by us-
ing a finer granularity, focusing on the prop-
erties of instances rather than corpus com-
ponents, and using a simpler training proce-
dure. We incorporate instance weighting into
a mixture-model framework, and find that it
yields consistent improvements over a wide
range of baselines.
