Discovering synonyms and other related words
among the words in a document collection can
be seen as a clustering problem, where we ex-
pect the words in a cluster to be closely related
to one another. The intuition is that words oc-
curring in similar contexts tend to convey simi-
lar meaning.
We introduce a way to use translation dictio-
naries for several languages to evaluate the rate
of synonymy found in the word clusters. We also
apply the information radius to calculating sim-
ilarities between words using a full dependency
syntactic feature space, and introduce a method
for similarity recalculation during clustering as
a fast approximation of the high-dimensional
feature space. Finally, we show that 69-79% of
the words in the clusters we discover are useful
for thesaurus construction.
