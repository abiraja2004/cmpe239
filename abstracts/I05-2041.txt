In this paper, we propose a tree annota-
tion tool using a parser in order to build
a treebank. For the purpose of mini-
mizing manual effort without any mod-
ification of the parser, it performs two-
phase parsing for the intra-structure of
each segment and the inter-structure af-
ter segmenting a sentence. Experimen-
tal results show that it can reduce man-
ual effort about 24.5% as compared
with a tree annotation tool without seg-
mentation because an annotation?s in-
tervention related to cancellation and
reconstruction remarkably decrease al-
though it requires the annotator to seg-
ment some long sentence.
