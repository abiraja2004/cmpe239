We propose a flexible and effective frame-
work for extracting a bilingual dictionary
from comparable corpora. Our approach
is based on a novel combination of topic
modeling and word alignment techniques.
Intuitively, our approach works by con-
verting a comparable document-aligned
corpus into a parallel topic-aligned cor-
pus, then learning word alignments us-
ing co-occurrence statistics. This topic-
aligned corpus is similar in structure to the
sentence-aligned corpus frequently used in
statistical machine translation, enabling us
to exploit advances in word alignment re-
search. Unlike many previous work, our
framework does not require any language-
specific knowledge for initialization. Fur-
thermore, our framework attempts to han-
dle polysemy by allowing multiple trans-
lation probability models for each word.
On a large-scale Wikipedia corpus, we
demonstrate that our framework reliably
extracts high-precision translation pairs on
a wide variety of comparable data condi-
tions.
