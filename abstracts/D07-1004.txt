Previous machine learning techniques for
answer selection in question answering
(QA) have required question-answer train-
ing pairs. It has been too expensive and
labor-intensive, however, to collect these
training pairs. This paper presents a novel
unsupervised support vector machine (U-
SVM) classifier for answer selection, which
is independent of language and does not re-
quire hand-tagged training pairs. The key
ideas are the following: 1. unsupervised
learning of training data for the classifier by
clustering web search results; and 2. select-
ing the correct answer from the candidates
by classifying the question. The compara-
tive experiments demonstrate that the pro-
posed approach significantly outperforms
the retrieval-based model (Retrieval-M), the
supervised SVM classifier (S-SVM), and the
pattern-based model (Pattern-M) for answer
selection. Moreover, the cross-model com-
parison showed that the performance rank-
ing of these models was: U-SVM > Pattern-
M > S-SVM > Retrieval-M.
