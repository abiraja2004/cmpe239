 
RASTA (Rhetorical Structure Theory 
Analyzer), a system for automatic discourse 
analysis, reliably, identifies rhetorical 
relations present m written discourse by 
examining information available in syntactic 
and logical form analyses. Since there is a 
many-to-many relationship between 
rhetorical relations and elements of linguistic 
form, RASTA identifies relations by the 
convergence of a number of pieces of 
evidence, many of which would be 
insufficient in isolation to reliably identify a 
relation.
