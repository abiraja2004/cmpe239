This paper addresses a novel task of 
detecting sub-topic correspondence in a 
pair of text fragments, enhancing common 
notions of text similarity. This task is 
addressed by coupling corresponding term 
subsets through bipartite clustering. The 
paper presents a cost-based clustering 
scheme and compares it with a bipartite 
version of the single-link method, 
providing illustrating results.
