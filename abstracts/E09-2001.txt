Frolog is a text-adventure game whose goal
is to serve as a laboratory for testing prag-
matic theories of accommodation. To
this end, rather than implementing ad-hoc
mechanisms for each task that is neces-
sary in such a conversational agent, Frolog
integrates recently developed tools from
computational linguistics, theorem prov-
ing and artificial intelligence planning.
