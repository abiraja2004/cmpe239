This paper presents the results of the PASCAL
Challenge on Grammar Induction, a compe-
tition in which competitors sought to predict
part-of-speech and dependency syntax from
text. Although many previous competitions
have featured dependency grammars or parts-
of-speech, these were invariably framed as
supervised learning and/or domain adaption.
This is the first challenge to evaluate unsuper-
vised induction systems, a sub-field of syntax
which is rapidly becoming very popular. Our
challenge made use of a 10 different treebanks
annotated in a range of different linguistic for-
malisms and covering 9 languages. We pro-
vide an overview of the approaches taken by
the participants, and evaluate their results on
each dataset using a range of different evalua-
tion metrics.
