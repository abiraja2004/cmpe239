We propose a simple but effective method
for enriching dictionary definitions with
images based on image searches. Vari-
ous query expansion methods using syn-
onyms/hypernyms (or related words) are
evaluated. We demonstrate that our
method is effective in obtaining high-
precision images that complement dictio-
nary entries, even for words with abstract
or multiple meanings.
