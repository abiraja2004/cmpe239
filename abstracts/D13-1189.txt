 
Microblog messages pose severe challenges 
for current sentiment analysis techniques due 
to some inherent characteristics such as the 
length limit and informal writing style. In this 
paper, we study the problem of extracting 
opinion targets of Chinese microblog messag-
es. Such fine-grained word-level task has not 
been well investigated in microblogs yet. We 
propose an unsupervised label propagation al-
gorithm to address the problem. The opinion 
targets of all messages in a topic are collec-
tively extracted based on the assumption that 
similar messages may focus on similar opinion 
targets. Topics in microblogs are identified by 
hashtags or using clustering algorithms. Ex-
perimental results on Chinese microblogs 
show the effectiveness of our framework and 
algorithms.
