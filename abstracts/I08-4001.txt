 
In this paper, we propose an example-based 
decoder for a statistical machine translation 
(SMT) system, which is used for spoken 
language machine translation. In this way, 
it will help to solve the re-ordering problem 
and other problems for spoken language 
MT, such as lots of omissions, idioms etc. 
Through experiments, we show that this 
approach obtains improvements over the 
baseline on a Chinese-English spoken lan-
guage translation task.
