This paper presents the SemEval-2010
task on Coreference Resolution in Multi-
ple Languages. The goal was to evaluate
and compare automatic coreference reso-
lution systems for six different languages
(Catalan, Dutch, English, German, Italian,
and Spanish) in four evaluation settings
and using four different metrics. Such a
rich scenario had the potential to provide
insight into key issues concerning corefer-
ence resolution: (i) the portability of sys-
tems across languages, (ii) the relevance of
different levels of linguistic information,
and (iii) the behavior of scoring metrics.
