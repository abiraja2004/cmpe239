To overcome the problem of not hav-
ing enough manually labeled relation in-
stances for supervised relation extraction
methods, in this paper we propose a label
propagation (LP) based semi-supervised
learning algorithm for relation extraction
task to learn from both labeled and unla-
beled data. Evaluation on the ACE corpus
showed when only a few labeled examples
are available, our LP based relation extrac-
tion can achieve better performance than
SVM and another bootstrapping method.
