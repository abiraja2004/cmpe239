 
In this paper, we describe the experimental 
settings we adopted in the context of the 2010 
CoNLL shared task for detecting sentences 
containing uncertainty. The classification results 
reported on are obtained using discriminative 
learning with features essentially incorporating 
lexical information. Hyper-parameters are tuned 
for each domain: using BioScope training data 
for the biomedical domain and Wikipedia 
training data for the Wikipedia test set. By 
allowing an efficient handling of combinations of 
large-scale input features, the discriminative 
approach we adopted showed highly competitive 
empirical results for hedge detection on the 
Wikipedia dataset: our system is ranked as the 
first with an F-score of 60.17%.
