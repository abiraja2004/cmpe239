Automatic detection of general relations
between short texts is a complex task that
cannot be carried out only relying on lan-
guage models and bag-of-words. There-
fore, learning methods to exploit syntax
and semantics are required. In this pa-
per, we present a new kernel for the repre-
sentation of shallow semantic information
along with a comprehensive study on ker-
nel methods for the exploitation of syntac-
tic/semantic structures for short text pair
categorization. Our experiments with Sup-
port Vector Machines on question/answer
classification show that our kernels can be
used to greatly improve system accuracy.
