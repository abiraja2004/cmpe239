This paper presents a semantic class
prediction model of Chinese two-
character compound words based on
a character ontology, which is set to
be a feasible conceptual knowledge re-
source grounded in Chinese characters.
The experiment we conduct yields sat-
isfactory results which turn out to be
that the task of semantic prediction of
two-character words could be greatly
facilitated using Chinese characters as
a knowledge resource.
