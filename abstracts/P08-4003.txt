Developing a full coreference system able
to run all the way from raw text to seman-
tic interpretation is a considerable engineer-
ing effort, yet there is very limited avail-
ability of off-the shelf tools for researchers
whose interests are not in coreference, or for
researchers who want to concentrate on a
specific aspect of the problem. We present
BART, a highly modular toolkit for de-
veloping coreference applications. In the
Johns Hopkins workshop on using lexical
and encyclopedic knowledge for entity dis-
ambiguation, the toolkit was used to ex-
tend a reimplementation of the Soon et al
(2001) proposal with a variety of additional
syntactic and knowledge-based features, and
experiment with alternative resolution pro-
cesses, preprocessing tools, and classifiers.
