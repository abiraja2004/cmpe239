This paper describes a spoken dialog Q-
A system as a substitution for call centers.
The system is capable of making dialogs
for both fixing speech recognition errors
and for clarifying vague questions, based
on only large text knowledge base. We in-
troduce two measures to make dialogs for
fixing recognition errors. An experimental
evaluation shows the advantages of these
measures.
