 
Vocabulary tutors need word sense disambig-
uation (WSD) in order to provide exercises 
and assessments that match the sense of words 
being taught. Using expert annotators to build 
a WSD training set for all the words supported 
would be too expensive. Crowdsourcing that 
task seems to be a good solution.  However, a 
first required step is to define what the possi-
ble sense labels to assign to word occurrence 
are.  This can be viewed as a clustering task 
on dictionary definitions. This paper evaluates 
the possibility of using Amazon Mechanical 
Turk (MTurk) to carry out that prerequisite 
step to WSD.  We propose two different ap-
proaches to using a crowd to accomplish clus-
tering: one where the worker has a global 
view of the task, and one where only a local 
view is available.  We discuss how we can 
aggregate multiple workers? clusters together, 
as well as pros and cons of our two approach-
es.  We show that either approach has an inte-
rannotator agreement with experts that 
corresponds to the agreement between ex-
perts, and so using MTurk to cluster dictio-
nary definitions appears to be a reliable 
approach.
