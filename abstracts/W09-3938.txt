In real-world applications, modelling di-
alogue as a POMDP requires the use of
a summary space for the dialogue state
representation to ensure tractability. Sub-
optimal estimation of the value func-
tion governing the selection of system re-
sponses can then be obtained using a grid-
based approach on the belief space. In
this work, the Monte-Carlo control tech-
nique is extended so as to reduce training
over-fitting and to improve robustness to
semantic noise in the user input. This tech-
nique uses a database of belief vector pro-
totypes to choose the optimal system ac-
tion. A locally weighted k-nearest neigh-
bor scheme is introduced to smooth the de-
cision process by interpolating the value
function, resulting in higher user simula-
tion performance.
