The BioNLP Shared Task 2013 is organ-
ised to further advance the field of in-
formation extraction in biomedical texts.
This paper describes our entry in the Gene
Regulation Network in Bacteria (GRN)
part, for which our system finished in sec-
ond place (out of five). To tackle this re-
lation extraction task, we employ a basic
Support Vector Machine framework. We
discuss our findings in constructing local
and contextual features, that augment our
precision with as much as 7.5%. We touch
upon the interaction type hierarchy inher-
ent in the problem, and the importance of
the evaluation procedure to encourage ex-
ploration of that structure.
