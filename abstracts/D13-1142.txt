In this paper we present a novel approach to
automatic creation of anchor texts for hyper-
links in a document pointing to similar doc-
uments. Methods used in this approach rank
parts of a document based on the similarity
to a presumably related document. Ranks are
then used to automatically construct the best
anchor text for a link inside original document
to the compared document. A number of dif-
ferent methods from information retrieval and
natural language processing are adapted for
this task. Automatically constructed anchor
texts are manually evaluated in terms of relat-
edness to linked documents and compared to
baseline consisting of originally inserted an-
chor texts. Additionally we use crowdsourc-
ing for evaluation of original anchors and au-
tomatically constructed anchors. Results show
that our best adapted methods rival the preci-
sion of the baseline method.
