Parsing in type logical grammars amounts
to theorem proving in a substructural
logic. This paper takes the proof net
presentation of Lambek?s associative cal-
culus as a case study. It introduces
switch graphs for online maintenance
of the Danos-Regnier acyclicity condi-
tion on proof nets. Early detection of
Danos-Regnier acyclicity violations sup-
ports early failure in shift-reduce parsers.
Normalized switch graphs represent the
combinatorial potential of a set of anal-
yses derived from lexical and structural
ambiguities. Packing these subanalyses
and memoizing the results leads directly
to a dynamic programming algorithm for
Lambek grammars.
