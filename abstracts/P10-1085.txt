This paper proposes to use monolingual 
collocations to improve Statistical Ma-
chine Translation (SMT). We make use 
of the collocation probabilities, which are 
estimated from monolingual corpora, in 
two aspects, namely improving word 
alignment for various kinds of SMT sys-
tems and improving phrase table for 
phrase-based SMT. The experimental re-
sults show that our method improves the 
performance of both word alignment and 
translation quality significantly. As com-
pared to baseline systems, we achieve ab-
solute improvements of 2.40 BLEU score 
on a phrase-based SMT system and 1.76 
BLEU score on a parsing-based SMT 
system.
