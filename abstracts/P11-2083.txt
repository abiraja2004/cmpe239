We study in this paper the problem of enhanc-
ing the comparability of bilingual corpora in
order to improve the quality of bilingual lexi-
cons extracted from comparable corpora. We
introduce a clustering-based approach for en-
hancing corpus comparability which exploits
the homogeneity feature of the corpus, and
finally preserves most of the vocabulary of
the original corpus. Our experiments illus-
trate the well-foundedness of this method and
show that the bilingual lexicons obtained from
the homogeneous corpus are of better quality
than the lexicons obtained with previous ap-
proaches.
