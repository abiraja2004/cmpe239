We present a novel answer summarization
method for community Question Answering
services (cQAs) to address the problem of ?in-
complete answer?, i.e., the ?best answer? of a
complex multi-sentence question misses valu-
able information that is contained in other an-
swers. In order to automatically generate a
novel and non-redundant community answer
summary, we segment the complex original
multi-sentence question into several sub ques-
tions and then propose a general Conditional
Random Field (CRF) based answer summary
method with group L1 regularization. Vari-
ous textual and non-textual QA features are
explored. Specifically, we explore four differ-
ent types of contextual factors, namely, the in-
formation novelty and non-redundancy mod-
eling for local and non-local sentence inter-
actions under question segmentation. To fur-
ther unleash the potential of the abundant cQA
features, we introduce the group L1 regu-
larization for feature learning. Experimental
results on a Yahoo! Answers dataset show
that our proposed method significantly outper-
forms state-of-the-art methods on cQA sum-
marization task.
