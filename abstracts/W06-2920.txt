Each year the Conference on Com-
putational Natural Language Learning
(CoNLL)1 features a shared task, in which
participants train and test their systems on
exactly the same data sets, in order to bet-
ter compare systems. The tenth CoNLL
(CoNLL-X) saw a shared task on Multi-
lingual Dependency Parsing. In this pa-
per, we describe how treebanks for 13 lan-
guages were converted into the same de-
pendency format and how parsing perfor-
mance was measured. We also give an
overview of the parsing approaches that
participants took and the results that they
achieved. Finally, we try to draw gen-
eral conclusions about multi-lingual pars-
ing: What makes a particular language,
treebank or annotation scheme easier or
harder to parse and which phenomena are
challenging for any dependency parser?
