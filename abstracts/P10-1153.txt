Constructing an encoding of a concept lat-
tice using short bit vectors allows for ef-
ficient computation of join operations on
the lattice. Join is the central operation
any unification-based parser must support.
We extend the traditional bit vector encod-
ing, which represents join failure using the
zero vector, to count any vector with less
than a fixed number of one bits as failure.
This allows non-joinable elements to share
bits, resulting in a smaller vector size. A
constraint solver is used to construct the
encoding, and a variety of techniques are
employed to find near-optimal solutions
and handle timeouts. An evaluation is pro-
vided comparing the extended representa-
tion of failure with traditional bit vector
techniques.
