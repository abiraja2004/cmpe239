Training a statistical machine translation
starts with tokenizing a parallel corpus.
Some languages such as Chinese do not in-
corporate spacing in their writing system,
which creates a challenge for tokenization.
Moreover, morphologically rich languages
such as Korean present an even bigger
challenge, since optimal token boundaries
for machine translation in these languages
are often unclear. Both rule-based solu-
tions and statistical solutions are currently
used. In this paper, we present unsuper-
vised methods to solve tokenization prob-
lem. Our methods incorporate informa-
tion available from parallel corpus to de-
termine a good tokenization for machine
translation.
