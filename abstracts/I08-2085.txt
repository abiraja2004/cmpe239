Search results clustering helps users to
browse the search results and locate what
they are looking for. In the search result
clustering, the label selection which anno-
tates a meaningful phrase for each cluster
becomes the most fundamental issue. In this
paper, we present a new method of using
the language modeling approach over Dmoz
for label selection, namely label language
model. Experimental results show that our
method is helpful to obtain meaningful clus-
tering labels of search results.
