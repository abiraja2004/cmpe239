WordNet::SenseRelate::AllWords is a freely
available open source Perl package that as-
signs a sense to every content word (known
to WordNet) in a text. It finds the sense of
each word that is most related to the senses
of surrounding words, based on measures
found in WordNet::Similarity. This method is
shown to be competitive with results from re-
cent evaluations including SENSEVAL-2 and
SENSEVAL-3.
