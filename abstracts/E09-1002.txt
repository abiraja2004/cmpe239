This paper present an overview of some
emerging trends in the application of NLP
in the domain of the so-called Digital Hu-
manities and discusses the role and nature
of metadata, the annotation layer that is so
characteristic of documents that play a role
in the scholarly practises of the humani-
ties. It is explained how metadata are the
key to the added value of techniques such
as text and link mining, and an outline is
given of what measures could be taken to
increase the chances for a bright future for
the old ties between NLP and the humani-
ties. There is no data like metadata!
