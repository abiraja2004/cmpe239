The Arabic language has far richer sys-
tems of inflection and derivation than En-
glish which has very little morphology.
This morphology difference causes a large
gap between the vocabulary sizes in any
given parallel training corpus. Segmen-
tation of inflected Arabic words is a way
to smooth its highly morphological na-
ture. In this paper, we describe some
statistically and linguistically motivated
methods for Arabic word segmentation.
Then, we show the efficiency of proposed
methods on the Arabic-English BTEC and
NIST tasks.
