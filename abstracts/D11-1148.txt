Attempts to profile authors according to their
characteristics extracted from textual data, in-
cluding native language, have drawn attention
in recent years, via various machine learn-
ing approaches utilising mostly lexical fea-
tures. Drawing on the idea of contrastive
analysis, which postulates that syntactic er-
rors in a text are to some extent influenced by
the native language of an author, this paper
explores the usefulness of syntactic features
for native language identification. We take
two types of parse substructure as features?
horizontal slices of trees, and the more gen-
eral feature schemas from discriminative parse
reranking?and show that using this kind of
syntactic feature results in an accuracy score
in classification of seven native languages of
around 80%, an error reduction of more than
30%.
