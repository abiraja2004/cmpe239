 
Several preprocessing steps are necessary 
in various problems of automatic Natural 
Language Processing. One major step is 
named-entity detection, which is relatively 
simple in English, because such entities 
start with an uppercase character. For In-
dian scripts like Bangla, no such indicator 
exists and the problem of identification is 
more complex, especially for human 
names, which may be common nouns and 
adjectives as well. In this paper we have 
proposed a three-stage approach of named-
entity detection. The stages are based on 
the use of Named-Entity (NE) dictionary, 
rules for named-entity and left-right co-
occurrence statistics. Experimental results 
obtained on Anandabazar Patrika (Most 
popular Bangla newspaper) corpus are 
quite encouraging.
