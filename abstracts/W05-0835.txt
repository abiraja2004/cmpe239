A new model for statistical translation is
presented. A novel feature of this model
is that the alignments it produces are hier-
archically arranged. The generative pro-
cess begins by splitting the input sen-
tence in two parts. Each of the parts is
translated by a recursive application of
the model and the resulting translation
are then concatenated. If the sentence
is small enough, a simpler model (in our
case IBM?s model 1) is applied.
The training of the model is explained. Fi-
nally, the model is evaluated using the cor-
pora from a large vocabulary shared task.
