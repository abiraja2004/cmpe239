. In this paper, we present an empirical study that utilizes
morph-syntactical information to improve translation quality. With three
kinds of language pairs matched according to morph-syntactical similar-
ity or difference, we investigate the effects of various morpho-syntactical
information, such as base form, part-of-speech, and the relative positional
information of a word in a statistical machine translation framework.
We learn not only translation models but also word-based/class-based
language models by manipulating morphological and relative positional
information. And we integrate the models into a log-linear model. Ex-
periments on multilingual translations showed that such morphological
information as part-of-speech and base form are effective for improving
performance in morphologically rich language pairs and that the relative
positional features in a word group are useful for reordering the local
word orders. Moreover, the use of a class-based n-gram language model
improves performance by alleviating the data sparseness problem in a
word-based language model.
