This paper presents the current results of
an ongoing research project on corpus
distribution of prepositions and pronouns
within Polish preposition-pronoun con-
tractions. The goal of the project is to pro-
vide a quantitative description of Polish
preposition-pronoun contractions taking
into consideration morphosyntactic prop-
erties of their components. It is expected
that the results will provide a basis for a re-
vision of the traditionally assumed inflec-
tional paradigms of Polish pronouns and,
thus, for a possible remodeling of these
paradigms. The results of corpus-based in-
vestigations of the distribution of preposi-
tions within preposition-pronoun contrac-
tions can be used for grammar-theoretical
and lexicographic purposes.
