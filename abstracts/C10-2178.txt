We present a probabilistic, salience-based
approach to the interpretation of pointing
gestures together with spoken utterances.
Our mechanism models dependencies be-
tween spatial and temporal aspects of ges-
tures and features of utterances. For our
evaluation, we collected a corpus of re-
quests which optionally included point-
ing. Our results show that pointing infor-
mation improves interpretation accuracy.
