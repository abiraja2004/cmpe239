In this paper we extend our work described
in (Dinu et al 2011) by adding more con-
jugational rules to the labelling system in-
troduced there, in an attempt to capture
the entire dataset of Romanian verbs ex-
tracted from (Barbu, 2007), and we em-
ploy machine learning techniques to predict
a verb?s correct label (which says what con-
jugational pattern it follows) when only the
infinitive form is given.
