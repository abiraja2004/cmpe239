In this work, we present a new semantic lan-
guage modeling approach to model news sto-
ries in the Topic Detection and Tracking (TDT)
task. In the new approach, we build a unigram
language model for each semantic class in a
news story. We also cast the link detection sub-
task of TDT as a two-class classification prob-
lem in which the features of each sample con-
sist of the generative log-likelihood ratios from
each semantic class. We then compute a lin-
ear discriminant classifier using the perceptron
learning algorithm on the training set. Results
on the test set show a marginal improvement
over the unigram performance, but are not very
encouraging on the whole.
