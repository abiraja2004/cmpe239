Our work in this area started as a re-
search project but when L2F joined TecnoVoz,
a Portuguese national consortium including
Academia and Industry partners, our focus
shifted to real-time professional solutions.
The integration of our domain-independent
Spoken Dialogue System (SDS) framework
into commercial products led to a major
reengineering process.
This paper describes the changes that the
framework went through and that deeply af-
fected its entire architecture. The communi-
cation core was enhanced, the modules inter-
faces were redefined for an easier integration,
the SDS deployment process was optimized
and the framework robustness was improved.
The work was done according to software en-
gineering guidelines and making use of design
patterns.
