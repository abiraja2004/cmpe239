In this paper we present a demonstra-
tion of a multilingual generalization of
Word-Class Lattices (WCLs), a super-
vised lattice-based model used to identify
textual definitions and extract hypernyms
from them. Lattices are learned from a
dataset of automatically-annotated defini-
tions from Wikipedia. We release a Java
API for the programmatic use of multilin-
gual WCLs in three languages (English,
French and Italian), as well as a Web ap-
plication for definition and hypernym ex-
traction from user-provided sentences.
