The role of search queries, as available within
query sessions or in isolation from one an-
other, in examined in the context of ranking
the class labels (e.g., brazilian cities, busi-
ness centers, hilly sites) extracted from Web
documents for various instances (e.g., rio de
janeiro). The co-occurrence of a class la-
bel and an instance, in the same query or
within the same query session, is used to re-
inforce the estimated relevance of the class la-
bel for the instance. Experiments over eval-
uation sets of instances associated with Web
search queries illustrate the higher quality of
the query-based, re-ranked class labels, rel-
ative to ranking baselines using document-
based counts.
