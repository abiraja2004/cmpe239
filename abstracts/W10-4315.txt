In this paper we present a reference model
based on Reference Domain Theory that
can work both in interpretation and gener-
ation. We introduce a formalization of key
concepts of RDT, the interpretation and
generation algorithms and show an exam-
ple of behavior in the dynamic, asymmetric
and multimodal GIVE environment.
