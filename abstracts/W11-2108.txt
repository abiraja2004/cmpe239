SemPOS is an automatic metric of machine
translation quality for Czech and English fo-
cused on content words. It correlates well
with human judgments but it is computation-
ally costly and hard to adapt to other lan-
guages because it relies on a deep-syntactic
analysis of the system output and the refer-
ence. To remedy this, we attempt at approxi-
mating SemPOS using only tagger output and
a few heuristics. At a little expense in corre-
lation to human judgments, we can evaluate
MT systems much faster. Additionally, we de-
scribe our submission to the Tunable Metrics
Task in WMT11.
