In this paper, we examine how to im-
prove the precision and recall of docu-
ment clustering by utilizing meta-data.
We use meta-data through NewsML tags 
to assist clustering and show that this ap-
proach is effective through experiments 
on sample news data. Experimental result 
shows that clustering using NewsML 
could improve average recall and preci-
sion over the same without using
NewsML by about 10%. Our algorithm 
facilitates effective e-business for the
news media and publishing industry to
empower e-business.
