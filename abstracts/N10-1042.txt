In this paper we examine different linguistic features
for sentimental polarity classification, and perform a
comparative study on this task between blog and re-
view data. We found that results on blog are much
worse than reviews and investigated two methods
to improve the performance on blogs. First we ex-
plored information retrieval based topic analysis to
extract relevant sentences to the given topics for po-
larity classification. Second, we adopted an adaptive
method where we train classifiers from review data
and incorporate their hypothesis as features. Both
methods yielded performance gain for polarity clas-
sification on blog data.
