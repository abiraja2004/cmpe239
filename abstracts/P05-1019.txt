Processing discourse connectives is im-
portant for tasks such as discourse parsing
and generation. For these tasks, it is use-
ful to know which connectives can signal
the same coherence relations. This paper
presents experiments into modelling the
substitutability of discourse connectives.
It shows that substitutability effects dis-
tributional similarity. A novel variance-
based function for comparing probability
distributions is found to assist in predict-
ing substitutability.
