A pseudoword is a composite comprised of two
or more words chosen at random; the individual
occurrences of the original words within a text
are replaced by their conflation. Pseudowords
are a useful mechanism for evaluating the im-
pact of word sense ambiguity in many NLP
applications. However, the standard method
for constructing pseudowords has some draw-
backs. Because the constituent words are cho-
sen at random, the word contexts that surround
pseudowords do not necessarily reflect the con-
texts that real ambiguous words occur in. This
in turn leads to an optimistic upper bound on
algorithm performance. To address these draw-
backs, we propose the use of lexical categories
to create more realistic pseudowords, and eval-
uate the results of different variations of this
idea against the standard approach.
