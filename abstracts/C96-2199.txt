 
We are studying under which constraints 
structured lexical data can bemade, at the same 
time, widely available to the general public 
(freely ornot), electronically supported, published 
and reasonably protected frompiracy? A three 
facet approach- with dictionary tools, web 
servers and e-mail servers -seems to be effective. 
We illustrate our views with Alex, a 
genericdictionary tool, which is used with a 
French-English-Malay dictionary. Thevery 
distinction between output, logical and coding 
formats is made. Storage is based onthe latter and 
output formats are dynamically generated on the 
fly atrequest times - making the tool usable in 
many configurations. Keeping the data 
structuredis necessary to make them usable also 
by automated processes and to allowdynamic 
filtering.
