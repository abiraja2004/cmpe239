In this paper, we present our linguistically-
enriched Bulgarian-to-English statistical ma-
chine translation model, which takes a sta-
tistical machine translation (SMT) system as
backbone various linguistic features as fac-
tors. The motivation is to take advantages of
both the robustness of the SMT system and
the rich linguistic knowledge from morpho-
logical analysis as well as the hand-crafted
grammar resources. The automatic evaluation
has shown promising results and our extensive
manual analysis confirms the high quality of
the translation the system delivers. The whole
framework is also extensible for incorporating
information provided by different sources.
