Protein modifications, in particular post-
translational modifications, have a central role
in bringing about the full repertoire of pro-
tein functions, and the identification of spe-
cific protein modifications is important for
understanding biological systems. This task
presents a number of opportunities for the au-
tomatic support of manual curation efforts.
However, the sheer number of different types
of protein modifications is a daunting chal-
lenge for automatic extraction that has so far
not been met in full, with most studies focus-
ing on single modifications or a few prominent
ones. In this work, aim to meet this challenge:
we analyse protein modification types through
ontologies, databases, and literature and intro-
duce a corpus of 360 abstracts manually anno-
tated in the BioNLP Shared Task event repre-
sentation for over 4500 mentions of proteins
and 1000 statements of modification events of
nearly 40 different types. We argue that to-
gether with existing resources, this corpus pro-
vides sufficient coverage of modification types
to make effectively exhaustive extraction of
protein modifications from text feasible.
