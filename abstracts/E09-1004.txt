We present a classifier to predict con-
textual polarity of subjective phrases in
a sentence. Our approach features lexi-
cal scoring derived from the Dictionary of
Affect in Language (DAL) and extended
through WordNet, allowing us to automat-
ically score the vast majority of words in
our input avoiding the need for manual la-
beling. We augment lexical scoring with
n-gram analysis to capture the effect of
context. We combine DAL scores with
syntactic constituents and then extract n-
grams of constituents from all sentences.
We also use the polarity of all syntactic
constituents within the sentence as fea-
tures. Our results show significant im-
provement over a majority class baseline
as well as a more difficult baseline consist-
ing of lexical n-grams.
