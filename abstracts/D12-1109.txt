Decoding algorithms for syntax based ma-
chine translation suffer from high compu-
tational complexity, a consequence of in-
tersecting a language model with a con-
text free grammar. Left-to-right decoding,
which generates the target string in order,
can improve decoding efficiency by simpli-
fying the language model evaluation. This
paper presents a novel left to right decod-
ing algorithm for tree-to-string translation, us-
ing a bottom-up parsing strategy and dynamic
future cost estimation for each partial trans-
lation. Our method outperforms previously
published tree-to-string decoders, including a
competing left-to-right method.
