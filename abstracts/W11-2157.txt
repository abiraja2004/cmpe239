This paper describes the machine translation
(MT) system developed by the Transducens
Research Group, from Universitat d?Alacant,
Spain, for the WMT 2011 shared transla-
tion task. We submitted a hybrid system for
the Spanish?English language pair consist-
ing of a phrase-based statistical MT system
whose phrase table was enriched with bilin-
gual phrase pairs matching transfer rules and
dictionary entries from the Apertium shallow-
transfer rule-based MT platform. Our hybrid
system outperforms, in terms of BLEU, GTM
and METEOR, a standard phrase-based statis-
tical MT system trained on the same corpus,
and received the second best BLEU score in
the automatic evaluation.
