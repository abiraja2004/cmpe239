Word Sense Induction (WSI) is the task of
identifying the different senses (uses) of a tar-
get word in a given text. This paper focuses
on the unsupervised estimation of the free pa-
rameters of a graph-based WSI method, and
explores the use of eight Graph Connectiv-
ity Measures (GCM) that assess the degree of
connectivity in a graph. Given a target word
and a set of parameters, GCM evaluate the
connectivity of the produced clusters, which
correspond to subgraphs of the initial (unclus-
tered) graph. Each parameter setting is as-
signed a score according to one of the GCM
and the highest scoring setting is then selected.
Our evaluation on the nouns of SemEval-2007
WSI task (SWSI) shows that: (1) all GCM es-
timate a set of parameters which significantly
outperform the worst performing parameter
setting in both SWSI evaluation schemes, (2)
all GCM estimate a set of parameters which
outperform the Most Frequent Sense (MFS)
baseline by a statistically significant amount
in the supervised evaluation scheme, and (3)
two of the measures estimate a set of parame-
ters that performs closely to a set of parame-
ters estimated in supervised manner.
