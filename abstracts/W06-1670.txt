In this paper we approach word sense
disambiguation and information extrac-
tion as a unified tagging problem. The
task consists of annotating text with the
tagset defined by the 41 Wordnet super-
sense classes for nouns and verbs. Since
the tagset is directly related to Wordnet
synsets, the tagger returns partial word
sense disambiguation. Furthermore, since
the noun tags include the standard named
entity detection classes ? person, location,
organization, time, etc. ? the tagger, as
a by-product, returns extended named en-
tity information. We cast the problem of
supersense tagging as a sequential label-
ing task and investigate it empirically with
a discriminatively-trained Hidden Markov
Model. Experimental evaluation on the
main sense-annotated datasets available,
i.e., Semcor and Senseval, shows consid-
erable improvements over the best known
?first-sense? baseline.
