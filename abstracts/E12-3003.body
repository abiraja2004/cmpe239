Adaptive Dialogue Systems are rapidly be-
coming part of our everyday lives. As they
progress and adopt new technologies they
become more intelligent and able to adapt
better and faster to their environment. Re-
search in this field is currently focused on
how to achieve adaptation, and particularly
on applying Reinforcement Learning (RL)
techniques, so a comparative study of the
related methods, such as this, is necessary.
In this work we compare several standard
and state of the art online RL algorithms
that are used to train the dialogue manager
in a dynamic environment, aiming to aid re-
searchers / developers choose the appropri-
ate RL algorithm for their system. This is
the first work, to the best of our knowledge,
to evaluate online RL algorithms on the di-
alogue problem and in a dynamic environ-
ment.
