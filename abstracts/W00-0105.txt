 
Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) is a 
central task in the area of Natural 
Language Processing. In the past few years 
several context-based probabilistic and 
machine learning methods for WSD have 
been presented in literature. However, an 
important area of research that has not 
been given the attention it deserves is a 
formal analysis of the parameters affecting 
the performance of the learning task faced 
by these systems. Usually performance is 
estimated by measuring precision and 
recall of a specific algorithm for specific 
test sets and environmental conditions. 
Therefore, a comparison among different 
learning systems and an objective 
estimation of the difficulty of the learning 
task is extremely difficult. 
In this paper we propose, in the framework 
of Computational Learning theory, a 
formal analysis of the relations between 
accuracy of a context-based WSD system, 
the complexity of the context 
representation scheme, and the 
environmental conditions (e.g. the 
complexity of language domain and 
concept inventory ) .
