Recent work in computational psycholin-
guistics shows that morpheme lexica can
be acquired in an unsupervised man-
ner from a corpus of words by select-
ing the lexicon that best balances pro-
ductivity and reuse (e.g. Goldwater et
al. (2009) and others). In this paper,
we extend such work to the problem of
acquiring non-concatenative morphology,
proposing a simple model of morphology
that can handle both concatenative and
non-concatenative morphology and apply-
ing Bayesian inference on two datasets of
Arabic and English verbs to acquire lex-
ica. We show that our approach success-
fully extracts the non-contiguous triliteral
root from Arabic verb stems.
