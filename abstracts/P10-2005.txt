We present a novel method to improve
word alignment quality and eventually the
translation performance by producing and
combining complementary word align-
ments for low-resource languages. Instead
of focusing on the improvement of a single
set of word alignments, we generate mul-
tiple sets of diversified alignments based
on different motivations, such as linguis-
tic knowledge, morphology and heuris-
tics. We demonstrate this approach on an
English-to-Pashto translation task by com-
bining the alignments obtained from syn-
tactic reordering, stemming, and partial
words. The combined alignment outper-
forms the baseline alignment, with signif-
icantly higher F-scores and better transla-
tion performance.
