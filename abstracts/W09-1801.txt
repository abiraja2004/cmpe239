Text summarization is one of the oldest prob-
lems in natural language processing. Popu-
lar approaches rely on extracting relevant sen-
tences from the original documents. As a side
effect, sentences that are too long but partly
relevant are doomed to either not appear in the
final summary, or prevent inclusion of other
relevant sentences. Sentence compression is a
recent framework that aims to select the short-
est subsequence of words that yields an infor-
mative and grammatical sentence. This work
proposes a one-step approach for document
summarization that jointly performs sentence
extraction and compression by solving an in-
teger linear program. We report favorable ex-
perimental results on newswire data.
