We propose using large-scale clustering of de-
pendency relations between verbs and multi-
word nouns (MNs) to construct a gazetteer for
named entity recognition (NER). Since depen-
dency relations capture the semantics of MNs
well, the MN clusters constructed by using
dependency relations should serve as a good
gazetteer. However, the high level of computa-
tional cost has prevented the use of clustering
for constructing gazetteers. We parallelized
a clustering algorithm based on expectation-
maximization (EM) and thus enabled the con-
struction of large-scale MN clusters. We
demonstrated with the IREX dataset for the
Japanese NER that using the constructed clus-
ters as a gazetteer (cluster gazetteer) is a effec-
tive way of improving the accuracy of NER.
Moreover, we demonstrate that the combina-
tion of the cluster gazetteer and a gazetteer ex-
tracted from Wikipedia, which is also useful
for NER, can further improve the accuracy in
several cases.
