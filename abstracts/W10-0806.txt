 
In this research, we use machine learning 
techniques to provide solutions for descriptive 
linguists in the domain of language standardi-
zation. With regard to the personal name con-
struction in Afrikaans, we perform function 
learning from word pairs using the De-
fault&Refine algorithm. We demonstrate how 
the extracted rules can be used to identify ir-
regularities in previously standardized con-
structions and to predict new forms of unseen 
words. In addition, we define a generic, auto-
mated process that allows us to extract con-
structional schemas and present these visually 
as categorization networks, similar to what is 
often being used in Cognitive Grammar. We 
conclude that computational modeling of con-
structions can contribute to new descriptive 
linguistic insights, and to practical language 
solutions.
