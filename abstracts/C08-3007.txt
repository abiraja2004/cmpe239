This paper presents a real-world applica-
tion for assisting medical diagnosis and
drug prescription, which relies on the
exclusive use of machine learning tech-
niques. We have automatically processed
an extensive biomedical literature to train
a categorization algorithm in order to pro-
vide it with the capability of matching
symptoms to MeSH descriptors. To in-
teract with the classifier, we have devel-
oped a multilingual web interface so that
professionals in medicine can easily get
some help in their decisions about di-
agnoses (lookfordiagnosis.com) and pre-
scriptions (lookfortherapy.com). We also
demonstrate the effectiveness of this ap-
proach with a test set containing several
hundreds of real clinical histories.
