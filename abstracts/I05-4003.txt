The acquisition of grammar from a 
corpus is a challenging task in the 
preparation of a knowledge bank. In 
this paper, we discuss the extraction of 
Chinese grammar oriented to a re-
stricted corpus. First, probabilistic con-
text-free grammars (PCFG) are 
extracted automatically from the Penn 
Chinese Treebank and are regarded as 
the baseline rules. Then a corpus-
oriented grammar is developed by add-
ing specific information including head 
information from the restricted corpus. 
Then, we describe the peculiarities and 
ambiguities, particularly between the 
phrases ?PP? and ?VP? in the extracted 
grammar. Finally, the parsing results of 
the utterances are used to evaluate the 
extracted grammar.
