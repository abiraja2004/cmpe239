WordNet semantic classes in a dependency 
parser, obtaining improvements on the full 
Penn Treebank for the first time. We tried 
different combinations of some basic se-
mantic classes and word sense disambigua-
tion algorithms. Our experiments show that 
selecting the adequate combination of se-
mantic features on development data is key 
for success. Given the basic nature of the 
semantic classes and word sense disam-
biguation algorithms used, we think there is 
ample room for future improvements.
