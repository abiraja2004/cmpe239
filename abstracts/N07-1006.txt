We propose three new features for MT
evaluation: source-sentence constrained
n-gram precision, source-sentence re-
ordering metrics, and discriminative un-
igram precision, as well as a method of
learning linear feature weights to directly
maximize correlation with human judg-
ments. By aligning both the hypothe-
sis and the reference with the source-
language sentence, we achieve better cor-
relation with human judgments than pre-
viously proposed metrics. We further
improve performance by combining indi-
vidual evaluation metrics using maximum
correlation training, which is shown to be
better than the classification-based frame-
work.
