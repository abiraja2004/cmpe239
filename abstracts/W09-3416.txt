 
In this paper we propose a modelization of 
the construction of Persian noun and adjec-
tival phrases in a phrase structure grammar. 
This modelization uses the Interaction 
Grammar (IG) formalism by taking advan-
tage of the polarities on features and tree 
descriptions for the various constructions 
that we studied. The proposed grammar was 
implemented with a Metagrammar compiler 
named XMG. A small test suite was built 
and tested with a parser based on IG, called 
LEOPAR. The experimental results show 
that we could parse the phrases successfully, 
even the most complex ones which have 
various constructions in them.
