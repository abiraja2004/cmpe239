The mapping between syntactic structure and
prosodic structure is a widely discussed topic in
linguistics. In this work we use insights gained
from research on syntax-to-prosody mapping in or-
der to develop a computational model which assigns
prosodic structure to unrestricted text. The result-
ing structure is intended to help a text-to-speech
(TTS) system to predict phrase breaks. In addition
to linguistic constraints, the model also incorporates
a performance-oriented parameter which approxi-
mates the effect of speaking rate. The model is rule-
based rather than probabilistic, and does not require
training. We present the model and implementa-
tions for both English and German, and give eval-
uation results for both implementations. We then
examine how far the approach can account for the
different break patterns which are associated with
slow, normal and fast speech rates.
