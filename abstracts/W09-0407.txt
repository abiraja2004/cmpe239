RWTH participated in the System Combi-
nation task of the Fourth Workshop on Sta-
tistical Machine Translation (WMT 2009).
Hypotheses from 9 German?English MT
systems were combined into a consen-
sus translation. This consensus transla-
tion scored 2.1% better in BLEU and 2.3%
better in TER (abs.) than the best sin-
gle system. In addition, cross-lingual
output from 10 French, German, and
Spanish?English systems was combined
into a consensus translation, which gave
an improvement of 2.0% in BLEU/3.5% in
TER (abs.) over the best single system.
