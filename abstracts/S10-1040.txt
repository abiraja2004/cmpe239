Automatically assigning keyphrases to
documents has a great variety of applica-
tions. Here we focus on the keyphrase
extraction of scientific publications and
present a novel set of features for the su-
pervised learning of keyphraseness. Al-
though these features are intended for ex-
tracting keyphrases from scientific papers,
because of their generality and robust-
ness, they should have uses in other do-
mains as well. With the help of these fea-
tures SZTERGAK achieved top results on
the SemEval-2 shared task on Automatic
Keyphrase Extraction from Scientific Arti-
cles and exceeded its baseline by 10%.
