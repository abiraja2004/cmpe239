We experiment with splitting words into
their stem and suffix components for mod-
eling morphologically rich languages. We
show that using a morphological ana-
lyzer and disambiguator results in a sig-
nificant perplexity reduction in Turkish.
We present flexible n-gram models, Flex-
Grams, which assume that the n?1 tokens
that determine the probability of a given
token can be chosen anywhere in the sen-
tence rather than the preceding n?1 posi-
tions. Our final model achieves 27% per-
plexity reduction compared to the standard
n-gram model.
