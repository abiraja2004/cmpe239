The DLSI-UA team is currently working on sev-
eral word sense disambiguation approaches, both
supervised and unsupervised. These approaches are
based on different ways to use both annotated and
unannotated data, and several resources generated
from or exploiting WordNet (Miller et al, 1993),
WordNet Domains, EuroWordNet (EWN) and addi-
tional corpora. This paper presents a view of differ-
ent system results for Word Sense Disambiguation
in different tasks of SENSEVAL-3.
