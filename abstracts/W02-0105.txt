This paper describes a new Cornell
University course serving as a non-
programming introduction to com-
puter science, with natural language
processing and information retrieval
forming a crucial part of the syllabus.
Material was drawn from a wide vari-
ety of topics (such as theories of dis-
course structure and random graph
models of the World Wide Web) and
presented at some technical depth, but
was massaged to make it suitable for
a freshman-level course. Student feed-
back from the first running of the class
was overall quite positive, and a grant
from the GE Fund has been awarded
to further support the course?s devel-
opment and goals.
