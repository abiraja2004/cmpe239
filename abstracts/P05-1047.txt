This paper presents a novel algorithm for
the acquisition of Information Extraction
patterns. The approach makes the assump-
tion that useful patterns will have simi-
lar meanings to those already identified
as relevant. Patterns are compared using
a variation of the standard vector space
model in which information from an on-
tology is used to capture semantic sim-
ilarity. Evaluation shows this algorithm
performs well when compared with a
previously reported document-centric ap-
proach.
