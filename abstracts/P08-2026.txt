Parser self-training is the technique of
taking an existing parser, parsing extra
data and then creating a second parser
by treating the extra data as further
training data. Here we apply this tech-
nique to parser adaptation. In partic-
ular, we self-train the standard Char-
niak/Johnson Penn-Treebank parser us-
ing unlabeled biomedical abstracts. This
achieves an f -score of 84.3% on a stan-
dard test set of biomedical abstracts from
the Genia corpus. This is a 20% error re-
duction over the best previous result on
biomedical data (80.2% on the same test
set).
