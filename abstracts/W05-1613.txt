It is hard to come up with a general formalisation of
the problem of content determination in natural lan-
guage generation because of the degree of domain-
dependence that is involved. This paper presents
a novel way of looking at a class of content deter-
mination problems in terms of a non-standard kind
of inference, which we call natural language di-
rected inference. This is illustrated through exam-
ples from a system under development to present
parts of ontologies in natural language. Natural lan-
guage directed inference represents an interesting
challenge to research in automated reasoning and
natural language processing.
