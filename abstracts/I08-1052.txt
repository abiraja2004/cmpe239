Numerative classifiers are ubiquitous in
many Asian languages. This paper pro-
poses a method to construct a taxonomy
of numerative classifiers based on a noun-
classifier agreement database. The taxon-
omy defines superordinate-subordinate rela-
tion among numerative classifiers and rep-
resents the relations in tree structures. The
experiments to construct taxonomies were
conducted for evaluation by using data from
three different languages: Chinese, Japanese
and Thai. We found that our method was
promising for Chinese and Japanese, but in-
appropriate for Thai. It confirms that there
really is no hierarchy among Thai classifiers.
