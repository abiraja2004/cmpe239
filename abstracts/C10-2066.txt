The optimal choice of speech understand-
ing method depends on the amount of
training data available in rapid prototyp-
ing. A statistical method is ultimately
chosen, but it is not clear at which point
in the increase in training data a statisti-
cal method become effective. Our frame-
work combines multiple automatic speech
recognition (ASR) and language under-
standing (LU) modules to provide a set
of speech understanding results and se-
lects the best result among them. The
issue is how to allocate training data to
statistical modules and the selection mod-
ule in order to avoid overfitting in training
and obtain better performance. This paper
presents an automatic training data alloca-
tion method that is based on the change
in the coefficients of the logistic regres-
sion functions used in the selection mod-
ule. Experimental evaluation showed that
our allocation method outperformed base-
line methods that use a single ASR mod-
ule and a single LU module at every point
while training data increase.
