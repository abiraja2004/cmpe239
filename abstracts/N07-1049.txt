We present a revision learning model for
improving the accuracy of a dependency
parser. The revision stage corrects the out-
put of the base parser by means of revi-
sion rules learned from the mistakes of
the base parser itself. Revision learning
is performed with a discriminative classi-
fier. The revision stage has linear com-
plexity and preserves the efficiency of the
base parser. We present empirical evalu-
ations on the treebanks of two languages,
which show effectiveness in relative error
reduction and state of the art accuracy.
