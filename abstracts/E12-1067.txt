We propose a novel method for learning
morphological paradigms that are struc-
tured within a hierarchy. The hierarchi-
cal structuring of paradigms groups mor-
phologically similar words close to each
other in a tree structure. This allows detect-
ing morphological similarities easily lead-
ing to improved morphological segmen-
tation. Our evaluation using (Kurimo et
al., 2011a; Kurimo et al 2011b) dataset
shows that our method performs competi-
tively when compared with current state-of-
art systems.
