model of incremental utterance produc- 
tion in task-oriented ialogues. This 
model incrementally produces utter- 
antes to propose the solution of a given 
problem, while simultaneously solving 
the problem in a stepwise manner. Even 
when the solution has been partially de- 
termined, this model starts utterances 
to satisfy time constraints where pauses 
in mid-utterance must not exceed a cer- 
tain length. The results of an analysis 
of discourse structure in a dialogue cor- 
pus are presented and the fine structure 
of discourse that contributes to the in- 
cremental strategy of utterance produc- 
tion is described. This model utilizes 
such a discourse structure to incremen- 
tally produce utterances constituting a
discourse. Pragmatic onstraints are ex- 
ploited to guarantee the relevance of dis- 
courses, which are evaluated by an utter- 
ance simulation experiment.
