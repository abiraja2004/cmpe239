This paper describes the retrieval of cor-
rect semantic boundaries for predicate-
argument structures annotated by depen-
dency structure. Unlike phrase structure,
in which arguments are annotated at the
phrase level, dependency structure does
not have phrases so the argument labels are
associated with head words instead: the
subtree of each head word is assumed to
include the same set of words as the an-
notated phrase does in phrase structure.
However, at least in English, retrieving
such subtrees does not always guarantee
retrieval of the correct phrase boundaries.
In this paper, we present heuristics that
retrieve correct phrase boundaries for se-
mantic arguments, called semantic bound-
aries, from dependency trees. By apply-
ing heuristics, we achieved an F1-score
of 99.54% for correct representation of
semantic boundaries. Furthermore, error
analysis showed that some of the errors
could also be considered correct, depend-
ing on the interpretation of the annotation.
