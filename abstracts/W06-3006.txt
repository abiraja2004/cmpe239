In this paper, we propose ellipsis han-
dling method for follow-up questions in
Information Access Dialogue (IAD) task
of NTCIR QAC3. In this method, our sys-
tem classifies ellipsis patterns of question
sentences into three types and recognizes
elliptical elements using ellipsis handling
algorithm for each type. In the evalua-
tion using Formal Run and Reference Run
data, there were several cases which our
algorithm could not handle ellipsis cor-
rectly. According to the analysis of evalu-
ation results, the main reason of low per-
formance was lack of word information
for recognition of referential elements. If
our system can recognize word meanings
correctly, some errors will not occur and
ellipsis handling works well.
