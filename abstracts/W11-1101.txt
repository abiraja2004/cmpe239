This paper proposes a novel application of
a supervised topic model to do entity rela-
tion detection (ERD). We adapt Maximum En-
tropy Discriminant Latent Dirichlet Alloca-
tion (MEDLDA) with mixed membership for
relation detection. The ERD task is refor-
mulated to fit into the topic modeling frame-
work. Our approach combines the benefits of
both, maximum-likelihood estimation (MLE)
and max-margin estimation (MME), and the
mixed membership formulation enables the
system to incorporate heterogeneous features.
We incorporate different features into the sys-
tem and perform experiments on the ACE
2005 corpus. Our approach achieves better
overall performance for precision, recall and
Fmeasure metrics as compared to SVM-based
and LLDA-based models.
