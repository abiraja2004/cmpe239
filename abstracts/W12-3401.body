This paper investigates the impact on French
dependency parsing of lexical generalization
methods beyond lemmatization and morpho-
logical analysis. A distributional thesaurus
is created from a large text corpus and used
for distributional clustering and WordNet au-
tomatic sense ranking. The standard approach
for lexical generalization in parsing is to map
a word to a single generalized class, either re-
placing the word with the class or adding a
new feature for the class. We use a richer
framework that allows for probabilistic gener-
alization, with a word represented as a prob-
ability distribution over a space of general-
ized classes: lemmas, clusters, or synsets.
Probabilistic lexical information is introduced
into parser feature vectors by modifying the
weights of lexical features. We obtain im-
provements in parsing accuracy with some
lexical generalization configurations in exper-
iments run on the French Treebank and two
out-of-domain treebanks, with slightly better
performance for the probabilistic lexical gen-
eralization approach compared to the standard
single-mapping approach.
