We present DIRECTL+: an online dis-
criminative sequence prediction model
based on many-to-many alignments,
which is further augmented by the in-
corporation of joint n-gram features.
Experimental results show improvement
over the results achieved by DIRECTL in
2009. We also explore a number of diverse
resource-free and language-independent
approaches to transliteration mining,
which range from simple to sophisticated.
