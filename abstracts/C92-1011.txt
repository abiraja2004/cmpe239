 
Analysis of a corpus of queries to a statistical database 
has shown considerable variation in the location and 
order of modifiers in complex noun phrases. Never- 
theless, restrictions can be defined on nominal mod- 
ification because of certain correspondences between 
nominal modifiers and the role they fulfill in a statisti- 
cal database, notably that the names of database tables 
and columns, and values of columns, are all determined 
by the modifiers. These restrictions are described. In- 
corporating these restrictions into Head-Driven Phrase 
Structure Grammar (HPSG) has caused us to examine 
the treatment ofnominal modification i HPSG. A new 
treatment is proposed and an implementation within an 
HPSG based natural language front-end to a statistical 
database isdescribed.
