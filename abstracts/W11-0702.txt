The recent proliferation of political and so-
cial forums has given rise to a wealth of freely
accessible naturalistic arguments. People can
?talk? to anyone they want, at any time, in
any location, about any topic. Here we use
a Mechanical Turk annotated corpus of forum
discussions as a gold standard for the recog-
nition of disagreement in online ideological
forums. We analyze the utility of meta-post
features, contextual features, dependency fea-
tures and word-based features for signaling
the disagreement relation. We show that us-
ing contextual and dialogic features we can
achieve accuracies up to 68% as compared to
a unigram baseline of 63%.
