We demonstrate a method of improving a seed
sentiment lexicon developed on essay data by
using a pivot-based paraphrasing system for
lexical expansion coupled with sentiment pro-
file enrichment using crowdsourcing. Profile
enrichment alone yields up to 15% improve-
ment in the accuracy of the seed lexicon on 3-
way sentence-level sentiment polarity classifi-
cation of essay data. Using lexical expansion
in addition to sentiment profiles provides a
further 7% improvement in performance. Ad-
ditional experiments show that the proposed
method is also effective with other subjectivity
lexicons and in a different domain of applica-
tion (product reviews).
