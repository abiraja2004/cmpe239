The use of lexical semantic knowledge in
information retrieval has been a field of ac-
tive study for a long time. Collaborative
knowledge bases like Wikipedia and Wik-
tionary, which have been applied in com-
putational methods only recently, offer
new possibilities to enhance information
retrieval. In order to find the most bene-
ficial way to employ these resources, we
analyze the lexical semantic relations that
hold among query and document terms
and compare how these relations are repre-
sented by a measure for semantic related-
ness. We explore the potential of different
indicators of document relevance that are
based on semantic relatedness and com-
pare the characteristics and performance
of the knowledge bases Wikipedia, Wik-
tionary and WordNet.
