We considered a wide range of features for
the DiSCo 2011 shared task about composi-
tionality prediction for word pairs, including
COALS-based endocentricity scores, compo-
sitionality scores based on distributional clus-
ters, statistics about wordnet-induced para-
phrases, hyphenation, and the likelihood of
long translation equivalents in other lan-
guages. Many of the features we considered
correlated significantly with human compo-
sitionality scores, but in support vector re-
gression experiments we obtained the best re-
sults using only COALS-based endocentric-
ity scores. Our system was nevertheless the
best performing system in the shared task, and
average error reductions over a simple base-
line in cross-validation were 13.7% for En-
glish and 50.1% for German.
