Some anaphora resolution algorithms are based on model builders, and use the
fact that they generate minimal models: only those elements that are necessary
are postulated to exist in the model. In this way, such systems have the desirable
property that if anaphora can be resolved to a linguistically available antecedent,
this resolution applies, and only if there is no suitable antecedent, a deictic reading
is generated.
In this paper I formalize the entailments that follow from such anaphora reso-
lution algorithms. In particular, I will suggest a simple, linguistically motivated,
underspecified representation for anaphora?DRT, and place the burden of the res-
olution of anaphora and its consequences on an independently motivated logic for
default reasoning?Default Logic.
