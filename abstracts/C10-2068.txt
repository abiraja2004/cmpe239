Implicit relevance feedback has proved
to be a important resource in improv-
ing search accuracy and personalization.
However, researchers who rely on feed-
back data for testing their algorithms or
other personalization related problems are
loomed with problems like unavailabil-
ity of data, staling up of data and so
on. Given these problems, we are mo-
tivated towards creating a synthetic user
relevance feedback data, based on insights
from query log analysis. We call this sim-
ulated feedback. We believe that simu-
lated feedback can be immensely benefi-
cial to web search engine and personaliza-
tion research communities by greatly re-
ducing efforts involved in collecting user
feedback. The benefits from ?Simulated
feedback? are - it is easy to obtain and
also the process of obtaining the feed-
back data is repeatable, customizable and
does not need the interactions of the user.
In this paper, we describe a simple yet
effective approach for creating simulated
feedback. We have evaluated our system
using the clickthrough data of the users
and achieved 77% accuracy in generating
click-through data.
