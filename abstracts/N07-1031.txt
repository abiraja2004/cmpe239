We describe Castanet, an algorithm for auto-
matically generating hierarchical faceted meta-
data from textual descriptions of items, to be in-
corporated into browsing and navigation inter-
faces for large information collections. From
an existing lexical database (such as WordNet),
Castanet carves out a structure that reflects
the contents of the target information collec-
tion; moderate manual modifications improve
the outcome. The algorithm is simple yet ef-
fective: a study conducted with 34 information
architects finds that Castanet achieves higher
quality results than other automated category
creation algorithms, and 85% of the study par-
ticipants said they would like to use the system
for their work.
