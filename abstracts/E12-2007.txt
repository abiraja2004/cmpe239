This paper deals with an application of au-
tomatic titling. The aim of such application
is to attribute a title for a given text. So,
our application relies on three very differ-
ent automatic titling methods. The first one
extracts relevant noun phrases for their use
as a heading, the second one automatically
constructs headings by selecting words ap-
pearing in the text, and, finally, the third
one uses nominalization in order to propose
informative and catchy titles. Experiments
based on 1048 titles have shown that our
methods provide relevant titles.
