 
We describe a high precision system for ex-
tracting events of biomedical significance that 
was developed during the BioNLP shared task 
2013 and tested on the Cancer Genetics data 
set. The system achieved an F-score on the de-
velopment data of 73.67 but was ranked 5th out 
of six with an F-score of 29.94 on the test data. 
However, precision was the second highest 
ranked on the task at 62.73. Analysis suggests 
the need to continue to improve our system for 
complex events particularly taking into ac-
count cross-domain differences in argument 
distributions.
