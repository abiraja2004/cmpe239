We present a rule-based method to automati-
cally create a large-coverage semantic lexicon
of French adjectives by extracting paradig-
matic relations from lexicographic definitions.
Formalized adjectival resources are, indeed,
scarce for French and they mostly focus on
morphological and syntactic information. Our
objective is, therefore, to contribute enriching
the available set of resources by taking advan-
tage of reliable lexicographic data and formal-
izing it with the well-established lexical func-
tions formalism. The resulting semantic lexi-
con of French adjectives can be used in NLP
tasks such as word sense disambiguation or
machine translation. After presenting related
work, we describe the extraction method and
the formalization procedure of the data. Our
method is then quantitatively and qualitatively
evaluated. We discuss the results of the evalu-
ation and conclude on some perspectives.
