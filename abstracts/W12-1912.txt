Our system consists of a simple, EM-based
induction algorithm (Bisk and Hockenmaier,
2012), which induces a language-specific
Combinatory Categorial grammar (CCG) and
lexicon based on a small number of linguistic
principles, e.g. that verbs may be the roots of
sentences and can take nouns as arguments.
