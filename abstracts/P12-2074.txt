We examine some of the frequently disre-
garded subtleties of tokenization in Penn Tree-
bank style, and present a new rule-based pre-
processing toolkit that not only reproduces the
Treebank tokenization with unmatched accu-
racy, but also maintains exact stand-off point-
ers to the original text and allows flexible con-
figuration to diverse use cases (e.g. to genre-
or domain-specific idiosyncrasies).
