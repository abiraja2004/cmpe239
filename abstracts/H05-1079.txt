We use logical inference techniques for
recognising textual entailment. As the
performance of theorem proving turns
out to be highly dependent on not read-
ily available background knowledge, we
incorporate model building, a technique
borrowed from automated reasoning, and
show that it is a useful robust method to
approximate entailment. Finally, we use
machine learning to combine these deep
semantic analysis techniques with simple
shallow word overlap; the resulting hy-
brid model achieves high accuracy on the
RTE testset, given the state of the art. Our
results also show that the different tech-
niques that we employ perform very dif-
ferently on some of the subsets of the RTE
corpus and as a result, it is useful to use the
nature of the dataset as a feature.
