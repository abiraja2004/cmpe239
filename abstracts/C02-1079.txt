Ambiguity is the fundamental property of
natural language. Perhaps, the most bur-
densome case of ambiguity manifests itself
on the syntactic level of analysis. In order
to face up to the high number of obtained
derivation trees, this paper describes several
techniques for evaluation of the figures of
merit, which define a sort order on parsing
trees. The presented methods are based on
language specific features of synthetical lan-
guages and they improve the results of sim-
ple stochastic approaches.
