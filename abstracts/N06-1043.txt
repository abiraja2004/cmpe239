We investigate the problem of training
probabilistic context-free grammars on
the basis of a distribution defined over
an infinite set of trees, by minimizing
the cross-entropy. This problem can be
seen as a generalization of the well-known
maximum likelihood estimator on (finite)
tree banks. We prove an unexpected the-
oretical property of grammars that are
trained in this way, namely, we show
that the derivational entropy of the gram-
mar takes the same value as the cross-
entropy between the input distribution and
the grammar itself. We show that the re-
sult also holds for the widely applied max-
imum likelihood estimator on tree banks.
