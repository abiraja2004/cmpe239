Tree-based approaches to alignment model
translation as a sequence of probabilistic op-
erations transforming the syntactic parse tree
of a sentence in one language into that of the
other. The trees may be learned directly from
parallel corpora (Wu, 1997), or provided by a
parser trained on hand-annotated treebanks (Ya-
mada and Knight, 2001). In this paper, we
compare these approaches on Chinese-English
and French-English datasets, and find that au-
tomatically derived trees result in better agree-
ment with human-annotated word-level align-
ments for unseen test data.
