This paper explores the potential for an-
notating and enriching data for low-density
languages via the alignment and projec-
tion of syntactic structure from parsed data
for resource-rich languages such as English.
We seek to develop enriched resources for a
large number of the world?s languages, most
of which have no significant digital pres-
ence. We do this by tapping the body of
Web-based linguistic data, most of which
exists in small, analyzed chunks embedded
in scholarly papers, journal articles, Web
pages, and other online documents. By har-
vesting and enriching these data, we can
provide the means for knowledge discovery
across the resulting corpus that can lead
to building computational resources such
as grammars and transfer rules, which, in
turn, can be used as bootstraps for build-
ing additional tools and resources for the
languages represented.1
