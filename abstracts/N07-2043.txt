 
Customization to specific domains of dis-
course and/or user requirements is one of 
the greatest challenges for today?s Infor-
mation Extraction (IE) systems. While 
demonstrably effective, both rule-based 
and supervised machine learning ap-
proaches to IE customization pose too 
high a burden on the user. Semi-
supervised learning approaches may in 
principle offer a more resource effective 
solution but are still insufficiently 
accurate to grant realistic application. We 
demonstrate that this limitation can be 
overcome by integrating fully-supervised 
learning techniques within a semi-
supervised IE approach, without 
increasing resource requirements.
