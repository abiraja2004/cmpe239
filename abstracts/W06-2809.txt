This paper describes a method to automat-
ically create and maintain gazetteers for
Named Entity Recognition (NER). This
method extracts the necessary information
from linguistic resources. Our approach is
based on the analysis of an on-line ency-
clopedia entries by using a noun hierarchy
and optionally a PoS tagger. An impor-
tant motivation is to reach a high level of
language independence. This restricts the
techniques that can be used but makes the
method useful for languages with few re-
sources. The evaluation carried out proves
that this approach can be successfully used
to build NER gazetteers for location (F
78%) and person (F 68%) categories.
