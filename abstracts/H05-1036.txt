Weighted deduction with aggregation is a powerful theoretical
formalism that encompasses many NLP algorithms. This pa-
per proposes a declarative specification language, Dyna; gives
general agenda-based algorithms for computing weights and
gradients; briefly discusses Dyna-to-Dyna program transforma-
tions; and shows that a first implementation of a Dyna-to-C++
compiler produces code that is efficient enough for real NLP re-
search, though still several times slower than hand-crafted code.
