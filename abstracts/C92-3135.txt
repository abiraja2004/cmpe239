 
This paper presents a system which intends to 
resolve anaphora in the framework of the 
Discourse Representation Theory, arrd using a 
lexicon-grammar of anaphoric verbs, through 
the application of selection criteria for 
assignment of a referent to an anaphora. 
From a semantic representation of text 
provided by a DRT system implemented in 
Prolog, the system uses several criteria of 
selection of referent. One of these criteria is 
the anaphoric conditions of verbs described as 
a lexicon-grammar of anaphoric verbs. 
The present paper investigates a 
transformational analysis of verbs related to 
their anaphoric behaviour, and the adequacy 
of extension of the lexicon~grammar of 
MGROSS to anaphonc conditions on verbs.
