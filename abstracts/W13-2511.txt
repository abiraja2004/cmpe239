This work describes tech-niques to build and characterize ontologies using collaborative knowledge bases, e.g., Wikipedia. These ontologies can then be used to search and classify texts. Originally devel-oped for monolingual corpora, we extend the approach to multilingual texts and test the methods with Mandarin scientific abstracts. The presented techniques provide a novel and efficient mechanism to obtain contextually rich ontologies and measure document rele-vancy within multilingual corpora. 1
