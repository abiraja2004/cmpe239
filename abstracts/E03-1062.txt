This paper describes the NECA MNLG;
a fully implemented Multimodal Natu-
ral Language Generation module. The
MNLG is deployed as part of the NECA
system which generates dialogues be-
tween animated agents. The genera-
tion module supports the seamless inte-
gration of full grammar rules, templates
and canned text. The generator takes in-
put which allows for the specification of
syntactic, semantic and pragmatic con-
straints on the output.
