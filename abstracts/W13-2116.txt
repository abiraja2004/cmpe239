 
This study is conducted in the area of multi-
document summarization, and develops a 
literature review framework based on a 
deconstruction of human-written literature 
review sections in information science research 
papers. The first part of the study presents the 
results of a multi-level discourse analysis to 
investigate their discourse and content 
characteristics. These findings were 
incorporated into a framework for literature 
reviews, focusing on their macro-level 
document structure and the sentence-level 
templates, as well as the information 
summarization strategies. The second part of 
this study discusses insights from this analysis, 
and how the framework can be adapted to 
automatic summaries resembling human written 
literature reviews. Summaries generated from a 
partial implementation are evaluated against 
human written summaries and assessors? 
comments are discussed to formulate 
recommendations for future work.
