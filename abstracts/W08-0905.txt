We present the STYX system, which is de-
signed as an electronic corpus-based exercise
book of Czech morphology and syntax with
sentences directly selected from the Prague
Dependency Treebank, the largest annotated
corpus of the Czech language. The exercise
book offers complex sentence processing with
respect to both morphological and syntactic
phenomena, i. e. the exercises allow students
of basic and secondary schools to practice
classifying parts of speech and particular mor-
phological categories of words and in the pars-
ing of sentences and classifying the syntactic
functions of words. The corpus-based exer-
cise book presents a novel usage of annotated
corpora outside their original context.
