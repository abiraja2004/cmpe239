In this paper, we report our work on incor-
porating syntactic and morphological infor-
mation for English to Hindi statistical ma-
chine translation. Two simple and compu-
tationally inexpensive ideas have proven to
be surprisingly effective: (i) reordering the
English source sentence as per Hindi syntax,
and (ii) using the suffixes of Hindi words.
The former is done by applying simple trans-
formation rules on the English parse tree.
The latter, by using a simple suffix separa-
tion program. With only a small amount of
bilingual training data and limited tools for
Hindi, we achieve reasonable performance
and substantial improvements over the base-
line phrase-based system. Our approach es-
chews the use of parsing or other sophisti-
cated linguistic tools for the target language
(Hindi) making it a useful framework for
statistical machine translation from English
to Indian languages in general, since such
tools are not widely available for Indian lan-
guages currently.
