 
Lexical Markup Framework (LMF, ISO-
24613) is the ISO standard which provides 
a common standardized framework for the 
construction of natural language 
processing lexicons. LMF facilitates data 
exchange among computational linguistic 
resources, and also promises a convenient 
uniformity for future application. This 
study describes the design and implemen-
tation of the WordNet-LMF used to 
represent lexical semantics in Chinese 
WordNet. The compiled CWN-LMF will 
be released to the community for linguis-
tic researches.
