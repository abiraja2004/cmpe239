Cross-period (diachronic) thesaurus con-
struction aims to enable potential users to
search for modern terms and obtain se-
mantically related terms from earlier pe-
riods in history. This is a complex task not
previously addressed computationally. In
this paper we introduce a semi-automatic
iterative Query Expansion (QE) scheme
for supporting cross-period thesaurus con-
struction. We demonstrate the empirical
benefit of our scheme for a Jewish cross-
period thesaurus and evaluate its impact on
recall and on the effectiveness of lexicog-
rapher manual effort.
