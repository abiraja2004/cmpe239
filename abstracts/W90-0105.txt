 
In this paper we address the organization and use of the 
lexicon giving special consideration tohow the salience 
of certain aspects of abstract semantic structure may 
be expressed. We propose an organization of the lex- 
icon and its interaction with grammar and knowledge 
that makes extensive use of lexical functions from the 
Meaning-Text-Theory f Mel'~uk. We integrate this ap- 
proach with the architecture of the PENMAN text gen- 
eration system, showing some areas where that archi- 
tecture is insufficient, and illustrating how the lexicon 
can provide functionally oriented guidance for the gen- 
eration process.
