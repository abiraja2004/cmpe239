In this paper we present a novel similarity
between pairs of co-indexed trees to auto-
matically learn textual entailment classi-
fiers. We defined a kernel function based
on this similarity along with a more clas-
sical intra-pair similarity. Experiments
show an improvement of 4.4 absolute per-
cent points over state-of-the-art methods.
