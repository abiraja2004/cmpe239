 
This study addresses issues of Japanese lan-
guage learning concerning word combinations 
(collocations). Japanese learners may be able 
to construct grammatically correct sentences, 
however, these may sound ?unnatural?. In this 
work, we analyze correct word combinations 
using different collocation measures and 
word similarity methods. While other methods 
use well-formed text, our approach makes use 
of a large Japanese language learner corpus for 
generating collocation candidates, in order to 
build a system that is more sensitive to con-
structions that are difficult for learners. Our 
results show that we get better results com-
pared to other methods that use only well-
formed text.
