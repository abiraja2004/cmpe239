 The Speech Transcription Analysis Tool (STAT) is an open source tool for aligning and comparing two phonetically transcribed texts of human speech.  The output analysis is a parameterized set of phonological differ-ences.  These differences are based upon a se-lectable set of binary phonetic features such as [voice], [continuant], [high], etc.  STAT was initially designed to provide sets of phonological speech patterns in the compari-sons of various English accents found in the Speech Accent Archive http://accent.gmu.edu, but its scope and utility expand to matters of language assessment, phonetic training, foren-sic linguistics, and speech recognition.  1
