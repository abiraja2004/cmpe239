The Korean Resource Grammar (KRG)
is a computational open-source grammar
of Korean (Kim and Yang, 2003) that has
been constructed within the DELPH-IN
consortium since 2003. This paper re-
ports the second phase of the KRG devel-
opment that moves from a phenomena-
based approach to grammar customiza-
tion using the LinGO Grammar Matrix.
This new phase of development not only
improves the parsing efficiency but also
adds generation capacity, which is nec-
essary for many NLP applications.
