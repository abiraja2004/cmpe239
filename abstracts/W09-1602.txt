Most cross-lingual speech retrieval assumes
intensive knowledge about all involved lan-
guages. However, such resource may not ex-
ist for some less popular languages. Some
applications call for speech retrieval in un-
known languages. In this work, we lever-
age on a quasi-language-independent subword
recognizer trained on multiple languages, to
obtain an abstracted representation of speech
data in an unknown language. Language-
independent query expansion is achieved ei-
ther by allowing a wide lattice output for an
audio query, or by taking advantage of dis-
tinctive features in speech articulation to pro-
pose subwords most similar to the given sub-
words in a query. We propose using a re-
trieval model based on finite state machines
for fuzzy matching of speech sound patterns,
and further for speech retrieval. A pilot study
of speech retrieval in unknown languages is
presented, using English, Spanish and Russian
as training languages, and Croatian as the un-
known target language.
