 
Two technological dvances upport new sophis- 
tication in sound capture; namely, high-quality low- 
cost electret microphones and high-speed economical 
signal processors. Combined with new understand- 
ing in acoustic beamforming, these technologies per- 
mit spatially-selective transduction of speech signals 
several octaves in bandwidth. Spatial selectivity mk- 
igates the effects of noise and reverberation, and digi- 
tal processing provides the capability for speech- 
seeking, autodirective performance. This report out- 
lines the principles of autodirective beamforming for 
acoustic arrays, and it describes two experimental im- 
plementations. It also summarizes the direction and 
emphasis of continuing research.
