 
In this paper we discuss morpho-syntactic 
clues that can be used to facilitate termi-
nological processing in Serbian. A 
method (called SRCE) for automatic ex-
traction of multiword terms is presented. 
The approach incorporates a set of ge-
neric morpho-syntactic filters for recogni-
tion of term candidates, a method for 
conflation of morphological variants and 
a module for foreign word recognition. 
Morpho-syntactic filters describe general 
term formation patterns, and are imple-
mented as generic regular expressions. 
The inner structure together with the 
agreements within term candidates are 
used as clues to discover the boundaries 
of nested terms. The results of the termi-
nological processing of a textbook corpus 
in the domains of mathematics and com-
puter science are presented.
