Local coherence analysis is the task of deriving the (most likely) coher-
ence relation holding between two elementary discourse units or, recur-
sively, larger spans of text. The primary source of information for this
step is the connectives provided by a language for, more or less explic-
itly, signaling the relations. Focusing here on causal coherence relations,
we propose a lexical resource that holds both lexicographic and corpus-
statistic information on German connectives. It can serve as the cen-
tral repository of information needed for identifying and disambiguating
connectives in text, including determining the coherence relations being
signaled. We sketch a procedure performing this task, and describe a
manually-annotated corpus of causal relations (also in German), which
serves as reference data.
