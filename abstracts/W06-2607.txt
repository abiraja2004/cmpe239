Recent work on the design of automatic
systems for semantic role labeling has
shown that feature engineering is a com-
plex task from a modeling and implemen-
tation point of view. Tree kernels alleviate
such complexity as kernel functions gener-
ate features automatically and require less
software development for data extraction.
In this paper, we study several tree kernel
approaches for both boundary detection
and argument classification. The compar-
ative experiments on Support Vector Ma-
chines with such kernels on the CoNLL
2005 dataset show that very simple tree
manipulations trigger automatic feature
engineering that highly improves accuracy
and efficiency in both phases. Moreover,
the use of different classifiers for internal
and pre-terminal nodes maintains the same
accuracy and highly improves efficiency.
