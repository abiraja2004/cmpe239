 
We report on a small study undertaken to 
demonstrate the feasibility of combining 
portable information extraction with MT in 
order to support translingual information 
access. After describing the proposed 
system's usage scenario and system design, 
we describe our investigation of transferring 
information extraction techniques developed 
for English to Korean. We conclude with a 
brief discussion of related MT issues we plan 
to investigate in future work.
