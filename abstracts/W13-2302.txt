This paper presents a method for part-of-
speech tagging of historical data and eval-
uates it on texts from different corpora
of historical German (15th?18th century).
Spelling normalization is used to prepro-
cess the texts before applying a POS tag-
ger trained on modern German corpora.
Using only 250 manually normalized to-
kens as training data, the tagging accuracy
of a manuscript from the 15th century can
be raised from 28.65% to 74.89%.
