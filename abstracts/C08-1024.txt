This paper presents a method for mining
potential troubles or obstacles related to
the use of a given object. Some exam-
ple instances of this relation are ?medicine,
side effect? and ?amusement park, height
restriction?. Our acquisition method con-
sists of three steps. First, we use an un-
supervised method to collect training sam-
ples from Web documents. Second, a set
of expressions generally referring to trou-
bles is acquired by a supervised learning
method. Finally, the acquired troubles
are associated with objects so that each
of the resulting pairs consists of an ob-
ject and a trouble or obstacle in using that
object. To show the effectiveness of our
method we conducted experiments using
a large collection of Japanese Web doc-
uments for acquisition. Experimental re-
sults show an 85.5% precision for the top
10,000 acquired troubles, and a 74% pre-
cision for the top 10% of over 60,000 ac-
quired object-trouble pairs.
