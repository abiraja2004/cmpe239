 
Product reviews posted at online shopping 
sites vary greatly in quality. This paper ad-
dresses the problem of detecting low-
quality product reviews. Three types of bi-
ases in the existing evaluation standard of 
product reviews are discovered. To assess 
the quality of product reviews, a set of spe-
cifications for judging the quality of re-
views is first defined. A classification-
based approach is proposed to detect the 
low-quality reviews. We apply the pro-
posed approach to enhance opinion sum-
marization in a two-stage framework. Ex-
perimental results show that the proposed 
approach effectively (1) discriminates low-
quality reviews from high-quality ones and 
(2) enhances the task of opinion summari-
zation by detecting and filtering low-
quality reviews.
