 
This paper presents a method for generating 
multiple paraphrases from ambiguous logical 
forms. The method is based on a chart structure 
with edges indexed on semantic information 
and annotations that relate edges to the seman- 
tic facts they express. These annotations consist 
of logical expressions that identify particular 
realizations encoded in the chart. The method 
allows simultaneous generation from multiple 
interpretations, without hindering the genera- 
tion process or causing any work to be superflu- 
ously duplicated.
