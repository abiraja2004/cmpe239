Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis
(PLSA) models have been shown to pro-
vide a better model for capturing poly-
semy and synonymy than Latent Seman-
tic Analysis (LSA). However, the param-
eters of a PLSA model are trained using
the Expectation Maximization (EM) algo-
rithm, and as a result, the trained model
is dependent on the initialization values so
that performance can be highly variable.
In this paper we present a method for using
LSA analysis to initialize a PLSA model.
We also investigated the performance of
our method for the tasks of text segmenta-
tion and retrieval on personal-size corpora,
and present results demonstrating the effi-
cacy of our proposed approach.
