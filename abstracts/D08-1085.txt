We introduce a method for solving substi-
tution ciphers using low-order letter n-gram
models. This method enforces global con-
straints using integer programming, and it
guarantees that no decipherment key is over-
looked. We carry out extensive empirical ex-
periments showing how decipherment accu-
racy varies as a function of cipher length and
n-gram order. We also make an empirical in-
vestigation of Shannon?s (1949) theory of un-
certainty in decipherment.
