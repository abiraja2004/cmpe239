This paper tackles the problem of collect-
ing reliable human assessments. We show
that knowing multiple scores for each ex-
ample instead of a single score results in
a more reliable estimation of a system
quality. To reduce the cost of collect-
ing these multiple ratings, we propose to
use matrix completion techniques to pre-
dict some scores knowing only scores of
other judges and some common ratings.
Even if prediction performance is pretty
low, decisions made using the predicted
score proved to be more reliable than de-
cision based on a single rating of each ex-
ample.
