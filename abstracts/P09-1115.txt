This paper presents an unsupervised rela-
tion extraction method for discovering and
enhancing relations in which a specified
concept in Wikipedia participates. Using
respective characteristics of Wikipedia ar-
ticles and Web corpus, we develop a clus-
tering approach based on combinations of
patterns: dependency patterns from depen-
dency analysis of texts in Wikipedia, and
surface patterns generated from highly re-
dundant information related to the Web.
Evaluations of the proposed approach on
two different domains demonstrate the su-
periority of the pattern combination over
existing approaches. Fundamentally, our
method demonstrates how deep linguistic
patterns contribute complementarily with
Web surface patterns to the generation of
various relations.
