Most of the freely available parallel data to
train the translation model of a statistical ma-
chine translation system comes from very spe-
cific sources (European parliament, United
Nations, etc). Therefore, there is increasing
interest in methods to perform an adaptation
of the translation model. A popular approach
is based on unsupervised training, also called
self-enhancing. Both only use monolingual
data to adapt the translation model. In this pa-
per we extend the previous work and provide
new insight in the existing methods. We report
results on the translation between French and
English. Improvements of up to 0.5 BLEU
were observed with respect to a very com-
petitive baseline trained on more than 280M
words of human translated parallel data.
