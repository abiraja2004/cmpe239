This paper presents a status quo of an
ongoing research study of collocations ?
an essential linguistic phenomenon hav-
ing a wide spectrum of applications in
the field of natural language processing.
The core of the work is an empirical eval-
uation of a comprehensive list of auto-
matic collocation extraction methods us-
ing precision-recall measures and a pro-
posal of a new approach integrating mul-
tiple basic methods and statistical classi-
fication. We demonstrate that combining
multiple independent techniques leads to
a significant performance improvement in
comparisonwith individualbasic methods.
