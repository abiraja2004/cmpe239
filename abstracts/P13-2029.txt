Information Retrieval (IR) and Answer
Extraction are often designed as isolated
or loosely connected components in Ques-
tion Answering (QA), with repeated over-
engineering on IR, and not necessarily per-
formance gain for QA. We propose to
tightly integrate them by coupling auto-
matically learned features for answer ex-
traction to a shallow-structured IR model.
Our method is very quick to implement,
and significantly improves IR for QA
(measured in Mean Average Precision and
Mean Reciprocal Rank) by 10%-20%
against an uncoupled retrieval baseline
in both document and passage retrieval,
which further leads to a downstream 20%
improvement in QA F1.
