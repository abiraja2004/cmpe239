Latent Semantic Analysis has only recently
been applied to textual entailment recogni-
tion. However, these efforts have suffered
from inadequate bag of words vector repre-
sentations. Our prototype implementation
for the Third Recognising Textual Entail-
ment Challenge (RTE-3) improves the ap-
proach by applying it to vector represen-
tations that contain semi-structured repre-
sentations of words. It uses variable size
n-grams of word stems to model indepen-
dently verbs, subjects and objects displayed
in textual statements. The system perfor-
mance shows positive results and provides
insights about how to improve them further.
