 
The paper eports on a new approach to automatic 
generation of back-of-book indexes for Chinese 
books. Parsing on the level of complete sentential 
analysis i  avoided because of the inefficiency and 
unavailability ofa Chinese Grammar with enough 
coverage. Instead, fundamental analysis particular 
to Chinese text called word segmentation is 
performed to break up characters into a sequence 
of lexical units equivalent to words in English. 
The sequence of words then goes through part-of- 
speech tagging and noun phrase analysis. All these 
analyses are done using a corpus-based statistical 
algorithm. Experimental results have shown 
satisfactory esults.
