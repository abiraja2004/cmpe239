We investigate syntactic reordering within
an English to Arabic translation task. We
extend a pre-translation syntactic reorder-
ing approach developed on a close lan-
guage pair (English-Danish) to the dis-
tant language pair, English-Arabic. We
achieve significant improvements in trans-
lation quality over related approaches,
measured by manual as well as automatic
evaluations. These results prove the viabil-
ity of this approach for distant languages.
