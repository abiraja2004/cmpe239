Frequency distribution models tuned to
words and other linguistic events can pre-
dict the number of distinct types and their
frequency distribution in samples of arbi-
trary sizes. We conduct, for the first time,
a rigorous evaluation of these models based
on cross-validation and separation of train-
ing and test data. Our experiments reveal
that the prediction accuracy of the models
is marred by serious overfitting problems,
due to violations of the random sampling as-
sumption in corpus data. We then propose
a simple pre-processing method to allevi-
ate such non-randomness problems. Further
evaluation confirms the effectiveness of the
method, which compares favourably to more
complex correction techniques.
