 
This paper reports on a pilot study where two 
Models of argument were applied to the Dis-
cussion sections of a corpus of biomedical re-
search articles. The goal was to identify 
sources of systematic inter-annotator variation 
as diagnostics for improving the Models. In 
addition to showing a need to revise both 
Models, the results identified problems result-
ing from limitations in annotator expertise. In 
future work two types of annotators are re-
quired: those with biomedical domain exper-
tise and those with an understanding of rhe-
torical structure.
