A novel challenge for evaluating open-domain
question answering technologies is proposed.
In this challenge, question answering systems
are supposed to be used interactively to an-
swer a series of related questions, whereas in
the conventional setting, systems answer iso-
lated questions one by one. Such an interac-
tion occurs in the case of gathering informa-
tion for a report on a specific topic, or when
browsing information of interest to the user. In
this paper, first, we explain the design of the
challenge. We then discuss its reality and show
how the capabilities measured by the challenge
are useful and important in practical situations,
and that the difficulty of the challenge is proper
for evaluating the current state of open-domain
question answering technologies.
