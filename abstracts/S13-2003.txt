In this paper, we describe our participation in
the TempEval-3 challenge. With our multi-
lingual temporal tagger HeidelTime, we ad-
dressed task A, the extraction and normaliza-
tion of temporal expressions for English and
Spanish. Exploiting HeidelTime?s strict sep-
aration between source code and language-
dependent parts, we tuned HeidelTime?s ex-
isting English resources and developed new
Spanish resources. For both languages, we
achieved the best results among all partici-
pants for task A, the combination of extraction
and normalization. Both the improved English
and the new Spanish resources are publicly
available with HeidelTime.
