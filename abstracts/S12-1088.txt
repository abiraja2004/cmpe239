This paper presents the UNITOR system that
participated to the SemEval 2012 Task 6: Se-
mantic Textual Similarity (STS). The task is
here modeled as a Support Vector (SV) regres-
sion problem, where a similarity scoring func-
tion between text pairs is acquired from exam-
ples. The semantic relatedness between sen-
tences is modeled in an unsupervised fashion
through different similarity functions, each
capturing a specific semantic aspect of the
STS, e.g. syntactic vs. lexical or topical vs.
paradigmatic similarity. The SV regressor ef-
fectively combines the different models, learn-
ing a scoring function that weights individual
scores in a unique resulting STS. It provides a
highly portable method as it does not depend
on any manually built resource (e.g. WordNet)
nor controlled, e.g. aligned, corpus.
