Biological databases contain facts from scien-
tific literature, which have been curated by
hand to ensure high quality. Curation is time-
consuming and can be supported by informa-
tion extraction methods. We present a server
which identifies biological facts in scientific text
and presents the annotation to the curator.
Such facts are: UniProt, UMLS and GO ter-
minology, identification of gene and protein
names, mutations and protein-protein interac-
tions. UniProt, UMLS and GO concepts are
automatically linked to the original source. The
module for mutations is based on syntax pat-
terns and the one for protein-protein interac-
tions on NLP. All modules work independently
of each other in single threads and are combined
in a pipeline to ensure proper meta data inte-
gration. For fast response time the modules are
distributed on a Linux cluster. The server is at
present available to curation teams of biomedi-
cal data and will be opened to the public in the
future.
