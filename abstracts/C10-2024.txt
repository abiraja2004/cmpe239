Traditionally Sanskrit is written without
blank, sentences can make thousands of
characters without any separation. A crit-
ical edition takes into account all the dif-
ferent known versions of the same text in
order to show the differences between any
two distinct versions, in term of words
missing, changed or omitted. This pa-
per describes the Sanskrit characteristics
that make text comparisons different from
other languages, and will present different
methods of comparison of Sanskrit texts
which can be used for the elaboration of
computer assisted critical edition of San-
skrit texts. It describes two sets of meth-
ods used to obtain the alignments needed.
The first set is using the L.C.S., the sec-
ond one the global alignment algorithm.
One of the methods of the second set uses
a classical technique in the field of artifi-
cial intelligence, the A* algorithm to ob-
tain the suitable alignment. We conclude
by comparing our different results in term
of adequacy as well as complexity.
