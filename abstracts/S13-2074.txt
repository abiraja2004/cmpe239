This paper describes University of Leipzig?s
approach to SemEval-2013 task 2B on Sen-
timent Analysis in Twitter: message polar-
ity classification. Our system is designed to
function as a baseline, to see what we can
accomplish with well-understood and purely
data-driven lexical features, simple general-
izations as well as standard machine learning
techniques: We use one-against-one Support
Vector Machines with asymmetric cost fac-
tors and linear ?kernels? as classifiers, word
uni- and bigrams as features and additionally
model negation of word uni- and bigrams in
word n-gram feature space. We consider gen-
eralizations of URLs, user names, hash tags,
repeated characters and expressions of laugh-
ter. Our method ranks 23 out of all 48 partic-
ipating systems, achieving an averaged (pos-
itive, negative) F-Score of 0.5456 and an av-
eraged (positive, negative, neutral) F-Score of
0.595, which is above median and average.
