Statistical approaches to dialog state track-
ing synthesize information across multi-
ple turns in the dialog, overcoming some
speech recognition errors. When training
a dialog state tracker, there is typically
only a small corpus of well-matched dia-
log data available. However, often there is
a large corpus of mis-matched but related
data ? perhaps pertaining to different se-
mantic concepts, or from a different dialog
system. It would be desirable to use this
related dialog data to supplement the small
corpus of well-matched dialog data. This
paper addresses this task as multi-domain
learning, presenting 3 methods which syn-
thesize data from different slots and differ-
ent dialog systems. Since deploying a new
dialog state tracker often changes the re-
sulting dialogs in ways that are difficult to
predict, we study how well each method
generalizes to unseen distributions of dia-
log data. Our main result is the finding that
a simple method for multi-domain learn-
ing substantially improves performance in
highly mis-matched conditions.
