In this paper, we describe a rote extrac-
tor that learns patterns for finding seman-
tic relations in unrestricted text, with new
procedures for pattern generalisation and
scoring. An improved method for estimat-
ing the precision of the extracted patterns
is presented. We show that our method ap-
proximates the precision values as evalu-
ated by hand much better than the proce-
dure traditionally used in rote extractors.
