This paper addresses the task of construct-
ing a timeline of events mentioned in a given
text. To accomplish that, we present a novel
representation of the temporal structure of a
news article based on time intervals. We then
present an algorithmic approach that jointly
optimizes the temporal structure by coupling
local classifiers that predict associations and
temporal relations between pairs of tempo-
ral entities with global constraints. Moreover,
we present ways to leverage knowledge pro-
vided by event coreference to further improve
the system performance. Overall, our experi-
ments show that the joint inference model sig-
nificantly outperformed the local classifiers by
9.2% of relative improvement in F1. The ex-
periments also suggest that good event coref-
erence could make remarkable contribution to
a robust event timeline construction system.
