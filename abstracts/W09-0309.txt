 
Digital preservation is an integral part of 
the management of information and the 
institutions in the cultural heritage sector 
are seeking for ways to incorporate it into 
their everyday practice. While there are 
generic approaches to long-term preser-
vation, further research and development 
work is needed to address any specifics 
of the digital objects in the cultural heri-
tage domain. In this paper, we will take 
two case studies of recent projects and 
analyse to what extent the metadata ac-
companying digital objects contribute to 
guarantee longevity. We summarize this 
analysis in two scenarios for sustainabil-
ity of resources produced by small pro-
jects because compared to big institutions 
their digital assets are facing a higher risk 
not to be preserved properly. We also 
identify processes where natural lan-
guage technologies could be of help to 
make the preservation more efficient.
