 
An arbitrary definite clause grammar can be transforaled 
into a so-called Generalized Greibach Normal Form 
(GGNF), a generalization f the classical Greibach Nor- 
mat Form (GNF) for context-free grammars. 
The normalized efinite clause grammar is declara- 
tively equivalent to the original definite clause grammar, 
that is, it assigns the same analyses to the same strings. 
Offline-parsability of the original grammar is reflected in 
an elementary textual property of the transformed gram- 
mar. When this property holds, a direct (top-down) Pro- 
log implementation f the normalized grammar solves 
the parsing problem: all solutions are enumerated on 
backtracking and execution terminates. 
When specialized to the simpler case of context-free 
grammars, the GGNF provides a variant to file GNF, 
where the transformed context-free grammar not only 
generates the same strings as the original grammar, but 
also preserves their degrees of ambiguity (this last prop- 
erty does not hold for the GNF). 
The GGNF seems to be the first normal form result 
for DCGs. It provides an explicit factorization of the 
potential sources of uudeeidability for the parsing prob- 
lem, and offers valuable insights on the computational 
structure of unification grammars in general.
