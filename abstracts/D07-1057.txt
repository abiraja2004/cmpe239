In this paper, we present a machine learn-
ing approach to the identification and reso-
lution of Chinese anaphoric zero pronouns.
We perform both identification and resolu-
tion automatically, with two sets of easily
computable features. Experimental results
show that our proposed learning approach
achieves anaphoric zero pronoun resolution
accuracy comparable to a previous state-of-
the-art, heuristic rule-based approach. To
our knowledge, our work is the first to per-
form both identification and resolution of
Chinese anaphoric zero pronouns using a
machine learning approach.
