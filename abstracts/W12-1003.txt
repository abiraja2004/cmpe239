We present work on a verse-composition
assistant for composing, checking correct-
ness of, and singing traditional Basque
bertsoak?impromptu verses on particular
themes. A performing bertsolari?a verse
singer in the Basque Country?must ad-
here to strict rules that dictate the format
and content of the verses sung. To help
the aspiring bertsolari, we provide a tool
that includes a web interface that is able
to analyze, correct, provide suggestions and
synonyms, and tentatively also sing (using
text-to-speech synthesis) verses composed
by the user.
