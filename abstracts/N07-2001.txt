This paper explores what kind of user sim-
ulation model is suitable for developing
a training corpus for using Markov Deci-
sion Processes (MDPs) to automatically
learn dialog strategies. Our results sug-
gest that with sparse training data, a model
that aims to randomly explore more dialog
state spaces with certain constraints actu-
ally performs at the same or better than a
more complex model that simulates real-
istic user behaviors in a statistical way.
