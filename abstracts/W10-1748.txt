BBN submitted system combination out-
puts for Czech-English, German-English,
Spanish-English, French-English, and All-
English language pairs. All combinations
were based on confusion network decod-
ing. An incremental hypothesis alignment
algorithm with flexible matching was used
to build the networks. The bi-gram de-
coding weights for the single source lan-
guage translations were tuned directly to
maximize the BLEU score of the decod-
ing output. Approximate expected BLEU
was used as the objective function in gra-
dient based optimization of the combina-
tion weights for a 44 system multi-source
language combination (All-English). The
system combination gained around 0.4-
2.0 BLEU points over the best individual
systems on the single source conditions.
On the multi-source condition, the system
combination gained 6.6 BLEU points.
