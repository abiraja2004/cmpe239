We explore the contribution of different lexi-
cal and inflectional morphological features to
dependency parsing of Arabic, a morpholog-
ically rich language. We experiment with all
leading POS tagsets for Arabic, and introduce
a few new sets. We show that training the
parser using a simple regular expressive ex-
tension of an impoverished POS tagset with
high prediction accuracy does better than us-
ing a highly informative POS tagset with only
medium prediction accuracy, although the lat-
ter performs best on gold input. Using con-
trolled experiments, we find that definiteness
(or determiner presence), the so-called phi-
features (person, number, gender), and undi-
acritzed lemma are most helpful for Arabic
parsing on predicted input, while case and
state are most helpful on gold.
