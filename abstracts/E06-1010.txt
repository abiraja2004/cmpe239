We investigate a series of graph-theoretic
constraints on non-projective dependency
parsing and their effect on expressivity,
i.e. whether they allow naturally occurring
syntactic constructions to be adequately
represented, and efficiency, i.e. whether
they reduce the search space for the parser.
In particular, we define a new measure
for the degree of non-projectivity in an
acyclic dependency graph obeying the
single-head constraint. The constraints are
evaluated experimentally using data from
the Prague Dependency Treebank and the
Danish Dependency Treebank. The results
indicate that, whereas complete linguistic
coverage in principle requires unrestricted
non-projective dependency graphs, limit-
ing the degree of non-projectivity to at
most 2 can reduce average running time
from quadratic to linear, while excluding
less than 0.5% of the dependency graphs
found in the two treebanks. This is a sub-
stantial improvement over the commonly
used projective approximation (degree 0),
which excludes 15?25% of the graphs.
