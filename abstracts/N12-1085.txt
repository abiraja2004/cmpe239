Existing work in fine-grained sentiment anal-
ysis focuses on sentences and phrases but ig-
nores the contribution of individual words and
their grammatical connections. This is because
of a lack of both (1) annotated data at the word
level and (2) algorithms that can leverage syn-
tactic information in a principled way. We ad-
dress the first need by annotating articles from
the information technology business press via
crowdsourcing to provide training and testing
data. To address the second need, we propose
a suffix-tree data structure to represent syntac-
tic relationships between opinion targets and
words in a sentence that are opinion-bearing.
We show that a factor graph derived from this
data structure acquires these relationships with
a small number of word-level features. We
demonstrate that our supervised model per-
forms better than baselines that ignore syntac-
tic features and constraints.
