This paper proposes an efficient method
of sentence retrieval based on syntactic
structure. Collins proposed Tree Kernel
to calculate structural similarity. However,
structual retrieval based on Tree Kernel
is not practicable because the size of the
index table by Tree Kernel becomes im-
practical. We propose more efficient al-
gorithms approximating Tree Kernel: Tree
Overlapping and Subpath Set. These algo-
rithms are more efficient than Tree Kernel
because indexing is possible with practical
computation resources. The results of the
experiments comparing these three algo-
rithms showed that structural retrieval with
Tree Overlapping and Subpath Set were
faster than that with Tree Kernel by 100
times and 1,000 times respectively.
