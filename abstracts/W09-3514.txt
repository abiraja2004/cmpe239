We interpret the problem of transliterat-
ing English named entities into Hindi or
Japanese Katakana as a variant of the
letter-to-phoneme (L2P) subtask of text-
to-speech processing. Therefore, we apply
a re-implementation of a state-of-the-art,
discriminative L2P system (Jiampojamarn
et al, 2008) to the problem, without fur-
ther modification. In doing so, we hope
to provide a baseline for the NEWS 2009
Machine Transliteration Shared Task (Li
et al, 2009), indicating how much can be
achieved without transliteration-specific
technology. This paper briefly sum-
marizes the original work and our re-
implementation. We also describe a bug
in our submitted implementation, and pro-
vide updated results on the development
and test sets.
