In this paper we hypothesise that Denial of Ex-
pectation (DofE) across turns in dialogue sig-
nalled by ?but? can involve a range of different
expectations, i.e., not just causal expectations,
as argued in the literature. We will argue for
this hypothesis and outline a methodology to
distinguish the relations these denied expecta-
tions convey. Finally we will demonstrate the
practical utility of this hypothesis by showing
how it can improve generation of appropriate
responses to DofE and decrease the likelihood
of misunderstandings based on incorrectly in-
terpreting these underlying cross-speaker rela-
tions.
