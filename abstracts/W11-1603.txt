We present a method for the sentence-level
alignment of short simplified text to the orig-
inal text from which they were adapted. Our
goal is to align a medium-sized corpus of par-
allel text, consisting of short news texts in
Spanish with their simplified counterpart. No
training data is available for this task, so we
have to rely on unsupervised learning. In con-
trast to bilingual sentence alignment, in this
task we can exploit the fact that the probability
of sentence correspondence can be estimated
from lexical similarity between sentences. We
show that the algoithm employed performs
better than a baseline which approaches the
problem with a TF*IDF sentence similarity
metric. The alignment algorithm is being used
for the creation of a corpus for the study of
text simplification in the Spanish language.
