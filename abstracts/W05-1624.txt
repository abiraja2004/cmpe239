We describe a Wizard-of-Oz experiment setup for
the collection of multimodal interaction data for a
Music Player application. This setup was devel-
oped and used to collect experimental data as part
of a project aimed at building a flexible multimodal
dialogue system which provides an interface to an
MP3 player, combining speech and screen input
and output. Besides the usual goal of WOZ data
collection to get realistic examples of the behav-
ior and expectations of the users, an equally im-
portant goal for us was to observe natural behavior
of multiple wizards in order to guide our system
development. The wizards? responses were there-
fore not constrained by a script. One of the chal-
lenges we had to address was to allow the wizards
to produce varied screen output a in real time. Our
setup includes a preliminary screen output planning
module, which prepares several versions of possi-
ble screen output. The wizards were free to speak,
and/or to select a screen output.
