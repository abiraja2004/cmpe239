A rumor is commonly defined as a state-
ment whose true value is unverifiable. Ru-
mors may spread misinformation (false infor-
mation) or disinformation (deliberately false
information) on a network of people. Identi-
fying rumors is crucial in online social media
where large amounts of information are easily
spread across a large network by sources with
unverified authority. In this paper, we address
the problem of rumor detection in microblogs
and explore the effectiveness of 3 categories of
features: content-based, network-based, and
microblog-specific memes for correctly iden-
tifying rumors. Moreover, we show how these
features are also effective in identifying disin-
formers, users who endorse a rumor and fur-
ther help it to spread. We perform our exper-
iments on more than 10,000 manually anno-
tated tweets collected from Twitter and show
how our retrieval model achieves more than
0.95 in Mean Average Precision (MAP). Fi-
nally, we believe that our dataset is the first
large-scale dataset on rumor detection. It can
open new dimensions in analyzing online mis-
information and other aspects of microblog
conversations.
