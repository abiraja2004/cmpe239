 
Metaphorical and contextual affect de-
tection from open-ended text-based di-
alogue is challenging but essential for 
the building of effective intelligent user 
interfaces. In this paper, we report up-
dated developments of an affect detec-
tion model from text, including affect 
detection from one particular type of 
metaphorical affective expression and 
affect detection based on context. The 
overall affect detection model has been 
embedded in an intelligent conversa-
tional AI agent interacting with human 
users under loose scenarios. Evaluation 
for the updated affect detection compo-
nent is also provided. Our work contri-
butes to the conference themes on sen-
timent analysis and opinion mining and 
the development of dialogue and con-
versational agents.
