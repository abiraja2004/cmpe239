In this paper we summarize existing work on the recently introduced task of processing the scope
of negation and modality cues; we analyse the scope model that existing systems can process, which
is mainly the model reflected in the annotations of the biomedical corpus on which the systems have
been trained; and we point out aspects of the scope finding task that would be different based on
observations from a corpus from a different domain and nature.
