 
Speech recognition problems are a reality 
in current spoken dialogue systems. In 
order to better understand these phenom-
ena, we study dependencies between 
speech recognition problems and several 
higher level dialogue factors that define 
our notion of student state: frustra-
tion/anger, certainty and correctness. We 
apply Chi Square (?2) analysis to a cor-
pus of speech-based computer tutoring 
dialogues to discover these dependencies 
both within and across turns. Significant 
dependencies are combined to produce 
interesting insights regarding speech rec-
ognition problems and to propose new 
strategies for handling these problems. 
We also find that tutoring, as a new do-
main for speech applications, exhibits in-
teresting tradeoffs and new factors to 
consider for spoken dialogue design.
