A word has many senses, and each sense can
be mapped into many target words. Therefore,
to select the appropriate translation with a cor-
rect sense, the sense of a source word should be
disambiguated before selecting a target word.
Based on this observation, we propose a hybrid
method for translation selection that combines
disambiguation of a source word sense and se-
lection of a target word. Knowledge for transla-
tion selection is extracted from a bilingual dic-
tionary and target language corpora. Dividing
translation selection into the two sub-problems,
we can make knowledge acquisition straightfor-
ward and select more appropriate target words.
