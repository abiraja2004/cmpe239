Terminology structuring aims to elicit semantic re-
lations between the terms of a domain. We propose
here to exploit definitions found in corpora to ob-
tain such semantic relations. Definition typologies
show that definitions can be introduced by differ-
ent semantic relations, some of these relations be-
ing likely to structure terminologies. Our aim is
therefore to mine ?defining expressions? in domain-
specific corpora, and to detect the semantic rela-
tions they involve between their main terms. We
use lexico-syntactic markers and patterns to detect
at the same time both a definition and its main se-
mantic relation. 46 markers and 74 patterns have
been designed and tuned on a first corpus in the field
of anthropology. We report on their evaluation on a
second corpus in the field of dietetics, where they
obtained 4% to 36% recall and from 61 to 66% pre-
cision, and discuss the relative accuracy of different
subclasses of markers for this task.
