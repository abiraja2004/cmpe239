 
This paper describes a "bootstrapping" method 
which uses a broad-coverage, rule-based parser to 
compute probabilities while parsing an untagged 
corpus of NL text, and which then incorporates 
those probabilities into the processing of the same 
parser as it analyzes new text. Results are reported 
which show that this method can significantly 
improve the speed and accuracy of the parser 
without requiring the use of annotated corpora or 
human-supervised training during the computation 
of probabilities.
