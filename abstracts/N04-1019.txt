We present an empirically grounded method
for evaluating content selection in summariza-
tion. It incorporates the idea that no single best
model summary for a collection of documents
exists. Our method quantifies the relative im-
portance of facts to be conveyed. We argue that
it is reliable, predictive and diagnostic, thus im-
proves considerably over the shortcomings of
the human evaluation method currently used in
the Document Understanding Conference.
