Tracking information flow (IFLOW) is crucial
to understanding the evolution of news sto-
ries. We present analysis and experiments for
IFLOW between company announcements and
newswire. Error analysis shows that many FPs
are annotation errors and many FNs are due
to coarse-grained document-level modelling.
Experiments show that document meta-data
features (e.g., category, length, timing) im-
prove f-scores relative to upper bound by 23%.
