Monolingual translation probabilities have
recently been introduced in retrieval mod-
els to solve the lexical gap problem.
They can be obtained by training statisti-
cal translation models on parallel mono-
lingual corpora, such as question-answer
pairs, where answers act as the ?source?
language and questions as the ?target?
language. In this paper, we propose
to use as a parallel training dataset the
definitions and glosses provided for the
same term by different lexical semantic re-
sources. We compare monolingual trans-
lation models built from lexical semantic
resources with two other kinds of datasets:
manually-tagged question reformulations
and question-answer pairs. We also show
that the monolingual translation probabil-
ities obtained (i) are comparable to tradi-
tional semantic relatedness measures and
(ii) significantly improve the results over
the query likelihood and the vector-space
model for answer finding.
