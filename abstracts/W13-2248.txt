This paper presents the LIG?s systems
submitted for Task 2 of WMT13 Qual-
ity Estimation campaign. This is a
word confidence estimation (WCE) task
where each participant was asked to la-
bel each word in a translated text as
a binary ( Keep/Change) or multi-class
(Keep/Substitute/Delete) category. We in-
tegrate a number of features of various
types (system-based, lexical, syntactic and
semantic) into the conventional feature
set, for our baseline classifier training.
After the experiments with all features,
we deploy a ?Feature Selection? strategy
to keep only the best performing ones.
Then, a method that combines multiple
?weak? classifiers to build a strong ?com-
posite? classifier by taking advantage of
their complementarity is presented and ex-
perimented. We then select the best sys-
tems for submission and present the offi-
cial results obtained.
