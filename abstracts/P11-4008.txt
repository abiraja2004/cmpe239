This paper presents Engkoo 1, a system for
exploring and learning language. It is built
primarily by mining translation knowledge
from billions of web pages - using the Inter-
net to catch language in motion. Currently
Engkoo is built for Chinese users who are
learning English; however the technology it-
self is language independent and can be ex-
tended in the future. At a system level, En-
gkoo is an application platform that supports a
multitude of NLP technologies such as cross
language retrieval, alignment, sentence clas-
sification, and statistical machine translation.
The data set that supports this system is pri-
marily built from mining a massive set of
bilingual terms and sentences from across the
web. Specifically, web pages that contain
both Chinese and English are discovered and
analyzed for parallelism, extracted and for-
mulated into clear term definitions and sam-
ple sentences. This approach allows us to
build perhaps the world?s largest lexicon link-
ing both Chinese and English together - at the
same time covering the most up-to-date terms
as captured by the net.
