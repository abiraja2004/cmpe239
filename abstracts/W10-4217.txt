Building NLG systems, in particular sta-
tistical ones, requires parallel data (paired
inputs and outputs) which do not gener-
ally occur naturally. In this paper, we in-
vestigate the idea of automatically extract-
ing parallel resources for data-to-text gen-
eration from comparable corpora obtained
from the Web. We describe our compa-
rable corpus of data and texts relating to
British hills and the techniques for extract-
ing paired input/output fragments we have
developed so far.
