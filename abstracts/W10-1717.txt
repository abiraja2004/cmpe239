lish-French (E-F) and French-English (F-E) 
translation tasks of the ACL WMT 2010 eval-
uation. The most notable improvement over 
earlier versions of Portage is an efficient im-
plementation of lattice MERT. While Portage 
has typically performed well in Chinese to 
English MT evaluations, most recently in the 
NIST09 evaluation, our participation in WMT 
2010 revealed some interesting differences be-
tween Chinese-English and E-F/F-E transla-
tion, and alerted us to certain weak spots in 
our system. Most of this paper discusses the 
problems we found in our system and ways of 
fixing them. We learned several lessons that 
we think will be of general interest.
