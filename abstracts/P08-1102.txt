We propose a cascaded linear model for
joint Chinese word segmentation and part-
of-speech tagging. With a character-based
perceptron as the core, combined with real-
valued features such as language models, the
cascaded model is able to efficiently uti-
lize knowledge sources that are inconvenient
to incorporate into the perceptron directly.
Experiments show that the cascaded model
achieves improved accuracies on both seg-
mentation only and joint segmentation and
part-of-speech tagging. On the Penn Chinese
Treebank 5.0, we obtain an error reduction of
18.5% on segmentation and 12% on joint seg-
mentation and part-of-speech tagging over the
perceptron-only baseline.
