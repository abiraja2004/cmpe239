Discourse in and about computational linguis-
tics depends on a shared body of knowledge.
However, little content is shared across the
introductory courses in this field. Instead,
they typically cover a diverse assortment of
topics tailored to the capabilities of the stu-
dents and the interests of the instructor. If the
core body of knowledge could be agreed and
incorporated into introductory courses several
benefits would ensue, such as the proliferation
of instructional materials, software support,
and extension modules building on a com-
mon foundation. This paper argues that it is
worthwhile to articulate a core body of knowl-
edge, and proposes a starting point based on
the ACM Computer Science Curriculum. A
variety of issues specific to the multidisci-
plinary nature of computational linguistics are
explored.
