 
We present a computational model of ac-
quiring a second language from example 
sentences. Our learning algorithms build a 
construction grammar language model, 
and generalize using form-based patterns 
and the learner?s conceptual system. We 
use a unique professional language learn-
ing corpus, and show that substantial reli-
able learning can be achieved even though 
the corpus is very small. The model is ap-
plied to assisting the authoring of Japa-
nese language learning corpora.
