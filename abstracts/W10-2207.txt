evaluating competing syllabic parses of a pho-
nological string on the basis of temporal pat-
terns in speech production data. This is done 
by constructing models linking syllable parses 
to patterns of coordination between articulato-
ry events. Data simulated from different syl-
labic parses are evaluated against experimental 
data from American English and Moroccan 
Arabic, two languages claimed to parse similar 
strings of segments into different syllabic 
structures. Results implicate a tautosyllabic 
parse of initial consonant clusters in English 
and a heterosyllabic parse of initial clusters in 
Arabic, in accordance with theoretical work on 
the syllable structure of these languages. It is 
further demonstrated that the model can cor-
rectly diagnose syllable structure even when 
previously proposed phonetic heuristics for 
such structure do not clearly point to the cor-
rect diagnosis.
