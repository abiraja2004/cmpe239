We present a novel approach, called selec-
tional branching, which uses confidence es-
timates to decide when to employ a beam,
providing the accuracy of beam search at
speeds close to a greedy transition-based
dependency parsing approach. Selectional
branching is guaranteed to perform a fewer
number of transitions than beam search yet
performs as accurately. We also present a
new transition-based dependency parsing
algorithm that gives a complexity of O(n)
for projective parsing and an expected lin-
ear time speed for non-projective parsing.
With the standard setup, our parser shows
an unlabeled attachment score of 92.96%
and a parsing speed of 9 milliseconds per
sentence, which is faster and more accurate
than the current state-of-the-art transition-
based parser that uses beam search.
