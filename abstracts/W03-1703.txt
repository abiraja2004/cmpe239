 
This paper proposes a new approach to 
segmentation of utterances into sentences 
using a new linguistic model based upon 
Maximum-entropy-weighted Bi-
directional N-grams. The usual N-gram 
algorithm searches for sentence bounda-
ries in a text from left to right only. Thus 
a candidate sentence boundary in the text 
is evaluated mainly with respect to its left 
context, without fully considering its right 
context. Using this approach, utterances 
are often divided into incomplete sen-
tences or fragments. In order to make use 
of both the right and left contexts of can-
didate sentence boundaries, we propose a 
new linguistic modeling approach based 
on Maximum-entropy-weighted Bi-
directional N-grams. Experimental results 
indicate that the new approach signifi-
cantly outperforms the usual N-gram al-
gorithm for segmenting both Chinese and 
English utterances.
