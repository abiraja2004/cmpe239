This paper describes a user study where hu-
mans interactively train automatic text clas-
sifiers. We attempt to replicate previous re-
sults using multiple ?average? Internet users
instead of a few domain experts as annotators.
We also analyze user annotation behaviors to
find that certain labeling actions have an im-
pact on classifier accuracy, drawing attention
to the important role these behavioral factors
play in interactive learning systems.
