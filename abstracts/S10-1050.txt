This paper describes our approach to the
automatic identification of semantic rela-
tions between nominals in English sen-
tences. The basic idea of our strategy
is to develop machine-learning classifiers
which: (1) make use of class-independent
features and classifier; (2) make use of
a simple and effective feature set without
high computational cost; (3) make no use
of external annotated or unannotated cor-
pus at all. At SemEval 2010 Task 8 our
system achieved an F-measure of 75.43%
and a accuracy of 70.22%.
