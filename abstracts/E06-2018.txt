This paper quantitatively investigates in
how far local context is useful to disam-
biguate the senses of an ambiguous word.
This is done by comparing the co-occur-
rence frequencies of particular context
words. First, one context word repre-
senting a certain sense is chosen, and then
the co-occurrence frequencies with two
other context words, one of the same and
one of another sense, are compared. As
expected, it turns out that context words
belonging to the same sense have consid-
erably higher co-occurrence frequencies
than words belonging to different senses.
In our study, the sense inventory is taken
from the University of South Florida
homograph norms, and the co-occurrence
counts are based on the British National
Corpus.
