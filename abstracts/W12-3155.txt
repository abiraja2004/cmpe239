The new frontier of computer assisted transla-
tion technology is the effective integration of
statistical MT within the translation workflow.
In this respect, the SMT ability of incremen-
tally learning from the translations produced
by users plays a central role. A still open
problem is the evaluation of SMT systems that
evolve over time. In this paper, we propose
a new metric for assessing the quality of an
adaptive MT component that is derived from
the theory of learning curves: the percentage
slope.
