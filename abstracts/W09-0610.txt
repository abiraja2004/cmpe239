This paper shows a model of automatic in-
struction giving for guiding human users
in virtual 3D environments. A multilevel
model for choosing what instruction to
give in every state is presented, and so
are the different modules that compose the
whole generation system. How 3D in-
formation in the virtual world is used is
explained, and the final order generation
is detailed. This model has been imple-
mented as a solution for the GIVE Chal-
lenge, an instruction generation challenge.
