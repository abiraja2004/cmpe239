 
We explore the task of automatic classifica-
tion of texts by the emotions expressed. Our 
novel method arranges neutrality, polarity and 
emotions hierarchically. We test the method 
on two datasets and show that it outperforms 
the corresponding ?flat? approach, which does 
not take into account the hierarchical informa-
tion. The highly imbalanced structure of most 
of the datasets in this area, particularly the two 
datasets with which we worked, has a dramat-
ic effect on the performance of classification. 
The hierarchical approach helps alleviate the 
effect.
