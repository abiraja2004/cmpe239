Domain knowledge is the fundamental 
resources required by all intelligent 
information processing systems. With 
the upsurge of new technology and new 
products in various domains, the 
manual construction and updating of 
domain knowledge base can hardly 
meet the real needs of application 
systems, in terms of coverage or 
effectiveness. 
Based on natural language text analysis, 
this paper intends to draw a basic 
framework for the construction of 
domain knowledge base. Using 
encyclopedia resources and text 
information resources on the Web, we 
focus on the method of constructing 
domain knowledge base through 
technologies in natural language text 
analysis and machine learning. 
Moreover, an open network platform 
will be developed, through which 
common users can work with domain 
experts to contribute domain 
knowledge.
The technology can be applied to the 
construction and updating of domain 
knowledge base for intelligent 
information processing, and it can also 
provide help for the knowledge 
updating of encyclopedias.
