Mapping and classification of chemical
compound names are important aspects of
the tasks of BioNLP. This paper introduces
the architecture of a system for the syntac-
tic and semantic analysis of such names.
Our system aims at yielding both the de-
noted chemical structure and a classifica-
tion of a given name. We employ a novel
approach to the task which promises an
elegant and efficient way of solving the
problem. The proposed system differs sig-
nificantly from existing systems, in that it
is also able to deal with underspecifying
names and class names.
