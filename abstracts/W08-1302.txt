We investigate auxiliary distribu-
tions (Johnson and Riezler, 2000) for
domain adaptation of a supervised parsing
system of Dutch. To overcome the limited
target domain training data, we exploit an
original and larger out-of-domain model
as auxiliary distribution. However, our
empirical results exhibit that the auxiliary
distribution does not help: even when very
little target training data is available the
incorporation of the out-of-domain model
does not contribute to parsing accuracy on
the target domain; instead, better results
are achieved either without adaptation or
by simple model combination.
