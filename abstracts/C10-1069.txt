gether the phrases of a phrase-based sta-
tistical machine translation (SMT) sys-
tem, using information in the phrase table 
itself. The clustering is symmetric and 
recursive: it is applied both to source-
language and target-language phrases, 
and the clustering in one language helps 
determine the clustering in the other. The 
phrase clusters have many possible uses. 
This paper looks at one of these uses: 
smoothing the conditional translation 
model (TM) probabilities employed by 
the SMT system. We incorporated 
phrase-cluster-derived probability esti-
mates into a baseline loglinear feature 
combination that included relative fre-
quency and lexically-weighted condition-
al probability estimates. In Chinese-
English (C-E) and French-English (F-E) 
learning curve experiments, we obtained 
a gain over the baseline in 29 of 30 tests, 
with a maximum gain of 0.55 BLEU 
points (though most gains were fairly 
small). The largest gains came with me-
dium (200-400K sentence pairs) rather 
than with small (less than 100K sentence 
pairs) amounts of training data, contrary 
to what one would expect from the pa-
raphrasing literature. We have only be-
gun to explore the original smoothing 
approach described here.
