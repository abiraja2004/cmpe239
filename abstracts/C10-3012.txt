In this paper, we propose a lexical senses
representation system called E-HowNet,
in which the lexical senses are defined by
basic concepts. As a result, the mean-
ings of expressions are more specific than
those derived by using primitives. We also
design an ontology to express the taxo-
nomic relations between concepts and the
attributes of concepts. To establish the
taxonomic relations between word senses,
we introduce a strategy that constructs the
E-HowNet ontology automatically. We
then implement the lexical ontology as a
Web application1 to demonstrate the tax-
onomy and the search functions for query-
ing key-terms and E-HowNet expressions
in the lexicon, which contains more than
88,000 lexical senses.
