In this paper we present a choreography that
explains the process of supervised machine
learning. We present how a perceptron (in its
dual form) uses convolution kernels to learn
to differentiate between two categories of ob-
jects. Convolution kernels such as string ker-
nels and tree kernels are widely used in Nat-
ural Language Processing (NLP) applications.
However, the baggage associated with learn-
ing the theory behind convolution kernels,
which extends beyond graduate linear algebra,
makes the adoption of this technology intrinsi-
cally difficult. The main challenge in creating
this choreography was that we were required
to represent these mathematical equations at
their meaning level before we could translate
them into the language of movement. By or-
chestrating such a choreography, we believe,
we have obviated the need for people to posses
advanced math background in order to appre-
ciate the core ideas of using convolution ker-
nels in a supervised learning setting.
