In this paper we discuss issues related to
speeding up parsing with wide-coverage
unification grammars. We demonstrate
that state-of-the-art optimisation tech-
niques based on backbone parsing before
unification do not provide a general so-
lution, because they depend on specific
properties of the grammar formalism that
do not hold for all unification based gram-
mars. As an alternative, we describe an
optimisation technique that combines am-
biguity packing at the constituent structure
level with pruning based on local features.
