This paper describes the National Research Coun-
cil (NRC) Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) sys-
tem, as applied to the English Lexical Sample (ELS)
task in Senseval-3. The NRC system approach-
es WSD as a classical supervised machine learn-
ing problem, using familiar tools such as the Weka
machine learning software and Brill?s rule-based
part-of-speech tagger. Head words are represent-
ed as feature vectors with several hundred features.
Approximately half of the features are syntactic and
the other half are semantic. The main novelty in the
system is the method for generating the semantic
features, based on word co-occurrence probabilities.
The probabilities are estimated using the Waterloo
MultiText System with a corpus of about one ter-
abyte of unlabeled text, collected by a web crawler.
