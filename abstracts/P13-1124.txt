Long distance reordering remains one of
the greatest challenges in statistical ma-
chine translation research as the key con-
textual information may well be beyond
the confine of translation units. In this
paper, we propose Two-Neighbor Orien-
tation (TNO) model that jointly models
the orientation decisions between anchors
and two neighboring multi-unit chunks
which may cross phrase or rule bound-
aries. We explicitly model the longest
span of such chunks, referred to as Max-
imal Orientation Span, to serve as a
global parameter that constrains under-
lying local decisions. We integrate our
proposed model into a state-of-the-art
string-to-dependency translation system
and demonstrate the efficacy of our pro-
posal in a large-scale Chinese-to-English
translation task. On NIST MT08 set, our
most advanced model brings around +2.0
BLEU and -1.0 TER improvement.
