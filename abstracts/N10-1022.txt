In this paper we propose a novel general
framework for unsupervised model adapta-
tion. Our method is based on entropy which
has been used previously as a regularizer in
semi-supervised learning. This technique in-
cludes another term which measures the sta-
bility of posteriors w.r.t model parameters, in
addition to conditional entropy. The idea is to
use parameters which result in both low con-
ditional entropy and also stable decision rules.
As an application, we demonstrate how this
framework can be used for adjusting language
model interpolation weight for speech recog-
nition task to adapt from Broadcast news data
to MIT lecture data. We show how the new
technique can obtain comparable performance
to completely supervised estimation of inter-
polation parameters.
