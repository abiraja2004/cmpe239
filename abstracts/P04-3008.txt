The manual design of grammars for accurate natu-
ral language analysis is an iterative process; while
modelling decisions usually determine parser be-
haviour, evidence from analysing more or differ-
ent input can suggest unforeseen regularities, which
leads to a reformulation of rules, or even to a differ-
ent model of previously analysed phenomena. We
describe an implementation of Weighted Constraint
Dependency Grammar that supports the grammar
writer by providing display, automatic analysis, and
diagnosis of dependency analyses and allows the di-
rect exploration of alternative analyses and their sta-
tus under the current grammar.
