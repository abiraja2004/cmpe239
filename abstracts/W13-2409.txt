We propose a language-independent word
normalization method exemplified on
modernizing historical Slovene words.
Our method relies on character-based sta-
tistical machine translation and uses only
shallow knowledge. We present the rel-
evant lexicons and two experiments. In
one, we use a lexicon of historical word?
contemporary word pairs and a list of con-
temporary words; in the other, we only
use a list of historical words and one of
contemporary ones. We show that both
methods produce significantly better re-
sults than the baseline.
