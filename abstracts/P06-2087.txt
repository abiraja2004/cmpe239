We report on the development of a new au-
tomatic feedback model to improve informa-
tion retrieval in digital libraries. Our hy-
pothesis is that some particular sentences,
selected based on argumentative criteria,
can be more useful than others to perform
well-known feedback information retrieval
tasks. The argumentative model we ex-
plore is based on four disjunct classes, which
has been very regularly observed in scien-
tific reports: PURPOSE, METHODS, RE-
SULTS, CONCLUSION. To test this hy-
pothesis, we use the Rocchio algorithm as
baseline. While Rocchio selects the fea-
tures to be added to the original query
based on statistical evidence, we propose
to base our feature selection also on argu-
mentative criteria. Thus, we restrict the ex-
pansion on features appearing only in sen-
tences classified into one of our argumen-
tative categories. Our results, obtained on
the OHSUMED collection, show a signifi-
cant improvement when expansion is based
on PURPOSE (mean average precision =
+23%) and CONCLUSION (mean average
precision = +41%) contents rather than on
other argumentative contents. These results
suggest that argumentation is an important
linguistic dimension that could benefit in-
formation retrieval.
