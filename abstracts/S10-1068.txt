We compare several  state of the art dependency 
parsers  with  our  own  parser  based  on  a  linear 
classification  technique.  Our  primary  goal  is 
therefore to use syntactic information only, in or-
der to keep the comparison of the parsers as fair 
as possible. We demonstrate, that despite the in-
ferior result using the standard evaluation metrics 
for  parsers  like  UAS  or  LAS  on  standard  test 
data,  our  system  achieves  comparable  results 
when used in an application, such as the SemEv-
al-2 #12 evaluation exercise PETE. Our submis-
sion achieved the 4th position out of 19 participat-
ing systems. However, since it only uses a linear 
classifier  it  works 17-20 times faster  than other 
state of the parsers, as for instance MaltParser or 
Stanford Parser.
