 
In this paper, we introduce a multilingual ac-
cess and retrieval system with enhanced query 
translation and multilingual document retrieval, 
by mining bilingual terminologies and aligned 
document directly from the set of comparable 
corpora which are to be searched upon by us-
ers. By extracting bilingual terminologies and 
aligning bilingual documents with similar con-
tent prior to the search process provide more 
accurate translated terms for the in-domain 
data and support multilingual retrieval even 
without the use of translation tool during re-
trieval time. This system includes a user-
friendly graphical user interface designed to 
provide navigation and retrieval of information 
in browse mode and search mode respectively.
