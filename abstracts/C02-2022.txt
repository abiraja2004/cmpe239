Cross-linguistic phoneme correspondences, or meta-
phonemes1, can be defined across languages which are
relatively closely related in exactly the same way as cor-
respondences can be defined for dialects, or accents, of a
single language (e.g. O?Connor, 1973; Fitt, 2001). In this
paper we present the theory of metaphonemes, compar-
ing them with traditional archi- and morphophonemes as
well as with similar work using ?keysymbols? done for
accents of English. We describe the metaphoneme inven-
tory defined for Dutch, English and German, comparing
the results for vowels and consonants. We also describe
some of the unexpected information that arose from the
analysis of cognate forms we undertook to find the meta-
phoneme correspondences.
