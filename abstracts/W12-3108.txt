We describe a submission to the WMT12
Quality Estimation task, including an exten-
sive Machine Learning experimentation. Data
were augmented with features from linguis-
tic analysis and statistical features from the
SMT search graph. Several Feature Selec-
tion algorithms were employed. The Quality
Estimation problem was addressed both as a
regression task and as a discretised classifi-
cation task, but the latter did not generalise
well on the unseen testset. The most success-
ful regression methods had an RMSE of 0.86
and were trained with a feature set given by
Correlation-based Feature Selection. Indica-
tions that RMSE is not always sufficient for
measuring performance were observed.
