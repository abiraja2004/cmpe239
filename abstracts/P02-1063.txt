This paper presents a revision learn-
ing method that achieves high per-
formance with small computational
cost by combining a model with high
generalization capacity and a model
with small computational cost. This
method uses a high capacity model to
revise the output of a small cost model.
We apply this method to English part-
of-speech tagging and Japanese mor-
phological analysis, and show that the
method performs well.
