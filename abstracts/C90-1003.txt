Abstract 
This paper describes a way of expressing syn- 
tactic rules that ~kssociate semantic formulae 
with strings, but in a manner thai is inde- 
pendent of the syntactic details of these for- 
mulac. In particular we show how the same 
rules construct predicate argument formulae 
in the style of Montague grammar\[131, rap_ 
resentations reminiscent of situation seman- 
tics(Barwise and Perry 121) and of the event 
logic of Davidson \[5\], or representations in- 
spired by the discourse representations pro- 
posed by Kamp \[191. The idea is that seman- 
tic representations are specilied indirectly us- 
ing semantic onstruction operators, which en- 
force an abstraction barrier between the gram- 
mar and the semantic representations them- 
selves. First we present a simple grammar 
which is compatible with the three different 
sets of constructors for the three formalisms. 
We then extend the grammar to provide one 
treatment that accounts for quantilier aising in 
the three different semantic formalisms
