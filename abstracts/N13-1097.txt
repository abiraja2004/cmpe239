Twitter has been shown to be a fast and reli-
able method for disease surveillance of com-
mon illnesses like influenza. However, previ-
ous work has relied on simple content anal-
ysis, which conflates flu tweets that report
infection with those that express concerned
awareness of the flu. By discriminating these
categories, as well as tweets about the authors
versus about others, we demonstrate signifi-
cant improvements on influenza surveillance
using Twitter.
