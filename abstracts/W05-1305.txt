We present a database of annotated
biomedical text corpora merged into a
portable data structure with uniform con-
ventions. MedTag combines three cor-
pora, MedPost, ABGene and GENETAG,
within a common relational database data
model. The GENETAG corpus has been
modified to reflect new definitions of
genes and proteins. The MedPost cor-
pus has been updated to include 1,000
additional sentences from the clinical
medicine domain. All data have been up-
dated with original MEDLINE text ex-
cerpts, PubMed identifiers, and tokeniza-
tion independence to facilitate data accu-
racy, consistency and usability.
The data are available in flat files along
with software to facilitate loading the
data into a relational SQL database
from ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/lsmith
