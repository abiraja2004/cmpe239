This paper describes a hybrid, two-level
approach for resolving hedge cues, the
problem of the CoNLL-2010 shared task.
First, a maximum entropy classifier is ap-
plied to identify cue words, using both
syntactic- and surface-oriented features.
Second, a set of manually crafted rules,
operating on dependency representations
and the output of the classifier, is applied
to resolve the scope of the hedge cues
within the sentence.
