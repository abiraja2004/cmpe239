The extraction of nested, semantically rich
relationships of biological entities has re-
cently gained popularity in the biomed-
ical text mining community. To move
toward this objective, a method is pro-
posed for reconstructing original seman-
tic relationship graphs from projections,
where each node and edge is mapped to
the representative of its equivalence class,
by determining the relationship argument
combinations that represent real relation-
ships. It generalises the limited postpro-
cessing step of the method of Bjo?rne et al
(2010) and hence extends this extraction
method to arbitrarily deep relationships
with unrestricted primary argument com-
binations. The viability of the method is
shown by successfully extracting nested
relationships in BioInfer and the corpus
of the BioNLP?09 Shared Task on Event
Extraction. The reported results, to the
best of our knowledge, are the first for the
nested relationships in BioInfer on a task
in which only named entities are given.
