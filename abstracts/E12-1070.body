Widely accepted resources for semantic
parsing, such as PropBank and FrameNet,
are not perfect as a semantic role label-
ing framework. Their semantic roles are
not strictly defined; therefore, their mean-
ings and semantic characteristics are un-
clear. In addition, it is presupposed that
a single semantic role is assigned to each
syntactic argument. This is not necessarily
true when we consider internal structures of
verb semantics. We propose a new frame-
work for semantic role annotation which
solves these problems by extending the the-
ory of lexical conceptual structure (LCS).
By comparing our framework with that of
existing resources, including VerbNet and
FrameNet, we demonstrate that our ex-
tended LCS framework can give a formal
definition of semantic role labels, and that
multiple roles of arguments can be repre-
sented strictly and naturally.
