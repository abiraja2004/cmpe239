 
This paper describes an interactive 
graphical environment for computational 
semantics. The system provides a teach- 
ing tool, a stand alone extendible gra- 
pher, and a library of algorithms to- 
gether with test suites. The teaching 
tool allows users to work step by step 
through derivations of semantic repre- 
sentations, and to compare the proper- 
ties of various semantic formalisms uch 
as Intensional Logic, DRT, and Situation 
Semantics. The system is freely available 
on the Internet.
