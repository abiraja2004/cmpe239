Statistical machine translation systems are
usually trained on large amounts of bilin-
gual text and monolingual text in the tar-
get language. In this paper we explore the
use of transductive semi-supervised meth-
ods for the effective use of monolingual data
from the source language in order to im-
prove translation quality. We propose sev-
eral algorithms with this aim, and present the
strengths and weaknesses of each one. We
present detailed experimental evaluations on
the French?English EuroParl data set and on
data from the NIST Chinese?English large-
data track. We show a significant improve-
ment in translation quality on both tasks.
