We investigate the influence of informa-
tion status (IS) on constituent order in Ger-
man, and integrate our findings into a log-
linear surface realisation ranking model.
We show that the distribution of pairs of IS
categories is strongly asymmetric. More-
over, each category is correlated with mor-
phosyntactic features, which can be au-
tomatically detected. We build a log-
linear model that incorporates these asym-
metries for ranking German string reali-
sations from input LFG F-structures. We
show that it achieves a statistically signif-
icantly higher BLEU score than the base-
line system without these features.
