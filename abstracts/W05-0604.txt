Recent work on the problem of detect-
ing synonymy through corpus analysis has
used the Test of English as a Foreign Lan-
guage (TOEFL) as a benchmark. How-
ever, this test involves as few as 80 ques-
tions, prompting questions regarding the
statistical significance of reported results.
We overcome this limitation by generating
a TOEFL-like test using WordNet, con-
taining thousands of questions and com-
posed only of words occurring with suf-
ficient corpus frequency to support sound
distributional comparisons. Experiments
with this test lead us to a similarity mea-
sure which significantly outperforms the
best proposed to date. Analysis suggests
that a strength of this measure is its rela-
tive robustness against polysemy.
