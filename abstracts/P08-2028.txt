The omnipresence of unknown words is a
problem that any NLP component needs to ad-
dress in some form. While there exist many
established techniques for dealing with un-
known words in the realm of POS-tagging, for
example, guessing unknown words? semantic
properties is a less-explored area with greater
challenges. In this paper, we study the seman-
tic field of sentiment and propose five methods
for assigning prior sentiment polarities to un-
known words based on known sentiment carri-
ers. Tested on 2000 cases, the methods mirror
human judgements closely in three- and two-
way polarity classification tasks, and reach ac-
curacies above 63% and 81%, respectively.
