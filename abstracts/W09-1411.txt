We present an approach for extracting molec-
ular events from literature based on a deep
parser, using in a query language for parse
trees. Detected events range from gene ex-
pression to protein localization, and cover a
multitude of different entity types, including
genes/proteins, binding sites, and locations.
Furthermore, our approach is capable of rec-
ognizing negation and the speculative char-
acter of extracted statements. We first parse
documents using Link Grammar (BioLG) and
store the parse trees in a database. Events are
extracted using a newly developed query lan-
guage with traverses the BioLG linkages be-
tween trigger terms, arguments, and events.
The concrete queries are learnt from an an-
notated corpus. On BioNLP Shared Task data,
we achieve an overall F1-measure of 29.6%.
