We introduce a new emotion classification
task based on Leary?s Rose, a framework for
interpersonal communication. We present a
small dataset of 740 Dutch sentences, out-
line the annotation process and evaluate an-
notator agreement. We then evaluate the per-
formance of several automatic classification
systems when classifying individual sentences
according to the four quadrants and the eight
octants of Leary?s Rose. SVM-based classi-
fiers achieve average F-scores of up to 51% for
4-way classification and 31% for 8-way clas-
sification, which is well above chance level.
We conclude that emotion classification ac-
cording to the Interpersonal Circumplex is a
challenging task for both humans and ma-
chine learners. We expect classification per-
formance to increase as context information
becomes available in future versions of our
dataset.
