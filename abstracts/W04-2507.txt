 
In this paper we describe some preliminary 
results of qualitative evaluation of the answer-
ing system HITIQA (High-Quality Interactive 
Question Answering) which has been devel-
oped over the last 2 years as an advanced re-
search tool for information analysts. HITIQA 
is an interactive open-domain question an-
swering technology designed to allow analysts 
to pose complex exploratory questions in natu-
ral language and obtain relevant information 
units to prepare their briefing reports in order 
to satisfy a given scenario. The system uses 
novel data-driven semantics to conduct a clari-
fication dialogue with the user that explores 
the scope and the context of the desired answer 
space. The system has undergone extensive 
hands-on evaluations by a group of intelli-
gence analysts representing various foreign in-
telligence services. This evaluation validated 
the overall approach in HITIQA but also ex-
posed limitations of the current prototype.
