In this approach to named entity recognition,
a recurrent neural network, known as Long
Short-Term Memory, is applied. The network
is trained to perform 2 passes on each sentence,
outputting its decisions on the second pass. The
first pass is used to acquire information for dis-
ambiguation during the second pass. SARD-
NET, a self-organising map for sequences is
used to generate representations for the lexical
items presented to the LSTM network, whilst
orthogonal representations are used to repre-
sent the part of speech and chunk tags.
