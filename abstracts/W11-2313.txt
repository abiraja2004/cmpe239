A corpus of easy-to-read texts in combination
with a base vocabulary pool for Swedish was
used in order to build a basic vocabulary. The
coverage of these entries by symbols in an ex-
isting AAC database was then assessed. We
finally suggest a method for enriching the ex-
pressive power of the AAC language by com-
bining existing symbols and in this way illus-
trate additional concepts.
