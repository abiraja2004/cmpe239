We present a natural language gener-
ator that produces a range of medi-
cal reports on the clinical histories of
cancer patients, and discuss the prob-
lem of conceptual restatement in gen-
erating various textual views of the
same conceptual content. We focus on
two features of our system: the de-
mand for ?loose paraphrases? between
the various reports on a given patient,
with a high degree of semantic overlap
but some necessary amount of distinc-
tive content; and the requirement for
paraphrasing at primarily the discourse
level.
