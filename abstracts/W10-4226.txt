There were three GREC Tasks at Gen-
eration Challenges 2010: GREC-NER re-
quired participating systems to identify
all people references in texts; for GREC-
NEG, systems selected coreference chains
for all people entities in texts; and GREC-
Full combined the NER and NEG tasks, i.e.
systems identified and, if appropriate, re-
placed references to people in texts. Five
teams submitted 10 systems in total, and
we additionally created baseline systems
for each task. Systems were evaluated au-
tomatically using a range of intrinsic met-
rics. In addition, systems were assessed by
human judges using preference strength
judgements. This report presents the eval-
uation results, along with descriptions of
the three GREC tasks, the evaluation meth-
ods, and the participating systems.
