Context-dependent word similarity can be
measured over multiple cross-cutting dimen-
sions. For example, lung and breath are sim-
ilar thematically, while authoritative and su-
perficial occur in similar syntactic contexts,
but share little semantic similarity. Both of
these notions of similarity play a role in deter-
mining word meaning, and hence lexical se-
mantic models must take them both into ac-
count. Towards this end, we develop a novel
model, Multi-View Mixture (MVM), that rep-
resents words as multiple overlapping clus-
terings. MVM finds multiple data partitions
based on different subsets of features, sub-
ject to the marginal constraint that feature sub-
sets are distributed according to Latent Dirich-
let Allocation. Intuitively, this constraint fa-
vors feature partitions that have coherent top-
ical semantics. Furthermore, MVM uses soft
feature assignment, hence the contribution of
each data point to each clustering view is vari-
able, isolating the impact of data only to views
where they assign the most features. Through
a series of experiments, we demonstrate the
utility of MVM as an inductive bias for captur-
ing relations between words that are intuitive
to humans, outperforming related models such
as Latent Dirichlet Allocation.
