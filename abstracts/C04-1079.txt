 
The tedious task of responding to a backlog of 
email is one which is familiar to many researchers.  
As a subset of email management, we address the 
problem of constructing a summary of email 
discussions.  Specifically, we examine ongoing 
discussions which will ultimately culminate in a 
consensus in a decision-making process.  Our 
summary provides a snapshot of the current state-
of-affairs of the discussion and facilitates a speedy 
response from the user, who might be the 
bottleneck in some matter being resolved.  We 
present a method which uses the structure of the 
thread dialogue and word vector techniques to 
determine which sentence in the thread should be 
extracted as the main issue.   Our solution 
successfully identifies the sentence containing the 
issue of the thread being discussed, potentially 
more informative than subject line.
