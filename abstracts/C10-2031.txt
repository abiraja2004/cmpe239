Prepositions in English are a well-known
challenge for language learners, and the
computational analysis of preposition us-
age has attracted significant attention.
Such research generally starts out by de-
veloping models of preposition usage for
native English based on a range of fea-
tures, from shallow surface evidence to
deep linguistically-informed properties.
While we agree that ultimately a com-
bination of shallow and deep features is
needed to balance the preciseness of ex-
emplars with the usefulness of generaliza-
tions to avoid data sparsity, in this paper
we explore the limits of a purely surface-
based prediction of prepositions.
Using a web-as-corpus approach, we in-
vestigate the classification based solely on
the relative number of occurrences for tar-
get n-grams varying in preposition usage.
We show that such a surface-based ap-
proach is competitive with the published
state-of-the-art results relying on complex
feature sets.
Where enough data is available, in a sur-
prising number of cases it thus is possible
to obtain sufficient information from the
relatively narrow window of context pro-
vided by n-grams which are small enough
to frequently occur but large enough
to contain enough predictive information
about preposition usage.
