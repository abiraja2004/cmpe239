In this work, we model the writing re-
vision process of English as a Second
Language (ESL) students with syntax-
driven machine translation methods.
We compare two approaches: tree-to-
string transformations (Yamada and
Knight, 2001) and tree-to-tree trans-
formations (Smith and Eisner, 2006).
Results suggest that while the tree-to-
tree model provides a greater cover-
age, the tree-to-string approach offers
a more plausible model of ESL learn-
ers? revision writing process.
