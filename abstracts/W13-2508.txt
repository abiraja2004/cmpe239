We present a study on linguistic con-
trast and commonality in English scien-
tific discourse on the basis of a mono-
lingually comparable corpus. The focus
is on selected scientific disciplines at the
boundaries to computer science (compu-
tational linguistics, bioinformatics, digital
construction, microelectronics). The data
basis is the English Scientific Text Cor-
pus (SCITEX) which covers a time range
of roughly thirty years (1970/80s to early
2000s). In particular, we investigate the
disciplinary diversification/relatedness of
scientific research articles in terms of reg-
ister. Our results are relevant for research
on multilingually comparable corpora as
used in machine translation and related re-
search, since they shed new light on the
notion of ?comparablity?.
