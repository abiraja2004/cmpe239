In this paper, we present a system that au-
tomatically generates questions from natural
language text using discourse connectives. We
explore the usefulness of the discourse con-
nectives for Question Generation (QG) that
looks at the problem beyond sentence level.
Our work divides the QG task into content se-
lection and question formation. Content se-
lection consists of finding the relevant part in
text to frame question from while question for-
mation involves sense disambiguation of the
discourse connectives, identification of ques-
tion type and applying syntactic transforma-
tions on the content. The system is evaluated
manually for syntactic and semantic correct-
ness.
