We present a method of creating disjunctive
logical forms (DLFs) from aligned sentences
for grammar-based paraphrase generation us-
ing the OpenCCG broad coverage surface re-
alizer. The method takes as input word-level
alignments of two sentences that are para-
phrases and projects these alignments onto the
logical forms that result from automatically
parsing these sentences. The projected align-
ments are then converted into phrasal edits
for producing DLFs in both directions, where
the disjunctions represent alternative choices
at the level of semantic dependencies. The re-
sulting DLFs are fed into the OpenCCG re-
alizer for n-best realization, using a pruning
strategy that encourages lexical diversity. Af-
ter merging, the approach yields an n-best list
of paraphrases that contain grammatical alter-
natives to each original sentence, as well as
paraphrases that mix and match content from
the pair. A preliminary error analysis suggests
that the approach could benefit from taking the
word order in the original sentences into ac-
count. We conclude with a discussion of plans
for future work, highlighting the method?s po-
tential use in enhancing automatic MT evalu-
ation.
