In this paper we argue that the GATE
architecture and visual development
environment can be used as an effec-
tive tool for teaching language engi-
neering and computational linguistics.
Since GATE comes with a customis-
able and extendable set of components,
it allows students to get hands-on ex-
perience with building NLP applica-
tions. GATE also has tools for cor-
pus annotation and performance eval-
uation, so students can go through the
entire application development process
within its graphical development en-
vironment. Finally, it offers com-
prehensive Unicode-compliant multi-
lingual support, thus allowing stu-
dents to create components for lan-
guages other than English. Unlike
other NLP teaching tools which were
designed specifically and only for this
purpose, GATE is a system developed
for and used actively in language en-
gineering research. This unique dual-
ity allows students to contribute to re-
search projects and gain skills in em-
bedding HLT in practical applications.
