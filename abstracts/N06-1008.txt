This paper shows that inference rules with
temporal constraints can be acquired by us-
ing verb-verb co-occurrences in Japanese
coordinated sentences and verb-noun co-
occurrences. For example, our unsuper-
vised acquisition method could obtain the
inference rule ?If someone enforces a law,
usually someone enacts the law at the same
time as or before the enforcing of the
law? since the verbs ?enact? and ?enforce?
frequently co-occurred in coordinated sen-
tences and the verbs also frequently co-
occurred with the noun ?law?. We also
show that the accuracy of the acquisition
is improved by using the occurrence fre-
quency of a single verb, which we assume
indicates how generic the meaning of the
verb is.
