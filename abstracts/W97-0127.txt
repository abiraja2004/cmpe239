 
Corpus-based statistical-oriented Chinese word classif ication can be 
regarded as a fundamental step for automatic or non-automatic, mono- 
lingual natural processing system. Word classif ication can solve the 
problems of data sparseness and have far fewer parameters. So far, 
much r:,la~v~ work about word classification has been done. All the 
work is based on some similarity metrics. We use average mutual 
information as global similarity metric to do classification. The 
clustering process is top-down splitting and the binary tree is 
growin~ with splitting. In natural lan~lage, the effect of left 
neighbors and right neighbors of a word are asymmetric. To utilize 
this directional information, we induce the left-right binary and 
right-left binary tree to represent this property. The probabil ity is 
also introduced in our algorithm to merge the resulting classes from 
left-right and right-left binary tree. Also, we use the resulting 
classes to do experiments on word class-based language model. Some 
classes results and perplexity of word class-based language model are 
presented.
