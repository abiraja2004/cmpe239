This paper discusses a machine translation
evaluation task conducted using Amazon Me-
chanical Turk. We present a translation ade-
quacy assessment task for untrained Arabic-
speaking annotators and discuss several tech-
niques for normalizing the resulting data. We
present a novel 2-stage normalization tech-
nique shown to have the best performance on
this task and further discuss the results of all
techniques and the usability of the resulting
adequacy scores.
