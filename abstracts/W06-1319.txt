We present a probabilistic approach for the
interpretation of arguments that casts the
selection of an interpretation as a model
selection task. In selecting the best model,
our formalism balances conflicting fac-
tors: model complexity against data fit,
and structure complexity against belief
reasonableness. We first describe our ba-
sic formalism, which considers interpreta-
tions comprising inferential relations, and
then show how our formalism is extended
to suppositions that account for the beliefs
in an argument, and justifications that ac-
count for the inferences in an interpreta-
tion. Our evaluations with users show that
the interpretations produced by our system
are acceptable, and that there is strong sup-
port for the postulated suppositions and
justifications.
