Most Web-based Q/A systems work by find-
ing pages that contain an explicit answer to
a question. These systems are helpless if the
answer has to be inferred from multiple sen-
tences, possibly on different pages. To solve
this problem, we introduce the HOLMES sys-
tem, which utilizes textual inference (TI) over
tuples extracted from text.
Whereas previous work on TI (e.g., the lit-
erature on textual entailment) has been ap-
plied to paragraph-sized texts, HOLMES uti-
lizes knowledge-based model construction to
scale TI to a corpus of 117 million Web pages.
Given only a few minutes, HOLMES doubles
recall for example queries in three disparate
domains (geography, business, and nutrition).
Importantly, HOLMES?s runtime is linear in
the size of its input corpus due to a surprising
property of many textual relations in the Web
corpus?they are ?approximately? functional
in a well-defined sense.
