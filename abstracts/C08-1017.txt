 
We describe an entirely statistics-based, 
unsupervised, and language-
independent approach to multilingual 
information retrieval, which we call La-
tent Morpho-Semantic Analysis 
(LMSA). LMSA overcomes some of the 
shortcomings of related previous ap-
proaches such as Latent Semantic 
Analysis (LSA). LMSA has an impor-
tant theoretical advantage over LSA: it 
combines well-known techniques in a 
novel way to break the terms of LSA 
down into units which correspond more 
closely to morphemes. Thus, it has a 
particular appeal for use with morpho-
logically complex languages such as 
Arabic. We show through empirical re-
sults that the theoretical advantages of 
LMSA can translate into significant 
gains in precision in multilingual infor-
mation retrieval tests. These gains are 
not matched either when a standard 
stemmer is used with LSA, or when 
terms are indiscriminately broken down 
into n-grams.
