A range of Natural Language Process-
ing tasks involve making judgments about
the semantic relatedness of a pair of sen-
tences, such as Recognizing Textual En-
tailment (RTE) and answer selection for
Question Answering (QA). A key chal-
lenge that these tasks face in common
is the lack of explicit alignment annota-
tion between a sentence pair. We capture
the alignment by using a novel probabilis-
tic model that models tree-edit operations
on dependency parse trees. Unlike previ-
ous tree-edit models which require a sep-
arate alignment-finding phase and resort
to ad-hoc distance metrics, our method
treats alignments as structured latent vari-
ables, and offers a principled framework
for incorporating complex linguistic fea-
tures. We demonstrate the robustness of
our model by conducting experiments for
RTE and QA, and show that our model
performs competitively on both tasks with
the same set of general features.
