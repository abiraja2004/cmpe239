We investigate the effect of text summarisa-
tion in the problem of rating-inference ? the
task of associating a fine-grained numerical
rating to an opinionated document. We set-up
a comparison framework to study the effect of
different summarisation algorithms of various
compression rates in this task and compare the
classification accuracy of summaries and doc-
uments for associating documents to classes.
We make use of SVM algorithms to associate
numerical ratings to opinionated documents.
The algorithms are informed by linguistic and
sentiment-based features computed from full
documents and summaries. Preliminary re-
sults show that some types of summaries could
be as effective or better as full documents in
this problem.
