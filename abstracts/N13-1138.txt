We describe a supervised approach to predict-
ing the set of all inflected forms of a lexical
item. Our system automatically acquires the
orthographic transformation rules of morpho-
logical paradigms from labeled examples, and
then learns the contexts in which those trans-
formations apply using a discriminative se-
quence model. Because our approach is com-
pletely data-driven and the model is trained
on examples extracted from Wiktionary, our
method can extend to new languages without
change. Our end-to-end system is able to pre-
dict complete paradigms with 86.1% accuracy
and individual inflected forms with 94.9% ac-
curacy, averaged across three languages and
two parts of speech.
