We describe our contribution to the Gen-
eration Challenge 2010 for the tasks
of Named Entity Recognition and co-
reference detection (GREC-NER). To ex-
tract the NE and the referring expressions,
we employ a combination of a Part of
Speech Tagger and the Conditional Ran-
dom Fields (CRF) learning technique. We
finally experiment an original algorithm
to detect co-references. We conclude
with discussion about our system perfor-
mances.
