This paper investigates the problem of boot-
strapping a statistical dialogue manager with-
out access to training data and proposes a new
probabilistic agenda-based method for simu-
lating user behaviour. In experiments with a
statistical POMDP dialogue system, the simu-
lator was realistic enough to successfully test
the prototype system and train a dialogue pol-
icy. An extensive study with human subjects
showed that the learned policy was highly com-
petitive, with task completion rates above 90%.
