Effective transliteration of proper names
via grapheme conversion needs to find
transliteration patterns in training data,
and then generate optimized candidates
for testing samples accordingly. However,
the top-1 accuracy for the generated candi-
dates cannot be good if the right one is not
ranked at the top. To tackle this issue, we
propose to rerank the output candidates for
a better order using the averaged percep-
tron with multiple features. This paper de-
scribes our recent work in this direction for
our participation in NEWS2010 transliter-
ation evaluation. The official results con-
firm its effectiveness in English-Chinese
bidirectional transliteration.
