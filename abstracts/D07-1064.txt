We propose a sequence-alignment based
method for detecting and disambiguating co-
ordinate conjunctions. In this method, av-
eraged perceptron learning is used to adapt
the substitution matrix to the training data
drawn from the target language and domain.
To reduce the cost of training data con-
struction, our method accepts training exam-
ples in which complete word-by-word align-
ment labels are missing, but instead only
the boundaries of coordinated conjuncts are
marked. We report promising empirical re-
sults in detecting and disambiguating coor-
dinated noun phrases in the GENIA corpus,
despite a relatively small number of train-
ing examples and minimal features are em-
ployed.
