This paper addresses the question whether
metaphors can be represented in Word-
Nets. For this purpose, domain-centered
data is collected from the Hamburg
Metaphor Database, an online source cre-
ated for the study of possible metaphor
representations in WordNets. Based on
the results of the analyses of French and
German corpus data and EuroWordNet,
the implementation problem is discussed.
It can be shown that a much more com-
plete representation of synsets and rela-
tions between synsets in the source do-
main as well as a clearer indication of
the level of figurativity for individual
synsets are needed before global concep-
tual metaphors can be dealt with in Word-
Nets.
