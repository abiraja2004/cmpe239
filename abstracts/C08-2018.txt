This paper elaborates a model for rep-
resenting semantic calendar expressions
(SCEs), which correspond to the inten-
sional meanings of natural-language calen-
dar phrases. The model uses finite-state
transducers (FSTs) to mark denoted peri-
ods of time on a set of timelines repre-
sented as a finite-state automaton (FSA).
We present a treatment of SCEs corre-
sponding to quantified phrases (any Mon-
day; every May) and an implication oper-
ation for requiring the denotation of one
SCE to contain completely that of another.
