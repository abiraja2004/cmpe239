 
We describe Talk'n'Travel, a spoken 
dialogue language system for making air 
travel plans over the telephone. 
Talk'n'Travel is a fully conversational, 
mixed-initiative system that allows the 
user to specify the constraints on his travel 
plan in arbitrary order, ask questions, etc., 
in general spoken English. The system 
operates according to a plan-based agenda 
mechanism, rather than a finite state 
network, and attempts to negotiate with 
the user when not all of his constraints can 
be met.
