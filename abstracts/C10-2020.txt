 
Creating correct, semantic representa-
tions of questions is essential for appli-
cations that can use formal reasoning to 
answer them. However, even within a 
restricted domain, it is hard to anticipate 
all the possible ways that a question 
might be phrased, and engineer reliable 
processing modules to produce a correct 
semantic interpretation for the reasoner. 
In our work on posing questions to a bi-
ology knowledge base, we address this 
brittleness in two ways: First, we exploit 
the DIRT paraphrase database to intro-
duce alternative phrasings of a question; 
Second, we defer word sense and se-
mantic role commitment until question 
answering. Resulting ambiguities are 
then resolved by interleaving additional 
interpretation with question-answering, 
allowing the combinatorics of alterna-
tives to be controlled and domain 
knowledge to guide paraphrase and 
sense selection. Our evaluation suggests 
that the resulting system is able to un-
derstand exam-style questions more re-
liably.
