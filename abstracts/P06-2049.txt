Successful participation in dialogue as
well as understanding written text re-
quires, among others, interpretation of
specifications implicitly conveyed through
parallel structures. While those whose re-
construction requires insertion of a miss-
ing element, such as gapping and ellip-
sis, have been addressed to a certain extent
by computational approaches, there is vir-
tually no work addressing parallel struc-
tures headed by vice versa-like operators,
whose reconstruction requires transforma-
tion. In this paper, we address the mean-
ing reconstruction of such constructs by
an informed reasoning process. The ap-
plied techniques include building deep se-
mantic representations, application of cat-
egories of patterns underlying a formal
reconstruction, and using pragmatically-
motivated and empirically justified prefer-
ences. We present an evaluation of our al-
gorithm conducted on a uniform collection
of texts containing the phrases in question.
