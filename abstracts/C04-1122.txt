In this paper we describe a way to discover
Named Entities by using the distribution of
words in news articles. Named Entity recog-
nition is an important task for today?s natural
language applications, but it still suffers from
data sparseness. We used an observation that a
Named Entity is likely to appear synchronously
in several news articles, whereas a common
noun is less likely. Exploiting this characteris-
tic, we successfully obtained rare Named Enti-
ties with 90% accuracy just by comparing time
series distributions of a word in two newspa-
pers. Although the achieved recall is not suf-
ficient yet, we believe that this method can be
used to strengthen the lexical knowledge of a
Named Entity tagger.
