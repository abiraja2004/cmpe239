 
We describe a Slot Grammar (SG) parser 
for Arabic, ASG, and new features of SG 
designed to accommodate Arabic as well as 
the European languages for which SGs 
have been built.  We focus on the integra-
tion of BAMA with ASG, and on a new, 
expressive SG grammar formalism, SGF, 
and illustrate how SGF is used to advan-
tage in ASG.
