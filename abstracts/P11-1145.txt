We propose a non-parametric Bayesian model
for unsupervised semantic parsing. Follow-
ing Poon and Domingos (2009), we consider
a semantic parsing setting where the goal is to
(1) decompose the syntactic dependency tree
of a sentence into fragments, (2) assign each
of these fragments to a cluster of semanti-
cally equivalent syntactic structures, and (3)
predict predicate-argument relations between
the fragments. We use hierarchical Pitman-
Yor processes to model statistical dependen-
cies between meaning representations of pred-
icates and those of their arguments, as well
as the clusters of their syntactic realizations.
We develop a modification of the Metropolis-
Hastings split-merge sampler, resulting in an
efficient inference algorithm for the model.
The method is experimentally evaluated by us-
ing the induced semantic representation for
the question answering task in the biomedical
domain.
