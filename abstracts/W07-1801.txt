This paper describes how grammar-based
language models for speech recognition sys-
tems can be generated from Grammatical
Framework (GF) grammars. Context-free
grammars and finite-state models can be
generated in several formats: GSL, SRGS,
JSGF, and HTK SLF. In addition, semantic
interpretation code can be embedded in the
generated context-free grammars. This en-
ables rapid development of portable, multi-
lingual and easily modifiable speech recog-
nition applications.
