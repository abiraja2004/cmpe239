We use multiple views for cross-domain doc-
ument classification. The main idea is to
strengthen the views? consistency for target
data with source training data by identify-
ing the correlations of domain-specific fea-
tures from different domains. We present
an Information-theoretic Multi-view Adapta-
tion Model (IMAM) based on a multi-way
clustering scheme, where word and link clus-
ters can draw together seemingly unrelated
domain-specific features from both sides and
iteratively boost the consistency between doc-
ument clusterings based on word and link
views. Experiments show that IMAM signifi-
cantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.
