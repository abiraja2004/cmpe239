This paper describes an approach to adapt
an existing multilingual Open-Domain
Question Answering (ODQA) system for
factoid questions to a Restricted Domain,
the Geographical Domain. The adaptation
of this ODQA system involved the modifi-
cation of some components of our system
such as: Question Processing, Passage Re-
trieval and Answer Extraction. The new
system uses external resources like GNS
Gazetteer for Named Entity (NE) Classi-
fication and Wikipedia or Google in order
to obtain relevant documents for this do-
main. The system focuses on a Geograph-
ical Scope: given a region, or country, and
a language we can semi-automatically ob-
tain multilingual geographical resources
(e.g. gazetteers, trigger words, groups of
place names, etc.) of this scope. The
system has been trained and evaluated for
Spanish in the scope of the Spanish Geog-
raphy. The evaluation reveals that the use
of scope-based Geographical resources is
a good approach to deal with multilingual
Geographical Domain Question Answer-
ing.
