Entity linking refers entity mentions in a 
document to their representations in a 
knowledge base (KB). In this paper, we 
propose to use additional information 
sources from Wikipedia to find more 
name variations for entity linking task. In 
addition, as manually creating a training 
corpus for entity linking is labor-
intensive and costly, we present a novel 
method to automatically generate a large 
scale corpus annotation for ambiguous 
mentions leveraging on their unambi-
guous synonyms in the document collec-
tion. Then, a binary classifier is trained 
to filter out KB entities that are not simi-
lar to current mentions. This classifier 
not only can effectively reduce the am-
biguities to the existing entities in KB, 
but also be very useful to highlight the 
new entities to KB for the further popu-
lation. Furthermore, we also leverage on 
the Wikipedia documents to provide ad-
ditional information which is not availa-
ble in our generated corpus through a 
domain adaption approach which pro-
vides further performance improve-
ments.  The experiment results show that 
our proposed method outperforms the 
state-of-the-art approaches.
