The paper describes a set of experiments
involving the application of three state-of-
the-art part-of-speech taggers to Ethiopian
Amharic, using three different tagsets.
The taggers showed worse performance
than previously reported results for Eng-
lish, in particular having problems with
unknown words. The best results were
obtained using a Maximum Entropy ap-
proach, while HMM-based and SVM-
based taggers got comparable results.
