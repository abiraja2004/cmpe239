MEDLINE/PubMed contains structured
abstracts that can provide argumentative
labels. Selection of abstract sentences
based on the argumentative label has
shown to improve the performance of in-
formation retrieval tasks. These abstracts
make up less than one quarter of all the
abstracts in MEDLINE/PubMed, so it is
worthwhile to learn how to automatically
label the non-structured ones.
We have compared several machine learn-
ing algorithms trained on structured ab-
stracts to identify argumentative labels.
We have performed an intrinsic evalua-
tion on predicting argumentative labels for
non-structured abstracts and an extrinsic
evaluation to predict argumentative labels
on abstracts relevant to Gene Reference
Into Function (GeneRIF) indexing.
Intrinsic evaluation shows that argumen-
tative labels can be assigned effectively
to structured abstracts. Algorithms that
model the argumentative structure seem
to perform better than other algorithms.
Extrinsic results show that assigning ar-
gumentative labels to non-structured ab-
stracts improves the performance on
GeneRIF indexing. On the other hand, the
algorithms that model the argumentative
structure of the abstracts obtain lower per-
formance in the extrinsic evaluation.
