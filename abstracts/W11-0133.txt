In this paper we describe DISCUSS, a dialogue move taxonomy layered over semantic represen-
tations. We designed this scheme to enable development of computational models of tutorial dia-
logues and to provide an intermediate representation suitable for question and tutorial act generation.
As such, DISCUSS captures semantic and pragmatic elements across four dimensions: Dialogue Act,
Rhetorical Form, Predicate Type, Semantic Roles. Together these dimensions provide a summary of
an utterance?s propositional content and how it may change the underlying information state of the
conversation. This taxonomy builds on previous work in both general dialogue act taxonomies as
well as work in tutorial act and tutorial question categorization. The types and values found within
our taxonomy are based on preliminary observations and on-going annotation from our corpus of
multimodal tutorial dialogues for elementary school science education.
