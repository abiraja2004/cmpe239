 
This paper describes recent improvements in the SPHINX 
Speech Recognition System. These enhancements include 
function-phrase modeling, between-word coarticulation 
modeling, and corrective training. On the DARPA resource 
management task, SPHINX attained a speaker-independent 
word accuracy of 96% with a grammar (perplexity 60), and 
82% without grammar (perplexity 997).
