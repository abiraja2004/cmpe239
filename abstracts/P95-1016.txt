 
In this paper, we present a statistical ap- 
proach for dialogue act processing in the di- 
alogue component of the speech-to-speech 
translation system VERBMOBIL. Statistics 
in dialogue processing is used to predict 
follow-up dialogue acts. As an application 
example we show how it supports repair 
when unexpected dialogue states occur.
