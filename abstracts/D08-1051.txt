Although Machine Translation (MT) is a very
active research field which is receiving an in-
creasing amount of attention from the research
community, the results that current MT sys-
tems are capable of producing are still quite
far away from perfection. Because of this,
and in order to build systems that yield correct
translations, human knowledge must be inte-
grated into the translation process, which will
be carried out in our case in an Interactive-
Predictive (IP) framework. In this paper, we
show that considering Mouse Actions as a sig-
nificant information source for the underly-
ing system improves the productivity of the
human translator involved. In addition, we
also show that the initial translations that the
MT system provides can be quickly improved
by an expert by only performing additional
Mouse Actions. In this work, we will be using
word graphs as an efficient interface between
a phrase-based MT system and the IP engine.
