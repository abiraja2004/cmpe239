This study presents a novel approach to the
problem of system portability across differ-
ent domains: a sentiment annotation system
that integrates a corpus-based classifier trained
on a small set of annotated in-domain data
and a lexicon-based system trained on Word-
Net. The paper explores the challenges of sys-
tem portability across domains and text gen-
res (movie reviews, news, blogs, and product
reviews), highlights the factors affecting sys-
tem performance on out-of-domain and small-
set in-domain data, and presents a new sys-
tem consisting of the ensemble of two classi-
fiers with precision-based vote weighting, that
provides significant gains in accuracy and re-
call over the corpus-based classifier and the
lexicon-based system taken individually.
