This paper classifies six publicly avail-
able biomedical corpora according to var-
ious corpus design features and charac-
teristics. We then present usage data for
the six corpora. We show that corpora
that are carefully annotated with respect
to structural and linguistic characteristics
and that are distributed in standard for-
mats are more widely used than corpora
that are not. These findings have implica-
tions for the design of the next generation
of biomedical corpora.
