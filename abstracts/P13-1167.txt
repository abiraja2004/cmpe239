This work proposes a new segmentation
evaluation metric, named boundary simi-
larity (B), an inter-coder agreement coef-
ficient adaptation, and a confusion-matrix
for segmentation that are all based upon an
adaptation of the boundary edit distance in
Fournier and Inkpen (2012). Existing seg-
mentation metrics such as Pk, WindowD-
iff, and Segmentation Similarity (S) are
all able to award partial credit for near
misses between boundaries, but are biased
towards segmentations containing few or
tightly clustered boundaries. Despite S?s
improvements, its normalization also pro-
duces cosmetically high values that over-
estimate agreement & performance, lead-
ing this work to propose a solution.
