 
This paper explores the idqa that the operations 
of positing and resolving bridging anaphora in NPs 
with deverbal heads can be successfully guided by 
considering as possible implicit relations those sug- 
gested by the argument s ructures of the correspond- 
ing verbs. We exploit the event/result reading dis- 
tinction, combined with other aspeetual informa- 
tion. From there, we work out the idea that there is 
one particular argument, ermed the faeourite, that 
plays a key role in correctly situating the NP referent 
within the discourse.
