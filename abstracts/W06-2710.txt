The NITE XML Toolkit (NXT) is open
source software for working with multi-
modal, spoken, or text language corpora.
It is specifically designed to support the
tasks of human annotators and analysts
of heavily cross-annotated data sets, and
has been used successfully on a range of
projects with varying needs. In this text
to accompany a demonstration, we de-
scribe NXT along with four uses on dif-
ferent corpora that together span its most
novel features. The examples involve the
AMI and ICSI Meeting Corpora; a study
of multimodal reference; a syntactic anal-
ysis of Genesis in classical Hebrew; and
discourse annotation of Switchboard dia-
logues.
