 
Suppose we have a large collection of 
documents most of which are unlabeled. Suppose 
further that we have a small subset of these 
documents which represent a particular class of 
documents we are interested in, i.e. these are 
labeled as positive examples. We may have reason 
to believe that there are more of these positive 
class documents in our large unlabeled collection. 
What data mining techniques could help us find 
these unlabeled positive examples? Here we 
examine machine learning strategies designed to 
solve this problem. We find that a proper choice of 
machine learning method as well as training 
strategies can give substantial improvement in 
retrieving, from the large collection, data enriched 
with positive examples. We illustrate the principles 
with a real example consisting of multiword 
UMLS phrases among a much larger collection of 
phrases from Medline.
