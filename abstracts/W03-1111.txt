In this paper, we focus on performing
LSI on very low SVD dimensions. The
results show that there is a nearly linear
surface in the local query region. Using
low-dimensional LSI on local query re-
gion we can capture such a linear surface,
obtain much better performance than
VSM and come comparably to global
LSI. The surprisingly small requirements
of the SVD dimension resolve the com-
putation restrictions. Moreover, on the
condition that several relevant sample
documents are available, application of
low-dimensional LSI to these documents
yielded comparable IR performance to
local RF but in a different manner.
