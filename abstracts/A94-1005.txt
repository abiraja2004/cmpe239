based on sentence types for economic news stories. 
Conventional English-to-Japanese machine translation 
(MT) systems which are rule-based approaches, are diffi- 
cult to translate certain types of Associated Press (AP) 
wire service news stories, such as economics and sports, 
because these topics include many fixed expressions ( uch 
as compound words or collocations) which are difficult o 
be processed by conventional syntactic analysis and/or 
word selection methods. 
The proposed MT system, an economic-news stories 
machine translation system (ENTS), can translate co- 
nomic news sentences with fixed expressions. The system 
consists of three processes, to handle different ypes of 
sentences, fixed type, economics-specific type and general 
type. This paper focuses mainly on the translation method 
for fixed-type sentences, which is a kind of example-based 
approach. In this translation method, fixed sentence trans- 
lation (STRA) data plays a key role. The STRA data is a 
set of bilingual templates, which is built automatically 
from fixed English sentences and their Japanese transla- 
tion equivalents. The fixed English sentences are extracted 
automatically from the AP corpus. 
A series of experiments o evaluate ENTS using eco- 
nomic news in the AP news stories howed the translation 
accuracy was about 50 % higher than with our conven- 
tional rule-based MT method.
