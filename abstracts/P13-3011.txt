For expanding a corpus of clinical text, an-
notated for named entities, a method that
combines pre-tagging with a version of ac-
tive learning is proposed. In order to fa-
cilitate annotation and to avoid bias, two
alternative automatic pre-taggings are pre-
sented to the annotator, without reveal-
ing which of them is given a higher con-
fidence by the pre-tagging system. The
task of the annotator is to select the cor-
rect version among these two alternatives.
To minimise the instances in which none
of the presented pre-taggings is correct,
the texts presented to the annotator are ac-
tively selected from a pool of unlabelled
text, with the selection criterion that one
of the presented pre-taggings should have
a high probability of being correct, while
still being useful for improving the result
of an automatic classifier.
