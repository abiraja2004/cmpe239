 
Sharing portions of grammars across languages greatly re- 
duces the costs of nutltilingual grammar engineering. Related 
languages hare a ntuch wider range of linguistic itff'ornuttio;t 
than typically assunwd in stamlard mttltilingttal gramtmtr 
atwhitectures. Taking grammatical relatedness eriously, we 
are particularly interested in designing lhtguistically motivated 
grammatical resottrces Jbr Slavic languages to be used itz 
applied and theoretical computational linguistics, ht order to 
gain the pelwpective of a language-family oriented gramntar 
desigtl, we consider {ttt arrtly of systematic relations that can 
hold between syntactical units. While the categorisation of 
primitive linguistic entities tends to be language-specilic or 
even constrttction-.~pecific, the relations holding between them 
allow viii'lofts degrees of absltztction. On the basis of Slavic 
&tta, we show how a domain ontology conceptualising molpho- 
syntaclic "buildiltg blocks" can serve as a basis r~" a shared 
grotlt;nar of Slavic.
