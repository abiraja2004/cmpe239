 
This paper explores Chinese semantic role la-
beling (SRL) for nominal predicates. Besides 
those widely used features in verbal SRL, 
various nominal SRL-specific features are 
first included. Then, we improve the perform-
ance of nominal SRL by integrating useful 
features derived from a state-of-the-art verbal 
SRL system. Finally, we address the issue of 
automatic predicate recognition, which is es-
sential for a nominal SRL system. Evaluation 
on Chinese NomBank shows that our research 
in integrating various features derived from 
verbal SRL significantly improves the per-
formance. It also shows that our nominal SRL 
system much outperforms the state-of-the-art 
ones.
