  
To help developing a localization oriented 
EBMT system, an automatic machine 
translation evaluation method is 
implemented which adopts edit distance, 
cosine correlation and Dice coefficient as 
criteria. Experiment shows that the 
evaluation method distinguishes well 
between ?good? translations and ?bad? ones. 
To prove that the method is consistent with 
human evaluation, 6 MT systems are scored 
and compared. Theoretical analysis is made 
to validate the experimental results. 
Correlation coefficient and significance tests 
at 0.01 level are made to ensure the 
reliability of the results. Linear regression 
equations are calculated to map the 
automatic scoring results to human scorings.
