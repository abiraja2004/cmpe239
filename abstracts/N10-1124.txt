In evidence-based medicine, clinical questions
involve four aspects: Patient/Problem (P), In-
tervention (I), Comparison (C) and Outcome
(O), known as PICO elements. In this pa-
per we present a method that extends the lan-
guage modeling approach to incorporate both
document structure and PICO query formu-
lation. We present an analysis of the distri-
bution of PICO elements in medical abstracts
that motivates the use of a location-based
weighting strategy. In experiments carried out
on a collection of 1.5 million abstracts, the
method was found to lead to an improvement
of roughly 60% in MAP and 70% in P@10 as
compared to state-of-the-art methods.
