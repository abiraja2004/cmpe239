This paper discusses the construction of
a parallel treebank currently involving ten
languages from six language families. The
treebank is based on deep LFG (Lexical-
Functional Grammar) grammars that were
developed within the framework of the
ParGram (Parallel Grammar) effort. The
grammars produce output that is maxi-
mally parallelized across languages and
language families. This output forms the
basis of a parallel treebank covering a
diverse set of phenomena. The treebank
is publicly available via the INESS tree-
banking environment, which also allows
for the alignment of language pairs. We
thus present a unique, multilayered paral-
lel treebank that represents more and dif-
ferent types of languages than are avail-
able in other treebanks, that represents
deep linguistic knowledge and that allows
for the alignment of sentences at sev-
eral levels: dependency structures, con-
stituency structures and POS information.
