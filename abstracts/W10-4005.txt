 
The automatic generation of dictionaries from raw text has previously been based on parallel or comparable corpora. Here we describe an approach requiring only a single monolingual corpus to generate bilingual dictionaries for several lan-guage pairs. A constraint is that all lan-guage pairs have their target language in common, which needs to be the lan-guage of the underlying corpus. Our ap-proach is based on the observation that monolingual corpora usually contain a considerable number of foreign words. As these are often explained via transla-tions typically occurring close by, we can identify these translations by look-ing at the contexts of a foreign word and by computing its strongest associations from these. In this work we focus on the question what results can be expected for 20 language pairs involving five ma-jor European languages. We also com-pare the results for two different types of corpora, namely newsticker texts and web corpora. Our findings show that re-sults are best if English is the source language, and that noisy web corpora are better suited for this task than well edited newsticker texts.
