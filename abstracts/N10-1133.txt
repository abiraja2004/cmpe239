This paper analyzes the topic identification
stage of single-document automatic text sum-
marization across four different domains, con-
sisting of newswire, literary, scientific and le-
gal documents. We present a study that ex-
plores the summary space of each domain
via an exhaustive search strategy, and finds
the probability density function (pdf) of the
ROUGE score distributions for each domain.
We then use this pdf to calculate the per-
centile rank of extractive summarization sys-
tems. Our results introduce a new way to
judge the success of automatic summarization
systems and bring quantified explanations to
questions such as why it was so hard for the
systems to date to have a statistically signifi-
cant improvement over the lead baseline in the
news domain.
