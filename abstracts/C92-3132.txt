 
In this paper we show the 
relation between the "surface 
(morphological) cases" and "deep 
cases" (participants), and the 
possible way to  automate the 
creation of a syntactic diction- 
ary provided with frames contain- 
ing information about deep cases 
and their morphemic counterparts 
of particular lexical items 
(Czech verbs).
