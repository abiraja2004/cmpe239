We describe three semantic text similarity
systems developed for the *SEM 2013 STS
shared task and the results of the correspond-
ing three runs. All of them shared a word sim-
ilarity feature that combined LSA word sim-
ilarity and WordNet knowledge. The first,
which achieved the best mean score of the 89
submitted runs, used a simple term alignment
algorithm augmented with penalty terms. The
other two runs, ranked second and fourth, used
support vector regression models to combine
larger sets of features.
