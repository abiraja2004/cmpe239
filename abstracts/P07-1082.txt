We propose a novel algorithm for English
to Persian transliteration. Previous meth-
ods proposed for this language pair apply
a word alignment tool for training. By
contrast, we introduce an alignment algo-
rithm particularly designed for translitera-
tion. Our new model improves the English
to Persian transliteration accuracy by 14%
over an n-gram baseline. We also propose
a novel back-transliteration method for this
language pair, a previously unstudied prob-
lem. Experimental results demonstrate that
our algorithm leads to an absolute improve-
ment of 25% over standard transliteration
approaches.
