We present recent work in the area of
Cross-Domain Dialogue Act tagging. Our
experiments investigate the use of a sim-
ple dialogue act classifier based on purely
intra-utterance features - principally in-
volving word n-gram cue phrases. We ap-
ply automatically extracted cues from one
corpus to a new annotated data set, to de-
termine the portability and generality of
the cues we learn. We show that our auto-
matically acquired cues are general enough
to serve as a cross-domain classification
mechanism.
