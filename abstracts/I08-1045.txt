We describe our effort in developing a
Named Entity Recognition (NER) system
for Hindi using Maximum Entropy (Max-
Ent) approach. We developed a NER an-
notated corpora for the purpose. We have
tried to identify the most relevant features
for Hindi NER task to enable us to develop
an efficient NER from the limited corpora
developed. Apart from the orthographic and
collocation features, we have experimented
on the efficiency of using gazetteer lists as
features. We also worked on semi-automatic
induction of context patterns and experi-
mented with using these as features of the
MaxEnt method. We have evaluated the per-
formance of the system against a blind test
set having 4 classes - Person, Organization,
Location and Date. Our system achieved a
f-value of 81.52%.
