 
ProPOSEL is a prosody and PoS English lexicon, 
purpose-built to integrate and leverage domain 
knowledge from several well-established lexical 
resources for machine learning and NLP applica-
tions. The lexicon of 104049 separate entries is 
in accessible text file format, is human and ma-
chine-readable, and is intended for open source 
distribution with the Natural Language ToolKit. 
It is therefore supported by Python software tools 
which transform ProPOSEL into a Python dic-
tionary or associative array of linguistic concepts 
mapped to compound lookup keys. Users can 
also conduct searches on a subset of the lexicon 
and access entries by word class, phonetic tran-
scription, syllable count and lexical stress pat-
tern. ProPOSEL caters for a range of different 
cognitive aspects of the lexicon?.
