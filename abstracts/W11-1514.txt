Today we have access to unprecedented
amounts of literary texts. However, search
still relies heavily on key words. In this pa-
per, we show how sentiment analysis can be
used in tandem with effective visualizations to
quantify and track emotions in both individual
books and across very large collections. We
introduce the concept of emotion word den-
sity, and using the Brothers Grimm fairy tales
as example, we show how collections of text
can be organized for better search. Using the
Google Books Corpus we show how to deter-
mine an entity?s emotion associations from co-
occurring words. Finally, we compare emo-
tion words in fairy tales and novels, to show
that fairy tales have a much wider range of
emotion word densities than novels.
