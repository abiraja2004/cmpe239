This work incorporates Selectional Prefer-
ences (SP) into a Semantic Role (SR) Clas-
sification system. We learn separate selec-
tional preferences for noun phrases and prepo-
sitional phrases and we integrate them in a
state-of-the-art SR classification system both
in the form of features and individual class
predictors. We show that the inclusion of the
refined SPs yields statistically significant im-
provements on both in domain and out of do-
main data (14.07% and 11.67% error reduc-
tion, respectively). The key factor for success
is the combination of several SP methods with
the original classification model using meta-
classification.
