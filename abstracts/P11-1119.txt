Although the im-portance of emotion in human dialogue is widely recognized, most dialogue act classifi-cation models make limited or no use of affec-tive channels in dialogue act classification. This paper presents a novel affect-enriched dialogue act classifier for task-oriented dia-logue that models facial expressions of users, in particular, facial expressions related to con-fusion. The findings indicate that the affect-enriched classifiers perform significantly bet-ter for distinguishing user requests for feed-back and grounding dialogue acts within textual dialogue. The results point to ways in which dialogue systems can effectively lever-age affective channels to improve dialogue act classification.  1
