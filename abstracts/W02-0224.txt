 
This paper reports an exploratory study of 
the grounding styles of older dyads, namely, 
the characteristic ways in which they 
mutually agree to have shared a piece of 
information in dialogue. On the basis of 
Traum?s classification of grounding acts, 
we conducted an exploratory comparison of 
dialogue data on older and younger dyads, 
and found that a fairly clear contrast holds 
mainly in the types of acknowledgement 
utterances used by the two groups. We will 
discuss the implications of this contrast, 
concerning how some of the negative 
stereotypes about conversations with older 
people may arise from this difference in 
grounding styles.
