In this paper, we investigate the appli-
cation of recurrent neural network lan-
guage models (RNNLM) and factored
language models (FLM) to the task of
language modeling for Code-Switching
speech. We present a way to integrate part-
of-speech tags (POS) and language in-
formation (LID) into these models which
leads to significant improvements in terms
of perplexity. Furthermore, a comparison
between RNNLMs and FLMs and a de-
tailed analysis of perplexities on the dif-
ferent backoff levels are performed. Fi-
nally, we show that recurrent neural net-
works and factored language models can
be combined using linear interpolation to
achieve the best performance. The final
combined language model provides 37.8%
relative improvement in terms of perplex-
ity on the SEAME development set and
a relative improvement of 32.7% on the
evaluation set compared to the traditional
n-gram language model.
