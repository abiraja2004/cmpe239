This paper describes our statistical machine
translation systems based on the Moses toolkit
for the WMT08 shared task. We address the
Europarl and News conditions for the follow-
ing language pairs: English with French, Ger-
man and Spanish. For Europarl, n-best rescor-
ing is performed using an enhanced n-gram
or a neuronal language model; for the News
condition, language models incorporate extra
training data. We also report unconvincing re-
sults of experiments with factored models.
