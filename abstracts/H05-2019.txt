Abstract
The POSBIOTM/W1 is a workbench for
machine-learning oriented biomedical text
mining system. The POSTBIOTM/W is
intended to assist biologist in mining use-
ful information efficiently from biomed-
ical text resources. To do so, it pro-
vides a suit of tools for gathering, manag-
ing, analyzing and annotating texts. The
workbench is implemented in Java, which
