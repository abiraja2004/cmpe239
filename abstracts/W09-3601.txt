Our paper discusses the potential use of
Web Content Mining techniques for gath-
ering scientific social information from the
homepages of researchers. We will intro-
duce our system which seeks [affiliation,
position, start year, end year] information
tuples on these homepages along with pre-
liminary experimental results. We believe
that the lessons learnt from these experi-
ments may be useful for further scientific
social web mining.
