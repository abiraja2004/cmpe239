While some recent work in tutorial dialogue
has touched upon tutor reformulations of stu-
dent contributions, there has not yet been an
attempt to characterize the intentions of refor-
mulations in this educational context nor an
attempt to determine which types of reformu-
lation actually contribute to student learning.
In this paper we take an initial look at tutor
reformulations of student contributions in nat-
uralistic tutorial dialogue in order to charac-
terize the range of pedagogical intentions that
may be associated with these reformulations.
We further outline our plans for implementing
reformulation in our tutorial dialogue system,
Rimac, which engages high school physics
students in post problem solving reflective dis-
cussions. By implementing reformulations in
a tutorial dialogue system we can begin to test
their impact on student learning in a more con-
trolled way in addition to testing whether our
approximation of reformulation is adequate.
