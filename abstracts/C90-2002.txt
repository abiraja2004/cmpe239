 
In this paper, we describe aprogram of research 
designed to explore.' how a lexical semantic the- 
ory may be exploited for extracting information 
from corpora suitable for use in Information Re- 
trieval applications. Unlike with purely statis- 
tical collocational analyses, the framework of a 
semantic theory allows the ~ultomatic construc- 
tion of predictions about semantic relationships 
among words appearing in coltocatioz~al sys- 
tems. We illustrate the at)proach for the acqui- 
sition of lexical information for several classes 
of nominals.
