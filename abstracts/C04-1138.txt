 
We are presenting a working system for automated 
news analysis that ingests an average total of 7600 
news articles per day in five languages. For each 
language, the system detects the major news stories 
of the day using a group-average unsupervised ag-
glomerative clustering process. It also tracks, for 
each cluster, related groups of articles published 
over the previous seven days, using a cosine of 
weighted terms. The system furthermore tracks re-
lated news across languages, in all language pairs 
involved. The cross-lingual news cluster similarity 
is based on a linear combination of three types of 
input: (a) cognates, (b) automatically detected ref-
erences to geographical place names and (c) the re-
sults of a mapping process onto a multilingual clas-
sification system. A manual evaluation showed that 
the system produces good results.
