We report on recent advances in HPSG pars-
ing of German with local ambiguity pack-
ing (Oepen and Carroll, 2000), achieving a
speed-up factor of 2 on a balanced test-suite.
In contrast to earlier studies carried out for
English using the same packing algorithm,
we show that restricting semantic features
only is insufficient for achieving acceptable
runtime performance with a German HPSG
grammar. In a series of experiments relating
to the three different types of discontinuities
in German (head movement, extraction, ex-
traposition), we examine the effects of re-
strictor choice, ultimately showing that ex-
traction and head movement require partial
restriction of the respective features encod-
ing the dependency, whereas full restriction
gives best results for extraposition.
