While modeling entailment at the lexical-level
is a prominent task, addressed by most textual
entailment systems, it has been approached
mostly by heuristic methods, neglecting some
of its important aspects. We present a prob-
abilistic approach for this task which cov-
ers aspects such as differentiating various re-
sources by their reliability levels, considering
the length of the entailed sentence, the num-
ber of its covered terms and the existence of
multiple evidence for the entailment of a term.
The impact of our model components is vali-
dated by evaluations, which also show that its
performance is in line with the best published
entailment systems.
