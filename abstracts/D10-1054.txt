Hierarchical phrase-based (HPB) translation
provides a powerful mechanism to capture
both short and long distance phrase reorder-
ings. However, the phrase reorderings lack of
contextual information in conventional HPB
systems. This paper proposes a context-
dependent phrase reordering approach that
uses the maximum entropy (MaxEnt) model
to help the HPB decoder select appropriate re-
ordering patterns. We classify translation rules
into several reordering patterns, and build a
MaxEnt model for each pattern based on var-
ious contextual features. We integrate the
MaxEnt models into the HPB model. Ex-
perimental results show that our approach
achieves significant improvements over a stan-
dard HPB system on large-scale translation
tasks. On Chinese-to-English translation,
the absolute improvements in BLEU (case-
insensitive) range from 1.2 to 2.1.
