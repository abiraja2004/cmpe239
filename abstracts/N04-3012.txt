WordNet::Similarity is a freely available soft-
ware package that makes it possible to mea-
sure the semantic similarity and relatedness be-
tween a pair of concepts (or synsets). It pro-
vides six measures of similarity, and three mea-
sures of relatedness, all of which are based on
the lexical database WordNet. These measures
are implemented as Perl modules which take
as input two concepts, and return a numeric
value that represents the degree to which they
are similar or related.
