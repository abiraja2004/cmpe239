The paper describes a weakly supervised
approach for decomposing words into all
morphemes: stems, prefixes and suffixes,
using wordforms with marked stems as
training data. As we concentrate on
under-resourced languages, the amount
of training data is limited and we need
some amount of supervision in the form
of a small number of wordforms with
marked stems. In the first stage we in-
troduce a new Supervised Stem Extrac-
tion algorithm (SSE). Once stems have
been extracted, an improved unsupervised
segmentation algorithm GBUMS (Graph-
Based Unsupervised Morpheme Segmen-
tation) is used to segment suffix or prefix
sequences into individual suffixes and pre-
fixes. The approach, experimentally val-
idated on Turkish and isiZulu languages,
gives high performance on test data and is
comparable to a fully supervised method.
