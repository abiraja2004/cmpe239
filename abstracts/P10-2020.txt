In this paper we start to explore two-part
collocation extraction association measures
that do not estimate expected probabili-
ties on the basis of the independence as-
sumption. We propose two new measures
based upon the well-known measures of
mutual information and pointwise mutual
information. Expected probabilities are de-
rived from automatically trained Aggregate
Markov Models. On three collocation gold
standards, we find the new association mea-
sures vary in their effectiveness.
