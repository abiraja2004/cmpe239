We argue that failing to capture the degree of
contribution of each semantic frame in a sen-
tence explains puzzling results in recent work
on the MEANT family of semantic MT eval-
uation metrics, which have disturbingly in-
dicated that dissociating semantic roles and
fillers from their predicates actually improves
correlation with human adequacy judgments
even though, intuitively, properly segregat-
ing event frames should more accurately re-
flect the preservation of meaning. Our anal-
ysis finds that both properly structured and
flattened representations fail to adequately ac-
count for the contribution of each seman-
tic frame to the overall sentence. We then
show that the correlation of HMEANT, the hu-
man variant of MEANT, can be greatly im-
proved by introducing a simple length-based
weighting scheme that approximates the de-
gree of contribution of each semantic frame
to the overall sentence. The new results
also show that, without flattening the struc-
ture of semantic frames, weighting the degree
of each frame?s contribution gives HMEANT
higher correlations than the previously best-
performing flattened model, as well as HTER.
