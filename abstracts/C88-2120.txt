 
This paper presents an augmented context free grammar which 
describes important features of the surface structure and the semantics 
of discourse in a formal way, integrating new as well as previously 
existing insights into a unified framework. The structures covered include 
lists, narratives, subordinating and coordinating rhetorical relations, topic 
chains and interruptions. The paper discusses the problem of parsing 
discourse, and compares different grammatical formalisms which could 
be used for describing discourse structure.

the rhetorical relations themselves constitute an important structure- 
building component of discourse.
