Keyphrases are widely used as a brief
summary of documents. Since man-
ual assignment is time-consuming, vari-
ous unsupervised ranking methods based
on importance scores are proposed for
keyphrase extraction. In practice, the
keyphrases of a document should not only
be statistically important in the docu-
ment, but also have a good coverage of
the document. Based on this observa-
tion, we propose an unsupervised method
for keyphrase extraction. Firstly, the
method finds exemplar terms by leverag-
ing clustering techniques, which guaran-
tees the document to be semantically cov-
ered by these exemplar terms. Then the
keyphrases are extracted from the doc-
ument using the exemplar terms. Our
method outperforms sate-of-the-art graph-
based ranking methods (TextRank) by
9.5% in F1-measure.
