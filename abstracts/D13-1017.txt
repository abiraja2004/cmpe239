Two recent measures incorporate the notion of
statistical significance in basic PMI formula-
tion. In some tasks, we find that the new mea-
sures perform worse than the PMI. Our anal-
ysis shows that while the basic ideas in incor-
porating statistical significance in PMI are rea-
sonable, they have been applied slightly inap-
propriately. By fixing this, we get new mea-
sures that improve performance over not just
PMI but on other popular co-occurrence mea-
sures as well. In fact, the revised measures
perform reasonably well compared with more
resource intensive non co-occurrence based
methods also.
