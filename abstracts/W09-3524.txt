This paper presents a hybrid approach to
English-Korean name transliteration. The
base system is built on MOSES with en-
abled factored translation features. We
expand the base system by combining
with various transliteration methods in-
cluding a Web-based n-best re-ranking, a
dictionary-based method, and a rule-based
method. Our standard run and best non-
standard run achieve 45.1 and 78.5, re-
spectively, in top-1 accuracy. Experimen-
tal results show that expanding training
data size significantly contributes to the
performance. Also we discover that the
Web-based re-ranking method can be suc-
cessfully applied to the English-Korean
transliteration.
