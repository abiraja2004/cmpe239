 
The variation in speech due to dialect is a factor which significantly impacts speech system per-formance. In this study, we investigate effective methods of combining acoustic and language in-formation to take advantage of (i) speaker based acoustic traits as well as (ii) content based word selection across the text sequence. For acoustics, a GMM based system is employed and for text based dialect classification, we proposed n-gram language models combined with Latent Seman-tic Analysis (LSA) based dialect classifiers. The performance of the individual classifiers is es-tablished for the three dialect family case (DC rates vary from 69.1%-72.4%). The final com-bined system achieved a DC accuracy of 79.5% and significantly outperforms the baseline acoustic classifier with a relative improvement of 30%, confirming that an integrated dialect classification system is effective for American, British and Australian dialects. 1
