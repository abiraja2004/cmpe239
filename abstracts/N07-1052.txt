We present a novel method for creating A? esti-
mates for structured search problems. In our ap-
proach, we project a complex model onto multiple
simpler models for which exact inference is effi-
cient. We use an optimization framework to es-
timate parameters for these projections in a way
which bounds the true costs. Similar to Klein and
Manning (2003), we then combine completion es-
timates from the simpler models to guide search
in the original complex model. We apply our ap-
proach to bitext parsing and lexicalized parsing,
demonstrating its effectiveness in these domains.
