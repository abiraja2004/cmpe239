In this paper we look at a task at border
of natural language processing, historical
linguistics and the study of language de-
velopment, namely that of identifying the
time when a text was written. We use
machine learning classification using lexi-
cal, word ending and dictionary-based fea-
tures, with linear support vector machines
and random forests. We find that lexical
features are the most helpful.
