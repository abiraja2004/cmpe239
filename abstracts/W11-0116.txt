We present the first approach to learning the durations of events without annotated training data,
employing web query patterns to infer duration distributions. For example, we learn that ?war?
lasts years or decades, while ?look? lasts seconds or minutes. Learning aspectual information is an
important goal for computational semantics and duration information may help enable rich document
understanding. We first describe and improve a supervised baseline that relies on event duration
annotations. We then show how web queries for linguistic patterns can help learn the duration of
events without labeled data, producing fine-grained duration judgments that surpass the supervised
system. We evaluate on the TimeBank duration corpus, and also investigate how an event?s participants
(arguments) effect its duration using a corpus collected through Amazon?s Mechanical Turk. We make
available a new database of events and their duration distributions for use in research involving the
temporal and aspectual properties of events.
