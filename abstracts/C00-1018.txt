from software engineering, (:ode instrumentation, 
tbr the developlnent of large-scale natural anguage 
grammars, hltbrlnation about the usage of graln- 
mar rules in test and corpus sentences i  used to 
ilnprove grammar and testsuite, as well as adapting 
a grammar to a specific genre. Results show that less 
than half of a large-coverage rmnmar for German 
is actually tested by two large testsuites, and that 
10 30% of testing time is redundant. This method- 
ology applied can be seen as a re-use of grammar 
writing knowledge for testsuite compilation. The 
construction of genre-specific grmmnars results in 
peribrmance gains of a factor of four.
