We cluster verbs into lexical semantic classes,
using a general set of noisy features that cap-
ture syntactic and semantic properties of the
verbs. The feature set was previously shown to
work well in a supervised learning setting, us-
ing known English verb classes. In moving to a
scenario of verb class discovery, using cluster-
ing, we face the problem of having a large num-
ber of irrelevant features for a particular cluster-
ing task. We investigate various approaches to
feature selection, using both unsupervised and
semi-supervised methods, comparing the results
to subsets of features manually chosen accord-
ing to linguistic properties. We find that the un-
supervised method we tried cannot be consis-
tently applied to our data. However, the semi-
supervised approach (using a seed set of sam-
ple verbs) overall outperforms not only the full
set of features, but the hand-selected features as
well.
