We evaluate two dependency parsers,
MSTParser and MaltParser, with respect
to their capacity to recover unbounded de-
pendencies in English, a type of evalu-
ation that has been applied to grammar-
based parsers and statistical phrase struc-
ture parsers but not to dependency parsers.
The evaluation shows that when combined
with simple post-processing heuristics,
the parsers correctly recall unbounded
dependencies roughly 50% of the time,
which is only slightly worse than two
grammar-based parsers specifically de-
signed to cope with such dependencies.
