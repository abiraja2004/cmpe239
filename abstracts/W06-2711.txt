We demonstrate work in progress1 us-
ing the Nite XML Toolkit on a cor-
pus of multimodal dialogues with an
MP3 player collected in a Wizard-of-Oz
(WOZ) experiments and annotated with
a rich feature set at several layers. We
designed an NXT data model, converted
experiment log file data and manual tran-
scriptions into NXT, and are building an-
notation tools using NXT libraries.
