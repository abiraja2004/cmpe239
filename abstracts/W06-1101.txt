In many theoretical and applied areas of
computational linguistics researchers op-
erate with a notion of linguistic distance
or, conversely, linguistic similarity, which
is the focus of the present workshop.
While many CL areas make frequent use
of such notions, it has received little fo-
cused attention, an honorable exception
being Lebart & Rajman (2000). This
workshop brings a number of these strands
together, highlighting a number of com-
mon issues.
