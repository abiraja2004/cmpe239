We evaluate several heuristic solvers for corre-
lation clustering, the NP-hard problem of par-
titioning a dataset given pairwise affinities be-
tween all points. We experiment on two prac-
tical tasks, document clustering and chat dis-
entanglement, to which ILP does not scale.
On these datasets, we show that the cluster-
ing objective often, but not always, correlates
with external metrics, and that local search al-
ways improves over greedy solutions. We use
semi-definite programming (SDP) to provide a
tighter bound, showing that simple algorithms
are already close to optimality.
