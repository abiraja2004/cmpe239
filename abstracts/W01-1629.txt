This paper proposes a new dialogue
control method for spoken dialogue
systems. The method configures a
dialogue plan so as to minimize the
estimated number of turns to com-
plete the dialogue. The number of
turns is estimated depending on the
current speech recognition accuracy
and probability distribution of the
true user?s request. The proposed
method reduces the number of turns
to complete the task at almost any
recognition accuracy.
