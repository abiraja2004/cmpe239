We show that existing methods for training
preposition error correction systems, whether
using well-edited text or error-annotated cor-
pora, do not generalize across very differ-
ent test sets. We present a new, large error-
annotated corpus and use it to train systems
that generalize across three different test sets,
each from a different domain and with differ-
ent error characteristics. This new corpus is
automatically extracted from Wikipedia revi-
sions and contains over one million instances
of preposition corrections.
