 
We describe a sentence-level opinion 
detection system. We first define what 
an opinion means in our research and 
introduce an effective method for ob-
taining opinion-bearing and non-
opinion-bearing words. Then we de-
scribe recognizing opinion-bearing sen-
tences using these words We test the 
system on 3 different test sets: MPQA 
data, an internal corpus, and the TREC-
2003 Novelty track data. We show that 
our automatic method for obtaining 
opinion-bearing words can be used ef-
fectively to identify opinion-bearing 
sentences.
