. Previous works have suggested that the uncertainty of tokens
coming after a sequence helps determine whether a given position is
at a context boundary. This feature of language has been applied to
unsupervised text segmentation and term extraction. In this paper, we
fundamentally verify this feature. An experiment was performed using a
web search engine, in order to clarify the extent to which this assumption
holds. The verification was applied to Chinese and Japanese.
