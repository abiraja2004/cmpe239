In this paper, we investigate an ap-
proach for creating a comprehensive tex-
tual overview of a subject composed of in-
formation drawn from the Internet. We use
the high-level structure of human-authored
texts to automatically induce a domain-
specific template for the topic structure of
a new overview. The algorithmic innova-
tion of our work is a method to learn topic-
specific extractors for content selection
jointly for the entire template. We aug-
ment the standard perceptron algorithm
with a global integer linear programming
formulation to optimize both local fit of
information into each topic and global co-
herence across the entire overview. The
results of our evaluation confirm the bene-
fits of incorporating structural information
into the content selection process.
