 
We present disputant relation-based meth-
od for classifying news articles on conten-
tious issues. We observe that the disputants 
of a contention are an important feature for 
understanding the discourse. It performs 
unsupervised classification on news articles 
based on disputant relations, and helps 
readers intuitively view the articles through 
the opponent-based frame. The readers can 
attain balanced understanding on the con-
tention, free from a specific biased view. 
We applied a modified version of HITS al-
gorithm and an SVM classifier trained with 
pseudo-relevant data for article analysis.
