The analysis of reading times can pro-
vide insights into the processes that under-
lie language comprehension, with longer
reading times indicating greater cognitive
load. There is evidence that the language
processor is highly predictive, such that
prior context allows upcoming linguistic
material to be anticipated. Previous work
has investigated the contributions of se-
mantic and syntactic contexts in isolation,
essentially treating them as independent
factors. In this paper we analyze reading
times in terms of a single predictive mea-
sure which integrates a model of seman-
tic composition with an incremental parser
and a language model.
