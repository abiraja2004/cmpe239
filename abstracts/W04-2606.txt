Lexical-semantic verb classifications have
proved useful in supporting various natural lan-
guage processing (NLP) tasks. The largest and
the most widely deployed classification in En-
glish is Levin?s (1993) taxonomy of verbs and
their classes. While this resource is attrac-
tive in being extensive enough for some NLP
use, it is not comprehensive. In this paper, we
present a substantial extension to Levin?s tax-
onomy which incorporates 57 novel classes for
verbs not covered (comprehensively) by Levin.
We also introduce 106 novel diathesis alterna-
tions, created as a side product of constructing
the new classes. We demonstrate the utility of
our novel classes by using them to support au-
tomatic subcategorization acquisition and show
that the resulting extended classification has
extensive coverage over the English verb lex-
icon.
