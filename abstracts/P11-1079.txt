In this paper, we present an unsupervised
framework that bootstraps a complete corefer-
ence resolution (CoRe) system from word as-
sociations mined from a large unlabeled cor-
pus. We show that word associations are use-
ful for CoRe ? e.g., the strong association be-
tween Obama and President is an indicator
of likely coreference. Association information
has so far not been used in CoRe because it is
sparse and difficult to learn from small labeled
corpora. Since unlabeled text is readily avail-
able, our unsupervised approach addresses the
sparseness problem. In a self-training frame-
work, we train a decision tree on a corpus that
is automatically labeled using word associa-
tions. We show that this unsupervised system
has better CoRe performance than other learn-
ing approaches that do not use manually la-
beled data.
