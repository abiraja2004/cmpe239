We describe Joshua (Li et al, 2009a)
1
,
an open source toolkit for statistical ma-
chine translation. Joshua implements all
of the algorithms required for transla-
tion via synchronous context free gram-
mars (SCFGs): chart-parsing, n-gram lan-
guage model integration, beam- and cube-
pruning, and k-best extraction. The toolkit
also implements suffix-array grammar ex-
traction and minimum error rate training.
It uses parallel and distributed computing
techniques for scalability. We also pro-
vide a demonstration outline for illustrat-
ing the toolkit?s features to potential users,
whether they be newcomers to the field
or power users interested in extending the
toolkit.
