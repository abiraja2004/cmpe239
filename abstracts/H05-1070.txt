MONA is an automata toolkit provid-
ing a compiler for compiling formulae of
monadic second order logic on strings or
trees into string automata or tree automata.
In this paper, we evaluate the option of
using MONA as a treebank query tool.
Unfortunately, we find that MONA is not
an option. There are several reasons why
the main being unsustainable query an-
swer times. If the treebank contains larger
trees with more than 100 nodes, then even
the processing of simple queries may take
hours.
