Compound splitting is an important prob-
lem in many NLP applications which must
be solved in order to address issues of data
sparsity. Previous work has shown that lin-
guistic approaches for German compound
splitting produce a correct splitting more
often, but corpus-driven approaches work
best for phrase-based statistical machine
translation from German to English, a
worrisome contradiction. We address this
situation by combining linguistic analysis
with corpus-driven statistics and obtain-
ing better results in terms of both produc-
ing splittings according to a gold standard
and statistical machine translation perfor-
mance.
