Previous multi-document relationship ex-
traction and fusion research has focused
on single relationships. Shifting the fo-
cus to multiple relationships allows for the
use of mutual constraints to aid extrac-
tion. This paper presents a fusion method
which uses a probabilistic database model
to pick relationships which violate few
constraints. This model allows improved
performance on constructing corporate
succession timelines from multiple doc-
uments with respect to a multi-document
fusion baseline.
