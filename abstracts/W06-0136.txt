 
This paper describes an n-gram based 
reinforcement approach to the closed 
track of word segmentation in the third 
Chinese word segmentation bakeoff. 
Character n-gram features of unigram, 
bigram, and trigram are extracted from 
the training corpus and its frequencies are 
counted. We investigated a step-by-step 
methodology by using the n-gram statis-
tics. In the first step, relatively definite 
segmentations are fixed by the tight 
threshold value. The remaining tags are 
decided by considering the left or right 
space tags that are already fixed in the 
first step. Definite and loose segmenta-
tion are performed simply based on the 
bigram and trigram statistics. In order to 
overcome the data sparseness problem of 
bigram data, unigram is used for the 
smoothing.
