 
This paper proposes a multi-label ap-
proach to detect emotion causes. The 
multi-label model not only detects mul-
ti-clause causes, but also captures the 
long-distance information to facilitate 
emotion cause detection. In addition, 
based on the linguistic analysis, we cre-
ate two sets of linguistic patterns during 
feature extraction. Both manually gener-
alized patterns and automatically gener-
alized patterns are designed to extract 
general cause expressions or specific 
constructions for emotion causes. Ex-
periments show that our system 
achieves a performance much higher 
than a baseline model.
