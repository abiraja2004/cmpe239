News articles report on facts, events, and opin-
ions with the intent of conveying the truth.
However, the facts, events, and opinions appear-
ing in the text are often known only second-
or third-hand, and as any child who has played
?telephone? knows, this relaying of facts often
garbles the original message. Properly under-
standing the information filtering structures that
govern the interpretation of these facts, then, is
critical to appropriately analyzing them. In this
work, we present a learning approach that cor-
rectly determines the hierarchical structure of
information filtering expressions 78.30% of the
time.
