 
This paper presents two pivot strategies 
for statistical machine transliteration, 
namely system-based pivot strategy 
and model-based pivot strategy. Given 
two independent source-pivot and pi-
vot-target name pair corpora, the mod-
el-based strategy learns a direct source-
target transliteration model while the 
system-based strategy learns a source-
pivot model and a pivot-target model, 
respectively. Experimental results on 
benchmark data show that the system-
based pivot strategy is effective in re-
ducing the high resource requirement 
of training corpus for low-density lan-
guage pairs while the model-based pi-
vot strategy performs worse than the 
system-based one.
