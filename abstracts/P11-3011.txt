This paper describes a backtracking strategy
for an incremental deterministic transition-
based parser for HPSG. The method could
theoretically be implemented on any other
transition-based parser with some adjust-
ments. In this paper, the algorithm is evaluated
on CuteForce, an efficient deterministic shift-
reduce HPSG parser. The backtracking strat-
egy may serve to improve existing parsers, or
to assess if a deterministic parser would bene-
fit from backtracking as a strategy to improve
parsing.
