 In this paper we present a detailed scheme for annotating medical web pages de-signed for health care consumers.  The annotation is along two axes: first, by re-liability or the extent to which the medical information on the page can be trusted, second, by the type of page (patient leaf-let, commercial, link, medical article, tes-timonial, or support). We analyze inter-rater agreement among three judges for each category. Inter-rater agreement was moderate (0.77 accuracy, 0.62 F-measure, 0.49 Kappa) on the reliability axis and good (0.81 accuracy, 0.72 F-measure, 0.73 Kappa) along the type axis.
