This paper describes preliminary work in ex-
ploring the relative effectiveness of speech ver-
sus text based tutoring. Most current tuto-
rial dialogue systems are text based (Evens et
al., 2001; Rose and Aleven, 2002; Zinn et
al., 2002; Aleven et al, 2001; VanLehn et al,
2002). However, prior studies have shown con-
siderable benefits of tutoring through spoken
interactions (Lemke, 1990; Chi et al, 1994;
Hausmann and Chi, 2002). Thus, we are cur-
rently developing a speech based dialogue sys-
tem that uses a text based system for tutoring
conceptual physics (VanLehn et al, 2002) as
its ?back-end?. In order to explore the relative
effectiveness between these two input modal-
ities in our task domain, we have started by
collecting parallel human-human tutoring cor-
pora both for text based and speech based tu-
toring. In both cases, students interact with the
tutor through a web interface. We present here
a comparison between the two on a number
of features of dialogue that have been demon-
strated to correlate reliably with learning gains
with students interacting with the tutor using
the text based interface (Rose? et al, submitted).
