Large vocabulary speech recognition systems
fail to recognize words beyond their vocab-
ulary, many of which are information rich
terms, like named entities or foreign words.
Hybrid word/sub-word systems solve this
problem by adding sub-word units to large vo-
cabulary word based systems; new words can
then be represented by combinations of sub-
word units. Previous work heuristically cre-
ated the sub-word lexicon from phonetic rep-
resentations of text using simple statistics to
select common phone sequences. We pro-
pose a probabilistic model to learn the sub-
word lexicon optimized for a given task. We
consider the task of out of vocabulary (OOV)
word detection, which relies on output from
a hybrid model. A hybrid model with our
learned sub-word lexicon reduces error by
6.3% and 7.6% (absolute) at a 5% false alarm
rate on an English Broadcast News and MIT
Lectures task respectively.
