Most embedded systems for the avionics in-
dustry are considered safety critical systems;
as a result, strict software development stan-
dards exist to ensure critical software is built
with the highest quality possible. One of such
standards, DO-178B, establishes a number
of properties that software requirements must
satisfy including: accuracy, non-ambiguity
and verifiability. From a language perspec-
tive, it is possible to automate the analysis of
software requirements to determine whether
or not they satisfy some quality properties.
This work suggests a bounded definition for
three properties (accuracy, non-ambiguity and
verifiability) considering the main character-
istics that software requirements must exhibit
to satisfy those objectives. A software proto-
type that combines natural language process-
ing (NLP) techniques and specialized dictio-
naries was built to examine software require-
ments written in English with the goal of iden-
tifying whether or not they satisfy the de-
sired properties. Preliminary results are pre-
sented showing how the tool effectively iden-
tifies critical issues that are normally ignored
by human reviewers.
