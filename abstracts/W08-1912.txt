We compare a psycholinguistic approach
of mental lexicon organization with a com-
putational approach of implicit lexical or-
ganization as found in dictionaries. In this
work, we associate dictionaries with ?small
world? graphs. This multidisciplinary ap-
proach aims at showing that implicit struc-
ture of dictionaries, mathematically iden-
tified, fits the way young children catego-
rize. These dictionary graphs might there-
fore be considered as ?cognitive artifacts?.
This shows the importance of semantic
proximity both in cognitive and computa-
tional organization of verbs lexicon.
