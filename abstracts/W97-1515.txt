  
In this paper we describe our experi- 
ences with a tool for the development 
and testing of natural language gram- 
mars called GTU (German: Grammatik- 
Testumgebumg; grammar test environ- 
ment). GTU supports four grammar for- 
malisms under a window-oriented user in- 
terface. Additionally, it contains a set 
of German test sentences covering various 
syntactic phenomena as well as three types 
of German lexicons that can be attached to 
a grammar via an integrated lexicon inter- 
face. What follows is a description of the 
experiences we gained when we used GTU 
as a tutoring tool for students and as an ex- 
perimental tool for CL researchers. From 
these we will derive the features necessary 
for a future grammar workbench.
