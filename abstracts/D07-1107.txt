It has been widely observed that different NLP appli-
cations require different sense granularities in order to
best exploit word sense distinctions, and that for many
applications WordNet senses are too fine-grained. In
contrast to previously proposed automatic methods for
sense clustering, we formulate sense merging as a su-
pervised learning problem, exploiting human-labeled
sense clusterings as training data. We train a discrimi-
native classifier over a wide variety of features derived
from WordNet structure, corpus-based evidence, and
evidence from other lexical resources. Our learned
similarity measure outperforms previously proposed
automatic methods for sense clustering on the task of
predicting human sense merging judgments, yielding
an absolute F-score improvement of 4.1% on nouns,
13.6% on verbs, and 4.0% on adjectives. Finally, we
propose a model for clustering sense taxonomies us-
ing the outputs of our classifier, and we make avail-
able several automatically sense-clustered WordNets
of various sense granularities.
