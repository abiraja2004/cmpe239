The paper describes RLSC-LIN and RLSC-
COMB systems which participated in the
Senseval-3 English lexical sample task. These
systems are based on Regularized Least-Squares
Classification (RLSC) learning method. We
describe the reasons of choosing this method,
how we applied it to word sense disambigua-
tion, what results we obtained on Senseval-
1, Senseval-2 and Senseval-3 data and discuss
some possible improvements.
