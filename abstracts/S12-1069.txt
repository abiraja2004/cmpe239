This paper presents three systems that took
part in the lexical simplification task at SE-
MEVAL 2012. Speculating on what the con-
cept of simplicity might mean for a word,
the systems apply different approaches to rank
the given candidate lists. One of the systems
performs second-best (statistically significant)
and another one performs third-best out of 9
systems and 3 baselines. Notably, the third-
best system is very close to the second-best,
and at the same time much more resource-light
in comparison.
