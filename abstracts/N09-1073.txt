In this paper, we extend methods from Roark
and Hollingshead (2008) for reducing the
worst-case complexity of a context-free pars-
ing pipeline via hard constraints derived from
finite-state tagging pre-processing. Methods
from our previous paper achieved quadratic
worst-case complexity. We prove here that al-
ternate methods for choosing constraints can
achieve either linear orO(N log2N) complex-
ity. These worst-case bounds on processing
are demonstrated to be achieved without re-
ducing the parsing accuracy, in fact in some
cases improving the accuracy. The new meth-
ods achieve observed performance compara-
ble to the previously published quadratic com-
plexity method. Finally, we demonstrate im-
proved performance by combining complexity
bounding methods with additional high preci-
sion constraints.
