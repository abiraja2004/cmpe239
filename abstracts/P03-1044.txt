This paper presents a method for unsu-
pervised discovery of semantic patterns.
Semantic patterns are useful for a vari-
ety of text understanding tasks, in par-
ticular for locating events in text for in-
formation extraction. The method builds
upon previously described approaches to
iterative unsupervised pattern acquisition.
One common characteristic of prior ap-
proaches is that the output of the algorithm
is a continuous stream of patterns, with
gradually degrading precision.
Our method differs from the previous pat-
tern acquisition algorithms in that it intro-
duces competition among several scenar-
ios simultaneously. This provides natu-
ral stopping criteria for the unsupervised
learners, while maintaining good preci-
sion levels at termination. We discuss the
results of experiments with several scenar-
ios, and examine different aspects of the
new procedure.
