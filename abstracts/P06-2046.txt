Recognizing idioms in a sentence is im-
portant to sentence understanding. This
paper discusses the lexical knowledge of
idioms for idiom recognition. The chal-
lenges are that idioms can be ambiguous
between literal and idiomatic meanings,
and that they can be ?transformed? when
expressed in a sentence. However, there
has been little research on Japanese idiom
recognition with its ambiguity and trans-
formations taken into account. We pro-
pose a set of lexical knowledge for idiom
recognition. We evaluated the knowledge
by measuring the performance of an idiom
recognizer that exploits the knowledge. As
a result, more than 90% of the idioms in a
corpus are recognized with 90% accuracy.
