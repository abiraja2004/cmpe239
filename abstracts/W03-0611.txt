We present an empirical corpus study of the
meaning and usage of time phrases in weather
forecasts; this is based on a novel corpus anal-
ysis technique where we align phrases from
the forecast text with data extracted from a nu-
merical weather simulation. Previous papers
have summarised this analysis and discussed
the substantial variations we discovered among
individual writers, which was perhaps our most
surprising finding. In this paper we describe
our analysis procedure and results in consid-
erably more detail, and also discuss our cur-
rent work on using parallel text-data corpora to
learn the meanings of other types of words.
