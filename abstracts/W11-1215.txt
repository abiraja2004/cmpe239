This paper introduces a new task of
crosslingual slot filling which aims to dis-
cover attributes for entity queries from
crosslingual comparable corpora and then
present answers in a desired language. It is
a very challenging task which suffers from
both information extraction and machine
translation errors. In this paper we ana-
lyze the types of errors produced by five
different baseline approaches, and present
a novel supervised rescoring based valida-
tion approach to incorporate global evi-
dence from very large bilingual compara-
ble corpora. Without using any additional
labeled data this new approach obtained
38.5% relative improvement in Precision
and 86.7% relative improvement in Recall
over several state-of-the-art approaches.
The ultimate system outperformed mono-
lingual slot filling pipelines built on much
larger monolingual corpora.
