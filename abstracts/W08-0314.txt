This paper present the University of Washing-
ton?s submission to the 2008 ACL SMT shared ma-
chine translation task. Two systems, for English-to-
Spanish and German-to-Spanish translation are de-
scribed. Our main focus was on testing a novel
boosting framework for N-best list reranking and
on handling German morphology in the German-to-
Spanish system. While boosted N-best list reranking
did not yield any improvements for this task, simpli-
fying German morphology as part of the preprocess-
ing step did result in significant gains.
