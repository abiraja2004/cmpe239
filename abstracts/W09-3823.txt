Lexical-Functional Grammar (Kaplan and
Bresnan, 1982) f-structures are bilexical
labelled dependency representations. We
show that the Naive Bayes classifier is able
to guess missing grammatical function la-
bels (i.e. bilexical dependency labels) with
reasonably high accuracy (82?91%). In
the experiments we use f-structure parser
output for English and German Europarl
data, automatically ?broken? by replacing
grammatical function labels with a generic
UNKNOWN label and asking the classifier
to restore the label.
