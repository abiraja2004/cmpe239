Linear Context-Free Rewriting Systems
(LCFRSs) are a grammar formalism ca-
pable of modeling discontinuous phrases.
Many parsing applications use LCFRSs
where the fan-out (a measure of the dis-
continuity of phrases) does not exceed 2.
We present an efficient algorithm for opti-
mal reduction of the length of production
right-hand side in LCFRSs with fan-out at
most 2. This results in asymptotical run-
ning time improvement for known parsing
algorithms for this class.
