This article describes a machine translation
system based on an automatic post-editing
strategy: initially translate the input text into
the target-language using a rule-based MT
system, then automatically post-edit the out-
put using a statistical phrase-based system.
An implementation of this approach based
on the SYSTRAN and PORTAGE MT sys-
tems was used in the shared task of the Sec-
ond Workshop on Statistical Machine Trans-
lation. Experimental results on the test data
of the previous campaign are presented.
