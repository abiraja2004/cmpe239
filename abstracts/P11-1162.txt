Text mining and data harvesting algorithms
have become popular in the computational lin-
guistics community. They employ patterns
that specify the kind of information to be har-
vested, and usually bootstrap either the pat-
tern learning or the term harvesting process (or
both) in a recursive cycle, using data learned
in one step to generate more seeds for the next.
They therefore treat the source text corpus as
a network, in which words are the nodes and
relations linking them are the edges. The re-
sults of computational network analysis, espe-
cially from the world wide web, are thus ap-
plicable. Surprisingly, these results have not
yet been broadly introduced into the computa-
tional linguistics community. In this paper we
show how various results apply to text mining,
how they explain some previously observed
phenomena, and how they can be helpful for
computational linguistics applications.
