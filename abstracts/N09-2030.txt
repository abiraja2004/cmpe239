This paper presents a method for automatic
topic identification using a graph-centrality al-
gorithm applied to an encyclopedic graph de-
rived from Wikipedia. When tested on a data
set with manually assigned topics, the system
is found to significantly improve over a sim-
pler baseline that does not make use of the ex-
ternal encyclopedic knowledge.
