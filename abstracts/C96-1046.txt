 
Pronunciation-by-analogy (PbA) is an emer- 
ging technique for text-phoneme conversion 
based on a psychological model of read- 
ing aloud. This paper explores the impact 
of certain basic implementational choices 
on the performance of various PbA mod- 
els. These have been tested on their abil- 
ity to pronounce sets of short pseudowords 
previously used in similar studies, as well as 
lexical words temporarily removed from the 
dictionary. Best results of 85.7% and 67.9% 
words correct are obtained lor the pseudo- 
words and lexical words respectively, cast- 
ing doubt on certain previous-reported per- 
formance figures in the literature.
