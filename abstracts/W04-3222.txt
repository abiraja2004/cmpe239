We present a novel representation of parse trees as
lists of paths (leaf projection paths) from leaves to
the top level of the tree. This representation allows
us to achieve significantly higher accuracy in the
task of HPSG parse selection than standard models,
and makes the application of string kernels natural.
We define tree kernels via string kernels on projec-
tion paths and explore their performance in the con-
text of parse disambiguation. We apply SVM rank-
ing models and achieve an exact sentence accuracy
of 85.40% on the Redwoods corpus.
