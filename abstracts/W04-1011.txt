  
  Some document genres contain a large number of 
figures.  This position paper outlines approaches to 
diagram summarization that can augment the many 
well-developed techniques of text summarization.  
We discuss figures as surrogates for entire docu-
ments, thumbnails, extraction, the relations between 
text and figures as well as how automation might be 
achieved.  The focus is on diagrams (line drawings) 
because they allow parsing techniques to be used, in 
contrast to the difficulties of general image under-
standing. We describe the advances in raster image 
vectorization and parsing needed to produce cor-
pora for diagram summarization.
