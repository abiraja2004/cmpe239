 
Based on the core approach of the tree edit 
distance algorithm, the system central mod-
ule is designed to target the scope of TE ? 
semantic variability. The main idea is to 
transform the hypothesis making use of ex-

like DIRT, WordNet, Wikipedia, acronyms 
database. Additionally, we built a system to 
acquire the extra background knowledge 
needed and applied complex grammar rules 
for rephrasing in English.
