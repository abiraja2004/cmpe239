Semantic role labeling (SRL) and word
sense disambiguation (WSD) are two fun-
damental tasks in natural language pro-
cessing to find a sentence-level seman-
tic representation. To date, they have
mostly been modeled in isolation. How-
ever, this approach neglects logical con-
straints between them. We therefore ex-
ploit some pipeline systems which verify
the automatic all word sense disambigua-
tion could help the semantic role label-
ing and vice versa. We further propose a
Markov logic model that jointly labels se-
mantic roles and disambiguates all word
senses. By evaluating our model on the
OntoNotes 3.0 data, we show that this
joint approach leads to a higher perfor-
mance for word sense disambiguation and
semantic role labeling than those pipeline
approaches.
