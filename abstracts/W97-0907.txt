 
We describe an experimental system im- 
plemented using the Java(TM) program- 
ming language which demonstrates a va- 
riety of application-level tradeoffs available 
to distributed natural language processing 
(NLP) applications. In the context of the 
World Wide Web (WWW), it is possible to 
provide value added functionality to legacy 
documents in a client side browser, a docu- 
ment server or an intermediary agent. Us- 
ing a well-known ngram-based algorithm 
for automatic language identification, we 
have constructed a system to dynamically 
add language labels for whole documents 
and text fragments. We have experi- 
mented with several client/server configu- 
rations, and present he results of tradeoffs 
made between labelling accuracy and the 
size/completeness of the language models.
