Recently developed markup tools for di-
alogue work are quite sophisticated and
require considerable knowledge and over-
head, but older tools do not support XML
standoff markup, the current annotation
style of choice. For the DIAG-NLP
project we have created a ?lightweight?
but modern markup tool that can be con-
figured and used by the working NLP re-
searcher.
