Natural language has a high paraphrastic power yet
not all paraphrases are appropriate for all contexts.
In this paper, we present a TAG based surface re-
aliser which supports both the generation and the
selection of paraphrases. To deal with the combi-
natorial explosion typical of such an NP-complete
task, we introduce a number of new optimisations
in a tabular, bottom-up surface realisation algo-
rithm. We then show that one of these optimisations
supports paraphrase selection.
