 
We propose an intention analysis system 
for instant messaging applications.  The 
system adopts Yahoo! directory as category 
trees, and classifies each dialogue into one 
of the categories of the directory. Two 
weighting schemes in information retrieval, 
i.e., tf and tf-idf, are considered in our ex-
periments.  In addition, we also expand 
Yahoo! directory with the accompanying 
HTML files and explore different features 
such as nouns, verbs, hypernym, hyponym, 
etc.  Experiments show that category trees 
expanded with snippets together with noun 
features under tf scheme achieves a best F-
score, 0.86, when only 37.46% of utter-
ances are processed on the average.  This 
methodology is employed to recommend 
advertisements relevant to the dialogue.
