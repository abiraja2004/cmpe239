The many differences between Dialectal Ara-
bic and Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) pose
a challenge to the majority of Arabic natural
language processing tools, which are designed
for MSA. In this paper, we retarget an exist-
ing state-of-the-art MSA morphological tag-
ger to Egyptian Arabic (ARZ). Our evalua-
tion demonstrates that our ARZ morphology
tagger outperforms its MSA variant on ARZ
input in terms of accuracy in part-of-speech
tagging, diacritization, lemmatization and to-
kenization; and in terms of utility for ARZ-to-
English statistical machine translation.
