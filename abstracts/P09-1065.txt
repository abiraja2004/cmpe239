Current SMT systems usually decode with
single translation models and cannot ben-
efit from the strengths of other models in
decoding phase. We instead propose joint
decoding, a method that combines multi-
ple translation models in one decoder. Our
joint decoder draws connections among
multiple models by integrating the trans-
lation hypergraphs they produce individu-
ally. Therefore, one model can share trans-
lations and even derivations with other
models. Comparable to the state-of-the-art
system combination technique, joint de-
coding achieves an absolute improvement
of 1.5 BLEU points over individual decod-
ing.
