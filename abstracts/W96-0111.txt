 
In this paper I present ongoing work on the data-oriented parsing (DOP) model. In previous 
work, DOP was tested on a cleaned-up set of analyzed part-of-speech strings from the Penn 
Treebank, achieving excellent est results. This left, however, two important questions 
unanswered: (1) how does DOP perform if tested on unedited ata, and (2) how can DOP be 
used for parsing word strings that contain unknown words? This paper addresses these 
questions. We show that parse results on unedited ata are worse than on cleaned-up data, 
although still very competitive if compared to other models. As to the parsing of word strings, 
we show that the hardness of the problem does not so much depend on unknown words, but on 
previously unseen lexical categories of known words. We give a novel method for parsing 
these words by estimating the probabilities of unknown subtrees. The method is of general 
interest since it shows that good performance can be obtained without he use of a part-of- 
speech tagger. To the best of our knowledge, our method outperforms other statistical parsers 
tested on Penn Treebank word strings.
