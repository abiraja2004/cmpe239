Recent work has shown that very large
corpora can act as training data for NLP
algorithms even without explicit labels. In
this paper we show how the use of sur-
face features and paraphrases in queries
against search engines can be used to infer
labels for structural ambiguity resolution
tasks. Using unsupervised algorithms, we
achieve 84% precision on PP-attachment
and 80% on noun compound coordination.
