Individuals using an Augmentative and
Alternative Communication (AAC) de-
vice communicate at less than 10% of
the speed of ?traditional? speech, creat-
ing a large communication gap. In this
user study, we compare the communica-
tion rate of pseudo-impaired individuals
using two different word prediction algo-
rithms and a system without word pre-
diction. Our results show that word pre-
diction can increase AAC communication
rate and that more accurate predictions
significantly improve communication rate.
