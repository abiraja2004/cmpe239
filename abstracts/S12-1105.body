This paper overviews FBK?s participation
in the Cross-Lingual Textual Entailment
for Content Synchronization task organized
within SemEval-2012. Our participation is
characterized by using cross-lingual matching
features extracted from lexical and semantic
phrase tables and dependency relations. The
features are used for multi-class and binary
classification using SVMs. Using a combi-
nation of lexical, syntactic, and semantic fea-
tures to create a cross-lingual textual entail-
ment system, we report on experiments over
the provided dataset. Our best run achieved
an accuracy of 50.4% on the Spanish-English
dataset (with the average score and the me-
dian system respectively achieving 40.7% and
34.6%), demonstrating the effectiveness of a
?pure? cross-lingual approach that avoids in-
termediate translations.
