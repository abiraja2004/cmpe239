Current research in automatic subjectivity
analysis deals with various kinds of subjec-
tive statements involving human attitudes and
emotions. While all of them are related to
subjectivity, these statements usually touch on
multiple dimensions such as non-objectivity1,
uncertainty, vagueness, non-objective measur-
ability, imprecision, and ambiguity, which are
inherently different. This paper discusses the
differences and relations of six dimensions of
subjectivity. Conceptual and linguistic char-
acteristics of each dimension will be demon-
strated under different contexts.
