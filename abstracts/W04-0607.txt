This paper reports on an ongoing project that com-
bines NLP with semantic web technologies to sup-
port a content-based storage and retrieval of medical
pathology reports. We describe the NLP component
of the project (a robust parser) and the background
knowledge component (a domain ontology repre-
sented in OWL), and how they work together during
extraction of domain specific information from nat-
ural language reports. The system provides a good
example of how NLP techniques can be used to pop-
ulate the Semantic Web.
