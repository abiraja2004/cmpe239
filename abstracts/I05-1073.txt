. Creation titles, i.e. titles of literary and/or artistic works, comprise 
over 7% of named entities in Chinese documents. They are the fourth large sort 
of named entities in Chinese other than personal names, location names, and 
organization names. However, they are rarely mentioned and studied before. 
Chinese title recognition is challenging for the following reasons. There are few 
internal features and nearly no restrictions in the naming style of titles. Their 
lengths and structures are varied. The worst of all, they are generally composed 
of common words, so that they look like common fragments of sentences. In 
this paper, we integrate punctuation rules, lexicon, and na?ve Bayesian models 
to recognize creation titles in Chinese documents. This pioneer study shows a 
precision of 0.510 and a recall of 0.685 being achieved. The promising results 
can be integrated into Chinese segmentation, used to retrieve relevant informa-
tion for specific titles, and so on.
