RWTH participated in the System Combi-
nation task of the Fifth Workshop on Sta-
tistical Machine Translation (WMT 2010).
For 7 of the 8 language pairs, we com-
bine 5 to 13 systems into a single con-
sensus translation, using additional n-best
reranking techniques in two of these lan-
guage pairs. Depending on the language
pair, improvements versus the best sin-
gle system are in the range of +0.5 and
+1.7 on BLEU, and between ?0.4 and
?2.3 on TER. Novel techniques compared
with RWTH?s submission to WMT 2009
include the utilization of n-best reranking
techniques, a consensus true casing ap-
proach, a different tuning algorithm, and
the separate selection of input systems
for CN construction, primary/skeleton hy-
potheses, HypLM, and true casing.
