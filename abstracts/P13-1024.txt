Many current Natural Language Process-
ing [NLP] techniques work well assum-
ing a large context of text as input data.
However they become ineffective when
applied to short texts such as Twitter feeds.
To overcome the issue, we want to find
a related newswire document to a given
tweet to provide contextual support for
NLP tasks. This requires robust model-
ing and understanding of the semantics of
short texts.
The contribution of the paper is two-fold:
1. we introduce the Linking-Tweets-to-
News task as well as a dataset of linked
tweet-news pairs, which can benefit many
NLP applications; 2. in contrast to previ-
ous research which focuses on lexical fea-
tures within the short texts (text-to-word
information), we propose a graph based
latent variable model that models the in-
ter short text correlations (text-to-text in-
formation). This is motivated by the ob-
servation that a tweet usually only cov-
ers one aspect of an event. We show that
using tweet specific feature (hashtag) and
news specific feature (named entities) as
well as temporal constraints, we are able to
extract text-to-text correlations, and thus
completes the semantic picture of a short
text. Our experiments show significant im-
provement of our new model over base-
lines with three evaluation metrics in the
new task.
