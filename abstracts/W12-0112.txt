 
We report on a series of experiments aimed at improving the machine translation of ambig-uous lexical items by using wordnet-based unsupervised Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) and comparing its results to three MT systems. Our experiments are performed for the English-Slovene language pair using UKB, a freely available graph-based word sense disambiguation system. Results are evaluated in three ways: a manual evaluation of WSD performance from MT perspective, an analysis of agreement between the WSD-proposed equivalent and those suggested by the three systems, and finally by computing BLEU, NIST and METEOR scores for all translation versions. Our results show that WSD performs with a MT-relevant precision of 71% and that 21% of sense-related MT er-rors could be prevented by using unsuper-vised WSD. 1
