 
We propose a lexical organisation fi)r mullilingual 
lcxical databases (MLDB). This organisation is based on 
acceptions (word-senses). We detail this lexical 
organisation m~d show a mock-up built to experiment with 
it. We also present our current work in defining and 
prototyping a specialised system for the manage,ncnt of
acception-based M LDB. 
Keywords: mnltilingual exical database, acccplion, 
linguistic structure.
