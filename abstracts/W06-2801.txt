We analyze four different types of docu-
ment networks with respect to their small
world characteristics. These characteris-
tics allow distinguishing wiki-based sys-
tems from citation and more traditional
text-based networks augmented by hyper-
links. The study provides evidence that a
more appropriate network model is needed
which better reflects the specifics of wiki
systems. It puts emphasize on their topo-
logical differences as a result of wiki-
related linking compared to other text-
based networks.
