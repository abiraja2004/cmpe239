Abstract
In automatic summarization, centrality is
the notion that a summary should contain
the core parts of the source text. Cur-
rent systems use centrality, along with re-
dundancy avoidance and some sentence
compression, to produce mostly extrac-
tive summaries. In this paper, we investi-
gate how summarization can advance past
this paradigm towards robust abstraction
by making greater use of the domain of
the source text. We conduct a series of
studies comparing human-written model
summaries to system summaries at the se-
mantic level of caseframes. We show that
model summaries (1) are more abstrac-
tive and make use of more sentence aggre-
gation, (2) do not contain as many topi-
cal caseframes as system summaries, and
(3) cannot be reconstructed solely from
the source text, but can be if texts from
in-domain documents are added. These
results suggest that substantial improve-
ments are unlikely to result from better
optimizing centrality-based criteria, but
rather more domain knowledge is needed.
