 Event recognition 
We present a program for segmenting texts ac- 
cording to the separate vents they describe. 
A modular architecture is described that al- 
lows us to examine the contributions made by 
particular aspects of natural language to event 
structuring. This is applied in the context of 
terrorist news articles, and a technique is sug- 
gested for evaluating the resulting segmenta- 
tions. We also examine the usefulness of vari- 
ous heuristics in forming these segmentations.
