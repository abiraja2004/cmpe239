We present an unsupervised, nonparamet-
ric Bayesian approach to coreference reso-
lution which models both global entity iden-
tity across a corpus as well as the sequen-
tial anaphoric structure within each docu-
ment. While most existing coreference work
is driven by pairwise decisions, our model
is fully generative, producing each mention
from a combination of global entity proper-
ties and local attentional state. Despite be-
ing unsupervised, our system achieves a 70.3
MUC F1 measure on the MUC-6 test set,
broadly in the range of some recent super-
vised results.
