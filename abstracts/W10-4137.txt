 
This paper describes our experiments on 
the cross-domain Chinese word segmen-
tation task at the first CIPS-SIGHAN 
Joint Conference on Chinese Language 
Processing. Our system is based on the 
Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) 
model. Considering the particular prop-
erties of the out-of-domain data, we pro-
pose some novel steps to get some im-
provements for the special task.
