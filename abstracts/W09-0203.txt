We present the results of clustering exper-
iments with a number of different evalu-
ation sets using dependency based word
spaces. Contrary to previous results we
found a clear advantage using a parsed
corpus over word spaces constructed with
the help of simple patterns. We achieve
considerable gains in performance over
these spaces ranging between 9 and 13%
in absolute terms of cluster purity.
