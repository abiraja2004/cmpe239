We present a simple but very effective ap-
proach to identifying high-quality data in
noisy data sets for structured problems like
parsing, by greedily exploiting partial struc-
tures. We analyze our approach in an anno-
tation projection framework for dependency
trees, and show how dependency parsers from
two different paradigms (graph-based and
transition-based) can be trained on the result-
ing tree fragments. We train parsers for Dutch
to evaluate our method and to investigate
to which degree graph-based and transition-
based parsers can benefit from incomplete
training data. We find that partial correspon-
dence projection gives rise to parsers that out-
perform parsers trained on aggressively fil-
tered data sets, and achieve unlabeled attach-
ment scores that are only 5% behind the aver-
age UAS for Dutch in the CoNLL-X Shared
Task on supervised parsing (Buchholz and
Marsi, 2006).
