We present a number of semi-supervised pars-
ing experiments on the Irish language carried
out using a small seed set of manually parsed
trees and a larger, yet still relatively small, set
of unlabelled sentences. We take two pop-
ular dependency parsers ? one graph-based
and one transition-based ? and compare re-
sults for both. Results show that using semi-
supervised learning in the form of self-training
and co-training yields only very modest im-
provements in parsing accuracy. We also try
to use morphological information in a targeted
way and fail to see any improvements.
