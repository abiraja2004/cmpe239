 
In many contexts, automatic analyzers cannot 
fully disambiguate a sentence or an utterance 
reliably, but can produce ambiguous results 
containing the correct interpretation. It is useful 
to study vatious properties of these ambiguities 
in the view of subsequent total or partial inter- 
active disambiguation. We have proposed a 
technique for labelling ambiguities in texts and 
in dialogue transcriptions, and experimented it 
on multilingual data. It has been first necessary 
to define formally the very notion of ambiguity 
relative to a representation system, as well as 
associated concepts uch as ambiguity kernel, 
ambiguity scope, ambiguity occurrence. 
Keywords: interactive disambiguation, ambiguity
