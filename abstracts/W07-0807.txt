Transliteration of a word into another lan-
guage often leads to multiple spellings. Un-
less an information retrieval system recog-
nises different forms of transliterated words,
a significant number of documents will be
missed when users specify only one spelling
variant. Using two different datasets, we
evaluate several approaches to finding vari-
ants of foreign words in Arabic, and show
that the longest common subsequence (LCS)
technique is the best overall.
