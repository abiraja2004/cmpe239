 
This paper describes our ongoing work in 
and thoughts on developing a grammar 
learning system based on a construction 
grammar formalism. Necessary modules 
are presented and first results and chal-
lenges in formalizing the grammar are 
shown up. Furthermore, we point out the 
major reasons why we chose construction 
grammar as the most fitting formalism for 
our purposes. Then our approach and 
ideas of learning new linguistic phenom-
ena, ranging from holophrastic construc-
tions to compositional ones, is presented.
