This paper reports the effect of corpus size on
case frame acquisition for discourse analysis
in Japanese. For this study, we collected a
Japanese corpus consisting of up to 100 bil-
lion words, and constructed case frames from
corpora of six different sizes. Then, we ap-
plied these case frames to syntactic and case
structure analysis, and zero anaphora resolu-
tion. We obtained better results by using case
frames constructed from larger corpora; the
performance was not saturated even with a
corpus size of 100 billion words.
