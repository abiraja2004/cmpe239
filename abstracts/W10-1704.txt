This paper describes our Statistical Ma-
chine Translation systems for the WMT10
evaluation, where LIMSI participated for
two language pairs (French-English and
German-English, in both directions). For
German-English, we concentrated on nor-
malizing the German side through a proper
preprocessing, aimed at reducing the lex-
ical redundancy and at splitting complex
compounds. For French-English, we stud-
ied two extensions of our in-house N -code
decoder: firstly, the effect of integrating a
new bilingual reordering model; second,
the use of adaptation techniques for the
translation model. For both set of exper-
iments, we report the improvements ob-
tained on the development and test data.
