In this paper we present the approach and
system setup of the joint participation of
Fondazione Bruno Kessler and University
of Edinburgh in the WMT 2013 Quality
Estimation shared-task. Our submissions
were focused on tasks whose aim was pre-
dicting sentence-level Human-mediated
Translation Edit Rate and sentence-level
post-editing time (Task 1.1 and 1.3, re-
spectively). We designed features that
are built on resources such as automatic
word alignment, n-best candidate transla-
tion lists, back-translations and word pos-
terior probabilities. Our models consis-
tently overcome the baselines for both
tasks and performed particularly well for
Task 1.3, ranking first among seven parti-
cipants.
