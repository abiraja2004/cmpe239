This paper presents and evaluates several
original techniques for the latent classifi-
cation of biographic attributes such as gen-
der, age and native language, in diverse
genres (conversation transcripts, email)
and languages (Arabic, English). First,
we present a novel partner-sensitive model
for extracting biographic attributes in con-
versations, given the differences in lexi-
cal usage and discourse style such as ob-
served between same-gender and mixed-
gender conversations. Then, we explore
a rich variety of novel sociolinguistic and
discourse-based features, including mean
utterance length, passive/active usage, per-
centage domination of the conversation,
speaking rate and filler word usage. Cu-
mulatively up to 20% error reduction is
achieved relative to the standard Boulis
and Ostendorf (2005) algorithm for classi-
fying individual conversations on Switch-
board, and accuracy for gender detection
on the Switchboard corpus (aggregate) and
Gulf Arabic corpus exceeds 95%.
