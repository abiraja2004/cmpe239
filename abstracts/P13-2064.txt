In this paper, we propose a novel compact
representation called weighted bipartite
hypergraph to exploit the fertility model,
which plays a critical role in word align-
ment. However, estimating the probabili-
ties of rules extracted from hypergraphs is
an NP-complete problem, which is com-
putationally infeasible. Therefore, we pro-
pose a divide-and-conquer strategy by de-
composing a hypergraph into a set of inde-
pendent subhypergraphs. The experiments
show that our approach outperforms both
1-best and n-best alignments.
