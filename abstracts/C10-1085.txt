We propose to analyse semantic similar-
ity in comparable text by matching syn-
tactic trees and labeling the alignments
according to one of five semantic simi-
larity relations. We present a Memory-
based Graph Matcher (MBGM) that per-
forms both tasks simultaneously as a com-
bination of exhaustive pairwise classifica-
tion using a memory-based learner, fol-
lowed by global optimization of the align-
ments using a combinatorial optimization
algorithm. The method is evaluated on a
monolingual treebank consisting of com-
parable Dutch news texts. Results show
that it performs substantially above the
baseline and close to the human reference.
