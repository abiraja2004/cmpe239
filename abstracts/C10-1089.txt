Relations between entities in text have
been widely researched in the natu-
ral language processing and information-
extraction communities. The region con-
necting a pair of entities (in a parsed
sentence) is often used to construct ker-
nels or feature vectors that can recognize
and extract interesting relations. Such re-
gions are useful, but they can also incor-
porate unnecessary distracting informa-
tion. In this paper, we propose a rule-
based method to remove the information
that is unnecessary for relation extraction.
Protein?protein interaction (PPI) is used
as an example relation extraction problem.
A dozen simple rules are defined on out-
put from a deep parser. Each rule specif-
ically examines the entities in one target
interaction pair. These simple rules were
tested using several PPI corpora. The PPI
extraction performance was improved on
all the PPI corpora.
