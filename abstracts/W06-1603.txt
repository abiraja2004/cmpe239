We propose a supervised, two-phase
framework to address the problem of para-
phrase recognition (PR). Unlike most PR
systems that focus on sentence similarity,
our framework detects dissimilarities be-
tween sentences and makes its paraphrase
judgment based on the significance of such
dissimilarities. The ability to differenti-
ate significant dissimilarities not only re-
veals what makes two sentences a non-
paraphrase, but also helps to recall addi-
tional paraphrases that contain extra but
insignificant information. Experimental
results show that while being accurate
at discerning non-paraphrasing dissimilar-
ities, our implemented system is able to
achieve higher paraphrase recall (93%), at
an overall performance comparable to the
alternatives.
