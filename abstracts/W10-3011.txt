 
This paper describes our system about 
detecting hedges and their scope in natural 
language texts for our participation in CoNLL-
2010 shared tasks. We formalize these two 
tasks as sequence labeling problems, and 
implement them using conditional random 
fields (CRFs) model. In the first task, we use a 
greedy forward procedure to select features for 
the classifier. These features include part-of-
speech tag, word form, lemma, chunk tag of 
tokens in the sentence. In the second task, our 
system exploits rich syntactic features about 
dependency structures and phrase structures, 
which achieves a better performance than only 
using the flat sequence features. Our system 
achieves the third score in biological data set 
for the first task, and achieves 0.5265 F1 score 
for the second task.
