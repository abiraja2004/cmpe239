We present a new translation model in-
tegrating the shallow local multi bottom-
up tree transducer. We perform a large-
scale empirical evaluation of our obtained
system, which demonstrates that we sig-
nificantly beat a realistic tree-to-tree base-
line on the WMT 2009 English?German
translation task. As an additional contribu-
tion we make the developed software and
complete tool-chain publicly available for
further experimentation.
