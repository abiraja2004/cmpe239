 
Accurate evaluation of machine 
translation (MT) is an open problem. A 
brief survey of the current approach to 
tackle this problem is presented and a 
new proposal is introduced. This proposal 
attempts to measure the percentage of 
words, which should be modified at the 
output of an automatic translator in order 
to obtain a correct translation. To show 
the feasibility of the method we have 
assessed the most important Spanish-
Catalan translators in comparing the 
results obtained by the various methods.
