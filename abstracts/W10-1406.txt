We investigate parsing accuracy on the Ko-
rean Treebank 2.0 with a number of different
grammars. Comparisons among these gram-
mars and to their English counterparts suggest
different aspects of Korean that contribute to
parsing difficulty. Our results indicate that the
coarseness of the Treebank?s nonterminal set
is a even greater problem than in the English
Treebank. We also find that Korean?s rela-
tively free word order does not impact parsing
results as much as one might expect, but in
fact the prevalence of zero pronouns accounts
for a large portion of the difference between
Korean and English parsing scores.
