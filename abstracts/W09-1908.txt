Building machine translation (MT) for many
minority languages in the world is a serious
challenge. For many minor languages there is
little machine readable text, few knowledge-
able linguists, and little money available for
MT development. For these reasons, it be-
comes very important for an MT system to
make best use of its resources, both labeled
and unlabeled, in building a quality system.
In this paper we argue that traditional active
learning setup may not be the right fit for seek-
ing annotations required for building a Syn-
tax Based MT system for minority languages.
We posit that a relatively new variant of active
learning, Proactive Learning, is more suitable
for this task.
