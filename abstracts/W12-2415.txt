The goal of this work is to apply NLP tech-
niques to the field of BioNLP in order to gain
a better insight into the field and show connec-
tions and trends that might not otherwise be
apparent. The data we analyzed was the pro-
ceedings from last decade of BioNLP work-
shops. Our findings reveal the prominent re-
search problems and techniques in the field,
their progression over time, the approaches
that researchers are using to solve those prob-
lems, insightful ways to categorize works in
the field, and the prominent researchers and
groups whose works are influencing the field.
