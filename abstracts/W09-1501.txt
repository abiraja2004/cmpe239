 
We summarize our experiences building a 
comprehensive suite of tests for a statistical 
natural language processing toolkit, ClearTK. 
We describe some of the challenges we en-
countered, introduce a software project that 
emerged from these efforts, summarize our re-
sulting test suite, and discuss some of the les-
sons learned.
