Finding temporal and causal relations is cru-
cial to understanding the semantic structure
of a text. Since existing corpora provide no
parallel temporal and causal annotations, we
annotated 1000 conjoined event pairs, achiev-
ing inter-annotator agreement of 81.2% on
temporal relations and 77.8% on causal re-
lations. We trained machine learning mod-
els using features derived from WordNet and
the Google N-gram corpus, and they out-
performed a variety of baselines, achieving
an F-measure of 49.0 for temporals and 52.4
for causals. Analysis of these models sug-
gests that additional data will improve perfor-
mance, and that temporal information is cru-
cial to causal relation identification.
