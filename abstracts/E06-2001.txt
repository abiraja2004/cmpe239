The Web contains vast amounts of linguis-
tic data. One key issue for linguists and
language technologists is how to access
it. Commercial search engines give highly
compromised access. An alternative is to
crawl the Web ourselves, which also al-
lows us to remove duplicates and near-
duplicates, navigational material, and a
range of other kinds of non-linguistic mat-
ter. We can also tokenize, lemmatise and
part-of-speech tag the corpus, and load the
data into a corpus query tool which sup-
ports sophisticated linguistic queries. We
have now done this for German and Ital-
ian, with corpus sizes of over 1 billion
words in each case. We provide Web ac-
cess to the corpora in our query tool, the
Sketch Engine.
