Aphasia treatment for the recovery of lost
communication functionalities is possible
through frequent and intense speech therapy
sessions. In this sense, speech and language
technology may provide important support in
improving the recovery process. The aim of
the project Vithea (Virtual Therapist for Apha-
sia Treatment) is to develop an on-line sys-
tem designed to behave as a virtual thera-
pist, guiding the patient in performing train-
ing exercises in a simple and intuitive fashion.
In this paper, the fundamental components of
the Vithea system are presented, with particu-
lar emphasis on the speech recognition mod-
ule. Furthermore, we report encouraging au-
tomatic word naming recognition results using
data collected from speech therapy sessions.
