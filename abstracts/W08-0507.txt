In this paper, we describe our efforts to build
on WORDNET resources, using WORDNET
lexical data, the data format that it comes with
and WORDNET?s software infrastructure in
order to generate a biomedical extension of
WORDNET, the BIOWORDNET. We began
our efforts on the assumption that the soft-
ware resources were stable and reliable. In
the course of our work, it turned out that this
belief was far too optimistic. We discuss the
stumbling blocks that we encountered, point
out an error in the WORDNET software with
implications for research based on it, and con-
clude that building on the legacy of WORD-
NET data structures and its associated soft-
ware might preclude sustainable extensions
that go beyond the domain of general English.
