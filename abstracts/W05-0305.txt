The annotations of the Penn Discourse
Treebank (PDTB) include (1) discourse
connectives and their arguments, and (2)
attribution of each argument of each con-
nective and of the relation it denotes. Be-
cause the PDTB covers the same text as
the Penn TreeBank WSJ corpus, syntac-
tic and discourse annotation can be com-
pared. This has revealed significant dif-
ferences between syntactic structure and
discourse structure, in terms of the argu-
ments of connectives, due in large part to
attribution. We describe these differences,
an algorithm for detecting them, and fi-
nally some experimental results. These re-
sults have implications for automating dis-
course annotation based on syntactic an-
notation.
