Definition questions represent a largely unex-
plored area of question answering?they are
different from factoid questions in that the
goal is to return as many relevant ?nuggets?
of information about a concept as possible.
We describe a multi-strategy approach to an-
swering such questions using a database con-
structed offline with surface patterns, a Web-
based dictionary, and an off-the-shelf docu-
ment retriever. Results are presented from
component-level evaluation and from an end-
to-end evaluation of our implemented system
at the TREC 2003 Question Answering Track.
