. This paper shows that our WSD system using rich linguistic features 
achieved high accuracy in the classification of English SENSEVAL2 verbs for 
both fine-grained (64.6%) and coarse-grained (73.7%) senses. We describe 
three specific enhancements to our treatment of rich linguistic features and pre-
sent their separate and combined contributions to our system?s performance. 
Further experiments showed that our system had robust performance on test 
data without high quality rich features.
