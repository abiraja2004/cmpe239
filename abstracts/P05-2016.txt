We present a Czech-English statistical
machine translation system which per-
forms tree-to-tree translation of depen-
dency structures. The only bilingual re-
source required is a sentence-aligned par-
allel corpus. All other resources are
monolingual. We also refer to an evalua-
tion method and plan to compare our sys-
tem?s output with a benchmark system.
