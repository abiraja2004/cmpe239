Widespread use of Semantic Web tech-
nologies requires interfaces through which
knowledge can be viewed and edited with-
out deep understanding of Description
Logic and formalisms like OWL and RDF.
Several groups are pursuing approaches
based on Controlled Natural Languages
(CNLs), so that editing can be performed
by typing in sentences which are automat-
ically interpreted as statements in OWL.
We suggest here a variant of this approach
which relies entirely on Natural Language
Generation (NLG), and propose require-
ments for a system that can reliably gen-
erate transparent realisations of statements
in Description Logic.
