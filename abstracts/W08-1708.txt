In this paper we illustrate and underline
the importance of making detailed linguis-
tic information a central part of the pro-
cess of automatic acquisition of large-scale
lexicons as a means for enhancing robust-
ness and at the same time ensuring main-
tainability and re-usability of deep lexi-
calised grammars. Using the error mining
techniques proposed in (van Noord, 2004)
we show very convincingly that the main
hindrance to portability of deep lexicalised
grammars to domains other than the ones
originally developed in, as well as to ro-
bustness of systems using such grammars
is low lexical coverage. To this effect,
we develop linguistically-driven methods
that use detailed morphosyntactic informa-
tion to automatically enhance the perfor-
mance of deep lexicalised grammars main-
taining at the same time their usually al-
ready achieved high linguistic quality.
