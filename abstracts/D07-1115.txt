Recognizing polarity requires a list of po-
lar words and phrases. For the purpose of
building such lexicon automatically, a lot of
studies have investigated (semi-) unsuper-
vised method of learning polarity of words
and phrases. In this paper, we explore to
use structural clues that can extract polar
sentences from Japanese HTML documents,
and build lexicon from the extracted po-
lar sentences. The key idea is to develop
the structural clues so that it achieves ex-
tremely high precision at the cost of recall.
In order to compensate for the low recall,
we used massive collection of HTML docu-
ments. Thus, we could prepare enough polar
sentence corpus.
