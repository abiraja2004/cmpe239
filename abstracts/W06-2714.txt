We present the Heart of Gold mid-
dleware by demonstrating three XML-
based integration scenarios where multi-
dimensional markup produced online by
multilingual natural language processing
(NLP) components is combined to deliver
rich, robust linguistic markup for use in
NLP-based applications like information
extraction, question answering and seman-
tic web. The scenarios include (1) robust
deep-shallow integration, (2) shallow pro-
cessing cascades, and (3) treebank storage
of multi-dimensionally annotated texts.
