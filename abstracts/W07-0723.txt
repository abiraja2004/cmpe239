 
We present results and experiences from 
our experiments with phrase-based statisti-
cal machine translation using Moses. The 
paper is based on the idea of using an off-
the-shelf parser to supply linguistic infor-
mation to a factored translation model and 
compare the results of German?English 
translation to the shared task baseline sys-
tem based on word form. We report partial 
results for this model and results for two 
simplified setups. Our best setup takes ad-
vantage of the parser?s lemmatization and 
decompounding. A qualitative analysis of 
compound translation shows that decom-
pounding improves translation quality.
