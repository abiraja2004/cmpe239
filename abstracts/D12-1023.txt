Comprehension and corpus studies have found
that the tendency to minimize dependency
length has a strong influence on constituent or-
dering choices. In this paper, we investigate
dependency length minimization in the con-
text of discriminative realization ranking, fo-
cusing on its potential to eliminate egregious
ordering errors as well as better match the dis-
tributional characteristics of sentence order-
ings in news text. We find that with a state-
of-the-art, comprehensive realization rank-
ing model, dependency length minimization
yields statistically significant improvements
in BLEU scores and significantly reduces
the number of heavy/light ordering errors.
Through distributional analyses, we also show
that with simpler ranking models, dependency
length minimization can go overboard, too of-
ten sacrificing canonical word order to shorten
dependencies, while richer models manage to
better counterbalance the dependency length
minimization preference against (sometimes)
competing canonical word order preferences.
