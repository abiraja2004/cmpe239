Techniques that compare short text seg-
ments using dependency paths (or simply,
paths) appear in a wide range of automated
language processing applications including
question answering (QA). However, few
models in ad hoc information retrieval (IR)
use paths for document ranking due to
the prohibitive cost of parsing a retrieval
collection. In this paper, we introduce a
flexible notion of paths that describe chains
of words on a dependency path. These
chains, or catenae, are readily applied in
standard IR models. Informative catenae
are selected using supervised machine
learning with linguistically informed fea-
tures and compared to both non-linguistic
terms and catenae selected heuristically
with filters derived from work on paths.
Automatically selected catenae of 1-2
words deliver significant performance
gains on three TREC collections.
