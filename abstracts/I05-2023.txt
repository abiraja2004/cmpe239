In this paper, a novel kernel-based
method is presented for the problem
of relation extraction between named
entities from Chinese texts. The ker-
nel is defined over the original Chi-
nese string representations around par-
ticular entities. As a kernel func-
tion, the Improved-Edit-Distance (IED)
is used to calculate the similarity be-
tween two Chinese strings. By em-
ploying the Voted Perceptron and Sup-
port Vector Machine (SVM) kernel ma-
chines with the IED kernel as the clas-
sifiers, we tested the method by extract-
ing person-affiliation relation from Chi-
nese texts. By comparing with tradi-
tional feature-based learning methods,
we conclude that our method needs less
manual efforts in feature transformation
and achieves a better performance.
