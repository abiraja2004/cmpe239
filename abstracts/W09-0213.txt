We address the problem of classifying
multiword expression tokens in running
text. We focus our study on Verb-Noun
Constructions (VNC) that vary in their id-
iomaticity depending on context. VNC
tokens are classified as either idiomatic
or literal. Our approach hinges upon
the assumption that a literal VNC will
have more in common with its component
words than an idiomatic one. Commonal-
ity is measured by contextual overlap. To
this end, we set out to explore different
contextual variations and different similar-
ity measures handling the sparsity in the
possible contexts via four different param-
eter variations. Our approach yields state
of the art performance with an overall ac-
curacy of 75.54% on a TEST data set.
