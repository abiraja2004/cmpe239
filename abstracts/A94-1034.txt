 
We attack the problem of aligning words from pairs of 
bilingual sentences, rather than the well-known, and 
somewhat easier, problem of aligning sentences. The 
method that we develop is based on the use of bilingual 
dictionaries, having supposed that lemmatization has 
taken place. We first show that this method performs 
poorly in terms of silence and noise. To improve its 
performance we introduce syntactic dependency 
relations between the words in each of the two 
sentences considered. In this sense the syntagmatic 
level comes to the rescue of the paradigmatic level at 
which the alignment actually takes place.
