The CoNLL-2010 Shared Task was dedi-
cated to the detection of uncertainty cues
and their linguistic scope in natural lan-
guage texts. The motivation behind this
task was that distinguishing factual and
uncertain information in texts is of essen-
tial importance in information extraction.
This paper provides a general overview
of the shared task, including the annota-
tion protocols of the training and evalua-
tion datasets, the exact task definitions, the
evaluation metrics employed and the over-
all results. The paper concludes with an
analysis of the prominent approaches and
an overview of the systems submitted to
the shared task.
