This paper describes a system for navigat-
ing large collections of information about
cultural heritage which is applied to Eu-
ropeana, the European Library. Euro-
peana contains over 20 million artefacts
with meta-data in a wide range of Euro-
pean languages. The system currently pro-
vides access to Europeana content with
meta-data in English and Spanish. The pa-
per describes how Natural Language Pro-
cessing is used to enrich and organise this
meta-data to assist navigation through Eu-
ropeana and shows how this information is
used within the system.
