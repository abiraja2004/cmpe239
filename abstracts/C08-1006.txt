 
Our goal is to use natural language proc-
essing to identify deceptive and non-
deceptive passages in transcribed narra-
tives.  We begin by motivating an analy-
sis of language-based deception that 
relies on specific linguistic indicators to 
discover deceptive statements.  The indi-
cator tags are assigned to a document us-
ing a mix of automated and manual 
methods.  Once the tags are assigned, an 
interpreter automatically discriminates 
between deceptive and truthful state-
ments based on tag densities.  The texts 
used in our study come entirely from 
?real world? sources?criminal state-
ments, police interrogations and legal tes-
timony.  The corpus was hand-tagged for 
the truth value of all propositions that 
could be externally verified as true or 
false. Classification and Regression Tree 
techniques suggest that the approach is 
feasible, with the model able to identify 
74.9% of the T/F propositions correctly. 
Implementation of an automatic tagger 
with a large subset of tags performed 
well on test data, producing an average 
score of 68.6% recall and 85.3% preci-
