This paper describes the statistical ma-
chine translation (SMT) systems devel-
oped at RWTH Aachen University for
the translation task of the ACL 2013
Eighth Workshop on Statistical Machine
Translation (WMT 2013). We partici-
pated in the evaluation campaign for the
French-English and German-English lan-
guage pairs in both translation directions.
Both hierarchical and phrase-based SMT
systems are applied. A number of dif-
ferent techniques are evaluated, including
hierarchical phrase reordering, translation
model interpolation, domain adaptation
techniques, weighted phrase extraction,
word class language model, continuous
space language model and system combi-
nation. By application of these methods
we achieve considerable improvements
over the respective baseline systems.
