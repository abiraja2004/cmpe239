  
We examine the role of temporal connec- 
tives in multi-sentence discourse. In cer- 
tain contexts, sentences containing tempo- 
ral connectives that are equivalent in tem- 
porai structure can fail to be equivalent in 
terms of discourse coherence. We account 
for this by offering a novel, formal mech- 
anism for accommodating the presupposi- 
tions in temporal subordinate clauses. This 
mechanism encompasses both accommoda- 
tion by discourse aftachme,f and accom- 
modation by temporal addition. As such, 
it offers a precise and systematic model of 
interactions between presupposed material, 
discourse context, and the reader's back- 
ground knowledge. We show how the re- 
sults of accommodation help to determine 
a discou~e's coherence.
