We are interested in extracting social net-
works from text. We present a novel an-
notation scheme for a new type of event,
called social event, in which two people
participate such that at least one of them
is cognizant of the other. We compare
our scheme in detail to the ACE scheme.
We perform a detailed analysis of inter-
annotator agreement, which shows that
our annotations are reliable.
