 
This paper presents apartial solution to a com- 
ponent of the problem of lexical choice: choos- 
ing the synonym most typical, or expected, in 
context. We apply a new statistical approach 
to representing the context of a word through 
lexical co-occurrence networks. The imple- 
mentation was trained and evaluated on a large 
corpus, and results show that the inclusion of 
second-order co-occurrence r lations improves 
the performance of our implemented lexical 
choice program.
