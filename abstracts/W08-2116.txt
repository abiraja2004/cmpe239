Pictorial communication systems convert
natural language text into pictures to as-
sist people with limited literacy. We define
a novel and challenging problem: picture
layout optimization. Given an input sen-
tence, we seek the optimal way to lay out
word icons such that the resulting picture
best conveys the meaning of the input sen-
tence. To this end, we propose a family
of intuitive ?ABC? layouts, which organize
icons in three groups. We formalize layout
optimization as a sequence labeling prob-
lem, employing conditional random fields
as our machine learning method. Enabled
by novel applications of semantic role la-
beling and syntactic parsing, our trained
model makes layout predictions that agree
well with human annotators. In addition,
we conduct a user study to compare our
ABC layout versus the standard linear lay-
out. The study shows that our semantically
enhanced layout is preferred by non-native
speakers, suggesting it has the potential to
be useful for people with other forms of
limited literacy, too.
