 
This paper briefly describes the current implementa- 
tion status of an intelligent information retrieval sys- 
tem, MARIE, that employs natural language process- 
ing techniques. Descriptive captions are used to iden- 
tify photographic images concerning various military 
projects. The captions are parsed to produce a logical 
form from which nouns and verbs are extracted to 
form the primary keywords. User queries are also 
specified in natural language. A two-phase search pro- 
cess employing coarse-grain and fine-grain match pro- 
cesses is used to find the captions that best match the 
query. A type hierarchy based on object-oriented pro- 
gramming constructs i used to represent the semantic 
knowledge base. This knowledge base contains 
knowledge of various military concepts and terminol- 
ogy with specifics from the Naval Weapons Center. 
Methods are used for creating the logical form during 
semantic analysis, generating the keywords to be used 
in the coarse-grain match process, and fine-grain 
matching between query and caption logical forms.
