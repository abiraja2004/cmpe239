We reveal a previously unnoticed connection
between dependency parsing and statistical
machine translation (SMT), by formulating
the dependency parsing task as a problem of
word alignment. Furthermore, we show that
two well known models for these respective
tasks (DMV and the IBM models) share com-
mon modeling assumptions. This motivates us
to develop an alignment-based framework for
unsupervised dependency parsing. The frame-
work (which will be made publicly available)
is flexible, modular and easy to extend. Us-
ing this framework, we implement several al-
gorithms based on the IBM alignment mod-
els, which prove surprisingly effective on the
dependency parsing task, and demonstrate the
potential of the alignment-based approach.
