 Semantic inference is a core component of many natural language applications. In re-sponse, several researchers have developed algorithms for automatically learning infer-ence rules from textual corpora. However, these rules are often either imprecise or un-derspecified in directionality. In this paper we propose an algorithm called LEDIR that filters incorrect inference rules and identi-fies the directionality of correct ones. Based on an extension to Harris?s distribu-tional hypothesis, we use selectional pref-erences to gather evidence of inference di-rectionality and plausibility. Experiments show empirical evidence that our approach can classify inference rules significantly better than several baselines. 1
