 
Zipf?s law states that the frequency of 
word tokens in a large corpus of natural 
language is inversely proportional to the 
rank. The law is investigated for two 
languages English and Mandarin and for n-
gram word phrases as well as for single 
words. The law for single words is shown 
to be valid only for high frequency words. 
However, when single word and n-gram 
phrases are combined together in one list 
and put in order of frequency the combined 
list follows Zipf?s law accurately for all 
words and phrases, down to the lowest 
frequencies in both languages. The Zipf 
curves for the two languages are then 
almost identical.
