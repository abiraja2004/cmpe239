Named entity recognition (NER) is a subtask
of information extraction (IE) which can be
used further on for different purposes. In this
paper, we discuss named entity recognition
for Ukrainian language, which is a Slavonic
language with a rich morphology. The ap-
proach we follow uses a restricted number of
features. We show that it is feasible to boost
performance by considering several heuris-
tics and patterns acquired from the Web data.
