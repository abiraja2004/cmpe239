This paper demonstrates a new method for
leveraging free-text annotations to infer se-
mantic properties of documents. Free-text an-
notations are becoming increasingly abundant,
due to the recent dramatic growth in semi-
structured, user-generated online content. An
example of such content is product reviews,
which are often annotated by their authors
with pros/cons keyphrases such as ?a real bar-
gain? or ?good value.? To exploit such noisy
annotations, we simultaneously find a hid-
den paraphrase structure of the keyphrases, a
model of the document texts, and the underly-
ing semantic properties that link the two. This
allows us to predict properties of unannotated
documents. Our approach is implemented as
a hierarchical Bayesian model with joint in-
ference, which increases the robustness of the
keyphrase clustering and encourages the doc-
ument model to correlate with semantically
meaningful properties. We perform several
evaluations of our model, and find that it sub-
stantially outperforms alternative approaches.
