 
When an idiomatic expression is encountered uring 
natural anguage processing, the ambiguity between its 
idiomatic ~md non-idiomatic meaning has to be resolved. 
Rather than including both meanings in further process- 
ing, a conventionality-principle could be applied. This 
results in best-first processing of the idiomatic analysis. 
Two models are discussed fot the lexical representation f 
idioms. One extends the notion continuation class from 
two-level morphology, the other is a localist, connec- 
tionist model. The connectionist model has an important 
advantage over the continuation class model: the conven- 
tionality principle follows naturally from the architecture 
of the conneetionist model. 
Keywords: idiom processing, ambiguity resulution, two- 
level morphology, conneetionism.
