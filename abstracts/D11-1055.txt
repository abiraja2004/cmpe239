We consider the problem of predicting mea-
surable responses to scientific articles based
primarily on their text content. Specif-
ically, we consider papers in two fields
(economics and computational linguistics)
and make predictions about downloads and
within-community citations. Our approach is
based on generalized linear models, allowing
interpretability; a novel extension that cap-
tures first-order temporal effects is also pre-
sented. We demonstrate that text features
significantly improve accuracy of predictions
over metadata features like authors, topical
categories, and publication venues.
