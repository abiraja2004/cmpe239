This paper studies the problem of im-
posing a known hierarchical structure
onto an unstructured spoken document,
aiming to help browse such archives.
We formulate our solutions within a
dynamic-programming-based alignment
framework and use minimum error-
rate training to combine a number of
global and hierarchical constraints. This
pragmatic approach is computationally
efficient. Results show that it outperforms
a baseline that ignores the hierarchical
and global features and the improvement
is consistent on transcripts with different
WERs. Directly imposing such hierar-
chical structures onto raw speech without
using transcripts yields competitive
results.
