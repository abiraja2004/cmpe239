We present a novel annotation scheme for
cross-cultural argumentation and persuasion
dialogues. This scheme is an adaptation of
existing coding schemes on negotiation, fol-
lowing a review of literature on cross-cultural
differences in negotiation styles. The scheme
has been refined through application to cod-
ing both two-party and multi-party negotia-
tion dialogues in three different domains, and
is general enough to be applicable to differ-
ent domains with few if any extensions. Di-
alogues annotated with the scheme have been
used to successfully learn culture-specific di-
alogue policies for argumentation and persua-
sion.
