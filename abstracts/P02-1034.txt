This paper introduces new learning al-
gorithms for natural language processing
based on the perceptron algorithm. We
show how the algorithms can be efficiently
applied to exponential sized representa-
tions of parse trees, such as the ?all sub-
trees? (DOP) representation described by
(Bod 1998), or a representation tracking
all sub-fragments of a tagged sentence.
We give experimental results showing sig-
nificant improvements on two tasks: pars-
ing Wall Street Journal text, and named-
entity extraction from web data.
