The Natural Language Toolkit is a suite of program mod-
ules, data sets, tutorials and exercises, covering symbolic
and statistical natural language processing. NLTK is
written in Python and distributed under the GPL open
source license. Over the past three years, NLTK has
become popular in teaching and research. We describe
the toolkit and report on its current state of development.
