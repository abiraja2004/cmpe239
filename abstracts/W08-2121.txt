The Conference on Computational Natu-
ral Language Learning is accompanied ev-
ery year by a shared task whose purpose
is to promote natural language processing
applications and evaluate them in a stan-
dard setting. In 2008 the shared task was
dedicated to the joint parsing of syntactic
and semantic dependencies. This shared
task not only unifies the shared tasks of
the previous four years under a unique
dependency-based formalism, but also ex-
tends them significantly: this year?s syn-
tactic dependencies include more informa-
tion such as named-entity boundaries; the
semantic dependencies model roles of both
verbal and nominal predicates. In this pa-
per, we define the shared task and describe
how the data sets were created. Further-
more, we report and analyze the results and
describe the approaches of the participat-
ing systems.
