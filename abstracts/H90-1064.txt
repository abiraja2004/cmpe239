 
The Lincoln robust HMM recognizer has been con- 
verted from a single Ganssian or Gaussian mixture pdf 
per state to tied mixtures in which a single set of Gaus- 
sians is shared between all states. There were some 
initial difficulties caused by the use of mixture pruning 
\[12\] but these were cured by using observation pruning. 
Fixed weight smoothing of the mixture weights allowed 
the use of word-boundary-context-dependent triphone 
models for both speaker-dependent (SD) and speaker- 
independent (SI) recognition. A second-differential ob- 
servation stream further improved SI performance but 
not SD performance. The overall recognition perfor- 
mance for both SI and SD training is equivalent o 
the best reported according to the October 89 Resource 
Management test set. A new form of phonetic context 
model, the semiphone, is also introduced. This new 
model significantly reduces the number of states required 
to model a vocabulary.
