We propose a method for modeling pronunci-
ation variation in the context of spell checking
for non-native writers of English. Spell check-
ers, typically developed for native speakers,
fail to address many of the types of spelling
errors peculiar to non-native speakers, espe-
cially those errors influenced by differences in
phonology. Our model of pronunciation varia-
tion is used to extend a pronouncing dictionary
for use in the spelling correction algorithm
developed by Toutanova and Moore (2002),
which includes models for both orthography
and pronunciation. The pronunciation vari-
ation modeling is shown to improve perfor-
mance for misspellings produced by Japanese
writers of English.
