We query Web Image search engines with
words (e.g., spring) but need images that
correspond to particular senses of the word
(e.g., flexible coil). Querying with poly-
semous words often yields unsatisfactory
results from engines such as Google Im-
ages. We build an image search engine,
IDIOM, which improves the quality of re-
turned images by focusing search on the
desired sense. Our algorithm, instead of
searching for the original query, searches
for multiple, automatically chosen trans-
lations of the sense in several languages.
Experimental results show that IDIOM out-
performs Google Images and other com-
peting algorithms returning 22% more rel-
evant images.
