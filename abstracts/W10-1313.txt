 
This paper presents factors in designing a sys-
tem for automatically skimming text docu-
ments in response to a question. The system 
will take a potentially complex question and a 
single document and return a Web page con-
taining links to text related to the question. 
The goal is that these text areas be those that 
visual readers would spend the most time on 
when skimming for the answer to a question. 
To identify these areas, we had visual readers 
skim for an answer to a complex question 
while being tracked by an eye-tracking sys-
tem. Analysis of these results indicates that 
text with semantic connections to the question 
are of interest, but these connections are much 
looser than can be identified with traditional 
Question-Answering or Information Retrieval 
techniques. Instead, we are expanding tradi-
tional semantic treatments by using a Web 
search. The goal of this system is to give non-
visual readers information similar to what vis-
ual readers get when skimming through a 
document in response to a question.
