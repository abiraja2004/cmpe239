We introduce an interactive visualization com-
ponent for the JoBimText project. JoBim-
Text is an open source platform for large-scale
distributional semantics based on graph rep-
resentations. First we describe the underly-
ing technology for computing a distributional
thesaurus on words using bipartite graphs of
words and context features, and contextualiz-
ing the list of semantically similar words to-
wards a given sentential context using graph-
based ranking. Then we demonstrate the ca-
pabilities of this contextualized text expan-
sion technology in an interactive visualization.
The visualization can be used as a semantic
parser providing contextualized expansions of
words in text as well as disambiguation to
word senses induced by graph clustering, and
is provided as an open source tool.
