This paper presents a novel approach in Sen-
timent Polarity Detection on Twitter posts, by
extracting a vector of weighted nodes from the
graph of WordNet. These weights are used
on SentiWordNet to compute a final estima-
tion of the polarity. Therefore, the method
proposes a non-supervised solution that is
domain-independent. The evaluation over a
generated corpus of tweets shows that this
technique is promising.
