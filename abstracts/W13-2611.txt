We describe a method for learning an in-
cremental semantic grammar from data in
which utterances are paired with logical
forms representing their meaning. Work-
ing in an inherently incremental frame-
work, Dynamic Syntax, we show how
words can be associated with probabilistic
procedures for the incremental projection
of meaning, providing a grammar which
can be used directly in incremental prob-
abilistic parsing and generation. We test
this on child-directed utterances from the
CHILDES corpus, and show that it results
in good coverage and semantic accuracy,
without requiring annotation at the word
level or any independent notion of syntax.
