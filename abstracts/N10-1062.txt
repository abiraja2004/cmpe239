Typical statistical machine translation sys-
tems are trained with static parallel corpora.
Here we account for scenarios with a continu-
ous incoming stream of parallel training data.
Such scenarios include daily governmental
proceedings, sustained output from transla-
tion agencies, or crowd-sourced translations.
We show incorporating recent sentence pairs
from the stream improves performance com-
pared with a static baseline. Since frequent
batch retraining is computationally demand-
ing we introduce a fast incremental alternative
using an online version of the EM algorithm.
To bound our memory requirements we use
a novel data-structure and associated training
regime. When compared to frequent batch re-
training, our online time and space-bounded
model achieves the same performance with
significantly less computational overhead.
