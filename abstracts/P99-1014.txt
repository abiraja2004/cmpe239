 
We present a technique for automatic induction 
of slot annotations for subcategorization frames, 
based on induction of hidden classes in the EM 
framework of statistical estimation. The models 
are empirically evalutated by a general decision 
test. Induction of slot labeling for subcategoriza- 
tion frames is accomplished by a further applica- 
tion of EM, and applied experimentally onframe 
observations derived from parsing large corpora. 
We outline an interpretation of the learned rep- 
resentations a theoretical-linguistic decomposi- 
tional lexical entries.
