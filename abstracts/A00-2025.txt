 
Automatic generation of text summaries for spoken 
language faces the problem of containing incorrect 
words and passages due to speech recognition er- 
rors. This paper describes comparative experiments 
where passages with higher speech recognizer confi- 
dence scores are favored in the ranking process. Re- 
sults show that a relative word error rate reduction 
of over 10% can be achieved while at the same time 
the accuracy of the summary improves markedly.
