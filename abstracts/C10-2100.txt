We propose a method for the task of iden-
tifying the general positions of users in
online debates, i.e., support or oppose the
main topic of an online debate, by ex-
ploiting local information in their remarks
within the debate. An online debate is
a forum where each user post an opin-
ion on a particular topic while other users
state their positions by posting their re-
marks within the debate. The supporting
or opposing remarks are made by directly
replying to the opinion, or indirectly to
other remarks (to express local agreement
or disagreement), which makes the task of
identifying users? general positions diffi-
cult. A prior study has shown that a link-
based method, which completely ignores
the content of the remarks, can achieve
higher accuracy for the identification task
than methods based solely on the contents
of the remarks. In this paper, we show
that utilizing the textual content of the
remarks into the link-based method can
yield higher accuracy in the identification
task.
