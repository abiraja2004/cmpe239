In this paper DiaGen is presented, a tool that
provides support in generating code for em-
bedded dialogue applications. By aid of it, the
dialogue development process is speeded up
considerably. At the same time it is guaran-
teed that only well-formed and well-defined
constructs are used. Having had its roots in
the EU-funded project GEMINI, fundamen-
tal changes were necessary to adopt it to the
requirements of the application environment.
Additionally within this paper the basics of
embedded speech dialogue systems are cov-
ered.
