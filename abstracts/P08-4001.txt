This is a demonstration of a voice di-
aler, implemented as a partially observable
Markov decision process (POMDP). A real-
time graphical display shows the POMDP?s
probability distribution over different possi-
ble dialog states, and shows how system out-
put is generated and selected. The system
demonstrated here includes several recent ad-
vances, including an action selection mecha-
nism which unifies a hand-crafted controller
and reinforcement learning. The voice dialer
itself is in use today in AT&T Labs and re-
ceives daily calls.
