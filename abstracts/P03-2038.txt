We will demonstrate the latest version of
an ongoing project to create an intelli-
gent procedure assistant for use by as-
tronauts on the International Space Sta-
tion (ISS). The system functionality in-
cludes spoken dialogue control of nav-
igation, coordinated display of the pro-
cedure text, display of related pictures,
alarms, and recording and playback of
voice notes. The demo also exempli-
fies several interesting component tech-
nologies. Speech recognition and lan-
guage understanding have been devel-
oped using the Open Source REGULUS
2 toolkit. This implements an approach
to portable grammar-based language mod-
elling in which all models are derived
from a single linguistically motivated uni-
fication grammar. Domain-specific CFG
language models are produced by first
specialising the grammar using an au-
tomatic corpus-based method, and then
compiling the resulting specialised gram-
mars into CFG form. Translation between
language centered and domain centered
semantic representations is carried out by
ALTERF, another Open Source toolkit,
which combines rule-based and corpus-
based processing in a transparent way.
