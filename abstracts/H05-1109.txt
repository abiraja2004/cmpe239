We present a lexicon-free post-processing
method for optical character recognition
(OCR), implemented using weighted fi-
nite state machines. We evaluate the
technique in a number of scenarios rele-
vant for natural language processing, in-
cluding creation of new OCR capabilities
for low density languages, improvement
of OCR performance for a native com-
mercial system, acquisition of knowledge
from a foreign-language dictionary, cre-
ation of a parallel text, and machine trans-
lation from OCR output.
