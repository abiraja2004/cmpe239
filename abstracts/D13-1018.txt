In this paper we present a minimally-
supervised approach to the multi-domain ac-
quisition of wide-coverage glossaries. We start
from a small number of hypernymy rela-
tion seeds and bootstrap glossaries from the
Web for dozens of domains using Probabilis-
tic Topic Models. Our experiments show that
we are able to extract high-precision glos-
saries comprising thousands of terms and def-
initions.
