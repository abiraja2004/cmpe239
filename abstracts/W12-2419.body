Block-LDA is a topic modeling approach to
perform data fusion between entity-annotated
text documents and graphs with entity-entity
links. We evaluate Block-LDA in the yeast bi-
ology domain by jointly modeling PubMed R?
articles and yeast protein-protein interaction
networks. The topic coherence of the emer-
gent topics and the ability of the model to re-
trieve relevant scientific articles and proteins
related to the topic are compared to that of a
text-only approach that does not make use of
the protein-protein interaction matrix. Eval-
uation of the results by biologists show that
the joint modeling results in better topic co-
herence and improves retrieval performance in
the task of identifying top related papers and
proteins.
