This paper introduces a formal framework
that presents a novel Interactive Predic-
tive Parsing schema which can be oper-
ated by a user, tightly integrated into the
system, to obtain error free trees. This
compares to the classical two-step schema
of manually post-editing the erroneus con-
stituents produced by the parsing system.
We have simulated interaction and cal-
culated evalaution metrics, which estab-
lished that an IPP system results in a high
amount of effort reduction for a manual
annotator compared to a two-step system.
