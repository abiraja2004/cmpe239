We present a new way to simplify the
construction of precise broad-coverage
grammars, employing typologically-
motivated, customizable extensions to
a language-independent core grammar.
Each ?module? represents a salient di-
mension of cross-linguistic variation,
and presents the grammar developer
with simple choices that result in auto-
matically generated language-specific
software. We illustrate the approach for
several phenomena and explore the in-
terdependence of the modules.
