Online forum discussions often contain vast
amounts of questions that are the focuses of
discussions. Extracting contexts and answers
together with the questions will yield not only
a coherent forum summary but also a valu-
able QA knowledge base. In this paper, we
propose a general framework based on Con-
ditional Random Fields (CRFs) to detect the
contexts and answers of questions from forum
threads. We improve the basic framework by
Skip-chain CRFs and 2D CRFs to better ac-
commodate the features of forums for better
performance. Experimental results show that
our techniques are very promising.
