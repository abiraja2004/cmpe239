 
Rapid advances in the biomedical field have 
resulted in the accumulation of numerous ex-
perimental results, mainly in text form. To ex-
tract knowledge from biomedical papers, or 
use the information they contain to interpret 
experimental results, requires improved tech-
niques for retrieving information from the 
biomedical literature. In many cases, since the 
information is required in gene units, recogni-
tion of the named entity is the first step in 
gathering and using knowledge encoded in 
these papers. Dictionary-based searching is 
useful for retrieving biological information in 
gene units. However, since many genes in the 
biomedical literature are written using am-
biguous names, such as family names, we 
need a way of constructing dictionaries. In our 
laboratory, we have developed a gene name 
dictionary:GENA and a family name diction-
ary. The latter contains ambiguous hierarchi-
cal gene names to compensate GENA. In 
addition, to address the problem of trivial 
gene name variations and polysemy, heuristics 
were used to search gene/protein/family 
names in MEDLINE abstracts. Using these 
algorithms to match dictionary and 
gene/protein/family names, about 95, 91, and 
89% of protein/gene/family names in abstracts 
on Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Drosophila 
melanogaster, and Homo sapiens were de-
tected with a precision of 96, 92, and 94%, in 
respective organisms. The effect of our 
gene/protein/family recognition method on 
protein-interaction and protein-function ex-
traction using these dictionaries is also dis-
cussed.
