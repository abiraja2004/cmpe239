Abstract 
The method of organization of word mean-
ings is a crucial issue with lexical databases. 
Our purpose in this research is to extract word 
hierarchies from corpora automatically. Our 
initial task to this end is to determine adjec-
tive hyperonyms. In order to find adjective 
hyperonyms, we utilize abstract nouns. We 
constructed linguistic data by extracting se-
mantic relations between abstract nouns and 
adjectives from corpus data and classifying 
abstract nouns based on adjective similarity 
using a self-organizing semantic map, which 
is a neural network model (Kohonen 1995). 
In this paper we describe how to hierarchi-
cally organize abstract nouns (adjective hy-
peronyms) in a semantic map mainly using 
CSM. We compare three hierarchical organi-
zations of abstract nouns, according to CSM, 
frequency (Tf.CSM) and an alternative simi-
larity measure based on coefficient overlap, to 
estimate hyperonym relations between words.
