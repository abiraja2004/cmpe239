We report on a novel approach to gener-
ating strategies for spoken dialogue sys-
tems. We present a series of experiments
that illustrate how an evolutionary rein-
forcement learning algorithm can produce
strategies that are both optimal and easily
inspectable by human developers. Our ex-
perimental strategies achieve a mean per-
formance of 98.9% with respect to a pre-
defined evaluation metric. Our approach
also produces a dramatic reduction in
strategy size when compared with conven-
tional reinforcement learning techniques
(87% in one experiment). We conclude
that this algorithm can be used to evolve
optimal inspectable dialogue strategies.
