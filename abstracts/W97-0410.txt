 
JANUS is a multi-lingual speech-to-speech translation 
system, which has been designed to translate sponta- 
neous spoken language in a limited domain. In this 
paper, we describe our recent preliminary efforts to ex- 
pand the domain of coverage of the system from the 
rather limited Appointment Scheduling domain, to the 
much richer Travel Planning domain. We compare the 
two domains in terms of out-of-vocabulary rates and 
linguistic omplexity. We discuss the challenges that 
these differences impose on our translation system and 
some planned changes in the design of the system. Ini- 
tial evaluations on Travel Planning data are also pre- 
sented.
