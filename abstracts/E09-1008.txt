Machine translation (MT) systems have
improved significantly; however, their out-
puts often contain too many errors to com-
municate the intended meaning to their
users. This paper describes a collabora-
tive approach for mediating between an
MT system and users who do not under-
stand the source language and thus cannot
easily detect translation mistakes on their
own. Through a visualization of multi-
ple linguistic resources, this approach en-
ables the users to correct difficult transla-
tion errors and understand translated pas-
sages that were otherwise baffling.
