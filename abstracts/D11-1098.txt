Lexical co-occurrence is an important cue for
detecting word associations. We propose a
new measure of word association based on a
new notion of statistical significance for lex-
ical co-occurrences. Existing measures typ-
ically rely on global unigram frequencies to
determine expected co-occurrence counts. In-
stead, we focus only on documents that con-
tain both terms (of a candidate word-pair) and
ask if the distribution of the observed spans of
the word-pair resembles that under a random
null model. This would imply that the words
in the pair are not related strongly enough
for one word to influence placement of the
other. However, if the words are found to oc-
cur closer together than explainable by the null
model, then we hypothesize a more direct as-
sociation between the words. Through exten-
sive empirical evaluation on most of the pub-
licly available benchmark data sets, we show
the advantages of our measure over existing
co-occurrence measures.
