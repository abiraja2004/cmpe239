We explore a range of features and ensembles
for the task of Native Language Identification
as part of the NLI Shared Task (Tetreault et al,
2013). Starting with recurring word-based n-
grams (Bykh and Meurers, 2012), we tested
different linguistic abstractions such as part-
of-speech, dependencies, and syntactic trees
as features for NLI. We also experimented
with features encoding morphological proper-
ties, the nature of the realizations of particu-
lar lemmas, and several measures of complex-
ity developed for proficiency and readabil-
ity classification (Vajjala and Meurers, 2012).
Employing an ensemble classifier incorporat-
ing all of our features we achieved an ac-
curacy of 82.2% (rank 5) in the closed task
and 83.5% (rank 1) in the open-2 task. In
the open-1 task, the word-based recurring n-
grams outperformed the ensemble, yielding
38.5% (rank 2). Overall, across all three tasks,
our best accuracy of 83.5% for the standard
TOEFL11 test set came in second place.
