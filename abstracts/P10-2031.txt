Developing features has been shown cru-
cial to advancing the state-of-the-art in Se-
mantic Role Labeling (SRL). To improve
Chinese SRL, we propose a set of ad-
ditional features, some of which are de-
signed to better capture structural infor-
mation. Our system achieves 93.49 F-
measure, a significant improvement over
the best reported performance 92.0. We
are further concerned with the effect
of parsing in Chinese SRL. We empiri-
cally analyze the two-fold effect, grouping
words into constituents and providing syn-
tactic information. We also give some pre-
liminary linguistic explanations.
