In this paper we present the system we
submitted to the WMT13 shared task on
Quality Estimation. We participated in
the Task 1.1. Each translated sentence
is given a score between 0 and 1. The
score is obtained by using several numeri-
cal or boolean features calculated accord-
ing to the source and target sentences. We
perform a linear regression of the feature
space against scores in the range [0..1]. To
this end, we use a Support Vector Machine
with 66 features. In this paper, we propose
to increase the size of the training corpus.
For that, we use the post-edited and refer-
ence corpora during the training step. We
assign a score to each sentence of these
corpora. Then, we tune these scores on a
development corpus. This leads to an im-
provement of 10.5% on the development
corpus, in terms of Mean Average Error,
but achieves only a slight improvement on
the test corpus.
