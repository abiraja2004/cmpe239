Detecting hedges and their scope in nat-
ural language text is very important for
information inference. In this paper,
we present a system based on a cascade
method for the CoNLL-2010 shared task.
The system composes of two components:
one for detecting hedges and another one
for detecting their scope. For detecting
hedges, we build a cascade subsystem.
Firstly, a conditional random field (CRF)
model and a large margin-based model are
trained respectively. Then, we train an-
other CRF model using the result of the
first phase. For detecting the scope of
hedges, a CRF model is trained according
to the result of the first subtask. The ex-
periments show that our system achieves
86.36% F-measure on biological corpus
and 55.05% F-measure on Wikipedia cor-
pus for hedge detection, and 49.95% F-
measure on biological corpus for hedge
scope detection. Among them, 86.36%
is the best result on biological corpus for
hedge detection.
