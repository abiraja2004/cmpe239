Counts from large corpora (like the web) can
be powerful syntactic cues. Past work has
used web counts to help resolve isolated am-
biguities, such as binary noun-verb PP attach-
ments and noun compound bracketings. In
this work, we first present a method for gener-
ating web count features that address the full
range of syntactic attachments. These fea-
tures encode both surface evidence of lexi-
cal affinities as well as paraphrase-based cues
to syntactic structure. We then integrate our
features into full-scale dependency and con-
stituent parsers. We show relative error re-
ductions of 7.0% over the second-order depen-
dency parser of McDonald and Pereira (2006),
9.2% over the constituent parser of Petrov et
al. (2006), and 3.4% over a non-local con-
stituent reranker.
