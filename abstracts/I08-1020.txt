We describe clustering experiments for
cross-document coreference for the first
Web People Search Evaluation. In our ex-
periments we apply agglomerative cluster-
ing to group together documents potentially
referring to the same individual. The algo-
rithm is informed by the results of two dif-
ferent summarization strategies and an off-
the-shelf named entity recognition compo-
nent. We present different configurations of
the system and show the potential of the ap-
plied techniques. We also present an analy-
sis of the impact that semantic information
and text summarization have in the cluster-
ing process.
