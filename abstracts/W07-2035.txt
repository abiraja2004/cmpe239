 
We have participated in the Multilingual 
Chinese-English Lexical Sample Task of 
SemEval-2007. Our system disambiguates 
senses of Chinese words and finds the 
correct translation in English by using the 
web as WSD knowledge source. Since all 
the statistic data is obtained from search 
engine, the method is considered to be 
unsupervised and does not require any 
sense-tagged corpus.
