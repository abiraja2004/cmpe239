The increasing flow of information be-
tween languages has led to a rise in the fre-
quency of non-native or loan words, where
terms of one language appear transliter-
ated in another. Dealing with such out
of vocabulary words is essential for suc-
cessful cross-lingual information retrieval.
For example, techniques such as stemming
should not be applied indiscriminately to
all words in a collection, and so before any
stemming, foreign words need to be iden-
tified. In this paper, we investigate three
approaches for the identification of foreign
words in Arabic text: lexicons, language
patterns, and n-grams and present that re-
sults show that lexicon-based approaches
outperform the other techniques.
