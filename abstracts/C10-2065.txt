This paper presents a novel approach to
dialogue act recognition employing multi-
level information features. In addition to
features such as context information and
words in the utterances, the recognition
task utilizes syntactic and semantic rela-
tions acquired by information extraction
methods. These features are utilized by
a Bayesian network classifier for our dia-
logue act recognition. The evaluation re-
sults show a clear improvement from the
accuracy of the baseline (only with word
features) with 61.9% to an accuracy of
67.4% achieved by the extended feature
set.
