We present an implemented system for the
resolution of it, this, and that in tran-
scribed multi-party dialog. The system han-
dles NP-anaphoric as well as discourse-
deictic anaphors, i.e. pronouns with VP an-
tecedents. Selectional preferences for NP or
VP antecedents are determined on the basis
of corpus counts. Our results show that the
system performs significantly better than a
recency-based baseline.
