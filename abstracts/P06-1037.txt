We investigate the utility of supertag infor-
mation for guiding an existing dependency
parser of German. Using weighted con-
straints to integrate the additionally avail-
able information, the decision process of
the parser is influenced by changing its
preferences, without excluding alternative
structural interpretations from being con-
sidered. The paper reports on a series of
experiments using varying models of su-
pertags that significantly increase the pars-
ing accuracy. In addition, an upper bound
on the accuracy that can be achieved with
perfect supertags is estimated.
