In this paper we present an approach to the ac-
quisition of geographical gazetteers. Instead of
creating these resources manually, we propose
to extract gazetteers from the World Wide Web,
using Data Mining techniques.
The bootstrapping approach, investigated in
our study, allows us to create new gazetteers
using only a small seed dataset (1260 words).
In addition to gazetteers, the system pro-
duces classifiers. They can be used online to
determine a class (CITY, ISLAND, RIVER,
MOUNTAIN, REGION, COUNTRY) of any
geographical name. Our classifiers perform
with the average accuracy of 86.5%.
