We should not have to look at the en-
tire corpus (e.g., the Web) to know if two
words are associated or not.1 A powerful
sampling technique called Sketches was
originally introduced to remove duplicate
Web pages. We generalize sketches to
estimate contingency tables and associa-
tions, using a maximum likelihood esti-
mator to find the most likely contingency
table given the sample, the margins (doc-
ument frequencies) and the size of the
collection. Not unsurprisingly, computa-
tional work and statistical accuracy (vari-
ance or errors) depend on sampling rate,
as will be shown both theoretically and
empirically. Sampling methods become
more and more important with larger and
larger collections. At Web scale, sampling
rates as low as 10?4 may suffice.
