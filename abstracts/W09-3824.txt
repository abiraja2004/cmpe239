This paper presents preliminary investiga-
tions on the statistical parsing of French by
bringing a complete evaluation on French
data of the main probabilistic lexicalized
and unlexicalized parsers first designed
on the Penn Treebank. We adapted the
parsers on the two existing treebanks of
French (Abeill? et al, 2003; Schluter and
van Genabith, 2007). To our knowledge,
mostly all of the results reported here are
state-of-the-art for the constituent parsing
of French on every available treebank. Re-
garding the algorithms, the comparisons
show that lexicalized parsing models are
outperformed by the unlexicalized Berke-
ley parser. Regarding the treebanks, we
observe that, depending on the parsing
model, a tag set with specific features
has direct influence over evaluation re-
sults. We show that the adapted lexical-
ized parsers do not share the same sensi-
tivity towards the amount of lexical ma-
terial used for training, thus questioning
the relevance of using only one lexicalized
model to study the usefulness of lexical-
ization for the parsing of French.
