We perform a series of 3-class sentiment clas-
sification experiments on a set of 2,624 tweets
produced during the run-up to the Irish Gen-
eral Elections in February 2011. Even though
tweets that have been labelled as sarcastic
have been omitted from this set, it still rep-
resents a difficult test set and the highest
accuracy we achieve is 61.6% using super-
vised learning and a feature set consisting
of subjectivity-lexicon-based scores, Twitter-
specific features and the top 1,000 most dis-
criminative words. This is superior to various
naive unsupervised approaches which use sub-
jectivity lexicons to compute an overall senti-
ment score for a <tweet,political party> pair.
