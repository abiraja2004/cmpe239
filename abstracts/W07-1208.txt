This paper proposes a design strategy
for deep language processing grammars
to appropriately handle language vari-
ants. It allows a grammar to be re-
stricted as to what language variant it is
tuned to, but also to detect the variant
a given input pertains to. This is eval-
uated and compared to results obtained
with an alternative strategy by which the
relevant variant is detected with current
language identification methods in a pre-
processing step.
