In this work, we present an approach for
multilingual portability of Spoken Lan-
guage Understanding systems. The goal
of this approach is to avoid the effort of ac-
quiring and labeling new corpora to learn
models when changing the language. The
work presented in this paper is focused on
the learning of a specific translator for the
task and the mechanism of transmitting the
information among the modules by means
of graphs. These graphs represent a set of
hypotheses (a language) that is the input
to the statistical semantic decoder that pro-
vides the meaning of the sentence. Some
experiments in a Spanish task evaluated
with input French utterances and text are
presented. They show the good behavior
of the system, mainly when speech input
is considered.
