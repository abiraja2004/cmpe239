Tree-to-string translation rules are widely
used in linguistically syntax-based statis-
tical machine translation systems. In this
paper, we propose to use deep syntac-
tic information for obtaining fine-grained
translation rules. A head-driven phrase
structure grammar (HPSG) parser is used
to obtain the deep syntactic information,
which includes a fine-grained description
of the syntactic property and a semantic
representation of a sentence. We extract
fine-grained rules from aligned HPSG
tree/forest-string pairs and use them in
our tree-to-string and string-to-tree sys-
tems. Extensive experiments on large-
scale bidirectional Japanese-English trans-
lations testified the effectiveness of our ap-
proach.
