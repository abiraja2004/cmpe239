. In order to obtain a high precision and high coverage grammar, we 
proposed a model to measure grammar coverage and designed a PCFG parser to 
measure efficiency of the grammar. To generalize grammars, a grammar binari-
zation method was proposed to increase the coverage of a probabilistic context-
free grammar. In the mean time linguistically-motivated feature constraints 
were added into grammar rules to maintain precision of the grammar. The gen-
eralized grammar increases grammar coverage from 93% to 99% and bracket-
ing F-score from 87% to 91% in parsing Chinese sentences. To cope with error 
propagations due to word segmentation and part-of-speech tagging errors, we 
also proposed a grammar blending method to adapt to such errors. The blended 
grammar can reduce about 20~30% of parsing errors due to error assignment of 
pos made by a word segmentation system.
