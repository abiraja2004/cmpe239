We describe our grammar correction sys-
tem for the CoNLL-2013 shared task.
Our system corrects three of the five er-
ror types specified for the shared task -
noun-number, determiner and subject-verb
agreement errors. For noun-number and
determiner correction, we apply a classi-
fication approach using rich lexical and
syntactic features. For subject-verb agree-
ment correction, we propose a new rule-
based system which utilizes dependency
parse information and a set of conditional
rules to ensure agreement of the verb
group with its subject. Our system ob-
tained an F-score of 11.03 on the official
test set using the M2 evaluation method
(the official evaluation method).
