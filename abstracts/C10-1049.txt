We present an approach to model hid-
den attributes in the compositional se-
mantics of adjective-noun phrases in a
distributional model. For the represen-
tation of adjective meanings, we refor-
mulate the pattern-based approach for at-
tribute learning of Almuhareb (2006) in
a structured vector space model (VSM).
This model is complemented by a struc-
tured vector space representing attribute
dimensions of noun meanings. The com-
bination of these representations along the
lines of compositional semantic principles
exposes the underlying semantic relations
in adjective-noun phrases. We show that
our compositional VSM outperforms sim-
ple pattern-based approaches by circum-
venting their inherent sparsity problems.
