 
This paper presents a new term extraction ap-
proach using relevance between term candi-
dates calculated by a link analysis based 
method. Different types of relevance are used 
separately or jointly for term verification. The 
proposed approach requires no prior domain 
knowledge and no adaptation for new domains. 
Consequently, the method can be used in any 
domain corpus and it is especially useful for 
resource-limited domains. Evaluations con-
ducted on two different domains for Chinese 
term extraction show significant improve-
ments over existing techniques and also verify 
the efficiency and relative domain independent 
nature of the approach.
