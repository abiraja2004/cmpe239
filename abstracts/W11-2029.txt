 
This paper reports on an experiment that 
investigates clarification subdialogues in 
intentionally noisy speech recognition. 
The architecture learns weights for mix-
tures of grounding strategies from exam-
ples provided by a human wizard 
embedded in the system. Results indicate 
that the architecture learns to eliminate 
misunderstandings reliably despite high 
word error rate.
