The task of Named Entity Recognition
(NER) is to identify in text predefined
units of information such as person names,
organizations and locations. In this work,
we address the problem of NER in Esto-
nian using supervised learning approach.
We explore common issues related to
building a NER system such as the us-
age of language-agnostic and language-
specific features, the representation of
named entity tags, the required corpus size
and the need for linguistic tools. For
system training and evaluation purposes,
we create a gold standard NER corpus.
On this corpus, our CRF-based system
achieves an overall F1-score of 87%.
