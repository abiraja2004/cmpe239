This paper presents the application of
WordNet-based semantic relatedness mea-
sures to Automatic Speech Recognition
(ASR) in multi-party meetings. Differ-
ent word-utterance context relatedness mea-
sures and utterance-coherence measures are
defined and applied to the rescoring of N -
best lists. No significant improvements
in terms of Word-Error-Rate (WER) are
achieved compared to a large word-based n-
gram baseline model. We discuss our results
and the relation to other work that achieved
an improvement with such models for sim-
pler tasks.
