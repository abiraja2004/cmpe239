Most statistical translation systems are
based on phrase translation pairs, or
?blocks?, which are obtained mainly from
word alignment. We use blocks to infer
better word alignment and improved word
alignment which, in turn, leads to better
inference of blocks. We propose two new
probabilistic models based on the inner-
outer segmentations and use EM algorithms
for estimating the models? parameters. The
first model recovers IBM Model-1 as a spe-
cial case. Both models outperform bi-
directional IBM Model-4 in terms of word
alignment accuracy by 10% absolute on the
F-measure. Using blocks obtained from
the models in actual translation systems
yields statistically significant improvements
in Chinese-English SMT evaluation.
