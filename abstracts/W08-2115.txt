 
Catchwords refer to those popular words 
or phrases in a time period. In this paper, 
we propose a novel approach for 
automatic extraction of Chinese 
catchwords. By analyzing features of 
catchwords, we define three aspects to 
describe Popular Degree of catchwords. 
Then we use curve fitting in Time Series 
Analysis to build Popular Degree Curves 
of the extracted terms. Finally we give a 
formula that can calculate Popular 
Degree values of catchwords and get a 
ranking list of catchword candidates. 
Experiments show that the method is 
effective.
