This paper describes the application of 
probabilistic  part  of  speech taggers  to 
the  Dzongkha  language.  A  tag  set 
containing 66 tags is designed, which is 
based  on  the  Penn  Treebank1.  A 
training  corpus  of  40,247  tokens  is 
utilized  to  train  the  model.  Using  the 
lexicon  extracted  from  the  training 
corpus and lexicon from the available 
word  list,  we  used  two  statistical 
taggers  for  comparison  reasons.  The 
best  result  achieved  was  93.1% 
accuracy in  a  10-fold cross  validation 
on the training set. The winning tagger 
was  thereafter  applied  to annotate  a 
570,247 token corpus.
