In order to boost the translation quality of
corpus-based MT systems for speech transla-
tion, the technique of splitting an input sen-
tence appears promising. In previous re-
search, many methods used N-gram clues to
split sentences. In this paper, to supplement
N-gram based splitting methods, we introduce
another clue using sentence similarity based
on edit-distance. In our splitting method,
we generate candidates for sentence splitting
based on N-grams, and select the best one by
measuring sentence similarity. We conducted
experiments using two EBMT systems, one of
which uses a phrase and the other of which
uses a sentence as a translation unit. The
translation results on various conditions were
evaluated by objective measures and a subjec-
tive measure. The experimental results show
that the proposed method is valuable for both
systems.
