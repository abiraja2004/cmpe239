 
Several approaches have already been em-
ployed to ?sense? affective information from 
text, but none of those ever considered the 
cognitive and appraisal structure of individ-
ual emotions. Hence this paper aims at inter-
preting the cognitive theory of emotions 
known as the OCC emotion model, from a 
linguistic standpoint. The paper provides 
rules for the OCC emotion types for the task 
of sensing affective information from text. 
Since the OCC emotions are associated with 
several cognitive variables, we explain how 
the values could be assigned to those by ana-
lyzing and processing natural language com-
ponents. Empirical results indicate that our 
system outperforms another state-of-the-art 
system.
