 
Automatically acquiring synonymous words 
(synonyms) from corpora is a challenging task. 
For this task, methods that use only one kind 
of resources are inadequate because of low 
precision or low recall. To improve the per-
formance of synonym extraction, we propose 
a method to extract synonyms with multiple 
resources including a monolingual dictionary, 
a bilingual corpus, and a large monolingual 
corpus. This approach uses an ensemble to 
combine the synonyms extracted by individ-
ual extractors which use the three resources. 
Experimental results prove that the three re-
sources are complementary to each other on 
synonym extraction, and that the ensemble 
method we used is very effective to improve 
both precisions and recalls of extracted 
synonyms.
