 
This article describes the current state 
of syntactic analysis of Estonian using 
Constraint Grammar. Constraint Gram- 
mar framework divides parsing into two 
different modules: morphological disam- 
biguation and determination of syntac- 
tic functions. This article focuses on the 
last module in detail. If the morphologi- 
cal disambiguator achieves the precision 
more than 85% and error rate is smaller 
than 2% then 80-88% of words becomes 
syntactically unambiguous. The error 
rate of parser is 1-4% depending on the 
ambiguity rate of input. The main goal 
of this work is to elaborate an efficient 
parser for Estonian and annotate the 
Corpus of Estonian Written Texts syn- 
tactically. It is the first attempt to write 
a parser for Estonian.
