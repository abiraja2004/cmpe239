We explore the task of automatically classify-
ing dialogue acts in 1-on-1 online chat forums,
an increasingly popular means of providing
customer service. In particular, we investi-
gate the effectiveness of various features and
machine learners for this task. While a sim-
ple bag-of-words approach provides a solid
baseline, we find that adding information from
dialogue structure and inter-utterance depen-
dency provides some increase in performance;
learners that account for sequential dependen-
cies (CRFs) show the best performance. We
report our results from testing using a corpus
of chat dialogues derived from online shop-
ping customer-feedback data.
