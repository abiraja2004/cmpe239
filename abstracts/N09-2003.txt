Hypergraphs are used in several syntax-
inspired methods of machine translation to
compactly encode exponentially many trans-
lation hypotheses. The hypotheses closest to
given reference translations therefore cannot
be found via brute force, particularly for pop-
ular measures of closeness such as BLEU. We
develop a dynamic program for extracting the
so called oracle-best hypothesis from a hyper-
graph by viewing it as the problem of finding
the most likely hypothesis under an n-gram
language model trained from only the refer-
ence translations. We further identify and re-
move massive redundancies in the dynamic
program state due to the sparsity of n-grams
present in the reference translations, resulting
in a very efficient program. We present run-
time statistics for this program, and demon-
strate successful application of the hypothe-
ses thus found as the targets for discriminative
training of translation system components.
