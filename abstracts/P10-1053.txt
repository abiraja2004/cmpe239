Dominance links were introduced in
grammars to model long distance scram-
bling phenomena, motivating the defi-
nition of multiset-valued linear indexed
grammars (MLIGs) by Rambow (1994b),
and inspiring quite a few recent for-
malisms. It turns out that MLIGs have
since been rediscovered and reused in a
variety of contexts, and that the complex-
ity of their emptiness problem has become
the key to several open questions in com-
puter science. We survey complexity re-
sults and open issues on MLIGs and re-
lated formalisms, and provide new com-
plexity bounds for some linguistically mo-
tivated restrictions.
