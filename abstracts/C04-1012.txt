In this paper, subclasses of monadic context-
free tree grammars (CFTGs) are compared.
Since linear, nondeleting, monadic CFTGs gen-
erate the same class of string languages as
tree adjoining grammars (TAGs), it is examined
whether the restrictions of linearity and non-
deletion on monadic CFTGs are necessary to
generate the same class of languages. Epsilon-
freeness on linear, nondeleting, monadic CFTG
is also examined.
