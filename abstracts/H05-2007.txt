Abstract
We describe a method for identifying system-
atic patterns in translation data using part-of-
speech tag sequences. We incorporate this
analysis into a diagnostic tool intended for de-
velopers of machine translation systems, and
demonstrate how our application can be used
by developers to explore patterns in machine
translation output.
