 
This study aims at identifying when an 
event written in text occurs. In particular, 
we classify a sentence for an event into 
four time-slots; morning, daytime, eve-
ning, and night. To realize our goal, we 
focus on expressions associated with 
time-slot (time-associated words). How-
ever, listing up all the time-associated 
words is impractical, because there are 
numerous time-associated expressions. 
We therefore use a semi-supervised 
learning method, the Na?ve Bayes classi-
fier backed up with the Expectation 
Maximization algorithm, in order to it-
eratively extract time-associated words 
while improving the classifier. We also 
propose to use Support Vector Machines 
to filter out noisy instances that indicates 
no specific time period. As a result of ex-
periments, the proposed method achieved 
0.864 of accuracy and outperformed 
other methods.
