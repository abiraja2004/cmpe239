Current vector-space models of lexical seman-
tics create a single ?prototype? vector to rep-
resent the meaning of a word. However, due
to lexical ambiguity, encoding word mean-
ing with a single vector is problematic. This
paper presents a method that uses cluster-
ing to produce multiple ?sense-specific? vec-
tors for each word. This approach provides
a context-dependent vector representation of
word meaning that naturally accommodates
homonymy and polysemy. Experimental com-
parisons to human judgements of semantic
similarity for both isolated words as well as
words in sentential contexts demonstrate the
superiority of this approach over both proto-
type and exemplar based vector-space models.
