Sinhala, spoken in Sri Lanka as an official
language, is one of the less privileged lan-
guages; still there are no established text in-
put methods. As with many of the Asian lan-
guages, Sinhala also has a large set of char-
acters, forcing us to develop an input method
that involves a conversion process from a
key sequence to a character/word. This
paper proposes a novel word-based predic-
tive text input system named SriShell Primo.
This system allows the user to input a Sin-
hala word with a key sequence that highly
matches his/her intuition from its pronuncia-
tion. A key to this scenario is a pre-compiled
table that lists conceivable roman character
sequences utilized by a wide range of users
for representing a consonant, a consonant
sign, and a vowel. By referring to this ta-
ble, as the user enters a key, the system gen-
erates possible character strings as candidate
Sinhala words. Thanks to a TRIE structured
word dictionary and a fast search algorithm,
the system successively and efficiently nar-
rows down the candidates to possible Sin-
hala words. The experimental results show
that the system greatly improves the user-
friendliness compared to former character-
based input systems while maintaining high
efficiency.
