In this paper, we proposed a novel prob-
abilistic generative model to deal with ex-
plicit multiple-topic documents: Parametric
Dirichlet Mixture Model(PDMM). PDMM
is an expansion of an existing probabilis-
tic generative model: Parametric Mixture
Model(PMM) by hierarchical Bayes model.
PMM models multiple-topic documents by
mixing model parameters of each single
topic with an equal mixture ratio. PDMM
models multiple-topic documents by mix-
ing model parameters of each single topic
with mixture ratio following Dirichlet dis-
tribution. We evaluate PDMM and PMM
by comparing F-measures using MEDLINE
corpus. The evaluation showed that PDMM
is more effective than PMM.
