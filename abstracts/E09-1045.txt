As empirically demonstrated by the last
SensEval exercises, assigning the appro-
priate meaning to words in context has re-
sisted all attempts to be successfully ad-
dressed. One possible reason could be the
use of inappropriate set of meanings. In
fact, WordNet has been used as a de-facto
standard repository of meanings. How-
ever, to our knowledge, the meanings rep-
resented by WordNet have been only used
for WSD at a very fine-grained sense level
or at a very coarse-grained class level. We
suspect that selecting the appropriate level
of abstraction could be on between both
levels. We use a very simple method for
deriving a small set of appropriate mean-
ings using basic structural properties of
WordNet. We also empirically demon-
strate that this automatically derived set of
meanings groups senses into an adequate
level of abstraction in order to perform
class-based Word Sense Disambiguation,
allowing accuracy figures over 80%.
