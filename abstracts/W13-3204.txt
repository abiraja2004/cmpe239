We present a letter-based encoding for
words in continuous space language mod-
els. We represent the words completely by
letter n-grams instead of using the word
index. This way, similar words will au-
tomatically have a similar representation.
With this we hope to better generalize
to unknown or rare words and to also
capture morphological information. We
show their influence in the task of machine
translation using continuous space lan-
guage models based on restricted Boltz-
mann machines. We evaluate the trans-
lation quality as well as the training time
on a German-to-English translation task of
TED and university lectures as well as on
the news translation task translating from
English to German. Using our new ap-
proach a gain in BLEU score by up to 0.4
points can be achieved.
