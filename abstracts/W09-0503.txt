In this paper, we describe the use of lexi-
cal and semantic features for topic classi-
fication in dictated medical reports. First,
we employ SVM classification to assign
whole reports to coarse work-type cate-
gories. Afterwards, text segments and
their topic are identified in the output
of automatic speech recognition. This
is done by assigning work-type-specific
topic labels to each word based on fea-
tures extracted from a sliding context win-
dow, again using SVM classification uti-
lizing semantic features. Classifier stack-
ing is then used for a posteriori error cor-
rection, yielding a further improvement in
classification accuracy.
