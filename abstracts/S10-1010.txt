Tempeval-2 comprises evaluation tasks for
time expressions, events and temporal re-
lations, the latter of which was split up in
four sub tasks, motivated by the notion that
smaller subtasks would make both data
preparation and temporal relation extrac-
tion easier. Manually annotated data were
provided for six languages: Chinese, En-
glish, French, Italian, Korean and Spanish.
