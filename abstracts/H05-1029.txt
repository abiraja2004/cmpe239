 
We describe the error handling architect-
ture underlying the RavenClaw dialog 
management framework. The architecture 
provides a robust basis for current and fu-
ture research in error detection and recov-
ery. Several objectives were pursued in its 
development: task-independence, ease-of-
use, adaptability and scalability. We de-
scribe the key aspects of architectural de-
sign which confer these properties, and 
discuss the deployment of this architect-
ture in a number of spoken dialog systems 
spanning several domains and interaction 
types. Finally, we outline current research 
projects supported by this architecture.
