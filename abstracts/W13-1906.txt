In this paper, a new self?training method
for domain adaptation is illustrated, where
the selection of reliable parses is car-
ried out by an unsupervised linguistically?
driven algorithm, ULISSE. The method
has been tested on biomedical texts with
results showing a significant improve-
ment with respect to considered baselines,
which demonstrates its ability to capture
both reliability of parses and domain?
specificity of linguistic constructions.
