The availability of large parsed corpora
and improved computing resources now
make it possible to extract vast amounts
of lexical data. We describe the pro-
cess of extracting structured data and sev-
eral methods of deriving argument struc-
ture mappings for deverbal nouns that sig-
nificantly improves upon non-lexicalized
rule-based methods. For a typical model,
the F-measure of performance improves
from a baseline of about 0.72 to 0.81.
