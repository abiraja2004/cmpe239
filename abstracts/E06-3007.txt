This paper presents a way in which a lex-
icalised HPSG grammar can handle word
order constraints in a computational pars-
ing system, without invoking an additional
layer of representation for word order,
such as Reape?s Word Order Domain. The
key proposal is to incorporate into lexi-
cal heads the WOC (Word Order Con-
straints) feature, which is used to constrain
the word order of its projection. We also
overview our parsing algorithm.
