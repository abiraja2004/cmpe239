We present a fast, space efficient and non-
heuristic method for calculating the decision
function of polynomial kernel classifiers for
NLP applications. We apply the method to
the MaltParser system, resulting in a Java
parser that parses over 50 sentences per sec-
ond on modest hardware without loss of accu-
racy (a 30 time speedup over existing meth-
ods). The method implementation is available
as the open-source splitSVM Java library.
