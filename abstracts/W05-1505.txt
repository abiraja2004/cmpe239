We present a corrective model for recov-
ering non-projective dependency struc-
tures from trees generated by state-of-the-
art constituency-based parsers. The con-
tinuity constraint of these constituency-
based parsers makes it impossible for
them to posit non-projective dependency
trees. Analysis of the types of depen-
dency errors made by these parsers on a
Czech corpus show that the correct gov-
ernor is likely to be found within a local
neighborhood of the governor proposed
by the parser. Our model, based on a
MaxEnt classifier, improves overall de-
pendency accuracy by .7% (a 4.5% reduc-
tion in error) with over 50% accuracy for
non-projective structures.
