 
Myanmar script uses no space between 
words and syllable segmentation represents 
a significant process in many NLP tasks 
such as word segmentation, sorting, line 
breaking and so on. In this study, a rule-
based approach of syllable segmentation 
algorithm for Myanmar text is proposed. 
Segmentation rules were created based on 
the syllable structure of Myanmar script 
and a syllable segmentation algorithm was 
designed based on the created rules. A 
segmentation program was developed to 
evaluate the algorithm. A training corpus 
containing 32,283 Myanmar syllables was 
tested in the program and the experimental 
results show an accuracy rate of 99.96% 
for segmentation.
