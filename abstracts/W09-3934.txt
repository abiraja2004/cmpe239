We use directed graphical models (DGMs)
to automatically detect decision discus-
sions in multi-party dialogue. Our ap-
proach distinguishes between different di-
alogue act (DA) types based on their role
in the formulation of a decision. DGMs
enable us to model dependencies, includ-
ing sequential ones. We summarize deci-
sions by extracting suitable phrases from
DAs that concern the issue under discus-
sion and its resolution. Here we use a
semantic-similarity metric to improve re-
sults on both manual and ASR transcripts.
