We describe a biological event detec-
tion method implemented for the Genia
Event Extraction task of BioNLP 2013.
The method relies on syntactic depen-
dency relations provided by a general NLP
pipeline, supported by statistics derived
from Maximum Entropy models for can-
didate trigger words, for potential argu-
ments, and for argument frames.
