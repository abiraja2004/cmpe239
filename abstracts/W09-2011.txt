 
This paper investigates a little-studied class of 
adjectives that we refer to as ?complex adjec-
tives?, i.e., operationally, adjectives consti-
tuted of at least two word tokens separated by 
a hyphen. We study the properties of these ad-
jectives using two very large text collections: 
a portion of Wikipedia and a Web corpus. We 
consider three corpus-based measures of mor-
phological productivity, and we investigate 
how productivity rankings based on them cor-
relate with each other under different condi-
tions, thus providing different angles both on 
the morphological productivity of complex 
adjectives, and on the productivity measures 
themselves.
