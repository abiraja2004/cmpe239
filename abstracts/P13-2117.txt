Distant supervision has attracted recent in-
terest for training information extraction
systems because it does not require any
human annotation but rather employs ex-
isting knowledge bases to heuristically la-
bel a training corpus. However, previous
work has failed to address the problem
of false negative training examples misla-
beled due to the incompleteness of knowl-
edge bases. To tackle this problem, we
propose a simple yet novel framework that
combines a passage retrieval model using
coarse features into a state-of-the-art rela-
tion extractor using multi-instance learn-
ing with fine features. We adapt the in-
formation retrieval technique of pseudo-
relevance feedback to expand knowledge
bases, assuming entity pairs in top-ranked
passages are more likely to express a rela-
tion. Our proposed technique significantly
improves the quality of distantly super-
vised relation extraction, boosting recall
from 47.7% to 61.2% with a consistently
high level of precision of around 93% in
the experiments.
