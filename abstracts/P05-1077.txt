In this paper, we explore the power of
randomized algorithm to address the chal-
lenge of working with very large amounts
of data. We apply these algorithms to gen-
erate noun similarity lists from 70 million
pages. We reduce the running time from
quadratic to practically linear in the num-
ber of elements to be computed.
