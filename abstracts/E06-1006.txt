We propose a backoff model for phrase-
based machine translation that translates
unseen word forms in foreign-language
text by hierarchical morphological ab-
stractions at the word and the phrase level.
The model is evaluated on the Europarl
corpus for German-English and Finnish-
English translation and shows improve-
ments over state-of-the-art phrase-based
models.
