Sarcasm is a form of speech act in which
the speakers convey their message in an
implicit way. The inherently ambiguous
nature of sarcasm sometimes makes it hard
even for humans to decide whether an ut-
terance is sarcastic or not. Recognition of
sarcasm can benefit many sentiment analy-
sis NLP applications, such as review sum-
marization, dialogue systems and review
ranking systems.
In this paper we experiment with semi-
supervised sarcasm identification on two
very different data sets: a collection of
5.9 million tweets collected from Twit-
ter, and a collection of 66000 product re-
views from Amazon. Using the Mechani-
cal Turk we created a gold standard sam-
ple in which each sentence was tagged by
3 annotators, obtaining F-scores of 0.78 on
the product reviews dataset and 0.83 on
the Twitter dataset. We discuss the dif-
ferences between the datasets and how the
algorithm uses them (e.g., for the Amazon
dataset the algorithm makes use of struc-
tured information). We also discuss the
utility of Twitter #sarcasm hashtags for the
task.
