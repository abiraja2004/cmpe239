In this paper we present an unsupervised ap-
proach to relational information extraction.
Our model partitions tuples representing an
observed syntactic relationship between two
named entities (e.g., ?X was born in Y?
and ?X is from Y?) into clusters correspond-
ing to underlying semantic relation types
(e.g., BornIn, Located). Our approach incor-
porates general domain knowledge which we
encode as First Order Logic rules and auto-
matically combine with a topic model devel-
oped specifically for the relation extraction
task. Evaluation results on the ACE 2007
English Relation Detection and Categoriza-
tion (RDC) task show that our model outper-
forms competitive unsupervised approaches
by a wide margin and is able to produce clus-
ters shaped by both the data and the rules.
