We present Jane, RWTH?s hierarchical
phrase-based translation system, which
has been open sourced for the scientific
community. This system has been in de-
velopment at RWTH for the last two years
and has been successfully applied in dif-
ferent machine translation evaluations. It
includes extensions to the hierarchical ap-
proach developed by RWTH as well as
other research institutions. In this paper
we give an overview of its main features.
We also introduce a novel reordering
model for the hierarchical phrase-based
approach which further enhances transla-
tion performance, and analyze the effect
some recent extended lexicon models have
on the performance of the system.
