 
This paper discusses the range of ways in which 
spoken dialogue system components have been 
evaluated and discusses approaches to evalua-

uation into an overall view of system perfor- 
mance. We will argue that the PARADISE 
(PARAdigm for Dialogue System Evaluation) 
framework has several advantages over other 
proposals.
