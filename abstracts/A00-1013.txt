 
This paper describes and evaluates a detector 
of presuppositions (DP) for survey questions. 
Incorrect presuppositions can make it 
difficult to answer a question correctly. 
Since they can be difficult to detect, DP is a 
useful tool for questionnaire designer. DP 
performs well using local characteristics of
presuppositions. It reports the presupposition 
to the survey methodologist who can 
determine whether the presupposition is 
valid.
