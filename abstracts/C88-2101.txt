 
This paper presents an attempt o construct a feed- 
back systenr PECOF which improves a Japauese- 
English Machine Translation system by feedback of 
correcting information given by posteditors. PECOF 
analyzes the error-correcting information by using an 
English-Japmmse Machine Translation system which 
works in the reverse direction to the original MT sys~ 
tern, corot)ares the intermediate xpressions of the 
corrected patterns with those of the erroneous parts of 
the originai MT output at every transfer stage and 
idenLifies the responsible parts of the original Japanese- 
English M'P system. Then PECOF corrects the 
irrelevant parts of tt,e database or adds error correcting 
patterns to a document of postediting to ask users for 
further exmninations for corrections.
