The NewsViz system aims to enhance news
reading experiences by integrating 30 seconds
long Flash-animations into news article web
pages depicting their content and emotional
aspects. NewsViz interprets football match
news texts automatically and creates abstract
2D visualizations. The user interface en-
ables animators to further refine the anima-
tions. Here, we focus on the emotion extrac-
tion component of NewsViz which facilitates
subtle background visualization. NewsViz de-
tects moods from news reports. The origi-
nal text is part-of-speech tagged and adjec-
tives and/or nouns, the word types convey-
ing most emotional meaning, are filtered out
and labeled with an emotion and intensity
value. Subsequently reoccurring emotions are
joined into longer lasting moods and matched
with appropriate animation presets. Differ-
ent linguistic analysis methods were tested on
NewsViz: word-by-word, sentence-based and
minimum threshold summarization, to find a
minimum number of occurrences of an emo-
tion in forming a valid mood. NewsViz proved
to be viable for the fixed domain of football
news, grasping the overall moods and some
more detailed emotions precisely. NewsViz
offers an efficient technique to cater for the
production of a large number of daily updated
news stories. NewsViz bypasses the lack of
information for background or environment
depiction encountered in similar applications.
Further development may refine the detection
of emotion shifts through summarization with
the full implementation of football and com-
mon linguistic knowledge.
