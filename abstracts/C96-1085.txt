 
We present an approach to parallel natural 
language parsing which is based on a con- 
current, object-oriented model of computa- 
tion. A depth-first, yet incomplete pars- 
ing algorithm for a dependency grammar is 
specified and several restrictions on the de- 
gree of its parallelization are discussed.
