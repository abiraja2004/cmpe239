There is high demand for automated tools that
assign polarity to microblog content such as
tweets (Twitter posts), but this is challenging
due to the terseness and informality of tweets
in addition to the wide variety and rapid evolu-
tion of language in Twitter. It is thus impracti-
cal to use standard supervised machine learn-
ing techniques dependent on annotated train-
ing examples. We do without such annota-
tions by using label propagation to incorpo-
rate labels from a maximum entropy classifier
trained on noisy labels and knowledge about
word types encoded in a lexicon, in combina-
tion with the Twitter follower graph. Results
on polarity classification for several datasets
show that our label propagation approach ri-
vals a model supervised with in-domain an-
notated tweets, and it outperforms the nois-
ily supervised classifier it exploits as well as
a lexicon-based polarity ratio classifier.
