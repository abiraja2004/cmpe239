 
This paper describes an operational system which 
can acquire the core meanings of words without any 
prior knowledge of either the category or meaning 
of any words it encounters. The system is given 
as input, a description of sequences of scenes along 
with sentences which describe the \ [EVENTS\]  taking 
place as those scenes unfold, and produces as out- 
put, a lexicon consisting of the category and mean- 
ing of each word in the input, that allows the sen- 
tences to describe the \[EVENTS\].  It is argued, that 
each of the three main components of the system, the 
parser, the linker and the inference component, make 
only linguistically and cognitively plausible assump- 
tions about the innate knowledge needed to support 
tractable learning. The paper discusses the theory 
underlying the system, the representations and al- 
gorithms used in the implementation, the semantic 
constraints which support the heuristics necessary 
to achieve tractable learning, the limitations of the 
current theory and the implications of this work for 
language acquisition research.
