Word sense disambiguation (WSD)
systems based on supervised learning
achieved the best performance in SensE-
val and SemEval workshops. However,
there are few publicly available open
source WSD systems. This limits the use
of WSD in other applications, especially
for researchers whose research interests
are not in WSD.
In this paper, we present IMS, a supervised
English all-words WSD system. The flex-
ible framework of IMS allows users to in-
tegrate different preprocessing tools, ad-
ditional features, and different classifiers.
By default, we use linear support vector
machines as the classifier with multiple
knowledge-based features. In our imple-
mentation, IMS achieves state-of-the-art
results on several SensEval and SemEval
tasks.
