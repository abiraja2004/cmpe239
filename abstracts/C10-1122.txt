Automated conversion has allowed the de-
velopment of wide-coverage corpora for a
variety of grammar formalisms without the
expense of manual annotation. Analysing
new languages also tests formalisms, ex-
posing their strengths and weaknesses.
We present Chinese CCGbank, a 760,000
word corpus annotated with Combinatory
Categorial Grammar (CCG) derivations, in-
duced automatically from the Penn Chi-
nese Treebank (PCTB). We design parsimo-
nious CCG analyses for a range of Chinese
syntactic constructions, and transform the
PCTB trees to produce them. Our process
yields a corpus of 27,759 derivations, cov-
ering 98.1% of the PCTB.
