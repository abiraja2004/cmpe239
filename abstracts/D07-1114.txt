The technology of opinion extraction allows
users to retrieve and analyze people?s opin-
ions scattered over Web documents. We de-
fine an opinion unit as a quadruple consist-
ing of the opinion holder, the subject being
evaluated, the part or the attribute in which
the subject is evaluated, and the value of the
evaluation that expresses a positive or neg-
ative assessment. We use this definition as
the basis for our opinion extraction task. We
focus on two important subtasks of opinion
extraction: (a) extracting aspect-evaluation
relations, and (b) extracting aspect-of re-
lations, and we approach each task using
methods which combine contextual and sta-
tistical clues. Our experiments on Japanese
weblog posts show that the use of contex-
tual clues improve the performance for both
tasks.
