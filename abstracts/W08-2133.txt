In this paper, we describe a syntactic and
semantic dependency parsing system sub-
mitted to the shared task of CoNLL 2008.
The proposed system consists of five mod-
ules: syntactic dependency parser, predi-
cate identifier, local semantic role labeler,
global role sequence candidate generator,
and role sequence selector. The syntac-
tic dependency parser is based on Malt
Parser and the sequence candidate gen-
erator is based on CKY style algorithm.
The remaining three modules are imple-
mented by using maximum entropy classi-
fiers. The proposed system achieves 76.90
of labeled F1 for the overall task, 84.82 of
labeled attachment, and 68.71 of labeled
F1 on the WSJ+Brown test set.
