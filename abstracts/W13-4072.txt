We describe our experience with engineer-
ing the dialog state tracker for the first
Dialog State Tracking Challenge (DSTC).
Dialog trackers are one of the essential
components of dialog systems which are
used to infer the true user goal from the
speech processing results. We explain the
main parts of our tracker: the observation
model, the belief refinement model, and
the belief transformation model. We also
report experimental results on a number
of approaches to the models, and compare
the overall performance of our tracker to
other submitted trackers. An extended ver-
sion of this paper is available as a technical
report (Kim et al, 2013).
