We present RUBISC, a new incremen-
tal chunker that can perform incremental
slot filling and revising as it receives a
stream of words. Slot values can influ-
ence each other via a unification mecha-
nism. Chunks correspond to sense units,
and end-of-sentence detection is done in-
crementally based on a notion of seman-
tic/pragmatic completeness. One of RU-
BISC?s main fields of application is in
dialogue systems where it can contribute
to responsiveness and hence naturalness,
because it can provide a partial or com-
plete semantics of an utterance while the
speaker is still speaking. The chunker is
evaluated on a German transcribed speech
corpus and achieves a concept error rate of
43.3% and an F-Score of 81.5.
