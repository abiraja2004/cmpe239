Adverse reactions to drugs are among the
most common causes of death in industri-
alized nations. Expensive clinical trials are
not sufficient to uncover all of the adverse
reactions a drug may cause, necessitating
systems for post-marketing surveillance,
or pharmacovigilance. These systems
have typically relied on voluntary report-
ing by health care professionals. However,
self-reported patient data has become an
increasingly important resource, with ef-
forts such as MedWatch from the FDA al-
lowing reports directly from the consumer.
In this paper, we propose mining the re-
lationships between drugs and adverse re-
actions as reported by the patients them-
selves in user comments to health-related
websites. We evaluate our system on a
manually annotated set of user comments,
with promising performance. We also re-
port encouraging correlations between the
frequency of adverse drug reactions found
by our system in unlabeled data and the
frequency of documented adverse drug re-
actions. We conclude that user comments
pose a significant natural language pro-
cessing challenge, but do contain useful
extractable information which merits fur-
ther exploration.
