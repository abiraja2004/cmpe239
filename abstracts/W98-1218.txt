 
Recently I have been intrigued by the reappearance of an 
old friend, George Kingsley Zipf, in a number of not 
entirely expected places. The law named for him is 
ubiquitous, but Zipf did not actually discover the law so 
much as provide a plausible explanation. Others have 
proposed modifications to Zipf's Law, and closer 
examination uncovers systematic deviations from its 
normative form. We demonstrate how Zipf's analysis can 
be extended to include some of these phenomena.
