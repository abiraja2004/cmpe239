Range Concatenation Grammars (RCGs)
are a syntactic formalism which possesses
many attractive properties. It is more pow-
erful than Linear Context-Free Rewriting
Systems, though this power is not reached
to the detriment of efficiency since its sen-
tences can always be parsed in polynomial
time. If the input, instead of a string, is a
Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), only sim-
ple RCGs can still be parsed in polyno-
mial time. For non-linear RCGs, this poly-
nomial parsing time cannot be guaranteed
anymore. In this paper, we show how the
standard parsing algorithm can be adapted
for parsing DAGs with RCGs, both in the
linear (simple) and in the non-linear case.
