 
The German joint research project Verb- 
mobil (VM) aims at the deveh)pment 
of a speech to speech translation sys- 
tem. This paper reports on research 
done in our group which belongs to Verb- 
mobil's subprojeet on system architec- 
tures (TP15). Our specific research areas 
are the construction of parsers for spon- 
taneous peech, investigations in the par- 
allelization of parsing and to contribute 
to the development of a flexible com- 
munication architecture with distributed 
control.
