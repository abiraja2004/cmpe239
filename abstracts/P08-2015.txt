We present four techniques for online han-
dling of Out-of-Vocabulary words in Phrase-
based Statistical Machine Translation. The
techniques use spelling expansion, morpho-
logical expansion, dictionary term expansion
and proper name transliteration to reuse or
extend a phrase table. We compare the per-
formance of these techniques and combine
them. Our results show a consistent improve-
ment over a state-of-the-art baseline in terms
of BLEU and a manual error analysis.
