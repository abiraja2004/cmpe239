 
Abstract. In this paper, a new multi-
document multi-lingual text summarization 
technique, based on singular value decom-
position and hierarchical clustering, is pro-
posed. The proposed approach relies on 
only two resources for any language: a 
word segmentation system and a dictionary 
of words along with their document fre-
quencies. The summarizer initially takes a 
collection of related documents, and trans-
forms them into a matrix; it then applies 
singular value decomposition to the re-
sulted matrix.  After using a binary hierar-
chical clustering algorithm, the most im-
portant sentences of the most important 
clusters form the summary. The appropri-
ate place of each chosen sentence is deter-
mined by a novel technique.  The system 
has been successfully tested on summariz-
ing several Persian document collections.
