This paper proposes a novel method for
building a bilingual lexicon through a pivot
language by using phrase-based statisti-
cal machine translation (SMT). Given two
bilingual lexicons between language pairs
L
f
?L
p
and L
p
?L
e
, we assume these lexi-
cons as parallel corpora. Then, we merge
the extracted two phrase tables into one
phrase table between L
f
and L
e
. Fi-
nally, we construct a phrase-based SMT
system for translating the terms in the lex-
icon L
f
?L
p
into terms of L
e
and, ob-
tain a new lexicon L
f
?L
e
. In our experi-
ments with Chinese-English and Japanese-
English lexicons, our system could cover
72.8% of Chinese terms and drastically im-
prove the utilization ratio.
