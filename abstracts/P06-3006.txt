In order to build a simulated robot that
accepts instructions in unconstrained nat-
ural language, a corpus of 427 route in-
structions was collected from human sub-
jects in the office navigation domain. The
instructions were segmented by the steps
in the actual route and labeled with the
action taken in each step. This flat
formulation reduced the problem to an
IE/Segmentation task, to which we applied
Conditional Random Fields. We com-
pared the performance of CRFs with a set
of hand-written rules. The result showed
that CRFs perform better with a 73.7%
success rate.
