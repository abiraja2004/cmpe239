We present a pilot study on an evaluation
method which is able to rank translation out-
puts with no reference translation, given only
their source sentence. The system employs a
statistical classifier trained upon existing hu-
man rankings, using several features derived
from analysis of both the source and the tar-
get sentences. Development experiments on
one language pair showed that the method
has considerably good correlation with human
ranking when using features obtained from a
PCFG parser.
