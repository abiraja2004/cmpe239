The CIAOSENSO WSD system is based on Con-
ceptual Density, WordNet Domains and frequences
of WordNet senses. This paper describes the upv-
unige-CIAOSENSO WSD system, we participated
in the english all-word task with, and its versions
used for the english lexical sample and the Word-
Net gloss disambiguation tasks. In the last an ad-
ditional goal was to check if the disambiguation of
glosses, that has been performed during our tests on
the SemCor corpus, was done properly or not.
