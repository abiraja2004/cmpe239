Humans are very good at judging the
strength of relationships between two
terms, a task which, if it can be au-
tomated, would be useful in a range
of applications. Systems attempting to
solve this problem automatically have
traditionally either used relative po-
sitioning in lexical resources such as
WordNet, or distributional relation-
ships in large corpora. This paper pro-
poses a new approach, whereby rela-
tionships are derived from natural lan-
guage text by using existing nlp tools,
then integrated into a large scale se-
mantic network. Spreading activation
is then used on this network in order
to judge the strengths of all relation-
ships connecting the terms. In com-
parisons with human measurements,
this approach was able to obtain re-
sults on par with the best purpose built
systems, using only a relatively small
corpus extracted from the web. This
is particularly impressive, as the net-
work creation system is a general tool
for information collection and integra-
tion, and is not specifically designed for
tasks of this type.
