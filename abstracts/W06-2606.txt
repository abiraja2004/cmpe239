We investigate methods that add syntac-
tically motivated features to a statistical
machine translation system in a reranking
framework. The goal is to analyze whether
shallow parsing techniques help in iden-
tifying ungrammatical hypotheses. We
show that improvements are possible by
utilizing supertagging, lightweight depen-
dency analysis, a link grammar parser and
a maximum-entropy based chunk parser.
Adding features to n-best lists and dis-
criminatively training the system on a de-
velopment set increases the BLEU score
up to 0.7% on the test set.
