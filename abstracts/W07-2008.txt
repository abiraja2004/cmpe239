In this paper we describe SemEval-2007 task
number 9 (Multilevel Semantic Annotation
of Catalan and Spanish). In this task, we
aim at evaluating and comparing automatic
systems for the annotation of several seman-
tic linguistic levels for Catalan and Spanish.
Three semantic levels are considered: noun
sense disambiguation, named entity recogni-
tion, and semantic role labeling.
