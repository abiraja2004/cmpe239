A technology demonstrator is one thing
but having people use a technology is an-
other, and the result reported here is that
people often ignore our lovingly crafted
handiwork. The SERA project - Social
Engagement with Robots and Agents -
was set up to look explicitly at what hap-
pens when a robot companion is put in
someone?s home. Even if things worked
perfectly, there are times when a compan-
ion?s human is simply not engaged. As a
result we have separated our ?dialog man-
ager? into two parts: the dialog manager
itself that determines what to say next, and
an ?interaction manager? that determines
when to say it. This paper details the de-
sign of this SALT-E architecture.
