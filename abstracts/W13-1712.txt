We decribe the submissions made by the Na-
tional Research Council Canada to the Native
Language Identification (NLI) shared task.
Our submissions rely on a Support Vector Ma-
chine classifier, various feature spaces using
a variety of lexical, spelling, and syntactic
features, and on a simple model combination
strategy relying on a majority vote between
classifiers. Somewhat surprisingly, a clas-
sifier relying on purely lexical features per-
formed very well and proved difficult to out-
perform significantly using various combina-
tions of feature spaces. However, the com-
bination of multiple predictors allowed to ex-
ploit their different strengths and provided a
significant boost in performance.
