 
This paper presents an unsupervised 
method for automatic Chinese word 
sense induction. The algorithm is based 
on clustering the similar words according 
to the contexts in which they occur. First, 
the target word which needs to be 
disambiguated is represented as the 
vector of its contexts. Then, reconstruct 
the matrix constituted by the vectors of 
target words through singular value 
decomposition (SVD) method, and use 
the vectors to cluster the similar words. 
Our system participants in CLP2010 
back off task4-Chinese word sense 
induction.
