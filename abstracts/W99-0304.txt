 
This paper describes standardizing discourse 
annotation schemes for Japanese and eval- 
uates the reliability of these schemes. We 
propose three schemes, that is, utterance 
unit, discourse segment and discourse mark- 
ers. These schemes have shown to be in- 
crementally improved based on the experi- 
mental results, and the reliability of these 
schemes are estimated as "good" range.
