A number of issues arise when trying to scale-
up natural language understanding (NLU) tools
designed for relatively simple domains (e.g.,
flight information) to domains such as medical
advising or tutoring where deep understanding
of user utterances is necessary. Because the
subject matter is richer, the range of vocabu-
lary and grammatical structures is larger mean-
ing NLU tools are more likely to encounter
out-of-vocabulary words or extra-grammatical
utterances. This is especially true in med-
ical advising and tutoring where users may
not know the correct vocabulary and use com-
mon sense terms or descriptions instead. Tech-
niques designed to improve robustness (e.g.,
skipping unknown words, relaxing grammat-
ical constraints, mapping unknown words to
known words) are effective at increasing the
number of utterances for which an NLU sub-
system can produce a semantic interpretation.
However, such techniques introduce additional
ambiguity and can lead to a loss of fidelity (i.e.,
a mismatch between the semantic interpreta-
tion and what the language producer meant).
To control this trade-off, we propose semantic
interpretation confidence scores akin to speech
recognition confidence scores, and describe our
initial attempt to compute such a score in a
modularized NLU sub-system.
