We invite the research community to con-
sider challenges for NLG which arise from
uncertainty. NLG systems should be able
to adapt to their audience and the genera-
tion environment in general, but often the
important features for adaptation are not
known precisely. We explore generation
challenges which could employ simulated
environments to study NLGwhich is adap-
tive under uncertainty, and suggest possi-
ble metrics for such tasks. It would be par-
ticularly interesting to explore how differ-
ent planning approaches to NLG perform
in challenges involving uncertainty in the
generation environment.
