For a given concrete noun concept, humans
are usually able to cite properties (e.g., ele-
phant is animal, car has wheels) of that con-
cept; cognitive psychologists have theorised
that such properties are fundamental to un-
derstanding the abstract mental representation
of concepts in the brain. Consequently, the
ability to automatically extract such properties
would be of enormous benefit to the field of
experimental psychology. This paper investi-
gates the use of semi-supervised learning and
support vector machines to automatically ex-
tract concept-relation-feature triples from two
large corpora (Wikipedia and UKWAC) for
concrete noun concepts. Previous approaches
have relied on manually-generated rules and
hand-crafted resources such as WordNet; our
method requires neither yet achieves bet-
ter performance than these prior approaches,
measured both by comparison with a property
norm-derived gold standard as well as direct
human evaluation. Our technique performs
particularly well on extracting features rele-
vant to a given concept, and suggests a number
of promising areas for future focus.
