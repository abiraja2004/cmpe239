 
We present a procedure that determines a set 
of phonemes possibly intended by a speaker 
from a recognized or uttered phone. This in- 
formation will be used to allow a speech rec- 
ognizer to take pronunciation i to account or 
to consider input from a noisy source during 
lexical access. We investigate the hypothesis 
that different pronunciations ofa phone occur 
within groups of sounds physically produced 
the same way, and use the Minimum Message 
Length principle to consider the effect of a 
phoneme's context on its pronunciation.
