 
Structured syntactic knowledge is important 
for phrase reordering. This paper proposes us-
ing convolution tree kernel over source parse 
tree to model structured syntactic knowledge 
for BTG-based phrase reordering in the con-
text of statistical machine translation. Our 
study reveals that the structured syntactic fea-
tures over the source phrases are very effective 
for BTG constraint-based phrase reordering 
and those features can be well captured by the 
tree kernel. We further combine the structured 
features and other commonly-used linear fea-
tures into a composite kernel. Experimental re-
sults on the NIST MT-2005 Chinese-English 
translation tasks show that our proposed 
phrase reordering model statistically signifi-
cantly outperforms the baseline methods.
