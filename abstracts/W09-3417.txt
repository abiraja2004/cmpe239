  
TimeML, TimeBank, and TTK (TARSQI 
Project) have been playing an important role 
in enhancement of IE, QA, and other NLP 
applications. TimeML is a specification lan-
guage for events and temporal expressions in 
text. This paper presents the problems and so-
lutions for porting TimeML to Korean as a 
part of the Korean TARSQI Project. We also 
introduce the KTTK which is an automatic 
markup tool of temporal and event-denoting 
expressions in Korean text.
