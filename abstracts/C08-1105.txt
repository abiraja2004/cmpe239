In Semantic Role Labeling (SRL), argu-
ments are usually limited in a syntax sub-
tree. It is reasonable to label arguments lo-
cally in such a sub-tree rather than a whole
tree. To identify active region of argu-
ments, this paper models Maximal Pro-
jection (MP), which is a concept in D-
structure from the projection principle of
the Principle and Parameters theory. This
paper makes a new definition of MP in S-
structure and proposes two methods to pre-
dict it: the anchor group approach and the
single anchor approach. The anchor group
approach achieves an accuracy of 87.75%
and the single anchor approach achieves
83.63%. Experimental results also indicate
that the prediction of MP improves seman-
tic role labeling.
