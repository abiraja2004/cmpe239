This paper describes two natural language
processing systems designed to assist song-
writers in obtaining and developing ideas for
their craft. Titular is a text synthesis algo-
rithm for automatically generating novel song
titles, which lyricists can use to back-form
concepts and narrative story arcs. LyriCloud
is a word-level language ?browser? or ?ex-
plorer,? which allows users to interactively se-
lect words and receive lyrical suggestions in
return. Two criteria for creativity tools are
also presented along with examples of how
they guided the development of these systems,
which were used by musicians during an inter-
national songwriting contest.
