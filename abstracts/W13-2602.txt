Computational work in the past decade
has produced several models accounting
for phonetic category learning from distri-
butional and lexical cues. However, there
have been no computational proposals for
how people might use another powerful
learning mechanism: generalization from
learned to analogous distinctions (e.g.,
from /b/?/p/ to /g/?/k/). Here, we present
a new simple model of generalization in
phonetic category learning, formalized in
a hierarchical Bayesian framework. The
model captures our proposal that linguis-
tic knowledge includes the possibility that
category types in a language (such as
voiced and voiceless) can be shared across
sound classes (such as labial and velar),
thus naturally leading to generalization.
We present two sets of simulations that
reproduce key features of human perfor-
mance in behavioral experiments, and we
discuss the model?s implications and di-
rections for future research.
