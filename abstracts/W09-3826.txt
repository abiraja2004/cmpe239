In this paper, we propose that grammar er-
ror detection be disambiguated in generat-
ing the connected parse(s) of optimal merit
for the full input utterance, in overcom-
ing the cheapest error. The detected er-
ror(s) are described as violated grammat-
ical constraints in a framework for Model-
Theoretic Syntax (MTS). We present a
parsing algorithm for MTS, which only re-
lies on a grammar of well-formedness, in
that the process does not require any extra-
grammatical resources, additional rules
for constraint relaxation or error handling,
or any recovery process.
