. Our research aims at developing a system that paraphrases
written language text to spoken language style. In such a system, it is
important to distinguish between appropriate and inappropriate words
in an input text for spoken language. We call this task lexical choice
for paraphrasing. In this paper, we describe a method of lexical choice
that considers the topic. Basically, our method is based on the word
probabilities in written and spoken language corpora. The novelty of our
method is topic adaptation. In our framework, the corpora are classified
into topic categories, and the probability is estimated using such corpora
that have the same topic as input text. The result of evaluation showed
the effectiveness of topic adaptation.
