The goal of this task is to evaluate
the feasibility of multilingual WSD on
a newly developed multilingual lexi-
cal sample data set. Participants were
asked to automatically determine the
contextually appropriate translation of
a given English noun in five languages,
viz. Dutch, German, Italian, Spanish
and French. This paper reports on the
sixteen submissions from the five dif-
ferent participating teams.
