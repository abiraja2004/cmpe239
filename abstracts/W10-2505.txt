We investigate the problem of structurally
changing lexica, while preserving the in-
formation. We present a type of lexicon
transformation that is complete on an in-
teresting class of lexica. Our work is mo-
tivated by the problem of merging one or
more lexica into one lexicon. Lexica, lexi-
con schemas, and lexicon transformations
are all seen as particular kinds of trees.
