This paper presents a tree-to-tree transduc-
tion method for text rewriting. Our model
is based on synchronous tree substitution
grammar, a formalism that allows local dis-
tortion of the tree topology and can thus
naturally capture structural mismatches. We
describe an algorithm for decoding in this
framework and show how the model can
be trained discriminatively within a large
margin framework. Experimental results on
sentence compression bring significant im-
provements over a state-of-the-art model.
