This paper presents CUCWeb, a 166 mil-
lion word corpus for Catalan built by
crawling the Web. The corpus has been
annotated with NLP tools and made avail-
able to language users through a flexible
web interface. The developed architecture
is quite general, so that it can be used to
create corpora for other languages.
