An important relation in information ex-
traction is the part-whole relation. On-
tological studies mention several types of
this relation. In this paper, we show
that the traditional practice of initializ-
ing minimally-supervised algorithms with
a single set that mixes seeds of different
types fails to capture the wide variety of
part-whole patterns and tuples. The re-
sults obtained with mixed seeds ultimately
converge to one of the part-whole relation
types. We also demonstrate that all the
different types of part-whole relations can
still be discovered, regardless of the type
characterized by the initializing seeds. We
performed our experiments with a state-of-
the-art information extraction algorithm.
