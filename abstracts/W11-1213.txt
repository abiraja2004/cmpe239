As the title suggests, our paper deals with web
discussion fora, whose content can be consid-
ered to be a special type of comparable cor-
pora. We discuss the potential of this vast
amount of data available now on the World
Wide Web nearly for every language, regard-
ing both general and common topics as well
as the most obscure and specific ones. To il-
lustrate our ideas, we propose a case study
of seven wedding discussion fora in five lan-
guages.
