Summarizing and analyzing Twitter content is
an important and challenging task. In this pa-
per, we propose to extract topical keyphrases
as one way to summarize Twitter. We propose
a context-sensitive topical PageRank method
for keyword ranking and a probabilistic scor-
ing function that considers both relevance and
interestingness of keyphrases for keyphrase
ranking. We evaluate our proposed methods
on a large Twitter data set. Experiments show
that these methods are very effective for topi-
cal keyphrase extraction.
