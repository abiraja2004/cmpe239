Most dialogue architectures are ei-
ther pipelined or, if agent-based,
are restricted to a pipelined flow-
of-information. The TRIPS di-
alogue architecture is agent-based
and asynchronous, with several lay-
ers of information flow. We present
this architecture and the synchro-
nization issues we encountered in
building a truly distributed, agent-
based dialogue architecture.
