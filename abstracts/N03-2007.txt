This paper describes an application of active
learning methods to the classification of phone
strings recognized using unsupervised phono-
tactic models. The only training data required
for classification using these recognition meth-
ods is assigning class labels to the audio files.
The work described here demonstrates that
substantial savings in this effort can be ob-
tained by actively selecting examples to be la-
beled using confidence scores from the Boos-
Texter classifier. The saving in class label-
ing effort is evaluated on two different spo-
ken language system domains in terms both of
the number of utterances to be labeled and the
length of the labeled utterances in phones. We
show that savings in labeling effort of around
30% can be obtained using active selection of
examples.
