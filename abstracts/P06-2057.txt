We present a FrameNet-based semantic
role labeling system for Swedish text. As
training data for the system, we used an
annotated corpus that we produced by
transferring FrameNet annotation from the
English side to the Swedish side in a par-
allel corpus. In addition, we describe two
frame element bracketing algorithms that
are suitable when no robust constituent
parsers are available.
We evaluated the system on a part of the
FrameNet example corpus that we trans-
lated manually, and obtained an accuracy
score of 0.75 on the classification of pre-
segmented frame elements, and precision
and recall scores of 0.67 and 0.47 for the
complete task.
