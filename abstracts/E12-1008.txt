We introduce a new approach to transition-
based dependency parsing in which the
parser does not directly construct a depen-
dency structure, but rather an undirected
graph, which is then converted into a di-
rected dependency tree in a post-processing
step. This alleviates error propagation,
since undirected parsers do not need to ob-
serve the single-head constraint.
Undirected parsers can be obtained by sim-
plifying existing transition-based parsers
satisfying certain conditions. We apply this
approach to obtain undirected variants of
the planar and 2-planar parsers and of Cov-
ington?s non-projective parser. We perform
experiments on several datasets from the
CoNLL-X shared task, showing that these
variants outperform the original directed al-
gorithms in most of the cases.
