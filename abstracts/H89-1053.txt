 
In this paper we describe a method for automatically discovering subsets of contextual factors which, 
taken together, axe useful for predicting the realizations, or pronunciations, of English words for contin- 
uous speech recognition. A decision tree is used for organizing contextual descriptions of phonological 
variation. This representation enables us to categorize different realizations according to the context in 
which they appear in the corpus. In addition, this organization permits us to consider simplifications 
such as pruning and branch clustering, leading to parsimonious descriptions that better predict allo- 
phones in these contexts. We created trees to examine the working assumption that preceding phoneme 
and following phoneme provide important contexts, as exemplified by the use of triphones in hidden 
Maxkov models; our results were in general accordance with the assumption. However, we found that 
other contexts also play a significant role in phoneme realizations.
