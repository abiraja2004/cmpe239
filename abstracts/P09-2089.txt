For many NLP tasks, including named en-
tity tagging, semi-supervised learning has
been proposed as a reasonable alternative
to methods that require annotating large
amounts of training data. In this paper,
we address the problem of analyzing new
data given a semi-supervised NE tagger
trained on data from an earlier time pe-
riod. We will show that updating the unla-
beled data is sufficient to maintain quality
over time, and outperforms updating the
labeled data. Furthermore, we will also
show that augmenting the unlabeled data
with older data in most cases does not re-
sult in better performance than simply us-
ing a smaller amount of current unlabeled
data.
