 
In this paper we describe two new objective 
automatic evaluation methods for machine 
translation. The first method is based on long-
est common subsequence between a candidate 
translation and a set of reference translations. 
Longest common subsequence takes into ac-
count sentence level structure similarity natu-
rally and identifies longest co-occurring in-
sequence n-grams automatically.  The second 
method relaxes strict n-gram matching to skip-
bigram matching. Skip-bigram is any pair of 
words in their sentence order. Skip-bigram co-
occurrence statistics measure the overlap of 
skip-bigrams between a candidate translation 
and a set of reference translations. The empiri-
cal results show that both methods correlate 
with human judgments very well in both ade-
quacy and fluency.
