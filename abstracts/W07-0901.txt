 
This paper provides a description and 
evaluation of a generic named-entity rec-
ognition (NER) system for Swedish applied 
to electronic versions of Swedish literary 
classics from the 19th century. We discuss 
the challenges posed by these texts and the 
necessary adaptations introduced into the 
NER system in order to achieve accurate 
results, useful both for metadata genera-
tion, but also for the enhancement of the 
searching and browsing capabilities of Lit-
teraturbanken, the Swedish Literature 
Bank, an ongoing cultural heritage project 
which aims to digitize significant works of 
Swedish literature.
