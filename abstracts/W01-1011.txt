  
We present a system for the automatic 
extraction of salient information from 
email messages, thus providing the gist of 
their meaning.   Dealing with email raises 
several challenges that we address in this 
paper:  heterogeneous data in terms of 
length and topic. Our method combines 
shallow linguistic processing with 
machine learning to extract phrasal units 
that are representative of email content. 
The GIST-IT application is fully 
implemented and embedded in an active 
mailbox platform.  Evaluation was 
performed over three machine learning 
paradigms.
