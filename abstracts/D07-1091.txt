We present an extension of phrase-based
statistical machine translation models that
enables the straight-forward integration of
additional annotation at the word-level ?
may it be linguistic markup or automati-
cally generated word classes. In a num-
ber of experiments we show that factored
translation models lead to better transla-
tion performance, both in terms of auto-
matic scores, as well as more grammatical
coherence.
