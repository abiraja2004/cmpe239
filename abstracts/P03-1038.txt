This paper presents a method to de-
velop a class of variable memory Markov
models that have higher memory capac-
ity than traditional (uniform memory)
Markov models. The structure of the vari-
able memory models is induced from a
manually annotated corpus through a de-
cision tree learning algorithm. A series of
comparative experiments show the result-
ing models outperform uniform memory
Markov models in a part-of-speech tag-
ging task.
