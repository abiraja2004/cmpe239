The current research demonstrates a system
inspired by cognitive neuroscience and
developmental psychology that learns to
construct mappings between the grammatical
structure of sentences and the structure of their
meaning representations. Sentence to meaning
mappings are learned and stored as
grammatical constructions. These are stored
and retrieved from a construction inventory
based on the constellation of closed class
items uniquely identifying each construction.
These learned mappings allow the system to
processes natural language sentences in order
to reconstruct complex internal representations
of the meanings these sentences describe. The
system demonstrates error free performance
and systematic generalization for a rich subset
of English constructions that includes complex
hierarchical grammatical structure, and
generalizes systematically to new sentences of
the learned construction categories. Further
testing demonstrates (1) the capability to
accommodate a significantly extended set of
constructions, and (2) extension to Japanese, a
free word order language that is structurally
quite different from English, thus
demonstrating the extensibility of the structure
mapping model.
