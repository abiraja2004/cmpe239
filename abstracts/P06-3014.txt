In this paper, we compare the per-
formance of a state-of-the-art statistical
parser (Bikel, 2004) in parsing written and
spoken language and in generating sub-
categorization cues from written and spo-
ken language. Although Bikel?s parser
achieves a higher accuracy for parsing
written language, it achieves a higher ac-
curacy when extracting subcategorization
cues from spoken language. Additionally,
we explore the utility of punctuation in
helping parsing and extraction of subcat-
egorization cues. Our experiments show
that punctuation is of little help in pars-
ing spoken language and extracting sub-
categorization cues from spoken language.
This indicates that there is no need to add
punctuation in transcribing spoken cor-
pora simply in order to help parsers.
