In this paper, we introduce a new framework
for recognizing textual entailment which de-
pends on extraction of the set of publicly-
held beliefs ? known as discourse commit-
ments ? that can be ascribed to the author of
a text or a hypothesis. Once a set of commit-
ments have been extracted from a t-h pair,
the task of recognizing textual entailment is
reduced to the identification of the commit-
ments from a t which support the inference
of the h. Promising results were achieved:
our system correctly identified more than
80% of examples from the RTE-3 Test Set
correctly, without the need for additional
sources of training data or other web-based
resources.
