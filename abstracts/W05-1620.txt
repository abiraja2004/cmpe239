The work presented here is intended as an evolu-
tionary task-specific module for referring expres-
sion generation and aggregation to be enclosed in a
generic flexible architecture. Appearances of con-
cepts are considered as genes, each one encoding
the type of reference used. Three genetic opera-
tors are used: classic crossover and mutation, plus
a specific operator dealing with aggregation. Fit-
ness functions are defined to achieve elementary
coherence and stylistic validity. Experiments are
described and discussed.
