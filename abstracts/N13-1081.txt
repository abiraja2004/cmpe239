This opinion piece proposes that recent ad-
vances in opinion detection are limited in the
extent to which they can detect important cat-
egories of opinion because they are not de-
signed to capture some of the pragmatic as-
pects of opinion. A component of these is the
perspective of the user of an opinion-mining
system as to what an opinion really is, which is
in itself a matter of opinion (metasubjectivity).
We propose a way to define this component of
opinion and describe the challenges it poses
for corpus development and sentence-level de-
tection technologies. Finally, we suggest that
investment in techniques to handle metasub-
jectivity will likely bear costs but bring bene-
fits in the longer term.
