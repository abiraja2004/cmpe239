Abstract
This paper describes a novel summariza-
tion system, Classummary, for interactive
online classroom discussions. This system
is originally designed for Open Source
Software (OSS) development forums.
However, this new application provides
valuable feedback on designing summari-
zation systems and applying them to eve-
ryday use, in addition to the traditional
natural language processing evaluation
methods. In our demonstration at HLT,
new users will be able to direct this sum-
marizer themselves.
