Many current sentence generators lack
the ability to compute elliptical versions
of coordinated clauses in accordance with
the rules for Gapping, Forward and
Backward Conjunction Reduction, and
SGF (Subject Gap in clauses with Fi-
nite/Fronted verb). We describe a module
(implemented in JAVA, with German
and Dutch as target languages) that takes
non-elliptical coordinated clauses as in-
put and returns all reduced versions li-
censed by coordinative ellipsis. It is
loosely based on a new psycholinguistic
theory of coordinative ellipsis proposed
by Kempen. In this theory, coordinative
ellipsis is not supposed to result from the
application of declarative grammar rules
for clause formation but from a proce-
dural component that interacts with the
sentence generator and may block the
overt expression of certain constituents.
