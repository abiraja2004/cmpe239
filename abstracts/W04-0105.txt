This paper describes a Bayesian procedure for un-
supervised learning of phonological rules from an
unlabeled corpus of training data. Like Goldsmith?s
Linguistica program (Goldsmith, 2004b), whose
output is taken as the starting point of this proce-
dure, our learner returns a grammar that consists of
a set of signatures, each of which consists of a set
of stems and a set of suffixes. Our grammars dif-
fer from Linguistica?s in that they also contain a set
of phonological rules, specifically insertion, dele-
tion and substitution rules, which permit our gram-
mars to collapse far more words into a signature
than Linguistica can. Interestingly, the choice of
Bayesian prior turns out to be crucial for obtaining a
learner that makes linguistically appropriate gener-
alizations through a range of different sized training
corpora.
