This article introduces an unsupervised word
sense disambiguation algorithm that is in-
spired by the lexical attraction models of
Yuret (1998). It is based on the assump-
tion that the meanings of the words that
form a sentence can be best assigned by con-
structing an interpretation of the whole sen-
tence. This interpretation is facilitated by
a dependency-like context specification of
a content word within the sentence. Thus,
finding the context words of a target word
is a matter of finding a pseudo-syntactic de-
pendency analysis of the sentence, called a
linkage.
