We present a machine learning frame-
work for resolving other-anaphora. Be-
sides morpho-syntactic, recency, and se-
mantic features based on existing lexi-
cal knowledge resources, our algorithm
obtains additional semantic knowledge
from the Web. We search the Web via
lexico-syntactic patterns that are specific
to other-anaphors. Incorporating this in-
novative feature leads to an 11.4 percent-
age point improvement in the classifier?s
F -measure (25% improvement relative to
results without this feature).
