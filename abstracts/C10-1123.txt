We propose a structure called dependency
forest for statistical machine translation.
A dependency forest compactly represents
multiple dependency trees. We develop
new algorithms for extracting string-to-
dependency rules and training depen-
dency language models. Our forest-based
string-to-dependency system obtains sig-
nificant improvements ranging from 1.36
to 1.46 BLEU points over the tree-based
baseline on the NIST 2004/2005/2006
Chinese-English test sets.
