 
We present an approach to text navigation 
conceived as a cognitive process exploiting 
linguistic information present in texts. We 
claim that the navigational knowledge in-
volved in this process can be modeled in a 
declarative way with the Sextant language. 
Since Sextant refers exhaustively to specific 
linguistic phenomena, we have defined a 
customized text representation. These dif-
ferent components are implemented in the 
text navigation system NaviTexte. Two ap-
plications of NaviTexte are described.
