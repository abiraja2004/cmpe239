We describe a method for discriminative
training of a language model that makes
use of syntactic features. We follow
a reranking approach, where a baseline
recogniser is used to produce 1000-best
output for each acoustic input, and a sec-
ond ?reranking? model is then used to
choose an utterance from these 1000-best
lists. The reranking model makes use of
syntactic features together with a parame-
ter estimation method that is based on the
perceptron algorithm. We describe exper-
iments on the Switchboard speech recog-
nition task. The syntactic features provide
an additional 0.3% reduction in test?set
error rate beyond the model of (Roark et
al., 2004a; Roark et al, 2004b) (signifi-
cant at p < 0.001), which makes use of
a discriminatively trained n-gram model,
giving a total reduction of 1.2% over the
baseline Switchboard system.
