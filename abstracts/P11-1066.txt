Community-based question answer (Q&A)
has become an important issue due to the pop-
ularity of Q&A archives on the web. This pa-
per is concerned with the problem of ques-
tion retrieval. Question retrieval in Q&A
archives aims to find historical questions that
are semantically equivalent or relevant to the
queried questions. In this paper, we propose
a novel phrase-based translation model for
question retrieval. Compared to the traditional
word-based translation models, the phrase-
based translation model is more effective be-
cause it captures contextual information in
modeling the translation of phrases as a whole,
rather than translating single words in isola-
tion. Experiments conducted on real Q&A
data demonstrate that our proposed phrase-
based translation model significantly outper-
forms the state-of-the-art word-based transla-
tion model.
