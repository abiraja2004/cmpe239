We describe a statistical Natural Language
Generation (NLG) method for summarisa-
tion of time-series data in the context of
feedback generation for students. In this
paper, we initially present a method for
collecting time-series data from students
(e.g. marks, lectures attended) and use ex-
ample feedback from lecturers in a data-
driven approach to content selection. We
show a novel way of constructing a reward
function for our Reinforcement Learning
agent that is informed by the lecturers?
method of providing feedback. We eval-
uate our system with undergraduate stu-
dents by comparing it to three baseline
systems: a rule-based system, lecturer-
constructed summaries and a Brute Force
system. Our evaluation shows that the
feedback generated by our learning agent
is viewed by students to be as good as the
feedback from the lecturers. Our findings
suggest that the learning agent needs to
take into account both the student and lec-
turers? preferences.
