Motivated by the psycholinguistic finding
that human eye gaze is tightly linked to
speech production, previous work has ap-
plied naturally occurring eye gaze for au-
tomatic vocabulary acquisition. However,
unlike in the typical settings for psycholin-
guistic studies, eye gaze can serve differ-
ent functions in human-machine conver-
sation. Some gaze streams do not link
to the content of the spoken utterances
and thus can be potentially detrimental to
word acquisition. To address this prob-
lem, this paper investigates the incorpo-
ration of interactivity in identifying the
close coupling of speech and gaze streams
for word acquisition. Our empirical re-
sults indicate that automatic identification
of closely coupled gaze-speech streams
leads to significantly better word acquisi-
tion performance.
