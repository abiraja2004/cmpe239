Following (McDonald et al, 2005), we
present an application of a maximum
spanning tree algorithm for a directed
graph to non-projective labeled depen-
dency parsing. Using a variant of the
voted perceptron (Collins, 2002; Collins
and Roark, 2004; Crammer and Singer,
2003), we discriminatively trained our
parser in an on-line fashion. After just one
epoch of training, we were generally able
to attain average results in the CoNLL
2006 Shared Task.
