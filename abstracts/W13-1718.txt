We apply Support Vector Machines to differ-
entiate between 11 native languages in the
2013 Native Language Identification Shared
Task. We expand a set of common language
identification features to include cognate inter-
ference and spelling mistakes. Our best results
are obtained with a classifier which includes
both the cognate and the misspelling features,
as well as word unigrams, word bigrams, char-
acter bigrams, and syntax production rules.
