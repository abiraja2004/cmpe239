Stanford Dependencies (SD) provide a
functional characterization of the gram-
matical relations in syntactic parse-trees.
The SD representation is useful for parser
evaluation, for downstream applications,
and, ultimately, for natural language un-
derstanding, however, the design of SD fo-
cuses on structurally-marked relations and
under-represents morphosyntactic realiza-
tion patterns observed in Morphologically
Rich Languages (MRLs). We present a
novel extension of SD, called Unified-SD
(U-SD), which unifies the annotation of
structurally- and morphologically-marked
relations via an inheritance hierarchy. We
create a new resource composed of U-SD-
annotated constituency and dependency
treebanks for the MRL Modern Hebrew,
and present two systems that can automat-
ically predict U-SD annotations, for gold
segmented input as well as raw texts, with
high baseline accuracy.
