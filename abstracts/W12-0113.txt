very crucial role for improving the over-
all performance in Phrase Based Statisti-
cal Machine Translation systems (PB-
SMT). In this paper the automatic align-
ments   of different kind of chunks have 
been studied that boosts up the word 
alignment as well as the machine transla-
tion quality. Single-tokenization of 
Noun-noun MWEs, phrasal preposition 
(source side only) and reduplicated 
phrases (target side only) and the align-
ment of named entities and complex 
predicates provide the best SMT model 
for bootstrapping. Automatic bootstrap-
ping on the alignment of various chunks 
makes significant gains over the previous 
best English-Bengali PB-SMT system. 
The source chunks are translated into the 
target language using the PB-SMT sys-
tem and the translated chunks are com-
pared with the original target chunk. The 
aligned chunks increase the size of the 
parallel corpus. The processes are run in 
a bootstrapping manner until all the 
source chunks have been aligned with the 
target chunks or no new chunk alignment 
is identified by the bootstrapping process. 
The proposed system achieves significant 
improvements (2.25 BLEU over the best 
System and 8.63 BLEU points absolute 
over the baseline system, 98.74% relative 
improvement over the baseline system) 
on an English- Bengali translation task.
