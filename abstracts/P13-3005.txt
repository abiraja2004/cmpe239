In this paper we focus on practical is-
sues of data representation for dependency
parsing. We carry out an experimental
comparison of (a) three syntactic depen-
dency schemes; (b) three data-driven de-
pendency parsers; and (c) the influence of
two different approaches to lexical cate-
gory disambiguation (aka tagging) prior to
parsing. Comparing parsing accuracies in
various setups, we study the interactions
of these three aspects and analyze which
configurations are easier to learn for a de-
pendency parser.
