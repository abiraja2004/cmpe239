Graph-based dependency parsing can be sped
up significantly if implausible arcs are elim-
inated from the search-space before parsing
begins. State-of-the-art methods for arc fil-
tering use separate classifiers to make point-
wise decisions about the tree; they label tokens
with roles such as root, leaf, or attaches-to-
the-left, and then filter arcs accordingly. Be-
cause these classifiers overlap substantially in
their filtering consequences, we propose to
train them jointly, so that each classifier can
focus on the gaps of the others. We inte-
grate the various pointwise decisions as latent
variables in a single arc-level SVM classifier.
This novel framework allows us to combine
nine pointwise filters, and adjust their sensi-
tivity using a shared threshold based on arc
length. Our system filters 32% more arcs than
the independently-trained classifiers, without
reducing filtering speed. This leads to faster
parsing with no reduction in accuracy.
