Most work on language acquisition treats
word segmentation?the identification of lin-
guistic segments from continuous speech?
and word learning?the mapping of those seg-
ments to meanings?as separate problems.
These two abilities develop in parallel, how-
ever, raising the question of whether they
might interact. To explore the question, we
present a new Bayesian segmentation model
that incorporates aspects of word learning and
compare it to a model that ignores word mean-
ings. The model that learns word meanings
proposes more adult-like segmentations for
the meaning-bearing words. This result sug-
gests that the non-linguistic context may sup-
ply important information for learning word
segmentations as well as word meanings.
