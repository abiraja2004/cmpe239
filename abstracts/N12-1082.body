Generating referring expressions has received
considerable attention in Natural Language
Generation. In recent years we start seeing
deployments of referring expression genera-
tors moving away from limited domains with
custom-made ontologies. In this work, we ex-
plore the feasibility of using large scale noisy
ontologies (folksonomies) for open domain
referring expression generation, an important
task for summarization by re-generation. Our
experiments on a fully annotated anaphora
resolution training set and a larger, volunteer-
submitted news corpus show that existing al-
gorithms are efficient enough to deal with
large scale ontologies but need to be extended
to deal with undefined values and some mea-
sure for information salience.
