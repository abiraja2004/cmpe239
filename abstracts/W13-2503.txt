This paper presents an extension of the
standard approach used for bilingual lex-
icon extraction from comparable corpora.
We study of the ambiguity problem re-
vealed by the seed bilingual dictionary
used to translate context vectors. For
this purpose, we augment the standard ap-
proach by a Word Sense Disambiguation
process relying on a WordNet-based se-
mantic similarity measure. The aim of
this process is to identify the translations
that are more likely to give the best rep-
resentation of words in the target lan-
guage. On two specialized French-English
comparable corpora, empirical experimen-
tal results show that the proposed method
consistently outperforms the standard ap-
proach.
