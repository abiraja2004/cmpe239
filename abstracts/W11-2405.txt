 
Common evaluation metrics for paraphrase 
patterns do not necessarily correlate with 
extrinsic recognition task performance. We 
propose a metric which gives weight to lex-
ical variety in paraphrase patterns; our pro-
posed metric has a positive correlation with 
paraphrase recognition task performance, 
with a Pearson correlation of 0.5~0.7 (k=10, 
with ?strict? judgment) in a statistically sig-
nificant level (p-value<0.01).
