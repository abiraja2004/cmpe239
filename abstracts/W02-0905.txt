Natural language parsing requires ex-
tensive lexicons containing subcategori-
sation information for specific sublan-
guages. This paper describes an unsuper-
vised method for acquiring both syntac-
tic and semantic subcategorisation restric-
tions from corpora. Special attention will
be paid to the role of co-composition in
the acquisition strategy. The acquired in-
formation is used for lexicon tuning and
parsing improvement.
