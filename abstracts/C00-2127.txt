 
We have developed a summarization method that creates a snmmary suitable for tim p,'ocess of  
sifting information retrieval results. Unlike conventional methods that extract ilnportant sen- 
tences, this method constructs short phrases to reduce the burden of reading long sentences. We 
have developed a prototype summarization system tbr Japanese. Through a rather large-scale task~ 
based experiment, he sumnmry this system creates proved to be effective to sift IR results. This 
summarization method is also applicable to other languages such as English.
