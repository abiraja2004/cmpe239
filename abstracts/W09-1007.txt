The problem of identifying and correcting
confusibles, i.e. context-sensitive spelling
errors, in text is typically tackled using
specifically trained machine learning clas-
sifiers. For each different set of con-
fusibles, a specific classifier is trained and
tuned.
In this research, we investigate a more
generic approach to context-sensitive con-
fusible correction. Instead of using spe-
cific classifiers, we use one generic clas-
sifier based on a language model. This
measures the likelihood of sentences with
different possible solutions of a confusible
in place. The advantage of this approach
is that all confusible sets are handled by
a single model. Preliminary results show
that the performance of the generic clas-
sifier approach is only slightly worse that
that of the specific classifier approach.
