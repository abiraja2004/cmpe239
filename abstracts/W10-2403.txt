 
This report documents the details of the Trans-
literation Mining Shared Task that was run as 
a part of the Named Entities Workshop 
(NEWS 2010), an ACL 2010 workshop.  The 
shared task featured mining of name translite-
rations from the paired Wikipedia titles in 5 
different language pairs, specifically, between 
English and one of Arabic, Chinese, Hindi 
Russian and Tamil.  Totally 5 groups took part 
in this shared task, participating in multiple 
mining tasks in different languages pairs.  The 
methodology and the data sets used in this 
shared task are published in the Shared Task 
White Paper [Kumaran et al 2010]. We meas-
ure and report 3 metrics on the submitted re-
sults to calibrate the performance of individual 
systems on a commonly available Wikipedia 
dataset.  We believe that the significant contri-
bution of this shared task is in (i) assembling a 
diverse set of participants working in the area 
of transliteration mining, (ii) creating a base-
line performance of transliteration mining sys-
tems in a set of diverse languages using com-
monly available Wikipedia data, and (iii) pro-
viding a basis for meaningful comparison and 
analysis of trade-offs between various algo-
rithmic approaches used in mining.  We be-
lieve that this shared task would complement 
the NEWS 2010 transliteration generation 
shared task, in enabling development of prac-
tical systems with a small amount of seed data 
in a given pair of languages.
