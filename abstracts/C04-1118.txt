This paper introduces the ?Gendercheck
Editor?, a tool to check German texts for
gender discriminatory formulations. It re-
lays on shallow rule-based techniques as
used in the Controlled Language Author-
ing Technology (CLAT). The paper outlines
major sources of gender imbalances in Ger-
man texts. It gives a background on the
underlying CLAT technology and describes
the marking and annotation strategy to au-
tomatically detect and visualize the ques-
tionable pieces of text. The paper provides
a detailed evaluation of the editor.
