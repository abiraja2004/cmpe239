This paper investigates cross-lingual textual
entailment as a semantic relation between two
text portions in different languages, and pro-
poses a prospective research direction. We
argue that cross-lingual textual entailment
(CLTE) can be a core technology for sev-
eral cross-lingual NLP applications and tasks.
Through preliminary experiments, we aim at
proving the feasibility of the task, and provid-
ing a reliable baseline. We also introduce new
applications for CLTE that will be explored in
future work.
