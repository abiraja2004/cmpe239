 
Mapping between syntax and semantics is one
of the most promising research topics in cor-
pus annotation. This paper deals with the im-
plementation of an semi-automatic
transformation from a syntactically-tagged
corpus into a semantic-tagged one. The
method has been experimentally applied to a
1600-sentence treebank (the UAM Spanish
Treebank). Results of evaluation  are provided
as well as prospective work in comparing
syntax and semantics in written and spoken
annotated corpora.
