This paper presents a corpus-based ac-
count of structural priming in human sen-
tence processing, focusing on the role that
syntactic representations play in such an
account. We estimate the strength of struc-
tural priming effects from a corpus of
spontaneous spoken dialogue, annotated
syntactically with Combinatory Catego-
rial Grammar (CCG) derivations. This
methodology allows us to test a range of
predictions that CCG makes about prim-
ing. In particular, we present evidence
for priming between lexical and syntactic
categories encoding partially satisfied sub-
categorization frames, and we show that
priming effects exist both for incremental
and normal-form CCG derivations.
