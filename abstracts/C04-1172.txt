Emdros is a text database engine for linguistic
analysis or annotation of text. It is applicca-
ble especially in corpus linguistics for storing
and retrieving linguistic analyses of text, at any
linguistic level. Emdros implements the EMdF
text database model and the MQL query lan-
guage. In this paper, I present both, and give an
example of how Emdros can be useful in com-
putational linguistics.
