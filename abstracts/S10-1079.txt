This paper presents an unsupervised
graph-based method for automatic word
sense induction and disambiguation. The
innovative part of our method is the as-
signment of either a word or a word pair
to each vertex of the constructed graph.
Word senses are induced by clustering the
constructed graph. In the disambiguation
stage, each induced cluster is scored ac-
cording to the number of its vertices found
in the context of the target word. Our sys-
tem participated in SemEval-2010 word
sense induction and disambiguation task.
