To enhance the technology for computing
semantic equivalence, we introduce the no-
tion of phrasal thesaurus which is a natural
extension of conventional word-based the-
saurus. Among a variety of phrases that
conveys the same meaning, i.e., paraphrases,
we focus on syntactic variants that are com-
positionally explainable using a small num-
ber of atomic knowledge, and develop a sys-
tem which dynamically generates such vari-
ants. This paper describes the proposed sys-
tem and three sorts of knowledge developed
for dynamic phrasal thesaurus in Japanese:
(i) transformation pattern, (ii) generation
function, and (iii) lexical function.
