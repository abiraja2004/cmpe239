The lack of sentence boundaries and presence of dis-
fluencies pose difficulties for parsing conversational
speech. This work investigates the effects of au-
tomatically detecting these phenomena on a proba-
bilistic parser?s performance. We demonstrate that a
state-of-the-art segmenter, relative to a pause-based
segmenter, gives more than 45% of the possible er-
ror reduction in parser performance, and that presen-
tation of interruption points to the parser improves
performance over using sentence boundaries alone.
