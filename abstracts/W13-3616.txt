 
This paper presents a hybrid model for the 
CoNLL-2013 shared task which focuses on the 
problem of grammatical error correction. This 
year?s task includes determiner, preposition, 
noun number, verb form, and subject-verb 
agreement errors which is more comprehen-
sive than previous error correction tasks. We 
correct these five types of errors in different 
modules where either machine learning based 
or rule-based methods are applied. Pre-
processing and post-processing procedures are 
employed to keep idiomatic phrases from be-
ing corrected. We achieved precision of 
35.65%, recall of 16.56%, F1 of 22.61% in the 
official evaluation and precision of 41.75%, 
recall of 20.29%, F1 of 27.3% in the revised 
version. Some further comparisons employing 
different strategies are made in our experi-
ments.
