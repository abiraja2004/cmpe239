In statistical machine translation, large
numbers of parallel sentences are required
to train the model parameters. However,
plenty of the bilingual language resources
available on web are aligned only at the
document level. To exploit this data,
we have to extract the bilingual sentences
from these documents.
The common method is to break the doc-
uments into segments using predefined
anchor words, then these segments are
aligned. This approach is not error free,
incorrect alignments may decrease the
translation quality.
We present an alternative approach to ex-
tract the parallel sentences by partitioning
a bilingual document into two pairs. This
process is performed recursively until all
the sub-pairs are short enough.
In experiments on the Chinese-English
FBIS data, our method was capable of
producing translation results comparable
to those of a state-of-the-art sentence
aligner. Using a combination of the two
approaches leads to better translation per-
formance.
