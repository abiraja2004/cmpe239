Word fragments pose serious problems for
speech recognizers. Accurate identification of
word fragments will not only improve recogni-
tion accuracy, but also be very helpful for dis-
fluency detection algorithm because the occur-
rence of word fragments is a good indicator of
speech disfluencies. Different from the previ-
ous effort of including word fragments in the
acoustic model, in this paper, we investigate the
problem of word fragment identification from
another approach, i.e. building classifiers using
acoustic-prosodic features. Our experiments
show that, by combining a few voice quality
measures and prosodic features extracted from
the forced alignments with the human tran-
scriptions, we obtain a precision rate of 74.3%
and a recall rate of 70.1% on the downsampled
data of spontaneous speech. The overall accu-
racy is 72.9%, which is significantly better than
chance performance of 50%.
