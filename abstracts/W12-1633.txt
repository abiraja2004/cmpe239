This paper proposes a probabilistic approach
to the resolution of referring expressions for
task-oriented dialogue systems. The approach
resolves descriptions, anaphora, and deixis in
a unified manner. In this approach, the notion
of reference domains serves an important role
to handle context-dependent attributes of enti-
ties and references to sets. The evaluation with
the REX-J corpus shows promising results.
