 
We have developed an improved task-based 
evaluation method of summarization, the 
accuracy of which is increased by specifying 
the details of the task including background 
stories, and by assigning ten subjects per 
summary sample. The method also serves 
precision/recall pairs for a variety of situa- 
tions by introducing multiple levels of 
relevance assessment. The method is applied 
to prove phrase-represented summary is 
most effective to select relevant documents 
from information retrieval results.
