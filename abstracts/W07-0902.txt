An alignment method based on the Viterbi
algorithm is proposed to find mappings be-
tween word images of a given handwrit-
ten document and their respective (ASCII)
words on its transcription. The approach
takes advantage of the underlying segmen-
tation made by Viterbi decoding in hand-
written text recognition based on Hidden
Markov Models (HMMs). Two HMMs
modelling schemes are evaluated: one using
78-HMMs (one HMM per character class)
and other using a unique HMM to model all
the characters and another to model blank
spaces. According to various metrics used
to measure the quality of the alignments, en-
couraging results are obtained.
