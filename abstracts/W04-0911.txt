Discourse in formal domains, such as mathematics,
is characterized by a mixture of telegraphic natu-
ral language and embedded (semi-)formal symbolic
mathematical expressions. Due to the lack of em-
pirical data, little is known about the suitability of
input analysis methods for mathematical discourse
in a dialog setting. We present an input understand-
ing method for a tutoring system teaching mathe-
matical theorem proving. The adopted deep anal-
ysis strategy is motivated by the complexity of the
language phenomena observed in a corpus collected
in a Wizard-of-Oz experiment. Our goal is a uni-
form input interpretation, in particular, considering
different degrees of formality of natural language
verbalizations.
