Two analyses of Ma?ori passives and gerunds
have been debated in the literature. Both as-
sume that the thematic consonants in these
forms are unpredictable. This paper reports
on three computational experiments designed
to test whether this assumption is sound. The
results suggest that thematic consonants are
predictable from the phonotactic probabilities
of their active counterparts. This study has
potential implications for allomorphy in other
Polynesian languages. It also exemplifies the
benefits of using computational methods in
linguistic analyses.
