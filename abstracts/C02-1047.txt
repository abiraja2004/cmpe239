We describe a mechanism for the interpretation of
arguments, which can cope with noisy conditions
in terms of wording, beliefs and argument struc-
ture. This is achieved through the application of
the Minimum Message Length Principle to evalu-
ate candidate interpretations. Our system receives
as input a quasi-Natural Language argument, where
propositions are presented in English, and gener-
ates an interpretation of the argument in the form
of a Bayesian network (BN). Performance was eval-
uated by distorting the system?s arguments (gener-
ated from a BN) and feeding them to the system for
interpretation. In 75% of the cases, the interpreta-
tions produced by the system matched precisely or
almost-precisely the representation of the original
arguments.
