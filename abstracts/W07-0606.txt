We present a cognitive model of inducing
verb selectional preferences from individ-
ual verb usages. The selectional preferences
for each verb argument are represented as
a probability distribution over the set of
semantic properties that the argument can
possess?a semantic profile. The seman-
tic profiles yield verb-specific conceptual-
izations of the arguments associated with a
syntactic position. The proposed model can
learn appropriate verb profiles from a small
set of noisy training data, and can use them
in simulating human plausibility judgments
and analyzing implicit object alternation.
