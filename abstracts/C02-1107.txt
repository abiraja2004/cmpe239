This paper proposes a method of speech inten-
tion understanding based on dialogue examples.
The method uses a spoken dialogue corpus with
intention tags to regard the intention of each in-
put utterance as that of the sentence to which it
is the most similar in the corpus. The degree of
similarity is calculated according to the degree
of correspondence in morphemes and dependen-
cies between sentences, and it is weighted by
the dialogue context information. An exper-
iment on inference of utterance intentions us-
ing a large-scale in-car spoken dialogue corpus
of CIAIR has shown 68.9% accuracy. Further-
more, we have developed a prototype system of
in-car spoken dialogue processing for a restau-
rant retrieval task based on our method, and
confirmed the feasiblity of the system.
