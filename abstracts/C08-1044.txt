 
As Chinese text is written without word 
boundaries, effectively recognizing Chi-
nese words is like recognizing colloca-
tions in English, substituting characters 
for words and words for collocations. 
However, existing topical models that in-
volve collocations have a common limi-
tation. Instead of directly assigning a top-
ic to a collocation, they take the topic of 
a word within the collocation as the topic 
of the whole collocation. This is unsatis-
factory for topical modeling of Chinese 
documents. Thus, we propose a topical 
word-character model (TWC), which al-
lows two distinct types of topics: word 
topic and character topic. We evaluated 
TWC both qualitatively and 
quantitatively to show that it is a power-
ful and a promising topic model.
