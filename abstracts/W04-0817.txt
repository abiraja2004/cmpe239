We describe a system for semantic role assignment
built as part of the Senseval III task, based on an
off-the-shelf parser and Maxent and Memory-Based
learners. We focus on generalisation using several
similarity measures to increase the amount of train-
ing data available and on the use of EM-based clus-
tering to improve role assignment. Our final score
is Precision=73.6%, Recall=59.4% (F=65.7).
