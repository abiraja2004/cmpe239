. Ordering information is a difficult but a important task for
natural language generation applications. A wrong order of information
not only makes it difficult to understand, but also conveys an entirely
different idea to the reader. This paper proposes an algorithm that learns
orderings from a set of human ordered texts. Our model consists of a set
of ordering experts. Each expert gives its precedence preference between
two sentences. We combine these preferences and order sentences. We
also propose two new metrics for the evaluation of sentence orderings.
Our experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms
the existing methods in all evaluation metrics.
