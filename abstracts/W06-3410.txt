 This research is aimed at understanding the dynamics of collaborative multi-party dis-course across multiple communication mo-dalities. Before we can truly make significant strides in devising collaborative communica-tion systems, there is a need to understand how typical users utilize computationally sup-ported communications mechanisms such as email, instant messaging, video conferencing, chat rooms, etc., both singularly and in con-junction with traditional means of communi-cation such as face-to-face meetings, telephone calls and postal mail. Attempting to understand an individual?s communications profile with access to only a single modality is challenging at best and often futile. Here, we discuss the development of RACE ? Retro-spective Analysis of Communications Events ? a test-bed prototype to investigate issues re-lating to multi-modal multi-party discourse. We also examine future avenues of research for further enhancing our prototype and inves-tigating this area.
