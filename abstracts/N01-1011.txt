This paper presents a corpus-based approach to
word sense disambiguation where a decision tree as-
signs a sense to an ambiguous word based on the
bigrams that occur nearby. This approach is evalu-
ated using the sense-tagged corpora from the 1998
SENSEVAL word sense disambiguation exercise. It
is more accurate than the average results reported
for 30 of 36 words, and is more accurate than the
best results for 19 of 36 words.
