We identify a set of prosodic cues for parsing con-
versational speech and show how such features can
be effectively incorporated into a statistical parsing
model. On the Switchboard corpus of conversa-
tional speech, the system achieves improved parse
accuracy over a state-of-the-art system which uses
only lexical and syntactic features. Since removal
of edit regions is known to improve downstream
parse accuracy, we explore alternatives for edit de-
tection and show that PCFGs are not competitive
with more specialized techniques.
