This paper describes our ongoing research
project on text simplification for congenitally
deaf people. Text simplification we are aiming
at is the task of offering a deaf reader a syn-
tactic and lexical paraphrase of a given text for
assisting her/him to understand what it means.
In this paper, we discuss the issues we should
address to realize text simplification and re-
port on the present results in three different
aspects of this task: readability assessment,
paraphrase representation and post-transfer er-
ror detection.
