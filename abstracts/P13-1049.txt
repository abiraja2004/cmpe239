This paper proposes a new method for
significantly improving the performance
of pairwise coreference models. Given a
set of indicators, our method learns how
to best separate types of mention pairs
into equivalence classes for which we con-
struct distinct classification models. In ef-
fect, our approach finds an optimal fea-
ture space (derived from a base feature set
and indicator set) for discriminating coref-
erential mention pairs. Although our ap-
proach explores a very large space of pos-
sible feature spaces, it remains tractable
by exploiting the structure of the hierar-
chies built from the indicators. Our exper-
iments on the CoNLL-2012 Shared Task
English datasets (gold mentions) indicate
that our method is robust relative to dif-
ferent clustering strategies and evaluation
metrics, showing large and consistent im-
provements over a single pairwise model
using the same base features. Our best
system obtains a competitive 67.2 of aver-
age F1 over MUC, B3, and CEAF which,
despite its simplicity, places it above the
mean score of other systems on these
datasets.
