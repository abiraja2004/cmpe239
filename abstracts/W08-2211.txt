Recent work on automatically predicting the predominant sense of a word
has proven to be promising (McCarthy et al, 2004). It can be applied (as a
first sense heuristic) to Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) tasks, without
needing expensive hand-annotated data sets. Due to the big skew in the
sense distribution of many words (Yarowsky and Florian, 2002), the First
Sense heuristic for WSD is often hard to beat. However, the local context
of an ambiguous word can give important clues to which of its senses was
intended. The sense ranking method proposed by McCarthy et al (2004)
uses a distributional similarity thesaurus. The k nearest neighbours in the
thesaurus are used to establish the predominant sense of a word. In this
paper we report on a first investigation on how to use the grammatical
relations the target word is involved with, in order to select a subset of
the neighbours from the automatically created thesaurus, to take the local
context into account. This unsupervised method is quantitatively evalu-
ated on SemCor. We found a slight improvement in precision over using
the predicted first sense. Finally, we discuss strengths and weaknesses of
the method and suggest ways to improve the results in the future.
