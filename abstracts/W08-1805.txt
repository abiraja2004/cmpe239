Automated answering of natural language
questions is an interesting and useful prob-
lem to solve. Question answering (QA)
systems often perform information re-
trieval at an initial stage. Information re-
trieval (IR) performance, provided by en-
gines such as Lucene, places a bound on
overall system performance. For example,
no answer bearing documents are retrieved
at low ranks for almost 40% of questions.
In this paper, answer texts from previous
QA evaluations held as part of the Text
REtrieval Conferences (TREC) are paired
with queries and analysed in an attempt
to identify performance-enhancing words.
These words are then used to evaluate the
performance of a query expansion method.
Data driven extension words were found
to help in over 70% of difficult questions.
These words can be used to improve and
evaluate query expansion methods. Sim-
ple blind relevance feedback (RF) was cor-
rectly predicted as unlikely to help overall
performance, and an possible explanation
is provided for its low value in IR for QA.
