Kleene is a high-level programming language,
based on the OpenFst library, for constructing
and manipulating finite-state acceptors and
transducers. Users can program using reg-
ular expressions, alternation-rule syntax and
right-linear phrase-structure grammars; and
Kleene provides variables, lists, functions and
familiar program-control syntax. Kleene has
been approved by SAP AG for release as free,
open-source code under the Apache License,
Version 2.0, and will be available by Au-
gust 2012 for downloading from http://
www.kleene-lang.org. The design, im-
plementation, development status and future
plans for the language are discussed.
