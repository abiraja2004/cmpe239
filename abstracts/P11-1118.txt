We evaluate several popular models of local
discourse coherence for domain and task gen-
erality by applying them to chat disentangle-
ment. Using experiments on synthetic multi-
party conversations, we show that most mod-
els transfer well from text to dialogue. Co-
herence models improve results overall when
good parses and topic models are available,
and on a constrained task for real chat data.
