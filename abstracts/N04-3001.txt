We present the new multilingual version of
the Columbia Newsblaster news summariza-
tion system. The system addresses the problem
of user access to browsing news from multiple
languages from multiple sites on the internet.
The system automatically collects, organizes,
and summarizes news in multiple source lan-
guages, allowing the user to browse news top-
ics with English summaries, and compare per-
spectives from different countries on the topics.
