 In this paper we describe our recent and future research on multimodal interaction in an Ambient Assisted Living Lab. Our work combines two interaction modes, speech and gesture, for multiple device control in Ambient Assisted Living environments. We conducted a user study concerning multimodal interaction between participants and an intelligent wheelchair in a smart home environment. Important empirical data were collected through the user study, which encouraged further developments on our multi-modal interactive system for Ambient Assisted Living environments. 1
