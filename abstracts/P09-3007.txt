Data-driven function tag assignment has
been studied for English using Penn Tree-
bank data. In this paper, we address
the question of whether such method can
be applied to other languages and Tree-
bank resources. In addition to simply
extend previous method from English to
Chinese, we also proposed an effective
way to recognize function tags directly
from lexical information, which is eas-
ily scalable for languages that lack suf-
ficient parsing resources or have inher-
ent linguistic challenges for parsing. We
investigated a supervised sequence learn-
ing method to automatically recognize
function tags, which achieves an F-score
of 0.938 on gold-standard POS (Part-of-
Speech) tagged Chinese text ? a statisti-
cally significant improvement over exist-
ing Chinese function label assignment sys-
tems. Results show that a small number
of linguistically motivated lexical features
are sufficient to achieve comparable per-
formance to systems using sophisticated
parse trees.
