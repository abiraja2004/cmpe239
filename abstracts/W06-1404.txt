We describe an implemented generator
for a spoken dialogue system that fol-
lows the ?overgeneration and ranking? ap-
proach. We find that overgeneration based
on bottom-up chart generation is well-
suited to a) model phenomena such as
alignment and variation in dialogue, and b)
address robustness issues in the face of im-
perfect generation input. We report evalu-
ation results of a first user study involving
20 subjects.
