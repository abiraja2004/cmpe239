We present a word substitution approach
to combine the output of different machine
translation systems. Using part of speech
information, candidate words are deter-
mined among possible translation options,
which in turn are estimated through a pre-
computed word alignment. Automatic
substitution is guided by several decision
factors, including part of speech, local
context, and language model probabili-
ties. The combination of these factors
is defined after careful manual analysis
of their respective impact. The approach
is tested for the language pair German-
English, however the general technique it-
self is language independent.
