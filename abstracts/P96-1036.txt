 
Based on empirical evidence from a free 
word order language (German) we propose a
fundamental revision of the principles guid- 
ing the ordering of discourse ntities in the 
forward-looking centers within the center- 
ing model. We claim that grammatical role 
criteria should be replaced by indicators 
of the functional information structure of 
the utterances, i.e., the distinction between 
context-bound and unbound iscourse le- 
ments. This claim is backed up by an empir- 
ical evaluation of functional centering.
