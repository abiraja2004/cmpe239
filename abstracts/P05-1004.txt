The limited coverage of lexical-semantic re-
sources is a significant problem for NLP sys-
tems which can be alleviated by automati-
cally classifying the unknown words. Su-
persense tagging assigns unknown nouns one
of 26 broad semantic categories used by lex-
icographers to organise their manual inser-
tion into WORDNET. Ciaramita and Johnson
(2003) present a tagger which uses synonym
set glosses as annotated training examples. We
describe an unsupervised approach, based on
vector-space similarity, which does not require
annotated examples but significantly outper-
forms their tagger. We also demonstrate the use
of an extremely large shallow-parsed corpus for
calculating vector-space semantic similarity.
