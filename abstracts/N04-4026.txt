In this paper, we present a unigram segmen-
tation model for statistical machine transla-
tion where the segmentation units are blocks:
pairs of phrases without internal structure. The
segmentation model uses a novel orientation
component to handle swapping of neighbor
blocks. During training, we collect block un-
igram counts with orientation: we count how
often a block occurs to the left or to the right of
some predecessor block. The orientation model
is shown to improve translation performance
over two models: 1) no block re-ordering is
used, and 2) the block swapping is controlled
only by a language model. We show exper-
imental results on a standard Arabic-English
translation task.
