This report documents the Translitera-
tion Generation Shared Task conducted as
a part of the Named Entities Workshop
(NEWS 2010), an ACL 2010 workshop.
The shared task features machine translit-
eration of proper names from English to
9 languages and from 3 languages to En-
glish. In total, 12 tasks are provided. 7
teams from 5 different countries partici-
pated in the evaluations. Finally, 33 stan-
dard and 8 non-standard runs are submit-
ted, where diverse transliteration method-
ologies are explored and reported on the
evaluation data. We report the results with
4 performance metrics. We believe that the
shared task has successfully achieved its
objective by providing a common bench-
marking platform for the research commu-
nity to evaluate the state-of-the-art tech-
nologies that benefit the future research
and development.
