 
As a task in SensEval-3, Automatic Labeling 
of Semantic Roles is to identify frame 
elements within a sentence and tag them with 
appropriate semantic roles given a sentence, a 
target word and its frame.  We apply 
Maximum Entropy classification with feature 
sets of syntactic patterns from parse trees and 
officially attain 80.2% precision and 65.4% 
recall.  When the frame element boundaries 
are given, the system performs 86.7% 
precision and 85.8% recall.
