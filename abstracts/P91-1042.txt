 
This paper presents a unification pro- 
cedure which eliminates the redundant 
copying of structures by using a lazy in- 
cremental copying appr0a~:h to achieve 
structure sharing. Copying of structures 
accounts for a considerable amount of 
the total processing time. Several meth- 
ods have been proposed to minimize the 
amount of necessary copying. Lazy In- 
cremental Copying (LIC) is presented as 
a new solution to the copying problem. 
It synthesizes ideas of lazy copying with 
the notion of chronological dereferencing 
for achieving a high amount of structure 
sharing.
