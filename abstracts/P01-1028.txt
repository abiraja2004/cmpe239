While the generative view of language
processing builds bigger units out of
smaller ones by means of rewriting
steps, the axiomatic view eliminates in-
valid linguistic structures out of a set of
possible structures by means of well-
formedness principles. We present a
generator based on the axiomatic view
and argue that when combined with a
TAG-like grammar and a flat seman-
tics, this axiomatic view permits avoid-
ing drawbacks known to hold either of
top-down or of bottom-up generators.
