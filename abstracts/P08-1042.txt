We outline the problem of ad hoc rules in
treebanks, rules used for specific construc-
tions in one data set and unlikely to be used
again. These include ungeneralizable rules,
erroneous rules, rules for ungrammatical text,
and rules which are not consistent with the rest
of the annotation scheme. Based on a sim-
ple notion of rule equivalence and on the idea
of finding rules unlike any others, we develop
two methods for detecting ad hoc rules in flat
treebanks and show they are successful in de-
tecting such rules. This is done by examin-
ing evidence across the grammar and without
making any reference to context.
