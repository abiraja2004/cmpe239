We explore how features based on syntac-
tic dependency relations can be utilized to
improve performance on opinion mining.
Using a transformation of dependency re-
lation triples, we convert them into ?com-
posite back-off features? that generalize
better than the regular lexicalized depen-
dency relation features. Experiments com-
paring our approach with several other ap-
proaches that generalize dependency fea-
tures or ngrams demonstrate the utility of
composite back-off features.
