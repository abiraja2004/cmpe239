As part of the STATEMENT MAP project,
we are constructing a Japanese corpus an-
notated with the semantic relations bridg-
ing facts and opinions that are necessary
for online information credibility evalua-
tion. In this paper, we identify the se-
mantic relations essential to this task and
discuss how to efficiently collect valid ex-
amples from Web documents by splitting
complex sentences into fundamental units
of meaning called ?statements? and an-
notating relations at the statement level.
We present a statement annotation scheme
and examine its reliability by annotating
around 1,500 pairs of statements. We are
preparing the corpus for release this win-
ter.
