Dative variation is a widely observed syn-
tactic phenomenon in world languages
(e.g. I gave John a book and I gave a book
to John). It has been shown that which
surface form will be used in a dative sen-
tence is not a completely random choice,
rather, it is conditioned by a wide range
of linguistic factors. Previous work by
Bresnan and colleagues adopted a statis-
tical modeling approach to investigate the
probabilistic trends in English dative alter-
nation. In this paper, we report a similar
study on Mandarin Chinese. We further
developed Bresnan et al?s models to suit
the complexity of the Chinese data. Our
models effectively explain away a large
proportion of the variation in the data, and
unveil some interesting probabilistic fea-
tures of Chinese grammar. Among other
things, we show that Chinese dative varia-
tion is sensitive to heavy NP shift in both
left and right directions.
