: Terminologies are specialized words and compound words used in a particular domain, such as 
computer science. Since they are very common in scientific articles, the ability to automatic identification f
terminology could greatly assist any domain related natural language processing applications. Unfortunately, 
the collection of terminology information is very difficult and requires much tedious and time consuming 
manual work. In this paper, a semi-automatic approach isdeveloped to extract technical words and phrases 
from on-line corpora. This approach can significantly reduce the manual effort in the generation of 
terminology dictionary. First, those domain specific words which have no entries in the universal dictionary 
are identified. Second, terminology words are extracted from these new words as well as the universal 
dictionary. Then compound words are extracted from the combination of terminology words and other 
words. The final computer terminology dictionary contains 1,034 words and 3,471 compound words. 
Experiment shows that 89.5 percent of all the occurrences ofcomputer terminology can be identified with 
this terminology dictionary.
