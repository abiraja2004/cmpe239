 
In this paper we present a simplified shallow 
semantic parsing approach to learning the 
scope of negation (SoN). This is done by 
formulating it as a shallow semantic parsing 
problem with the negation signal as the 
predicate and the negation scope as its ar-
guments. Our parsing approach to SoN 
learning differs from the state-of-the-art 
chunking ones in two aspects. First, we ex-
tend SoN learning from the chunking level 
to the parse tree level, where structured syn-
tactic information is available. Second, we 
focus on determining whether a constituent, 
rather than a word, is negated or not, via a 
simplified shallow semantic parsing frame-
work. Evaluation on the BioScope corpus 
shows that structured syntactic information 
is effective in capturing the domination rela-
tionship between a negation signal and its 
dominated arguments. It also shows that our 
parsing approach much outperforms the 
state-of-the-art chunking ones.
