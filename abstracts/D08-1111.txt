This paper presents a novel, ranking-style
word segmentation approach, called RSVM-
Seg, which is well tailored to Chinese informa-
tion retrieval(CIR). This strategy makes seg-
mentation decision based on the ranking of the
internal associative strength between each pair
of adjacent characters of the sentence. On the
training corpus composed of query items, a
ranking model is learned by a widely-used tool
Ranking SVM, with some useful statistical
features, such as mutual information, differ-
ence of t-test, frequency and dictionary infor-
mation. Experimental results show that, this
method is able to eliminate overlapping am-
biguity much more effectively, compared to
the current word segmentation methods. Fur-
thermore, as this strategy naturally generates
segmentation results with different granular-
ity, the performance of CIR systems is im-
proved and achieves the state of the art.
