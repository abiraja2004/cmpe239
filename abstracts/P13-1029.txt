In this paper, we consider the problem
of cross-formalism transfer in parsing.
We are interested in parsing constituency-
based grammars such as HPSG and CCG
using a small amount of data specific for
the target formalism, and a large quan-
tity of coarse CFG annotations from the
Penn Treebank. While all of the target
formalisms share a similar basic syntactic
structure with Penn Treebank CFG, they
also encode additional constraints and se-
mantic features. To handle this appar-
ent discrepancy, we design a probabilistic
model that jointly generates CFG and tar-
get formalism parses. The model includes
features of both parses, allowing trans-
fer between the formalisms, while pre-
serving parsing efficiency. We evaluate
our approach on three constituency-based
grammars ? CCG, HPSG, and LFG, aug-
mented with the Penn Treebank-1. Our ex-
periments show that across all three for-
malisms, the target parsers significantly
benefit from the coarse annotations.1
