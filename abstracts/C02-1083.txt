  
In this paper we propose an integrated knowledge 
management system in which terminology-based 
knowledge acquisition, knowledge integration, 
and XML-based knowledge retrieval are 
combined using tag information and ontology 
management tools. The main objective of the 
system is to facilitate knowledge acquisition 
through query answering against XML-based 
documents in the domain of molecular biology. 
Our system integrates automatic term recognition, 
term variation management, context-based 
automatic term clustering, ontology-based 
inference, and intelligent tag information retrieval. 
Tag-based retrieval is implemented through 
interval operations, which prove to be a powerful 
means for textual mining and knowledge 
acquisition. The aim is to provide efficient access 
to heterogeneous biological textual data and 
databases, enabling users to integrate a wide 
range of textual and non-textual resources 
effortlessly.
