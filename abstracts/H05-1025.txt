We explore the benefit that users in sev-
eral application areas can experience from
a ?tab-complete? editing assistance func-
tion. We develop an evaluation metric
and adapt N -gram language models to
the problem of predicting the subsequent
words, given an initial text fragment. Us-
ing an instance-based method as base-
line, we empirically study the predictabil-
ity of call-center emails, personal emails,
weather reports, and cooking recipes.
