This paper presents a Native Language Iden-
tification (NLI) system based on TF-IDF
weighting schemes and using linear classi-
fiers - support vector machines, logistic re-
gressions and perceptrons. The system was
one of the participants of the 2013 NLI Shared
Task in the closed-training track, achieving
0.814 overall accuracy for a set of 11 native
languages. This accuracy was only 2.2 per-
centage points lower than the winner?s perfor-
mance. Furthermore, with subsequent evalua-
tions using 10-fold cross-validation (as given
by the organizers) on the combined training
and development data, the best average accu-
racy obtained is 0.8455 and the features that
contributed to this accuracy are the TF-IDF of
the combined unigrams and bigrams of words.
