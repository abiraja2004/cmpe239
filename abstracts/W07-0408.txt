In this paper we explore a generative
model for recovering surface syntax and
strings from deep-syntactic tree structures.
Deep analysis has been proposed for a
number of language and speech process-
ing tasks, such as machine translation and
paraphrasing of speech transcripts. In an
effort to validate one such formalism of
deep syntax, the Praguian Tectogrammat-
ical Representation (TR), we present a
model of synthesis for English which gen-
erates surface-syntactic trees as well as
strings. We propose a generative model
for function word insertion (prepositions,
definite/indefinite articles, etc.) and sub-
phrase reordering. We show by way of
empirical results that this model is ef-
fective in constructing acceptable English
sentences given impoverished trees.
