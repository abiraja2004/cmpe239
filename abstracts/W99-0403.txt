 
The Rosetta Stone TM is a successful CD- 
ROM based interactive program for teaching 
foreign languages, that uses speech 
comparison to help students improve their 
pronunciation. The input to a speech 
comparison system is N+I digitised 
utterances. The output is a measure of the 
similarity of the last utterance to each of the 
N others. Which language is being spoken 
is irrelevant. This differs from classical 
speech recognition where the input data 
includes but one utterance, a set of 
expectations tuned to the particular language 
in use (typically digraphs or similar), and a 
grammar of expected words or phrases, and 
the output is recognition in the utterance of 
one of the phrases in the grammar (or 
rejection). This paper describes a speech 
comparison system and its application in 
The Rosetta Stone TM.
