We present a method for automatically
generating input parsers from English
specifications of input file formats. We
use a Bayesian generative model to cap-
ture relevant natural language phenomena
and translate the English specification into
a specification tree, which is then trans-
lated into a C++ input parser. We model
the problem as a joint dependency pars-
ing and semantic role labeling task. Our
method is based on two sources of infor-
mation: (1) the correlation between the
text and the specification tree and (2) noisy
supervision as determined by the success
of the generated C++ parser in reading in-
put examples. Our results show that our
approach achieves 80.0% F-Score accu-
racy compared to an F-Score of 66.7%
produced by a state-of-the-art semantic
parser on a dataset of input format speci-
fications from the ACM International Col-
legiate Programming Contest (which were
written in English for humans with no in-
tention of providing support for automated
processing).1
