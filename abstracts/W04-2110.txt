 
A very large Russian dictionary is described. It contains currently 3.6 million links between its 120,000 entries. The links are syntagmatic (collocations), paradigmatic (WordNet-like), or paronymic (words similar in letters or in morphs). The entries of the dictionary are sin-gle- or multiwords belonging to four main POS. The entries represent so-called gram-memes rather than lexemes: e.g., nouns are represented as singular and plural; verbs are split into ?finite forms + infinitive?, ?participle?, and ?gerund?. The multiword entries in turn can be collocations?idiomatic free?whose parts are also entries of the same dictionary.
