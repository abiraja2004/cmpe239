We present Minimum Bayes-Risk (MBR) de-
coding over translation lattices that compactly
encode a huge number of translation hypothe-
ses. We describe conditions on the loss func-
tion that will enable efficient implementation
of MBR decoders on lattices. We introduce
an approximation to the BLEU score (Pap-
ineni et al, 2001) that satisfies these condi-
tions. The MBR decoding under this approx-
imate BLEU is realized using Weighted Fi-
nite State Automata. Our experiments show
that the Lattice MBR decoder yields mod-
erate, consistent gains in translation perfor-
mance over N-best MBR decoding on Arabic-
to-English, Chinese-to-English and English-
to-Chinese translation tasks. We conduct a
range of experiments to understand why Lat-
tice MBR improves upon N-best MBR and
study the impact of various parameters on
MBR performance.
