A single word may have multiple un-
specified meanings in a corpus. Word
sense induction aims to discover these dif-
ferent meanings through word use, and
knowledge-lean algorithms attempt this
without using external lexical resources.
We propose a new method for identify-
ing the different senses that uses a flexi-
ble clustering strategy to automatically de-
termine the number of senses, rather than
predefining it. We demonstrate the effec-
tiveness using the SemEval-2 WSI task,
achieving competitive scores on both the
V-Measure and Recall metrics, depending
on the parameter configuration.
