In this paper, we describe a method of automatic
sentence alignment for building extracts from ab-
stracts in automatic summarization research. Our
method is based on two steps. First, we introduce
the ?dependency tree path? (DTP). Next, we calcu-
late the similarity between DTPs based on the ESK
(Extended String Subsequence Kernel), which con-
siders sequential patterns. By using these proce-
dures, we can derive one-to-many or many-to-one
correspondences among sentences. Experiments us-
ing different similarity measures show that DTP
consistently improves the alignment accuracy and
that ESK gives the best performance.
