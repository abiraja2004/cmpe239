A maximum entropy classifier is used in
our semantic role labeling system, which
takes syntactic constituents as the labeling
units. The maximum entropy classifier is
trained to identify and classify the predi-
cates? semantic arguments together. Only
the constituents with the largest probabil-
ity among embedding ones are kept. Af-
ter predicting all arguments which have
matching constituents in full parsing trees,
a simple rule-based post-processing is ap-
plied to correct the arguments which have
no matching constituents in these trees.
Some useful features and their combina-
tions are evaluated.
