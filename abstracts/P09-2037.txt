We would like to draw attention to Hid-
den Markov Tree Models (HMTM), which
are to our knowledge still unexploited in
the field of Computational Linguistics, in
spite of highly successful Hidden Markov
(Chain) Models. In dependency trees,
the independence assumptions made by
HMTM correspond to the intuition of lin-
guistic dependency. Therefore we suggest
to use HMTM and tree-modified Viterbi
algorithm for tasks interpretable as label-
ing nodes of dependency trees. In par-
ticular, we show that the transfer phase
in a Machine Translation system based
on tectogrammatical dependency trees can
be seen as a task suitable for HMTM.
When using the HMTM approach for
the English-Czech translation, we reach a
moderate improvement over the baseline.
