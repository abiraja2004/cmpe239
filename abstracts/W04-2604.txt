This paper presents a detailed account of
prepositional mismatch between our hand-
crafted verb lexicon and a semantically an-
notated corpus. The analysis of these mis-
matches allows us to rene the lexicon and
to create a more robust resource capable
of better semantic predictions based on the
verb-preposition relations.
