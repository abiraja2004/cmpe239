WordNet is a useful resource for lexi-
cal inference in applications. Inference
over predicates, however, often requires
a change in argument positions, which
is not specified in WordNet. We pro-
pose a novel framework for augmenting
WordNet-based inferences over predicates
with corresponding argument mappings.
We further present a concrete implementa-
tion of this framework, which yields sub-
stantial improvement to WordNet-based
inference.
