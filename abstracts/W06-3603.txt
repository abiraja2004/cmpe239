This paper presents a discriminative
parser that does not use a generative
model in any way, yet whose accu-
racy still surpasses a generative base-
line. The parser performs feature selec-
tion incrementally during training, as op-
posed to a priori, which enables it to
work well with minimal linguistic clever-
ness. The main challenge in building this
parser was fitting the training data into
memory. We introduce gradient sampling,
which increased training speed 100-fold.
