eration in the NEWS 2009 Machine Translit-
eration Shared Task adding source context 
modeling into state-of-the-art log-linear 
phrase-based statistical machine translation 
(PB-SMT). Source context features enable us 
to exploit source similarity in addition to tar-
get similarity, as modelled by the language 
model. We use a memory-based classification 
framework that enables efficient estimation of 
these features while avoiding data sparseness 
problems.We carried out experiments both at 
character and transliteration unit (TU) level. 
Position-dependent source context features 
produce significant improvements in terms of 
all evaluation metrics.
