In this paper we present a contextual ex-
tension to ONTOSCORE, a system for
scoring sets of concepts on the basis of
an ontology. We apply the contextually
enhanced system to the task of scoring
alternative speech recognition hypothe-
ses (SRH) in terms of their semantic co-
herence. We conducted several annota-
tion experiments and showed that human
annotators can reliably differentiate be-
tween semantically coherent and incoher-
ent speech recognition hypotheses (both
with and without discourse context). We
also showed, that annotators can reliably
identify the overall best hypothesis from
a given n-best list. While the original
ONTOSCORE system correctly assigns the
highest score to 84.06% of the corpus,
the inclusion of the conceptual context in-
creases the number of correct classifica-
tions to yield 86.76%, given a baseline of
63.91% in both cases.
