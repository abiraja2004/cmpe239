We describe two methods to improve SMT
accuracy using shallow syntax information.
First, we use chunks to refine the set of word
alignments typically used as a starting point in
SMT systems. Second, we extend an N -gram-
based SMT system with chunk tags to better
account for long-distance reorderings. Exper-
iments are reported on an Arabic-English task
showing significant improvements. A human
error analysis indicates that long-distance re-
orderings are captured effectively.
