Word sense disambiguation is the process of
determining which sense of a word is used
in a given context. Due to its importance in
understanding semantics of natural languages,
word sense disambiguation has been exten-
sively studied in Computational Linguistics.
However, existing methods either are brit-
tle and narrowly focus on specific topics or
words, or provide only mediocre performance
in real-world settings. Broad coverage and
disambiguation quality are critical for a word
sense disambiguation system. In this paper we
present a fully unsupervised word sense dis-
ambiguation method that requires only a dic-
tionary and unannotated text as input. Such an
automatic approach overcomes the problem of
brittleness suffered in many existing methods
and makes broad-coverage word sense dis-
ambiguation feasible in practice. We evalu-
ated our approach using SemEval 2007 Task
7 (Coarse-grained English All-words Task),
and our system significantly outperformed the
best unsupervised system participating in Se-
mEval 2007 and achieved the performance ap-
proaching top-performing supervised systems.
Although our method was only tested with
coarse-grained sense disambiguation, it can be
directly applied to fine-grained sense disam-
biguation.
