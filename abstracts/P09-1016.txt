This paper studies transliteration align-
ment, its evaluation metrics and applica-
tions. We propose a new evaluation met-
ric, alignment entropy, grounded on the
information theory, to evaluate the align-
ment quality without the need for the gold
standard reference and compare the metric
with F -score. We study the use of phono-
logical features and affinity statistics for
transliteration alignment at phoneme and
grapheme levels. The experiments show
that better alignment consistently leads to
more accurate transliteration. In transliter-
ation modeling application, we achieve a
mean reciprocal rate (MRR) of 0.773 on
Xinhua personal name corpus, a signifi-
cant improvement over other reported re-
sults on the same corpus. In transliteration
validation application, we achieve 4.48%
equal error rate on a large LDC corpus.
