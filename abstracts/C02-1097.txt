  
It is popular in WSD to use contextual 
information in training sense tagged data. 
Co-occurring words within a limited 
window-sized context support one sense 
among the semantically ambiguous ones of 
the word. This paper reports on word sense 
disambiguation of English words using 
static and dynamic sense vectors. First, 
context vectors are constructed using 
contextual words 1  in the training sense 
tagged data. Then, the words in the context 
vector are weighted with local density. 
Using the whole training sense tagged data, 
each sense of a target word2 is represented 
as a static sense vector in word space, which 
is the centroid of the context vectors. Then 
contextual noise is removed using a 
automatic selective sampling. A automatic 
selective sampling method use information 
retrieval technique, so as to enhance the 
discriminative power. In each test case, a 
automatic selective sampling method 
retrieves N relevant training samples to 
reduce noise. Using them, we construct 
another sense vectors for each sense of the 
target word. They are called dynamic sense 
vectors because they are changed according 
to a target word and its context. Finally, a 
word sense of a target word is determined 
using static and dynamic sense vectors. The 
English SENSEVAL test suit is used for this 
experimentation and our method produces 
relatively good results.
