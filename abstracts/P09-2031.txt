This paper presents an effective approach
to discard most entries of the rule table for
statistical machine translation. The rule ta-
ble is filtered by monolingual key phrases,
which are extracted from source text us-
ing a technique based on term extraction.
Experiments show that 78% of the rule ta-
ble is reduced without worsening trans-
lation performance. In most cases, our
approach results in measurable improve-
ments in BLEU score.
