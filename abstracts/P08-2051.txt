Automatic summarization evaluation is critical to
the development of summarization systems. While
ROUGE has been shown to correlate well with hu-
man evaluation for content match in text summa-
rization, there are many characteristics in multiparty
meeting domain, which may pose potential prob-
lems to ROUGE. In this paper, we carefully exam-
ine how well the ROUGE scores correlate with hu-
man evaluation for extractive meeting summariza-
tion. Our experiments show that generally the cor-
relation is rather low, but a significantly better cor-
relation can be obtained by accounting for several
unique meeting characteristics, such as disfluencies
and speaker information, especially when evaluating
system-generated summaries.
