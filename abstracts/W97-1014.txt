 
In this paper, we study the use of so-called 
word trigger pairs to improve an existing 
language model, which is typically a tri- 
gram model in combination with a cache 
component. A word trigger pair is de- 
fined as a long-distance word pair. We 
present two methods to select the most 
significant single word trigger pairs. The 
selected trigger pairs are used in a com- 
bined model where the interpolation pa- 
rameters and trigger interaction parame- 
ters are trained by the EM algorithm.
