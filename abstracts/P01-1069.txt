Many machine learning methods have
recently been applied to natural lan-
guage processing tasks. Among them,
the Winnow algorithm has been ar-
gued to be particularly suitable for NLP
problems, due to its robustness to ir-
relevant features. However in theory,
Winnow may not converge for non-
separable data. To remedy this prob-
lem, a modification called regularized
Winnow has been proposed. In this pa-
per, we apply this new method to text
chunking. We show that this method
achieves state of the art performance
with significantly less computation than
previous approaches.
