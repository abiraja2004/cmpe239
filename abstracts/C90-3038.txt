 
Word category prediction is used to implement an 
accurate word recognition system. Traditional statistical 
approaches require considerable training data to estimate 
the probabilities ofword sequences, and many parameters 
to memorize probabilities. Tosolve this problem, NETgram, 
which is the neural network for word category prediction, is
proposed. Training results how that the perfornmnce of tim 
NETgram is comparable to that of the statistical model 
;although the NETgram requires fewer parameters than the 
~;tatisticat model. Also the NETgram performs effectively 
?or unknown data, i.e., the NETgram interpolates sparse 
training data. Results of analyzing the hidden layer show 
that the word categories are classified into linguistically 
ti~ignificant groups. The results of applying the NETgram to 
HMM English word recognition show that the NETgram 
improves the word recognition rate fi'om 81.0% to 86.9%.
