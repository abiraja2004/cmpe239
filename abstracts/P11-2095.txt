Several results in the word segmentation liter-
ature suggest that description length provides
a useful estimate of segmentation quality in
fully unsupervised settings. However, since
the space of potential segmentations grows ex-
ponentially with the length of the corpus, no
tractable algorithm follows directly from the
Minimum Description Length (MDL) princi-
ple. Therefore, it is necessary to generate
a set of candidate segmentations and select
between them according to the MDL princi-
ple. We evaluate several algorithms for gen-
erating these candidate segmentations on a
range of natural language corpora, and show
that the Bootstrapped Voting Experts algo-
rithm consistently outperforms other methods
when paired with MDL.
