 
This work proposes a case-based classifier to tackle 
the gene/protein mention problem in biomedical lit-
erature. The so called gene mention problem con-
sists of the recognition of gene and protein entities in 
scientific texts. A classification process aiming at 
deciding if a term is a gene mention or not is carried 
out for each word in the text. It is based on the selec-
tion of the best or most similar case in a base of 
known and unknown cases. The approach was 
evaluated on several datasets for different organisms 
and results show the suitability of this approach for 
the gene mention problem.
