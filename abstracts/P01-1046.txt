Previous research has shown that the
plausibility of an adjective-noun com-
bination is correlated with its corpus
co-occurrence frequency. In this paper,
we estimate the co-occurrence frequen-
cies of adjective-noun pairs that fail to
occur in a 100 million word corpus
using smoothing techniques and com-
pare them to human plausibility rat-
ings. Both class-based smoothing and
distance-weighted averaging yield fre-
quency estimates that are significant
predictors of rated plausibility, which
provides independent evidence for the
validity of these smoothing techniques.
