 
In this paper, we report a survey of lan-
guage resources in Indonesia, primarily of 
indigenous languages. We look at the offi-
cial Indonesian language (Bahasa Indone-
sia) and 726 regional languages of Indone-
sia (Bahasa Nusantara) and list all the 
available lexical resources (LRs) that we 
can gathered. This paper suggests that the 
smaller regional languages may remain 
relatively unstudied, and unknown, but 
they are still worthy of our attention. Vari-
ous LRs of these endangered languages are 
being built and collected by regional lan-
guage centers for study and its preserva-
tion. We will also briefly report its pres-
ence on the Internet.
