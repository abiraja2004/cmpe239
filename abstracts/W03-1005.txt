This paper explores the problem of find-
ing non-local dependencies. First, we
isolate a set of features useful for this
task. Second, we develop both a two-step
approach which combines a trace tagger
with a state-of-the-art lexicalized parser
and a one-step approach which finds non-
local dependencies while parsing. We find
that the former outperforms the latter be-
cause it makes better use of the features
we isolate.
