We present a web service for natural language
parsing, prediction, generation, and translation
using grammars in Portable Grammar Format
(PGF), the target format of the Grammatical
Framework (GF) grammar compiler. The web
service implementation is open source, works
with any PGF grammar, and with any web
server that supports FastCGI. The service ex-
poses a simple interface which makes it pos-
sible to use it for interactive natural language
web applications. We describe the function-
ality and interface of the web service, and
demonstrate several applications built on top
of it.
