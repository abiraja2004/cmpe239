 
This paper attempts to systematize natural 
language analysis process by (I) use of a 
partitioned semantic network formalism as the 
meaning representation and (2) stepwise 
translation based on Montague Grammar. The 
meaning representation is obtained in two steps. 
The first step translates natural language into 
logical expression. The second step interprets 
logical expression to generate network 
structure. We have implemented set of programs 
which performs the stepwise translation. 
Experiments are in progress for machine 
translation and question answering.
