In statistical machine translation, an align-
ment defines a mapping between the
words in the source and in the target sen-
tence. Alignments are used, on the one
hand, to train the statistical models and, on
the other, during the decoding process to
link the words in the source sentence to the
words in the partial hypotheses generated.
In both cases, the quality of the alignments
is crucial for the success of the translation
process. In this paper, we propose an al-
gorithm based on an Estimation of Dis-
tribution Algorithm for computing align-
ments between two sentences in a paral-
lel corpus. This algorithm has been tested
on different tasks involving different pair
of languages. In the different experiments
presented here for the two word-alignment
shared tasks proposed in the HLT-NAACL
2003 and in the ACL 2005, the EDA-
based algorithm outperforms the best par-
ticipant systems.
