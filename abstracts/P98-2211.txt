 
This paper explores the possibilities and limits of a 
discourse grammar applied to spontaneous speech. 
Most discourse grammars (e.g. SDRT, Asher, 1993; 
RST, Mann & Thompson, 1988) tend to be descrip- 
tive theories of written discourse which presuppose 
a coherent structure. This structure is the outcome 
of a goal directed planning process on the part of 
the producer. In order to obtain a better understand- 
ing of the planning process we analyse spoken dis- 
course elicited in an experimental setting. Subjects 
describe the pixel-per-pixel development of sketch- 
maps on a computer screen. This forces the speak- 
ers to conceptualise the perceived state of affairs, 
plan their discourse, and produce a description of 
the drawing at the same time. Thus we find evi- 
dence for the planning process in the recorded ata 
and can show that the discourse structures are less 
globally coherent than those underlying written text. 
In our paper we discuss to what extent a flexible dis- 
course grammar based on a Tree Description Gram- 
mar (TDG) (Schilder, 1997) can handle such data.
