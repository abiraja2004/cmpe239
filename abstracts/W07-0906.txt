This article presents a method to extract and
query Cultural Heritage (CH) textual dig-
ital resources. The extraction and query-
ing phases are linked by a common on-
tological representation (CIDOC-CRM). A
transport format (RDF) allows the ontol-
ogy to be queried in a suitable query lan-
guage (SPARQL), on top of which an inter-
face makes it possible to formulate queries
in Natural Language (NL). The extraction
phase exploits the propositional nature of
the ontology. The query interface is based
on the Generate and Select principle, where
potentially suitable queries are generated to
match the user input, only for the most se-
mantically similar candidate to be selected.
In the process we evaluate data extracted
from the description of a medieval city
(Wolfenbu?ttel), transform and develop two
methods of computing similarity between
sentences based on WordNet. Experiments
are described that compare the pros and
cons of the similarity measures and evaluate
them.
