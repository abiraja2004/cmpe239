Under a lexicalist approach to semantics, a verb
completely encodes its syntactic and semantic
structures, along with the relevant syntax-to-
semantics mapping; polysemy is typically at-
tributed to the existence of different lexical en-
tries. A lexicon organized in this fashion con-
tains much redundant information and is un-
able to capture cross-categorial morphological
derivations. The solution is to spread the ?se-
mantic load? of lexical entries to other mor-
phemes not typically taken to bear semantic
content. This approach follows current trends
in linguistic theory, and more perspicuously ac-
counts for alternations in argument structure.
I demonstrate how such a framework can be
computationally realized with a feature-based,
agenda-driven chart parser for the Minimalist
Program.
