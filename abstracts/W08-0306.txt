Word alignments that violate syntactic cor-
respondences interfere with the extraction
of string-to-tree transducer rules for syntax-
based machine translation. We present an
algorithm for identifying and deleting incor-
rect word alignment links, using features of
the extracted rules. We obtain gains in both
alignment quality and translation quality in
Chinese-English and Arabic-English transla-
tion experiments relative to a GIZA++ union
baseline.
