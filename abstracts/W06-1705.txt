 
This paper presents a proposal to facili-
tate the use of the annotated web as cor-
pus by alleviating the annotation bottle-
neck for corpus data drawn from the web. 
We describe a framework for large-scale 
distributed corpus annotation using peer-
to-peer (P2P) technology to meet this 
need. We also propose to annotate a large 
reference corpus in order to evaluate this 
framework. This will allow us to investi-
gate the affordances offered by distrib-
uted techniques to ensure replicability of 
linguistic research based on web-derived 
corpora.
