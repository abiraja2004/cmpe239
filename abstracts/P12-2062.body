Syntax-based translation models that operate
on the output of a source-language parser have
been shown to perform better if allowed to
choose from a set of possible parses. In this
paper, we investigate whether this is because it
allows the translation stage to overcome parser
errors or to override the syntactic structure it-
self. We find that it is primarily the latter, but
that under the right conditions, the transla-
tion stage does correct parser errors, improv-
ing parsing accuracy on the Chinese Treebank.
