 
In this paper, we present a solution to the prob- 
lem of generating Japanese nmneral classifiers us- 
ing semantic lasses from an ontology. Most nouns 
must take a numeral classifier when they are quan- 
tiffed in languages uch as Chinese, Japanese, Ko- 
rean, Malay and Thai. In order to select an appro- 
priate classifier, we propose an algorithm which as- 
sociates classifiers with semantic lasses and uses 
inheritance to list only those classifiers which have 
to be listed. It generates sortal classifiers with au ac- 
curacy of 81%. We reuse the ontology provided by 
Goi-Taikei - -  a Japanese lexicon, and show that it 
is a reasonable choice for this task, requiring infor- 
mation to be entered for less than 6% of individual 
nouns .
