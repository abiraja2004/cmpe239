Synchronous tree substitution grammars are a
translation model that is used in syntax-based
machine translation. They are investigated in
a formal setting and compared to a competi-
tor that is at least as expressive. The competi-
tor is the extended multi bottom-up tree trans-
ducer, which is the bottom-up analogue with
one essential additional feature. This model
has been investigated in theoretical computer
science, but seems widely unknown in natu-
ral language processing. The two models are
compared with respect to standard algorithms
(binarization, regular restriction, composition,
application). Particular attention is paid to the
complexity of the algorithms.
