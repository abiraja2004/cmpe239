Indexing and retrieving broadcast news stories
within a large collection requires automatic de-
tection of story boundaries. This video news
story segmentation can use a wide range of au-
dio, language, video, and image features. In
this paper, we investigate the correlation be-
tween automatically-derived multimodal fea-
tures and story boundaries in seven different
broadcast news sources in three languages. We
identify several features that are important for
all seven sources analyzed, and we discuss the
contributions of other features that are impor-
tant for a subset of the seven sources.
