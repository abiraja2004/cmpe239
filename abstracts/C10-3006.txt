COMUNICA is a voice QA system for
Brazilian Portuguese with search ca-
pabilities for consulting both struc-
tured and unstructured datasets.
One of the goals of this work is to help
address digital inclusion by providing
an alternative way to accessing writ-
ten information, which users can em-
ploy regardless of available computa-
tional resources or computational lit-
eracy.
