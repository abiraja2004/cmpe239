We present a phrasal synchronous gram-
mar model of translational equivalence.
Unlike previous approaches, we do not
resort to heuristics or constraints from
a word-alignment model, but instead
directly induce a synchronous grammar
from parallel sentence-aligned corpora.
We use a hierarchical Bayesian prior
to bias towards compact grammars with
small translation units. Inference is per-
formed using a novel Gibbs sampler
over synchronous derivations. This sam-
pler side-steps the intractability issues of
previous models which required inference
over derivation forests. Instead each sam-
pling iteration is highly efficient, allowing
the model to be applied to larger transla-
tion corpora than previous approaches.
