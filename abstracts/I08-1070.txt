In a broad range of natural language pro-
cessing tasks, large-scale knowledge-base of
paraphrases is anticipated to improve their
performance. The key issue in creating such
a resource is to establish a practical method
of computing semantic equivalence and syn-
tactic substitutability, i.e., paraphrasability,
between given pair of expressions. This
paper addresses the issues of computing
paraphrasability, focusing on syntactic vari-
ants of predicate phrases. Our model esti-
mates paraphrasability based on traditional
distributional similarity measures, where the
Web snippets are used to overcome the data
sparseness problem in handling predicate
phrases. Several feature sets are evaluated
through empirical experiments.
