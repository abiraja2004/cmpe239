 
Relational clustering has received much 
attention from researchers in the last decade. In 
this paper we present a parametric method that 
employs a combination of both hard and soft 
clustering. Based on the corresponding Markov 
chain of an affinity matrix, we simulate a 
probability distribution on the states by 
defining a conditional probability for each 
subpopulation of states. This probabilistic 
model would enable us to use expectation 
maximization for parameter estimation. The 
effectiveness of the proposed approach is 
demonstrated on several real datasets against 
spectral clustering methods.
