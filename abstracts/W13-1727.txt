In this paper, we describe our approach to na-
tive language identification and discuss the re-
sults we submitted as participants to the First
NLI Shared Task. By resorting to a wide set of
general?purpose features qualifying the lexi-
cal and grammatical structure of a text, rather
than to ad hoc features specifically selected
for the NLI task, we achieved encouraging re-
sults, which show that the proposed approach
is general?purpose and portable across differ-
ent tasks, domains and languages.
