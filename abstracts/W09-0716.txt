This paper presents the Ontology for Ac-
cessing Transcription Systems (OATS), a
knowledge base that supports interopera-
tion over disparate transcription systems
and practical orthographies. The knowl-
edge base includes an ontological descrip-
tion of writing systems and relations for
mapping transcription system segments
to an interlingua pivot, the IPA. It in-
cludes orthographic and phonemic inven-
tories from 203 African languages. OATS
is motivated by the desire to query data in
the knowledge base via IPA or native or-
thography, and for error checking of dig-
itized data and conversion between tran-
scription systems. The model in this paper
implements these goals.
