We introduce cause identification, a new
problem involving classification of in-
cident reports in the aviation domain.
Specifically, given a set of pre-defined
causes, a cause identification system seeks
to identify all and only those causes that
can explain why the aviation incident de-
scribed in a given report occurred. The dif-
ficulty of cause identification stems in part
from the fact that it is a multi-class, multi-
label categorization task, and in part from
the skewness of the class distributions and
the scarcity of annotated reports. To im-
prove the performance of a cause identi-
fication system for the minority classes,
we present a bootstrapping algorithm that
automatically augments a training set by
learning from a small amount of labeled
data and a large amount of unlabeled data.
Experimental results show that our algo-
rithm yields a relative error reduction of
6.3% in F-measure for the minority classes
in comparison to a baseline that learns
solely from the labeled data.
