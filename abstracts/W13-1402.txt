nizing and extracting classical Arabic poems 
found in textual sources. The method utilizes 
the basic classical Arabic poem features such 
as structure, rhyme, writing style, and word 
usage. The proposed method achieves a preci-
sion of 96.94% while keeping a high recall 
value at 92.24%. The method was also used to
