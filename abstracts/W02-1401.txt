Technical terms in text often appear as noun
compounds, a frequently occurring yet highly
ambiguous construction whose interpretation
relies on extra-syntactic information. Several
statistical methods for disambiguating com-
pounds have been reported in the literature, of-
ten with quite impressive results. However, a
striking feature of all these approaches is that
they rely on the existence of previously seen un-
ambiguous compounds, meaning they are prone
to the problem of sparse data. This difficulty
has been overcome somewhat through the use
of hand-crafted knowledge resources to collect
statistics on ?concepts? rather than noun to-
kens, but domain-independence has been sacri-
ficed by doing so. We report here on work inves-
tigating the application of Latent Semantic In-
dexing to provide a robust domain-independent
source of the extra-syntactic knowledge neces-
sary for noun compound disambiguation.
