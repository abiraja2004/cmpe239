The TUNA-REG?09 Challenge was one
of the shared-task evaluation competitions
at Generation Challenges 2009. TUNA-
REG?09 used data from the TUNA Cor-
pus of paired representations of enti-
ties and human-authored referring expres-
sions. The shared task was to create sys-
tems that generate referring expressions
for entities given representations of sets
of entities and their properties. Four
teams submitted six systems to TUNA-
REG?09. We evaluated the six systems and
two sets of human-authored referring ex-
pressions using several automatic intrinsic
measures, a human-assessed intrinsic eval-
uation and a human task performance ex-
periment. This report describes the TUNA-
REG task and the evaluation methods used,
and presents the evaluation results.
