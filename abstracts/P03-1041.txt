Phrase level translation models are ef-
fective in improving translation qual-
ity by addressing the problem of local
re-ordering across language boundaries.
Methods that attempt to fundamentally
modify the traditional IBM translation
model to incorporate phrases typically do
so at a prohibitive computational cost. We
present a technique that begins with im-
proved IBM models to create phrase level
knowledge sources that effectively repre-
sent local as well as global phrasal con-
text. Our method is robust to noisy align-
ments at both the sentence and corpus
level, delivering high quality phrase level
translation pairs that contribute to signif-
icant improvements in translation quality
(as measured by the BLEU metric) over
word based lexica as well as a competing
alignment based method.
