 
This paper focuses on mining the hypon-
ymy (or is-a) relation from large-scale, 
open-domain web documents. A nonlinear 
probabilistic model is exploited to model 
the correlation between sentences in the 
aggregation of pattern matching results. 
Based on the model, we design a set of ev-
idence combination and propagation algo-
rithms. These significantly improve the 
result quality of existing approaches.  Ex-
perimental results conducted on 500 mil-
lion web pages and hypernym labels for 
300 terms show over 20% performance 
improvement in terms of P@5, MAP and 
R-Precision.
