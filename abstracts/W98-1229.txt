 
This paper describes our preliminary research 
on "attention-sharing" in infants' language ac- 
quisition. Attention-sharing is the activity of 
paying one's attention to someone lse's atten- 
tional target. This enables one to observe oth- 
ers' sensory-input (what they are perceiving 
from the target) and motor-output (what they 
are doing in response to the target). Being 
inspired by lack of attention-sharing i  autis- 
tic children, we assumed that observation of 
others' behavior by attention-sharing plays an 
indispensable role in symbol acquisition. As 
a test-bed for attention-sharing, we are de- 
veloping a robot that can follow people's at- 
tentional targets by means of monitoring their 
gaze-direction.
