We present a system for cross-lingual parse
disambiguation, exploiting the assumption
that the meaning of a sentence remains un-
changed during translation and the fact that
different languages have different ambiguities.
We simultaneously reduce ambiguity in multi-
ple languages in a fully automatic way. Eval-
uation shows that the system reliably discards
dispreferred parses from the raw parser output,
which results in a pre-selection that can speed
up manual treebanking.
