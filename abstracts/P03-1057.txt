When rules of transfer-based machine
translation (MT) are automatically ac-
quired from bilingual corpora, incor-
rect/redundant rules are generated due to
acquisition errors or translation variety in
the corpora. As a new countermeasure
to this problem, we propose a feedback
cleaning method using automatic evalua-
tion of MT quality, which removes incor-
rect/redundant rules as a way to increase
the evaluation score. BLEU is utilized
for the automatic evaluation. The hill-
climbing algorithm, which involves fea-
tures of this task, is applied to searching
for the optimal combination of rules. Our
experiments show that the MT quality im-
proves by 10% in test sentences according
to a subjective evaluation. This is consid-
erable improvement over previous meth-
ods.
