Automatic topic segmentation, separation of
a discourse stream into its constituent sto-
ries or topics, is a necessary preprocessing
step for applications such as information re-
trieval, anaphora resolution, and summariza-
tion. While significant progress has been made
in this area for text sources and for English au-
dio sources, little work has been done in au-
tomatic, acoustic feature-based segmentation
of other languages. In this paper, we focus
on prosody-based topic segmentation of Man-
darin Chinese. As a tone language, Man-
darin presents special challenges for applica-
bility of intonation-based techniques, since the
pitch contour is also used to establish lexical
identity. We demonstrate that intonational cues
such as reduction in pitch and intensity at topic
boundaries and increase in duration and pause
still provide significant contrasts in Mandarin
Chinese. We also build a decision tree classi-
fier that, based only on word and local context
prosodic information without reference to term
similarity, cue phrase, or sentence-level infor-
mation, achieves boundary classification accu-
racy of 89-95.8% on a large standard test set.
