We present Minimum Bayes-Risk word
alignment for machine translation. This
statistical, model-based approach attempts
to minimize the expected risk of align-
ment errors under loss functions that mea-
sure alignment quality. We describe var-
ious loss functions, including some that
incorporate linguistic analysis as can be
obtained from parse trees, and show that
these approaches can improve alignments
of the English-French Hansards.
