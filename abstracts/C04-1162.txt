This paper presents a new open text word sense
disambiguation method that combines the use
of logical inferences with PageRank-style algo-
rithms applied on graphs extracted from natu-
ral language documents. We evaluate the ac-
curacy of the proposed algorithm on several
sense-annotated texts, and show that it consis-
tently outperforms the accuracy of other pre-
viously proposed knowledge-based word sense
disambiguation methods. We also explore and
evaluate methods that combine several open-text
word sense disambiguation algorithms.
