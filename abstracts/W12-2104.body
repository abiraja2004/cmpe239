We examine the response to the recent nat-
ural disaster Hurricane Irene on Twitter.com.
We collect over 65,000 Twitter messages re-
lating to Hurricane Irene from August 18th to
August 31st, 2011, and group them by loca-
tion and gender. We train a sentiment classi-
fier to categorize messages based on level of
concern, and then use this classifier to investi-
gate demographic differences. We report three
principal findings: (1) the number of Twit-
ter messages related to Hurricane Irene in di-
rectly affected regions peaks around the time
the hurricane hits that region; (2) the level of
concern in the days leading up to the hurri-
cane?s arrival is dependent on region; and (3)
the level of concern is dependent on gender,
with females being more likely to express con-
cern than males. Qualitative linguistic vari-
ations further support these differences. We
conclude that social media analysis provides
a viable, real-time complement to traditional
survey methods for understanding public per-
ception towards an impending disaster.
