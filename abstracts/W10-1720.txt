This paper describes the DCU machine
translation system in the evaluation cam-
paign of the Joint Fifth Workshop on Sta-
tistical Machine Translation and Metrics
in ACL-2010. We describe the modular
design of our multi-engine machine trans-
lation (MT) system with particular focus
on the components used in this partici-
pation. We participated in the English?
Spanish and English?Czech translation
tasks, in which we employed our multi-
engine architecture to translate. We also
participated in the system combination
task which was carried out by the MBR
decoder and confusion network decoder.
