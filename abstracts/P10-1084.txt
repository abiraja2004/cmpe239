Scoring sentences in documents given ab-
stract summaries created by humans is im-
portant in extractive multi-document sum-
marization. In this paper, we formulate ex-
tractive summarization as a two step learn-
ing problem building a generative model
for pattern discovery and a regression
model for inference. We calculate scores
for sentences in document clusters based
on their latent characteristics using a hi-
erarchical topic model. Then, using these
scores, we train a regression model based
on the lexical and structural characteris-
tics of the sentences, and use the model to
score sentences of new documents to form
a summary. Our system advances current
state-of-the-art improving ROUGE scores
by ?7%. Generated summaries are less
redundant and more coherent based upon
manual quality evaluations.
