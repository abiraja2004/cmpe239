The paper describes a tagger for Old Czech
(1200-1500 AD), a fusional language with
rich morphology. The practical restrictions
(no native speakers, limited corpora and lex-
icons, limited funding) make Old Czech an
ideal candidate for a resource-light cross-
lingual method that we have been developing
(e.g. Hana et al, 2004; Feldman and Hana,
2010).
We use a traditional supervised tagger. How-
ever, instead of spending years of effort to cre-
ate a large annotated corpus of Old Czech, we
approximate it by a corpus of Modern Czech.
We perform a series of simple transformations
to make a modern text look more like a text
in Old Czech and vice versa. We also use a
resource-light morphological analyzer to pro-
vide candidate tags. The results are worse
than the results of traditional taggers, but the
amount of language-specific work needed is
minimal.
