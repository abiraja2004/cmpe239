 
The paper presents the Constructive 
Dialogue Model as a new approach to 
formulate system goals in intelligent di- 
alogue systems. The departure point 
is in general communicative principles 
which constrain cooperative and coher- 
ent communication. Dialogue partici- 
pants are engaged in a cooperative task 
whereby a model of the joint purpose is 
constructed. Contributions are planned 
as reactions to the changing context, 
and no dialogue grammar is needed. 
Also speech act classification is aban- 
doned, in favour of contextual reasoning 
and rationality considerations.
