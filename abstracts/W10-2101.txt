This paper describes work being done on
the modeling and encoding of a legacy re-
source, the traditional descriptive wordlist,
in ways that make its data accessible to
NLP applications. We describe an abstract
model for traditional wordlist entries and
then provide an instantiation of the model
in RDF/XML which makes clear the re-
lationship between our wordlist database
and interlingua approaches aimed towards
machine translation, and which also al-
lows for straightforward interoperation
with data from full lexicons.
