 
In intonational phonology and speech syn- 
thesis research, it has been suggested that 
the relative informativeness of a word can be 
used to predict pitch prominence. The more 
information conveyed by a word, the more 
likely it will be accented. But there are oth- 
ers who express doubts about such a correla- 
tion. In this paper, we provide some empiri- 
cal evidence to support he existence of such 
a correlation by employing two widely ac- 
cepted measures of informativeness. Our ex- 
periments how that there is a positive corre- 
lation between the informativeness of a word 
and its pitch accent assignment. They also 
show that informativeness enables statisti- 
cally significant improvements in pitch ac- 
cent prediction. The computation of word 
informativeness i  inexpensive and can be 
incorporated into speech synthesis ystems 
easily.
