We advance the state-of-the-art for discrimi-
natively trained machine translation systems
by presenting novel probabilistic inference
and search methods for synchronous gram-
mars. By approximating the intractable space
of all candidate translations produced by inter-
secting an ngram language model with a
synchronous grammar, we are able to train
and decode models incorporating millions of
sparse, heterogeneous features. Further, we
demonstrate the power of the discriminative
training paradigm by extracting structured
syntactic features, and achieving increases in
translation performance.
