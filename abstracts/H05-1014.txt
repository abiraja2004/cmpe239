A challenge for search systems is to de-
tect not only when an item is relevant to
the user?s information need, but also when
it contains something new which the user
has not seen before. In the TREC novelty
track, the task was to highlight sentences
containing relevant and new information in
a short, topical document stream. This
is analogous to highlighting key parts of a
document for another person to read, and
this kind of output can be useful as input to
a summarization system. Search topics in-
volved both news events and reported opin-
ions on hot-button subjects. When peo-
ple performed this task, they tended to se-
lect small blocks of consecutive sentences,
whereas current systems identified many
relevant and novel passages. We also found
that opinions are much harder to track than
events.
