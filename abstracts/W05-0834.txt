Word graphs have various applications in
the field of machine translation. Therefore
it is important for machine translation sys-
tems to produce compact word graphs of
high quality. We will describe the gen-
eration of word graphs for state of the
art phrase-based statistical machine trans-
lation. We will use these word graph
to provide an analysis of the search pro-
cess. We will evaluate the quality of the
word graphs using the well-known graph
word error rate. Additionally, we intro-
duce the two novel graph-to-string crite-
ria: the position-independent graph word
error rate and the graph BLEU score.
Experimental results are presented for two
Chinese?English tasks: the small IWSLT
task and the NIST large data track task.
For both tasks, we achieve significant re-
ductions of the graph error rate already
with compact word graphs.
