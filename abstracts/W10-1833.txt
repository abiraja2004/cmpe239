We present our concept-annotation guidelines 
for an large multi-institutional effort to create 
a gold-standard manually annotated corpus of 
full-text  biomedical  journal  articles.   We are 
semantically annotating these documents with 
the full term sets of eight large biomedical on-
tologies and controlled terminologies ranging 
from approximately 1,000 to millions of terms, 
and, using these guidelines, we have been able 
to  perform  this  extremely  challenging  task 
with  a  high  degree  of  interannotator  agree-
ment.  The guidelines have been designed to 
be able to be used with any terminology em-
ployed to semantically annotate concept men-
tions in text and are available for external use.
