In a spoken dialog system that can handle nat-
ural conversation between a human and a ma-
chine, spoken language understanding (SLU)
is a crucial component aiming at capturing
the key semantic components of utterances.
Building a robust SLU system is a challeng-
ing task due to variability in the usage of lan-
guage, need for labeled data, and requirements
to expand to new domains (movies, travel, fi-
nance, etc.). In this paper, we survey recent
research on bootstrapping or improving SLU
systems by using information mined or ex-
tracted from web search query logs, which
include (natural language) queries entered by
users as well as the links (web sites) they click
on. We focus on learning methods that help
unveiling hidden information in search query
logs via implicit crowd-sourcing.
