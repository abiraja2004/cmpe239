Successful application of multi-view co-
training algorithms relies on the ability to
factor the available features into views that
are compatible and uncorrelated. This can
potentially preclude their use on problems
such as coreference resolution that lack an
obvious feature split. To bootstrap coref-
erence classifiers, we propose and eval-
uate a single-view weakly supervised al-
gorithm that relies on two different learn-
ing algorithms in lieu of the two different
views required by co-training. In addition,
we investigate a method for ranking un-
labeled instances to be fed back into the
bootstrapping loop as labeled data, aiming
to alleviate the problem of performance
deterioration that is commonly observed
in the course of bootstrapping.
