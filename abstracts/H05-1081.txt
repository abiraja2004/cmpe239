This paper focuses on semantic role la-
beling using automatically-generated syn-
tactic information. A simple and robust
strategy for system combination is pre-
sented, which allows to partially recover
from input parsing errors and to signif-
icantly boost results of individual sys-
tems. This combination scheme is also
very flexible since the individual systems
are not required to provide any informa-
tion other than their solution. Extensive
experimental evaluation in the CoNLL-
2005 shared task framework supports our
previous claims. The proposed architec-
ture outperforms the best results reported
in that evaluation exercise.
