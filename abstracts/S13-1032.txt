This article provides a detailed overview of the
CPN text-to-text similarity system that we par-
ticipated with in the Semantic Textual Similar-
ity task evaluations hosted at *SEM 2013. In
addition to more traditional components, such
as knowledge-based and corpus-based met-
rics leveraged in a machine learning frame-
work, we also use opinion analysis features to
achieve a stronger semantic representation of
textual units. While the evaluation datasets are
not designed to test the similarity of opinions,
as a component of textual similarity, nonethe-
less, our system variations ranked number 38,
39 and 45 among the 88 participating systems.
