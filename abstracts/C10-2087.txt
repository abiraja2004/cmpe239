Recent kernel-based PPI extraction 
systems achieve promising perform-
ance because of their capability to 
capture structural syntactic informa-
tion, but at the expense of computa-
tional complexity. This paper incorpo-
rates dependency information as well 
as other lexical and syntactic knowl-
edge in a feature-based framework. 
Our motivation is that, considering the 
large amount of biomedical literature 
being archived daily, feature-based 
methods with comparable performance 
are more suitable for practical applica-
tions. Additionally, we explore the 
difference of lexical characteristics be-
tween biomedical and newswire do-
mains. Experimental evaluation on the 
AIMed corpus shows that our system 
achieves comparable performance of 
54.7 in F1-Score with other 
state-of-the-art PPI extraction systems, 
yet the best performance among all the 
feature-based ones.
