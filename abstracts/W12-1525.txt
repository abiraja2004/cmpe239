The Surface Realisation Shared Task was first
run in 2011. Two common-ground input rep-
resentations were developed and for the first
time several independently developed surface
realisers produced realisations from the same
shared inputs. However, the input representa-
tions had several shortcomings which we have
been aiming to address in the time since. This
paper reports on our work to date on improv-
ing the input representations and on our plans
for the next edition of the SR Task. We also
briefly summarise other related developments
in NLG shared tasks and outline how the dif-
ferent ideas may be usefully brought together
in the future.
