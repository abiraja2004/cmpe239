We consider the problem of learning fac-
tored probabilistic CCG grammars for seman-
tic parsing from data containing sentences
paired with logical-form meaning representa-
tions. Traditional CCG lexicons list lexical
items that pair words and phrases with syntac-
tic and semantic content. Such lexicons can
be inefficient when words appear repeatedly
with closely related lexical content. In this
paper, we introduce factored lexicons, which
include both lexemes to model word meaning
and templates to model systematic variation in
word usage. We also present an algorithm for
learning factored CCG lexicons, along with a
probabilistic parse-selection model. Evalua-
tions on benchmark datasets demonstrate that
the approach learns highly accurate parsers,
whose generalization performance benefits
greatly from the lexical factoring.
