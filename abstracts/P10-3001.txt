This paper presents ongoing research on
computational models for non-cooperative
dialogue. We start by analysing differ-
ent levels of cooperation in conversation.
Then, inspired by findings from an em-
pirical study, we propose a technique for
measuring non-cooperation in political in-
terviews. Finally, we describe a research
programme towards obtaining a suitable
model and discuss previous accounts for
conflictive dialogue, identifying the differ-
ences with our work.
