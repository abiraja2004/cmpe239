Machine Translation has evolved tremen-
dously in the recent time and stood as center
of research interest for many computer
scientists. Developing a Machine Transla-
tion system for ancient languages is much
more fascinating and challenging task. A
detailed study of Sanskrit language reveals
that its well-structured and finely orga-
nized grammar has affinity for automated
translation systems. This paper provides
necessary analysis of Sanskrit Grammar in
the perspective of Machine Translation and
also provides one of the possible solution for
Samaas Vigraha(Compound Dissolution).
