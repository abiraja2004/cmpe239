We investigate a graph-based semi-supervised
learning approach for labeling semantic com-
ponents of questions such as topic, focus,
event, etc., for question understanding task.
We focus on graph construction to handle
learning with dense/sparse graphs and present
Relaxed Linear Neighborhoods method, in
which each node is linearly constructed from
varying sizes of its neighbors based on the
density/sparsity of its surrounding. With the
new graph representation, we show perfor-
mance improvements on syntactic and real
datasets, primarily due to the use of unlabeled
data and relaxed graph construction.
