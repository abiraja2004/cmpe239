Recent evaluation techniques applied to corpus-
based systems have been introduced that can
predict quantitatively how well surface realizers
will generate unseen sentences in isolation. We
introduce a similar method for determining the
coverage on the Fuf/Surge symbolic surface re-
alizer, report that its coverage and accuracy on
the Penn TreeBank is higher than that of a sim-
ilar statistics-based generator, describe several
benets that can be used in other areas of com-
putational linguistics, and present an updated
version of Surge for use in the NLG community.
