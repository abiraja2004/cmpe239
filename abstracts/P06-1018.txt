 This paper proposes a generic mathemati-cal formalism for the combination of various structures: strings, trees, dags, graphs and products of them. The polari-zation of the objects of the elementary structures controls the saturation of the final structure. This formalism is both elementary and powerful enough to strongly simulate many grammar formal-isms, such as rewriting systems, depend-ency grammars, TAG, HPSG and LFG.
