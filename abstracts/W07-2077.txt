We present a sequential Semantic Role La-
beling system that describes the tagging
problem as a Maximum Entropy Markov
Model. The system uses full syntactic in-
formation to select BIO-tokens from input
data, and classifies them sequentially us-
ing state-of-the-art features, with the addi-
tion of Selectional Preference features. The
system presented achieves competitive per-
formance in the CoNLL-2005 shared task
dataset and it ranks first in the SRL subtask
of the Semeval-2007 task 17.
