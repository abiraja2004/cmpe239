We present a novel noisy channel model for
correcting text produced by English as a sec-
ond language (ESL) authors. We model the
English word choices made by ESL authors as
a random walk across an undirected bipartite
dictionary graph composed of edges between
English words and associated words in an au-
thor?s native language. We present two such
models, using cascades of weighted finite-
state transducers (wFSTs) to model language
model priors, random walk-induced noise, and
observed sentences, and expectation maxi-
mization (EM) to learn model parameters af-
ter Park and Levy (2011). We show that such
models can make intelligent word substitu-
tions to improve grammaticality in an unsu-
pervised setting.
