We present a method that uses alternation data
to add new entries to an existing bilingual valency
lexicon. If the existing lexicon has only one half of
the alternation, then our method constructs the
other half. The new entries have detailed infor-
mation about argument structure and selectional
restrictions. In this paper we focus on one class
of alternations, but our method is applicable to
any alternation. We were able to increase the
coverage of the causative alternation to 98%, and
the new entries gave an overall improvement in
translation quality of 32%.
