 
In this work, we propose a new method 
for extracting user preferences from a few 
documents that might interest users. For 
this end, we first extract candidate terms 
and choose a number of terms called ini-
tial representative keywords (IRKs) from 
them through fuzzy inference. Then, by 
expanding IRKs and reweighting them us-
ing term co-occurrence similarity, the fi-
nal representative keywords are extracted. 
Performance of our approach is heavily 
influenced by effectiveness of selection 
method for IRKs so we choose fuzzy in-
ference because it is more effective in 
handling the uncertainty inherent in se-
lecting representative keywords of docu-
ments. The problem addressed in this 
paper can be viewed as the one of finding 
a representative vector of documents in 
the linear text classification literature. So, 
to show the usefulness of our approach, 
we compare it with two famous methods - 
Rocchio and Widrow-Hoff - on the 
Reuters-21578 collection. The results 
show that our approach outperforms the 
other approaches.
