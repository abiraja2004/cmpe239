This paper describes an algorithm for
propagating verb arguments along lexi-
cal chains consisting of WordNet rela-
tions. The algorithm creates verb argu-
ment structures using VerbNet syntactic
patterns. In order to increase the cover-
age, a larger set of verb senses were auto-
matically associated with the existing pat-
terns from VerbNet. The algorithm is used
in an in-house Question Answering sys-
tem for re-ranking the set of candidate an-
swers. Tests on factoid questions from
TREC 2004 indicate that the algorithm im-
proved the system performance by 2.4%.
