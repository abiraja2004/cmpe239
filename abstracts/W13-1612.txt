Up until now most of the methods published
for polarity classification are applied to En-
glish texts. However, other languages on the
Internet are becoming increasingly important.
This paper presents a set of experiments on
English and Spanish product reviews. Us-
ing a comparable corpus, a supervised method
and two unsupervised methods have been as-
sessed. Furthermore, a list of Spanish opinion
words is presented as a valuable resource.
