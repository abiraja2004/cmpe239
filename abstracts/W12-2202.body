In this paper we present the results of the anal-
ysis of a parallel corpus of original and simpli-
fied texts in Spanish, gathered for the purpose
of developing an automatic simplification sys-
tem for this language. The system is intended
for individuals with cognitive disabilities who
experience difficulties reading and interpret-
ing informative texts. We here concentrate
on lexical simplification operations applied by
human editors on the basis of which we derive
a set of rules to be implemented automatically.
We have so far addressed the issue of lexical
units substitution, with special attention to re-
porting verbs and adjectives of nationality; in-
sertion of definitions; simplification of numer-
ical expressions; and simplification of named
entities.
