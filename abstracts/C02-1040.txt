In this paper we investigate the task of automatically
identifying the correct argument structure for a set
of verbs. The argument structure of a verb allows
us to predict the relationship between the syntac-
tic arguments of a verb and their role in the under-
lying lexical semantics of the verb. Following the
method described in (Merlo and Stevenson, 2001),
we exploit the distributions of some selected fea-
tures from the local context of a verb. These fea-
tures were extracted from a 23M word WSJ cor-
pus based on part-of-speech tags and phrasal chunks
alone. We constructed several decision tree classi-
fiers trained on this data. The best performing clas-
sifier achieved an error rate of 33.4%. This work
shows that a subcategorization frame (SF) learning
algorithm previously applied to Czech (Sarkar and
Zeman, 2000) is used to extract SFs in English. The
extracted SFs are evaluated by classifying verbs into
verb alternation classes.
