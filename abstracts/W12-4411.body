We report the results of our transliteration ex-
periments with language-specific adaptations
in the context of two language pairs: English
to Chinese, and Arabic to English. In particu-
lar, we investigate a syllable-based Pinyin in-
termediate representation for Chinese, and a
letter mapping for Arabic.
