 
This paper presents a new statistical method 
for detecting and tracking changes in word 
meaning, based on Latent Semantic Analysis. 
By comparing the density of semantic vector 
clusters this method allows researchers to 
make statistical inferences on questions such 
as whether the meaning of a word changed 
across time or if a phonetic cluster is asso-
ciated with a specific meaning. Possible appli-
cations of this method are then illustrated in 
tracing the semantic change of ?dog?, ?do?, and 
?deer? in early English and examining and 
comparing phonaesthemes.
