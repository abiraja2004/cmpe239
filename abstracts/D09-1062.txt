Polarity lexicons have been a valuable re-
source for sentiment analysis and opinion
mining. There are a number of such lexi-
cal resources available, but it is often sub-
optimal to use them as is, because general
purpose lexical resources do not reflect
domain-specific lexical usage. In this pa-
per, we propose a novel method based on
integer linear programming that can adapt
an existing lexicon into a new one to re-
flect the characteristics of the data more
directly. In particular, our method collec-
tively considers the relations among words
and opinion expressions to derive the most
likely polarity of each lexical item (posi-
tive, neutral, negative, or negator) for the
given domain. Experimental results show
that our lexicon adaptation technique im-
proves the performance of fine-grained po-
larity classification.
