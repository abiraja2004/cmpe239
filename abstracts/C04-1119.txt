 
This paper proposes a method of automatic 
back transliteration of proper nouns, in which 
a Japanese transliterated-word is restored to 
the original English word. The English words 
are created from a sequence of letters; thus 
our method can create new English words that 
are not registered in dictionaries or English 
word lists. When a katakana character is con-
verted into English letters, there are various 
candidates of alphabetic characters. To ensure 
adequate conversion, the proposed method 
uses a target English context to calculate the 
probability of an English character or string 
corresponding to a Japanese katakana charac-
ter or string. We confirmed the effectiveness 
of using the target English context by an ex-
periment of personal-name back translitera-
tion.
