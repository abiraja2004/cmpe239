In distributional semantics studies, there
is a growing attention in compositionally
determining the distributional meaning of
word sequences. Yet, compositional dis-
tributional models depend on a large set
of parameters that have not been explored.
In this paper we propose a novel approach
to estimate parameters for a class of com-
positional distributional models: the addi-
tive models. Our approach leverages on
two main ideas. Firstly, a novel idea for
extracting compositional distributional se-
mantics examples. Secondly, an estima-
tion method based on regression models
for multiple dependent variables. Experi-
ments demonstrate that our approach out-
performs existing methods for determin-
ing a good model for compositional dis-
tributional semantics.
