This paper describes an approach to uti-
lizing term weights for sentiment analysis
tasks and shows how various term weight-
ing schemes improve the performance of
sentiment analysis systems. Previously,
sentiment analysis was mostly studied un-
der data-driven and lexicon-based frame-
works. Such work generally exploits tex-
tual features for fact-based analysis tasks
or lexical indicators from a sentiment lexi-
con. We propose to model term weighting
into a sentiment analysis system utilizing
collection statistics, contextual and topic-
related characteristics as well as opinion-
related properties. Experiments carried
out on various datasets show that our
approach effectively improves previous
methods.
