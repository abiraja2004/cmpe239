Syntactic Reordering of the source lan-
guage to better match the phrase struc-
ture of the target language has been
shown to improve the performance of
phrase-based Statistical Machine Transla-
tion. This paper applies syntactic reorder-
ing to English-to-Arabic translation. It in-
troduces reordering rules, and motivates
them linguistically. It also studies the ef-
fect of combining reordering with Ara-
bic morphological segmentation, a pre-
processing technique that has been shown
to improve Arabic-English and English-
Arabic translation. We report on results in
the news text domain, the UN text domain
and in the spoken travel domain.
