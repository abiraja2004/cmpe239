 
This paper proposes a novel method to 
analyze syntactic dependencies and label 
semantic dependencies around both the 
verbal predicates and the nouns. In this 
method, a probabilistic model is designed 
to obtain a global optimal result. More-
over, a predicate identification model and 
a disambiguation model are proposed to 
label predicates and their senses. The ex-
perimental results obtained on the wsj 
and brown test sets show that our system 
obtains 77% of labeled macro F1 score 
for the whole task, 84.47% of labeled at-
tachment score for syntactic dependency 
task, and 69.45% of labeled F1 score for 
semantic dependency task.
