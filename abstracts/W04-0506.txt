We present an experiment for designing a logic
based QA system, WEBCOOP, that integrates
knowledge representation and advanced rea-
soning procedures to generate cooperative re-
sponses to natural language queries on the web.
The system is first developed for the tourism
domain. We then examine how and under what
conditions this system can be re-used for other
domains.
