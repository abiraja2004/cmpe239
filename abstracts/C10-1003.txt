In cross-language information retrieval it
is often important to align words that are
similar in meaning in two corpora writ-
ten in different languages. Previous re-
search shows that using context similar-
ity to align words is helpful when no
dictionary entry is available. We sug-
gest a new method which selects a sub-
set of words (pivot words) associated with
a query and then matches these words
across languages. To detect word associa-
tions, we demonstrate that a new Bayesian
method for estimating Point-wise Mutual
Information provides improved accuracy.
In the second step, matching is done in
a novel way that calculates the chance of
an accidental overlap of pivot words us-
ing the hypergeometric distribution. We
implemented a wide variety of previously
suggested methods. Testing in two con-
ditions, a small comparable corpora pair
and a large but unrelated corpora pair,
both written in disparate languages, we
show that our approach consistently out-
performs the other systems.
