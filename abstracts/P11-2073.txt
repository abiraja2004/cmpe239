 
To address the parse error issue for tree-to-
string translation, this paper proposes a 
similarity-based decoding generation (SDG) 
solution by reconstructing similar source 
parse trees for decoding at the decoding 
time instead of taking multiple source parse 
trees as input for decoding. Experiments on 
Chinese-English translation demonstrated 
that our approach can achieve a significant 
improvement over the standard method, 
and has little impact on decoding speed in 
practice. Our approach is very easy to im-
plement, and can be applied to other para-
digms such as tree-to-tree models.
