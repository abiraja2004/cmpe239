. Document clustering has many uses in natural language tools
and applications. For instance, summarizing sets of documents that all
describe the same event requires first identifying and grouping those
documents talking about the same event. Document clustering involves
dividing a set of documents into non-overlapping clusters. In this paper,
we present two document clustering algorithms: grouping algorithm, and
chaining algorithm. We compared them with k-means and the EM algo-
rithms. The evaluation results showed that our two algorithms perform
better than the k-means and EM algorithms in different experiments.
