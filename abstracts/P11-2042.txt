This short paper introduces an implemented
and evaluated monolingual Text-to-Text gen-
eration system. The system takes mono-
logue and transforms it to two-participant di-
alogue. After briefly motivating the task
of monologue-to-dialogue generation, we de-
scribe the system and present an evaluation in
terms of fluency and accuracy.
