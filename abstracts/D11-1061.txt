In the last few years, the interest of the re-
search community in micro-blogs and social
media services, such as Twitter, is growing ex-
ponentially. Yet, so far not much attention has
been paid on a key characteristic of micro-
blogs: the high level of information redun-
dancy. The aim of this paper is to systemat-
ically approach this problem by providing an
operational definition of redundancy. We cast
redundancy in the framework of Textual En-
tailment Recognition. We also provide quan-
titative evidence on the pervasiveness of re-
dundancy in Twitter, and describe a dataset
of redundancy-annotated tweets. Finally, we
present a general purpose system for identify-
ing redundant tweets. An extensive quantita-
tive evaluation shows that our system success-
fully solves the redundancy detection task, im-
proving over baseline systems with statistical
significance.
