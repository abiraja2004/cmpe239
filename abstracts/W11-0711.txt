Email is an important way of communication
in our daily life and it has become the subject
of various NLP and social studies. In this pa-
per, we focus on email formality and explore
the factors that could affect the sender?s choice
of formality. As a case study, we use the En-
ron email corpus to test how formality is af-
fected by social distance, relative power, and
the weight of imposition, as defined in Brown
and Levinson?s model of politeness (1987).
Our experiments show that their model largely
holds in the Enron corpus. We believe that
the methodology proposed in the paper can be
applied to other social media domains and be
used to test other linguistic or social theories.
