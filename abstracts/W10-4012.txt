 Linguistic porting of content manage-ment services processing spontaneous ut-terances in natural language has become important. In most situations, such utter-ances are noisy, but are constrained by the situation, thus constituting a restricted sublangage. In previous papers, we have presented three methods to port such sys-tems to other languages. In this paper, we study how to also personalize them by making them capable of automatic per-ception adaptation, using fuzzy evalu-ation functions. We have reengineered IMRS, a music retrieval NL-based sys-tem, to implement that idea, and ported it to French, English and Arabic using an enhanced version of our external porting method, building a unique content extrac-tor for these three languages. More than 30 persons participated in a preliminary on-line qualitative evaluation of the sys-tem.  1
