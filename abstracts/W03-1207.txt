The discovery of semantic relations from
text becomes increasingly important for
applications such as Question Answer-
ing, Information Extraction, Summariza-
tion, Text Understanding and others. This
paper presents a method for the auto-
matic discovery of manner relations using
a Naive Bayes learning algorithm. The
method was tested on the UPenn Tree-
bank2 corpus, and the targeted manner re-
lations were detected with a precision of
64.44% and a recall of 68.67%.
