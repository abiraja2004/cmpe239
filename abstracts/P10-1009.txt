 
In this paper, we formulate extractive 
summarization as a risk minimization 
problem and propose a unified probabilis-
tic framework that naturally combines su-
pervised and unsupervised summarization 
models to inherit their individual merits as 
well as to overcome their inherent limita-
tions. In addition, the introduction of vari-
ous loss functions also provides the sum-
marization framework with a flexible but 
systematic way to render the redundancy 
and coherence relationships among sen-
tences and between sentences and the 
whole document, respectively. Experi-
ments on speech summarization show that 
the methods deduced from our framework 
are very competitive with existing summa-
rization approaches.
