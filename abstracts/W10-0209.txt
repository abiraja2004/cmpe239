Subtle social information is available in text
such as a speaker?s emotional state, intentions,
and attitude, but current information extrac-
tion systems are unable to extract this infor-
mation at the level that humans can. We de-
scribe a methodology for creating databases
of messages annotated with social information
based on interactive games between humans
trying to generate and interpret messages for a
number of different social information types.
We then present some classification results
achieved by using a small-scale database cre-
ated with this methodology.
