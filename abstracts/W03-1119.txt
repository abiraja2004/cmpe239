This paper present a method based on the
behavior of nonnative speaker for reduc-
tion sentence in foreign language. We
demonstrate an algorithm using seman-
tic information in order to produce two
reduced sentences in two difference lan-
guages and ensure both grammatical and
sentence meaning of the original sentence
in reduced sentences. In addition, the or-
ders of reduced sentences are able to be
different from original sentences.
