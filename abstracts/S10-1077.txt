 
Temporal information extraction is a 
popular and interesting research field in 
the area of Natural Language Processing 
(NLP). In this paper, we report our works 
on TempEval-2 shared task. This is our 
first participation and we participated in 
all the tasks, i.e., A, B, C, D, E and F. We 
develop rule-based systems for Tasks A 
and B, whereas the remaining tasks are 
based on a machine learning approach, 
namely Conditional Random Field 
(CRF). All our systems are still in their 
development stages, and we report the 
very initial results. Evaluation results on 
the shared task English datasets yield the 
precision, recall and F-measure values of 
55%, 17% and 26%, respectively for 
Task A and 48%, 56% and 52%, respec-
tively for Task B (event recognition).  
The rest of tasks, namely C, D, E and F 
were evaluated with a relatively simpler 
metric: the number of correct answers di-
vided by the number of answers. Experi-
ments on the English datasets yield the 
accuracies of 63%, 80%, 56% and 56% 
for tasks C, D, E and F, respectively.
