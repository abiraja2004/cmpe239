Spoken and multimodal dialogue systems typ-
ically make use of confidence scores to choose
among (or reject) a speech recognizer?s N-
best hypotheses for a particular utterance. We
argue that it is beneficial to instead choose
among a list of candidate system responses.
We propose a novel method in which a con-
fidence score for each response is derived
from a classifier trained on acoustic and lex-
ical features emitted by the recognizer, as
well as features culled from the generation of
the candidate response itself. Our response-
based method yields statistically significant
improvements in F-measure over a baseline in
which hypotheses are chosen based on recog-
nition confidence scores only.
