 
This paper presents a project that 
investigates to what extent computational 
linguistic methods and tools used at GETA 
for machine translation can be used to 
implement  novel funct ional i t ies in 
intelligent computer assisted language 
learning. Our intelligent tutoring system 
project is still in its early phases. The 
learner module is based on an empirical 
study of French as used by Acadian 
elementary students l iving in New- 
Brunswick, Canada. Additionally, we are 
studying the state of the art of systems using 
Artificial Intelligence techniques as well as 
NLP resources and/or methodologies for 
teaching language, especially for bilingual 
and minority groups.

define the learner model. Then, in the last 
section we propose the system's general 
architecture and an overview some of its 
activities; particularly those that counteract 
Anglicisms by double generating examples in 
standard French and in the local dialect using 
linguistic resources usually used in machine 
translation.
