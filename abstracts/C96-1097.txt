 
In order to extract rigid expressions with a high fre- 
quency of use, new algorithm that can efficiently extract 
both uninterrupted and interrupted collocations from very 
large corpora has been proposed. 
The statistical method recently proposed for calculating 
N-gram of m'bitrary N can be applied to the extraction of 
uninterrupted collocations. But this method posed pro- 
blems that so large volumes of fractional and unnecessary 
expressions are extracted that it was impossible to extract 
interrupted collocations combining the results. To solve 
this problem, this paper proposed a new algorithm that 
restrains extraction of unnecessary substrings. This is 
followed by the proposal of a method that enable to extract 
interrupted collocations. 
The new methods are applied to Japanese newspaper 
articles involving 8.92 million characters. In the case of 
uninterrupted collocations with string length of 2 or mere 
characters and frequency of appearance 2 or more times, 
there were 4.4 millions types of expressions (total fre- 
quency of 31.2 millions times) extracted by the N-gram 
method. In contrast, the new method has reduced this to 
0.97 million types (total frequency of 2.6 million times) 
revealing a substantial reduction in fractional and un- 
necessary expressions. In the case of interrupted collo- 
cational substring extraction, combining the substring with 
frequency of 10 times or more extracted by the first 
method, 6.5 thousand types of pairs of substrings with the 
total frequency of 21.8 thousands were extracted.
