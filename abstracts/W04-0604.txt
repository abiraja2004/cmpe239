 
A method for mapping linguistic descrip-
tions in plain XML into semantically rich 
RDF/OWL is outlined and demonstrated. 
Starting with Simons?s (2003) original 
proof of concept of this method, we extend 
his Semantic Interpretation Language (SIL) 
for creating metaschemas to carry out the 
mapping, employ the General Ontology for 
Linguistic Description (GOLD) of Farrar 
and Langendoen (2003) as the target se-
mantic schema, and make use of SeRQL, 
an RDF-aware search engine. This data 
migration effort is in keeping with the vi-
sion of a Semantic Web; it is part of an ef-
fort to build a ?community of practice? 
around semantically rich linguistic re-
sources.
