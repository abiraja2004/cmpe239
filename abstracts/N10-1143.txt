Hierarchical discourse segmentation is a use-
ful technology, but it is difficult to eval-
uate. I propose an error measure based
on the word error rate of Beeferman et al
(1999). I then show that this new measure
not only reliably distinguishes baseline seg-
mentations from lexically-informed hierarchi-
cal segmentations and more informed segmen-
tations from less informed segmentations, but
it also offers an improvement over previous
linear error measures.
