Within the task of Recognizing Textual
Entailment, various existing work has pro-
posed the idea that tackling specific sub-
types of entailment could be more produc-
tive than taking a generic approach to en-
tailment. In this paper we look at one
such subtype, where the entailment in-
volves hypernymy relations, often found
in Question Answering tasks. We investi-
gate current work on hypernymy acquisi-
tion, and show that adapting one such ap-
proach leads to a marked improvement in
entailment classification accuracy.
