The topic of a document can prove to be use-
ful information for Word Sense Disambigua-
tion (WSD) since certain meanings tend to be
associated with particular topics. This paper
presents an LDA-based approach for WSD,
which is trained using any available WSD sys-
tem to establish a sense per (Latent Dirich-
let alocation based) topic. The technique is
tested using three unsupervised and one su-
pervised WSD algorithms within the SPORT
and FINANCE domains giving a performance
increase each time, suggesting that the tech-
nique may be useful to improve the perfor-
mance of any available WSD system.
