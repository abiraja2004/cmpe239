The UvT system is based on a hybrid, lin-
guistic and statistical approach, originally
proposed for the recognition of multi-
word terminological phrases, the C-value
method (Frantzi et al, 2000). In the UvT
implementation, we use an extended noun
phrase rule set and take into consideration
orthographic and morphological variation,
term abbreviations and acronyms, and ba-
sic document structure information.
