This paper describes a method for automat-
ically learning effective dialogue strategies,
generated from a library of dialogue content,
using reinforcement learning from user feed-
back. This library includes greetings, so-
cial dialogue, chit-chat, jokes and relation-
ship building, as well as the more usual clar-
ification and verification components of dia-
logue. We tested the method through a mo-
tivational dialogue system that encourages
take-up of exercise and show that it can be
used to construct good dialogue strategies
with little effort.
