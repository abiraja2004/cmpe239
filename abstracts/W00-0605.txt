 
This paper describes the Question Answering Sys- 
tem constructed uring a one semester graduate- 
level course on Natural Language Processing (NLP). 
We hypothesized that by using a combination ofsyn- 
tactic and semantic features and machine learning 
techniques, we could improve the accuracy of ques- 
tion answering on the test set of the Remedia corpus 
over the reported levels. The approach, although 
novel, was not entirely successful in the time frame 
of the course.
