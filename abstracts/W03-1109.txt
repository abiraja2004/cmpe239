This paper describes two new features of
the BRIDJE system for cross-language
information access. The first feature is
the partial disambiguation function of
the Bi-directional Retriever, which can
be used for search request translation in
cross-language IR. Its advantage over a
?black-box? machine translation approach
is consistent across five test collections
and across two language permutations:
English-Japanese and Japanese-English.
The second new feature is the Information
Distiller, which performs interactive
summarisation of retrieved documents
based on Semantic Role Analysis. Our
examples illustrate the usefulness of
this feature, and our evaluation results
show that the precision of Semantic Role
Analysis is very high.
