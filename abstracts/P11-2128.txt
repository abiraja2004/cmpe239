This paper proposes three modules based on
latent topics of documents for alleviating ?se-
mantic drift? in bootstrapping entity set ex-
pansion. These new modules are added to a
discriminative bootstrapping algorithm to re-
alize topic feature generation, negative exam-
ple selection and entity candidate pruning. In
this study, we model latent topics with LDA
(Latent Dirichlet Allocation) in an unsuper-
vised way. Experiments show that the accu-
racy of the extracted entities is improved by
6.7 to 28.2% depending on the domain.
