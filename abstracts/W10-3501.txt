 
This paper presents a method for con-
structing a large-scale Person Ontology 
with category hierarchy from Wikipe-
dia. We first extract Wikipedia category 
labels which represent person (hereafter, 
Wikipedia Person Category, WPC) by 
using a machine learning classifier. We 
then construct a WPC hierarchy by de-
tecting is-a relations in the Wikipedia 
category network. We then extract the 
titles of Wikipedia articles which 
represent person (hereafter, Wikipedia 
person instance, WPI). Experiments 
show that the accuracy of WPC extrac-
tion is 99.3% precision and 98.4% re-
call, while that of WPI extraction is 
98.2% and 98.6%, respectively. The ac-
curacies are significantly higher than 
the previous methods.
