Recent natural language learning research
has shown that structural kernels can be
effectively used to induce accurate models
of linguistic phenomena.
In this paper, we show that the above prop-
erties hold on a novel task related to predi-
cate argument classification. A tree kernel
for selecting the subtrees which encodes
argument structures is applied. Experi-
ments with Support Vector Machines on
large data sets (i.e. the PropBank collec-
tion) show that such kernel improves the
recognition of argument boundaries.
