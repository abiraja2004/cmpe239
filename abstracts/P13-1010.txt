We propose a computationally efficient
graph-based approach for local coherence
modeling. We evaluate our system on
three tasks: sentence ordering, summary
coherence rating and readability assess-
ment. The performance is comparable to
entity grid based approaches though these
rely on a computationally expensive train-
ing phase and face data sparsity problems.
