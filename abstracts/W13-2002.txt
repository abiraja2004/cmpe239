The Genia Event Extraction task is orga-
nized for the third time, in BioNLP Shared
Task 2013. Toward knowledge based con-
struction, the task is modified in a num-
ber of points. As the final results, it re-
ceived 12 submissions, among which 2
were withdrawn from the final report. This
paper presents the task setting, data sets,
and the final results with discussion for
possible future directions.
