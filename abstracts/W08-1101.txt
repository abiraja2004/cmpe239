 
We review psycholinguistic research on the 
use of intonation in dialogue, focusing on our 
own recent work. In experiments using com-
plex real-world tasks and na?ve speakers and 
listeners, we show that speakers reliably spe-
cific prosodic cues to signal their intensions, 
and that listeners use these cues to recognize 
syntactic and pragmatic aspects of discourse 
meaning.
