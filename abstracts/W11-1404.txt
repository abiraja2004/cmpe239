Automated testing of spoken language is the
subject of much current research. Elicited
Imitation (EI), or sentence repetition, is well
suited for automated scoring, but does not di-
rectly test a broad range of speech communi-
cation skills. An Oral Proficiency Interview
(OPI) tests a broad range of skills, but is not as
well suited for automated scoring. Some have
suggested that EI can be used as a predictor of
more general speech communication abilities.
We examine EI for this purpose. A fully au-
tomated EI test is used to predict OPI scores.
Experiments show strong correlation between
predicted and actual OPI scores. Effective-
ness of OPI score prediction depends upon at
least two important design decisions. One of
these decisions is to base prediction primar-
ily on acoustic measures, rather than on tran-
scription. The other of these decisions is the
choice of sentences, or EI test items, to be re-
peated. It is shown that both of these design
decisions can greatly impact performance. It
is also shown that the effectiveness of individ-
ual test items can be predicted.
