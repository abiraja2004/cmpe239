This paper describes the Cambridge sub-
mission to the SemEval-2010 Parser Eval-
uation using Textual Entailment (PETE)
task. We used a simple definition of en-
tailment, parsing both T and H with the
C&C parser and checking whether the core
grammatical relations (subject and object)
produced for H were a subset of those for
T. This simple system achieved the top
score for the task out of those systems sub-
mitted. We analyze the errors made by the
system and the potential role of the task in
parser evaluation.
