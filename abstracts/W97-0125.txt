 
We present an LO-based approach to recognizing of Proper Names in Korean texts. 
Local grammars (LGs) are constructed byexamining specific syntactic contexts of lexical 
elements, given that the general syntactic rules, independent from lexical items, cannot 
provide accurate analyses. The LGs will be represented under the form of Finite State 
Automata (FSA) in our system. 
So far as we do not have a dictionary which would provide all proper names, we need 
auxiliary tools to analyze them. We will examine contexts where strings containing proper 
names occur. Our approach consists in building an electronic lexicon of PNs in a way more 
satisfactory than other existing methods, uch as their recognition i  texts by means of 
statistical pproaches or by rule-based methods.
