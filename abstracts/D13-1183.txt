The distributional hypothesis, which states
that words that occur in similar contexts tend
to have similar meanings, has inspired sev-
eral Web mining algorithms for paraphras-
ing semantically equivalent phrases. Unfortu-
nately, these methods have several drawbacks,
such as confusing synonyms with antonyms
and causes with effects. This paper intro-
duces three Temporal Correspondence Heuris-
tics, that characterize regularities in parallel
news streams, and shows how they may be
used to generate high precision paraphrases
for event relations. We encode the heuristics
in a probabilistic graphical model to create
the NEWSSPIKE algorithm for mining news
streams. We present experiments demon-
strating that NEWSSPIKE significantly outper-
forms several competitive baselines. In order
to spur further research, we provide a large
annotated corpus of timestamped news arti-
cles as well as the paraphrases produced by
NEWSSPIKE.
