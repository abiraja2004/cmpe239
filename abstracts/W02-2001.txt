This paper proposes a series of techniques for ex-
tracting English verb?particle constructions from
raw text corpora. We initially propose three basic
methods, based on tagger output, chunker output
and a chunk grammar, respectively, with the chunk
grammar method optionally combining with an at-
tachment resolution module to determine the syn-
tactic structure of verb?preposition pairs in ambigu-
ous constructs. We then combine the three methods
together into a single classifier, and add in a number
of extra lexical and frequentistic features, producing
a final F-score of 0.865 over the WSJ.
