We investigate automatic geolocation (i.e.
identification of the location, expressed as
latitude/longitude coordinates) of documents.
Geolocation can be an effective means of sum-
marizing large document collections and it is
an important component of geographic infor-
mation retrieval. We describe several simple
supervised methods for document geolocation
using only the document?s raw text as evi-
dence. All of our methods predict locations
in the context of geodesic grids of varying de-
grees of resolution. We evaluate the methods
on geotagged Wikipedia articles and Twitter
feeds. For Wikipedia, our best method obtains
a median prediction error of just 11.8 kilome-
ters. Twitter geolocation is more challenging:
we obtain a median error of 479 km, an im-
provement on previous results for the dataset.
