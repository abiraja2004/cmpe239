This paper addresses the mitigation of medi-
cal errors due to the confusion of sound-alike
and look-alike drug names. Our approach
involves application of two new methods?
one based on orthographic similarity (?look-
alike?) and the other based on phonetic sim-
ilarity (?sound-alike?). We present a new
recall-based evaluation methodology for deter-
mining the effectiveness of different similar-
ity measures on drug names. We show that
the new orthographic measure (BI-SIM) outper-
forms other commonly used measures of sim-
ilarity on a set containing both look-alike and
sound-alike pairs, and that the feature-based
phonetic approach (ALINE) outperforms or-
thographic approaches on a test set contain-
ing solely sound-alike confusion pairs. How-
ever, an approach that combines several differ-
ent measures achieves the best results on both
test sets.
