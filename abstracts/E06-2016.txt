GOD (General Ontology Discovery) is an
unsupervised system to extract semantic
relations among domain specific entities
and concepts from texts. Operationally,
it acts as a search engine returning a set
of true predicates regarding the query in-
stead of the usual ranked list of relevant
documents. Our approach relies on two
basic assumptions: (i) paradigmatic rela-
tions can be established only among terms
in the same Semantic Domain an (ii) they
can be inferred from texts by analyzing the
Subject-Verb-Object patterns where two
domain specific terms co-occur. A quali-
tative analysis of the system output shows
that GOD provide true, informative and
meaningful relations in a very efficient
way.
