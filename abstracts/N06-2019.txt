This paper evaluates the benefit of deleting fillers
(e.g. you know, like) early in parsing conver-
sational speech. Readability studies have shown
that disfluencies (fillers and speech repairs) may
be deleted from transcripts without compromising
meaning (Jones et al, 2003), and deleting repairs
prior to parsing has been shown to improve its
accuracy (Charniak and Johnson, 2001). We ex-
plore whether this strategy of early deletion is also
beneficial with regard to fillers. Reported exper-
iments measure the effect of early deletion under
in-domain and out-of-domain parser training con-
ditions using a state-of-the-art parser (Charniak,
2000). While early deletion is found to yield only
modest benefit for in-domain parsing, significant
improvement is achieved for out-of-domain adap-
tation. This suggests a potentially broader role for
disfluency modeling in adapting text-based tools
for processing conversational speech.
