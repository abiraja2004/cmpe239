Definition extraction is the task of au-
tomatically identifying definitional sen-
tences within texts. The task has proven
useful in many research areas including
ontology learning, relation extraction and
question answering. However, current ap-
proaches ? mostly focused on lexico-
syntactic patterns ? suffer from both low
recall and precision, as definitional sen-
tences occur in highly variable syntactic
structures. In this paper, we propose Word-
Class Lattices (WCLs), a generalization of
word lattices that we use to model tex-
tual definitions. Lattices are learned from
a dataset of definitions from Wikipedia.
Our method is applied to the task of def-
inition and hypernym extraction and com-
pares favorably to other pattern general-
ization methods proposed in the literature.
