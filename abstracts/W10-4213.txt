We present a framework for reformulat-
ing sentences by applying transfer rules
on a typed dependency representation. We
specify a list of operations that the frame-
work needs to support and argue that
typed dependency structures are currently
the most suitable formalism for complex
lexico-syntactic paraphrasing. We demon-
strate our approach by reformulating sen-
tences expressing the discourse relation of
causation using four lexico-syntactic dis-
course markers ? ?cause? as a verb and
as a noun, ?because? as a conjunction and
?because of? as a preposition.
