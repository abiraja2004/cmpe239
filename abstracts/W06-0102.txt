 
This paper reports on an initial and nec-
essary step toward the construction of a 
Pan-Chinese lexical resource.  We inves-
tigated the regional variation of lexical 
items in two specific domains, finance 
and sports; and explored how much of 
such variation is covered in existing Chi-
nese synonym dictionaries, in particular 
the Tongyici Cilin.  The domain-specific 
lexical items were obtained from subsec-
tions of a synchronous Chinese corpus, 
LIVAC.  Results showed that 20-40% of 
the words from various subcorpora are 
unique to the individual communities, 
and as much as 70% of such unique items 
are not yet covered in the Tongyici Cilin.  
The results suggested great potential for 
building a Pan-Chinese lexical resource 
for Chinese language processing.  Our 
next step would be to explore automatic 
means for extracting related lexical items 
from the corpus, and to incorporate them 
into existing semantic classifications.
