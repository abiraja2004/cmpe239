A problem in dialogue research is that of
finding and managing expectations.
Adjacency pair theory has widespread
acceptance, but traditional classification
features (in particular, ?previous-tag?
type features) do not exploit this
information optimally. We suggest a
method of dialogue segmentation that
verifies adjacency pairs and allows us to
use dialogue-level information within the
entire segment and not just the previous
utterance. We also use the ?2 test for
statistical significance as ?noise
reduction? to refine a list of pairs.
Together, these methods can be used to
extend expectation beyond the traditional
classification features.
