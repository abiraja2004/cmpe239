The accuracy of many natural language pro-
cessing tasks can be improved by a reranking
step, which involves selecting a single output
from a list of candidate outputs generated by
a baseline system. We propose a novel fam-
ily of reranking algorithms based on learning
separate low-dimensional embeddings of the
task?s input and output spaces. This embed-
ding is learned in such a way that prediction
becomes a low-dimensional nearest-neighbor
search, which can be done computationally ef-
ficiently. A key quality of our approach is that
feature engineering can be done separately on
the input and output spaces; the relationship
between inputs and outputs is learned auto-
matically. Experiments on part-of-speech tag-
ging task in four languages show significant
improvements over a baseline decoder and ex-
isting reranking approaches.
