 
This paper analyzes the relative importance of 
different linguistic features for data-driven 
dependency parsing of Hindi, using a feature 
pool derived from two state-of-the-art parsers.  
The analysis shows that the greatest gain in 
accuracy comes from the addition of morpho-
syntactic features related to case, tense, aspect 
and modality. Combining features from the 
two parsers, we achieve a labeled attachment 
score of 76.5%, which is 2 percentage points 
better than the previous state of the art. We fi-
nally provide a detailed error analysis and 
suggest possible improvements to the parsing 
scheme.
