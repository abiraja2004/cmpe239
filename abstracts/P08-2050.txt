In this paper we present research in which we
apply (i) the kind of intrinsic evaluation met-
rics that are characteristic of current compara-
tive HLT evaluation, and (ii) extrinsic, human
task-performance evaluations more in keeping
with NLG traditions, to 15 systems implement-
ing a language generation task. We analyse
the evaluation results and find that there are no
significant correlations between intrinsic and
extrinsic evaluation measures for this task.
