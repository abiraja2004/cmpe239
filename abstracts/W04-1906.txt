We present a method for corpus-based induc-
tion of an LFG syntax-semantics interface for
frame semantic processing in a computational
LFG parsing architecture. We show how to
model frame semantic annotations in an LFG
projection architecture, including special phe-
nomena that involve non-isomorphic mappings
between levels. Frame semantic annotations
are ported from a manually annotated corpus
to a ?parallel? LFG corpus. We extract func-
tional descriptions from the frame-annotated
LFG corpus, to derive general frame assign-
ment rules that can be applied to new sentences.
We evaluate the results by applying the induced
frame assignment rules to LFG parser output.1
