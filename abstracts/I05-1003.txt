. For cross-language text retrieval systems that rely on bilingual dic-
tionaries for bridging the language gap between the source query language and 
the target document language, good bilingual dictionary coverage is imperative.  
For terms with missing translations, most systems employ some approaches for 
expanding the existing translation dictionaries.  In this paper, instead of lexicon 
expansion, we explore whether using the context of the unknown terms can help 
mitigate the loss of meaning due to missing translation.  Our approaches consist 
of two steps: (1) to identify terms that are closely associated with the unknown 
source language terms as context vectors and (2) to use the translations of the 
associated terms in the context vectors as the surrogate translations of the un-
known terms.  We describe a query-independent version and a query-dependent 
version using such monolingual context vectors.  These methods are evaluated 
in Japanese-to-English retrieval using the NTCIR-3 topics and data sets.  Em-
pirical results show that both methods improved CLIR performance for short 
and medium-length queries and that the query-dependent context vectors per-
formed better than the query-independent versions.
