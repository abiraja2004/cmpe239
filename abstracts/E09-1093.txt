A corpus-based technique is described to
improve the efficiency of wide-coverage
high-accuracy parsers. By keeping track
of the derivation steps which lead to the
best parse for a very large collection of
sentences, the parser learns which parse
steps can be filtered without significant
loss in parsing accuracy, but with an im-
portant increase in parsing efficiency. An
interesting characteristic of our approach
is that it is self-learning, in the sense that
it uses unannotated corpora.
