Chinese is a language that does not have mor-
phological tense markers that provide explicit
grammaticalization of the temporal location of
situations (events or states). However, in many
NLP applications such as Machine Transla-
tion, Information Extraction and Question An-
swering, it is desirable to make the temporal
location of the situations explicit. We describe
a machine learning framework where differ-
ent sources of information can be combined to
predict the temporal location of situations in
Chinese text. Our experiments show that this
approach significantly outperforms the most
frequent tense baseline. More importantly,
the high training accuracy shows promise that
this challenging problem is solvable to a level
where it can be used in practical NLP applica-
tions with more training data, better modeling
techniques and more informative and general-
izable features.
