In this paper we investigate methods
for computing similarity of two phrases
based on their relatedness scores across
all ranks k in a SVD approximation of
a phrase/term co-occurrence matrix. We
confirm the major observations made in
previous work and our preliminary experi-
ments indicate that these methods can lead
to reliable similarity scores which in turn
can be used for the task of paraphrasing.
