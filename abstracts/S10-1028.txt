We report here our work on English
French Cross-lingual Word Sense Disam-
biguation where the task is to find the
best French translation for a target English
word depending on the context in which it
is used. Our approach relies on identifying
the nearest neighbors of the test sentence
from the training data using a pairwise
similarity measure. The proposed mea-
sure finds the affinity between two sen-
tences by calculating a weighted sum of
the word overlap and the semantic over-
lap between them. The semantic overlap
is calculated using standard Wordnet Sim-
ilarity measures. Once the nearest neigh-
bors have been identified, the best trans-
lation is found by taking a majority vote
over the French translations of the nearest
neighbors.
