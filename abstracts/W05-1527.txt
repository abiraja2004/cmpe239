We describe SUPPLE, a freely-available,
open source natural language parsing sys-
tem, implemented in Prolog, and designed
for practical use in language engineering
(LE) applications. SUPPLE can be run as
a stand-alone application, or as a compo-
nent within the GATE General Architec-
ture for Text Engineering. SUPPLE is dis-
tributed with an example grammar that has
been developed over a number of years
across several LE projects. This paper de-
scribes the key characteristics of the parser
and the distributed grammar.
