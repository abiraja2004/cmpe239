In this paper we present a novel approach
(SDSM) that incorporates structure in dis-
tributional semantics. SDSM represents
meaning as relation specific distributions
over syntactic neighborhoods. We em-
pirically show that the model can effec-
tively represent the semantics of single
words and provides significant advantages
when dealing with phrasal units that in-
volve word composition. In particular, we
demonstrate that our model outperforms
both state-of-the-art window-based word
embeddings as well as simple approaches
for composing distributional semantic rep-
resentations on an artificial task of verb
sense disambiguation and a real-world ap-
plication of judging event coreference.
