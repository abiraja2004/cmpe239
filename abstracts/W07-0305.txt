 
We introduce Olympus, a freely available 
framework for research in conversational 
interfaces. Olympus? open, transparent, 
flexible, modular and scalable nature fa-
cilitates the development of large-scale, 
real-world systems, and enables research 
leading to technological and scientific ad-
vances in conversational spoken language 
interfaces. In this paper, we describe the 
overall architecture, several systems 
spanning different domains, and a number 
of current research efforts supported by 
Olympus.
