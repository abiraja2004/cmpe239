Previous research has demonstrated the
importance of handling differences be-
tween domains such as ?newswire? and
?biomedicine? when porting NLP systems
from one domain to another. In this paper
we identify the related issue of subdomain
variation, i.e., differences between subsets
of a domain that might be expected to be-
have homogeneously. Using a large corpus
of research articles, we explore how subdo-
mains of biomedicine vary across a variety
of linguistic dimensions and discover that
there is rich variation. We conclude that
an awareness of such variation is necessary
when deploying NLP systems for use in
single or multiple subdomains.
