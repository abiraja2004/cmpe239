During the last decade, there has been
a shift from developing natural lan-
guage generation systems to developing
generic systems that are capable of pro-
ducing natural language descriptions di-
rectly from Web ontologies. To make
these descriptions coherent and accessi-
ble in different languages, a methodol-
ogy is needed for identifying the gen-
eral principles that would determine the
distribution of referential forms. Pre-
vious work has proved through cross-
linguistic investigations that strategies for
building coreference are language depen-
dent. However, to our knowledge, there is
no language generation methodology that
makes a distinction between languages
about the generation of referential chains.
To determine the principles governing
referential chains, we gathered data from
three languages: English, Swedish and
Hebrew, and studied how coreference is
expressed in a discourse. As a result of
the study, a set of language specific coref-
erence strategies were identified. Using
these strategies, an ontology-based mul-
tilingual grammar for generating writ-
ten natural language descriptions about
paintings was implemented in the Gram-
matical Framework. A preliminary eval-
uation of our method shows language-
dependent coreference strategies lead to
better generation results.
