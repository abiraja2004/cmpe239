 
The acceptance of speech dialogue sys- 
tems by the user is critically dependent 
on the degree of "naturalness" realized. 
The speech generation and synthesis mod- 
ules have to be able to run in real time 
and to produce high-quality speech output. 
To produce naturally sounding speech, the 
synthesizer has to have not only the knowl- 
edge of the words to utter and the or- 
der in which they appear but also infor- 
mation about their structural relationship. 
The latter is expressed acoustically in the 
form of prosody, i.e. how the voice raises 
and falls during an utterance, the rhythm, 
where pauses are set, etc. Prosody is 
also influenced by the properties associated 
with given words in the context of an ut- 
terance, e.g. the focus of a sentence or cer- 
tain emphatic elements. This article de- 
scribes a compact representation for con- 
veying this type of information from the 
generator to the synthesizer in a modular 
system and describes how (parts of) this in- 
formation is (are) derived in the EFFENDI 
system, the generation module for a speech 
dialogue system for train inquiries.
