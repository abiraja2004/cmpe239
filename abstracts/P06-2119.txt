 
This paper designs a novel lexical hub to 
disambiguate word sense, using both syn-
tagmatic and paradigmatic relations of 
words. It only employs the semantic net-
work of WordNet to calculate word simi-
larity, and the Edinburgh Association 
Thesaurus (EAT) to transform contextual 
space for computing syntagmatic and 
other domain relations with the target 
word. Without any back-off policy the 
result on the English lexical sample of 
SENSEVAL-21 shows that lexical cohe-
sion based on edge-counting techniques 
is a good way of unsupervisedly disam-
biguating senses.
