Algorithms that generate expressions to 
identify a referent are mostly tailored 
towards objects which are in some sense 
conceived as holistic entities, describing 
them in terms of their properties and 
relations to other objects. This approach 
may prove not fully adequate when 
referring to components of structured 
objects, specifically for abstract objects 
in formal domains, where scope and 
relative positions are essential features. 
In this paper, we adapt the standard Dale 
and Reiter algorithm to specifics of such 
references as observed in a corpus about  
mathematical proofs. Extensions incor-
porated include an incremental speciali-
zation of property values for metonymic 
references, local and global positions 
reflecting group formations and impli-
cature-based scope preferences to justify 
unique identification of the intended 
referent. The approach is primarily 
relevant for domains where abstract 
formal objects are prominent, but some 
of its features are also useful to extend 
the expressive repertoire of reference 
generation algorithms in other domains.
