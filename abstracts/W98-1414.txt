In text, discourse markers ignal the kind of coherence r lation holding between adjacent text 
spans; for example, because, since; and for this reason are different markers for causal relations. 
For  any but the most simple applications of text generation, marker Selection is an important 
aspect of producing cohesive text. However, present systems use markers in fairly simplistic ways 
andcannot make use of the full potential of markers that language offers for a given relation. 
? To improve this situation, we propose a specialized lexicon for discourse markers, which holds 
the relevant constraints and preferences a sociated with the markers, and which can be used by 
a text generator to make an informed choice among alternative ways of expressing a relation 
in the given context, we demonstrate how .the lexicon can be employed in the generation 
? process and propose to perform discourse marker choice in the sentence planning stage, where 
the interactions with other generation? decisions can be accounted for.
