Up to now, work on semantic relations has fo-
cused on relation classification: recognizing
whether a given instance (a word pair such as
virus:flu) belongs to a specific relation class
(such as CAUSE:EFFECT). However, instances
of a single relation class may still have signif-
icant variability in how characteristic they are
of that class. We present a new SemEval task
based on identifying the degree of prototypi-
cality for instances within a given class. As
a part of the task, we have assembled the first
dataset of graded relational similarity ratings
across 79 relation categories. Three teams
submitted six systems, which were evaluated
using two methods.
