In this paper, we present a novel approach
to enhance hierarchical phrase-based machine
translation systems with linguistically moti-
vated syntactic features. Rather than directly
using treebank categories as in previous stud-
ies, we learn a set of linguistically-guided la-
tent syntactic categories automatically from a
source-side parsed, word-aligned parallel cor-
pus, based on the hierarchical structure among
phrase pairs as well as the syntactic structure
of the source side. In our model, each X non-
terminal in a SCFG rule is decorated with a
real-valued feature vector computed based on
its distribution of latent syntactic categories.
These feature vectors are utilized at decod-
ing time to measure the similarity between the
syntactic analysis of the source side and the
syntax of the SCFG rules that are applied to
derive translations. Our approach maintains
the advantages of hierarchical phrase-based
translation systems while at the same time nat-
urally incorporates soft syntactic constraints.
