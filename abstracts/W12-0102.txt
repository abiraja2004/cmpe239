In this paper we present and evaluate three
approaches to measure comparability of
documents in non-parallel corpora. We de-
velop a task-oriented definition of compa-
rability, based on the performance of auto-
matic extraction of translation equivalents
from the documents aligned by the pro-
posed metrics, which formalises intuitive
definitions of comparability for machine
translation research. We demonstrate ap-
plication of our metrics for the task of
automatic extraction of parallel and semi-
parallel translation equivalents and discuss
how these resources can be used in the
frameworks of statistical and rule-based
machine translation.
