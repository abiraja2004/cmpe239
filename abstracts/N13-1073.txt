We present a simple log-linear reparame-
terization of IBM Model 2 that overcomes
problems arising from Model 1?s strong
assumptions and Model 2?s overparame-
terization. Efficient inference, likelihood
evaluation, and parameter estimation algo-
rithms are provided. Training the model is
consistently ten times faster than Model 4.
On three large-scale translation tasks, systems
built using our alignment model outperform
IBM Model 4.
An open-source implementation of the align-
ment model described in this paper is available
from http://github.com/clab/fast align .
