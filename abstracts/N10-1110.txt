We suggest improvements to a previously pro-
posed framework for integrating Conditional
Random Fields and Hidden Markov Models,
dubbed a Crandem system (2009). The pre-
vious authors? work suggested that local la-
bel posteriors derived from the CRF were too
low-entropy for use in word-level automatic
speech recognition. As an alternative to the
log posterior representation used in their sys-
tem, we explore frame-level representations
derived from the CRF feature functions. We
also describe a weight normalization transfor-
mation that leads to increased entropy of the
CRF posteriors. We report significant gains
over the previous Crandem system on the Wall
Street Journal word recognition task.
