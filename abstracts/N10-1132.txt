Abstract
We address the challenge of automatically ab-
stracting conversations such as face-to-face
meetings and emails. We focus here on
the stages of interpretation, where sentences
are mapped to a conversation ontology, and
transformation, where the summary content
is selected. Our approach is fully developed
and tested on meeting speech, and we subse-
quently explore its application to email con-
versations.
