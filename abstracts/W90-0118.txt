Abstract 
The utihty of rhetorical abstractions and certain text 
planning mechanisms were assessed from the stand- 
point of accounting for how an explainer chooses and 
structures content under multiple perspectives to meet 
knowledge communication goals. This paper discusses 
ways in which they were found to be inadequate, ar- 
gues for greater emphasis on an epistemological level of 
analysis, and proposes a mixed architecture matching 
computational mechanisms to the explanation planning 
subtasks they are suited for.
