We present an implemented XML data model and a
new, simplified query language for multi-level an-
notated corpora. The new query language involves
automatic conversion of queries into the underly-
ing, more complicated MMAXQL query language.
It supports queries for sequential and hierarchical,
but also associative (e.g. coreferential) relations.
The simplified query language has been designed
with non-expert users in mind.
