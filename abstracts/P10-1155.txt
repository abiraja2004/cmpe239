In spite of decades of research on word
sense disambiguation (WSD), all-words
general purpose WSD has remained a dis-
tant goal. Many supervised WSD systems
have been built, but the effort of creat-
ing the training corpus - annotated sense
marked corpora - has always been a matter
of concern. Therefore, attempts have been
made to develop unsupervised and knowl-
edge based techniques for WSD which do
not need sense marked corpora. However
such approaches have not proved effective,
since they typically do not better Word-
net first sense baseline accuracy. Our re-
search reported here proposes to stick to
the supervised approach, but with far less
demand on annotation. We show that if
we have ANY sense marked corpora, be it
from mixed domain or a specific domain, a
small amount of annotation in ANY other
domain can deliver the goods almost as
if exhaustive sense marking were avail-
able in that domain. We have tested our
approach across Tourism and Health do-
main corpora, using also the well known
mixed domain SemCor corpus. Accuracy
figures close to self domain training lend
credence to the viability of our approach.
Our contribution thus lies in finding a con-
venient middle ground between pure su-
pervised and pure unsupervised WSD. Fi-
nally, our approach is not restricted to any
specific set of target words, a departure
from a commonly observed practice in do-
main specific WSD.
