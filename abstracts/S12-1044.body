This  paper  reports  on  a  simple  system  for 
resolving the scope of negation in the closed 
track of  the *SEM 2012 Shared Task.   Cue 
detection  is  performed  using  regular 
expression  rules  extracted  from  the  training 
data.  Both  scope  tokens  and  negated  event 
tokens  are  resolved  using  a  Conditional 
Random  Field  (CRF)  sequence  tagger  ? 
namely  the  SimpleTagger  library  in  the 
MALLET machine learning toolkit.  The full 
negation  F1 score  obtained  for  the  task 
evaluation is 48.09% (P=74.02%, R=35.61%) 
which ranks this system fourth among the six 
submitted for the closed track.
