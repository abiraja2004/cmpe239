 
One of the ways to achieve a good translation of 
verbal forms is the morphosp~tactic approach, which consists 
in a function pairing the different morphological tenses 
that occur in a given language with the tenses of the other 
language. Complicated rules must be established to calculate 
the right pair for an expression, because of the amount of 
discrepancies that differmnt languages show with respect to 
each other. 
The way we have chosen to deal with this problem is, 
conversely, the projection of the different values coming 
from verbs (type, processivity, morftense, morfaspect, 
moodrequire~nent), from adverbs, prepositional phrases and 
temporal N~S (deixis, espect, iteration), and from 
subordinate conjunctions (aspect, moodrequirement). 
All this information permits to obtain a final value 
for aspect .~nd tense for the whole sentence, which later on 
i8 percolated, not only to the verb node, but also to the 
the rest of elements conveying information. 
Our proposal relies on the fact that tense/aspect 
calculation is relevant not only for a good translation of 
verbs, but also for a good translation of adverbs, PPs, 
temporal I~.~ and conjunctions, as we have intended to 
demonstrat~ ~n this paper.
