This paper describes the design of a sys-
tem for extracting keyphrases from a sin-
gle document The principle of the algo-
rithm is to cluster sentences of the doc-
uments in order to highlight parts of text
that are semantically related. The clusters
of sentences, that reflect the themes of the
document, are then analyzed to find the
main topics of the text. Finally, the most
important words, or groups of words, from
these topics are proposed as keyphrases.
