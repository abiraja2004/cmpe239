We investigate state-of-the-art statistical
models for lemmatization and morphosyn-
tactic tagging of Croatian and Serbian.
The models stem from a new manually
annotated SETIMES.HR corpus of Croa-
tian, based on the SETimes parallel cor-
pus. We train models on Croatian text
and evaluate them on samples of Croat-
ian and Serbian from the SETimes corpus
and the two Wikipedias. Lemmatization
accuracy for the two languages reaches
97.87% and 96.30%, while full morphosyn-
tactic tagging accuracy using a 600-tag
tagset peaks at 87.72% and 85.56%, respec-
tively. Part of speech tagging accuracies
reach 97.13% and 96.46%. Results indicate
that more complex methods of Croatian-to-
Serbian annotation projection are not re-
quired on such dataset sizes for these par-
ticular tasks. The SETIMES.HR corpus, its
resulting models and test sets are all made
freely available.
