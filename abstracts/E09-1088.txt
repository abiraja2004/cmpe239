Latent conditional models have become
popular recently in both natural language
processing and vision processing commu-
nities. However, establishing an effective
and efficient inference method on latent
conditional models remains a question. In
this paper, we describe the latent-dynamic
inference (LDI), which is able to produce
the optimal label sequence on latent con-
ditional models by using efficient search
strategy and dynamic programming. Fur-
thermore, we describe a straightforward
solution on approximating the LDI, and
show that the approximated LDI performs
as well as the exact LDI, while the speed is
much faster. Our experiments demonstrate
that the proposed inference algorithm out-
performs existing inference methods on
a variety of natural language processing
tasks.
