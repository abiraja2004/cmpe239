We investigate the problem of measuring
phonetic similarity, focusing on the iden-
tification of cognates, words of the same
origin in different languages. We com-
pare representatives of two principal ap-
proaches to computing phonetic similar-
ity: manually-designed metrics, and learn-
ing algorithms. In particular, we consider
a stochastic transducer, a Pair HMM, sev-
eral DBN models, and two constructed
schemes. We test those approaches on
the task of identifying cognates among
Indoeuropean languages, both in the su-
pervised and unsupervised context. Our
results suggest that the averaged context
DBN model and the Pair HMM achieve
the highest accuracy given a large training
set of positive examples.
