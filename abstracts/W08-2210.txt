We present the explanation structure of procedural texts, focusing on the
analysis of argumentation, in particular advice and warnings. Their role is
to support and motivate the goal-instruction structure, which is the skele-
ton of procedural texts. Procedural texts consist of a sequence of instruc-
tions, designed with some accuracy in order to reach a goal (e.g. assemble
a computer). Procedural texts may also include subgoals. Goals and sub-
goals are most of the time realized by means of titles and subtitles. The
user must carefully follow step by step the given instructions in order to
reach the goal. We introduce the notion of instructional compound, which
is a complex structure that articulates instructions with various discourse
elements. We then show how arguments can be extracted with the help of
patterns. We finally investigate their contribution to the structure and the
understanding of procedural texts.
