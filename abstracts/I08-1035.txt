An approach to solving the problem of au-
tomatic briefing generation from non-textual
events can be segmenting the task into two
major steps, namely, extraction of briefing
templates and learning aggregators that col-
late information from events and automati-
cally fill up the templates. In this paper, we
describe two novel unsupervised approaches
for extracting briefing templates from hu-
man written reports. Since the problem is
non-standard, we define our own criteria for
evaluating the approaches and demonstrate
that both approaches are effective in extract-
ing domain relevant templates with promis-
ing accuracies.
