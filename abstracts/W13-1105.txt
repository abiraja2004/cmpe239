 
In this paper, we describe a novel approach to automatically detecting and tracking discus-sion dynamics in Internet social media by fo-cusing on attitude modeling of topics. We characterize each participant?s attitude to-wards topics as Topical Positioning, employ Topical Positioning Map to represent the posi-tions of participants with respect to each other and track attitude shifts over time. We also discuss how we used participants? attitudes towards system-detected meso-topics to re-flect their attitudes towards the overall topic of conversation. Our approach can work across different types of social media, such as Twitter discussion and online chat room. In this article, we show results on Twitter data.
