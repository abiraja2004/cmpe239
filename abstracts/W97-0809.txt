 
This paper presents a method for en- 
abling users to specialize an information 
extraction system to satisfy their particular 
needs. The method allows the user to man- 
ually demonstrate the creation of seman- 
tic nodes and transitions while scanning a
sample text article using a graphical user 
interface. On the basis of such examples, 
the system creates rules that translate text 
to semantic nets; then it generalizes these 
rules so that they can apply to a broad class 
of text instead of only the training articles. 
Finally, the generalized rules are used to 
scan large numbers of articles to extract 
the particular information targeted by the 
user. This paper concentrates on our de- 
sign of the generalization mechanism which 
self modifies to precisely match the user's 
specification.
