This paper discusses the use of statistical word
alignment over multiple parallel texts for the identi-
fication of string spans that cannot be constituents
in one of the languages. This information is ex-
ploited in monolingual PCFG grammar induction
for that language, within an augmented version of
the inside-outside algorithm. Besides the aligned
corpus, no other resources are required. We discuss
an implemented system and present experimental
results with an evaluation against the Penn Tree-
bank.
