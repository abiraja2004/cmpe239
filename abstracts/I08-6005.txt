Accurate high-coverage translation is a vi-
tal component of reliable cross language in-
formation access (CLIA) systems. While
machine translation (MT) has been shown
to be effective for CLIA tasks in previous
evaluation workshops, it is not well suited
to specialized tasks where domain specific
translations are required. We demonstrate
that effective query translation for CLIA can
be achieved in the domain of cultural her-
itage (CH). This is performed by augment-
ing a standard MT system with domain-
specific phrase dictionaries automatically
mined from the online Wikipedia. Exper-
iments using our hybrid translation system
with sample query logs from users of CH
websites demonstrate a large improvement
in the accuracy of domain specific phrase de-
tection and translation.
