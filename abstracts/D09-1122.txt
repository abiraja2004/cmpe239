Textual entailment recognition plays a
fundamental role in tasks that require in-
depth natural language understanding. In
order to use entailment recognition tech-
nologies for real-world applications, a
large-scale entailment knowledge base is
indispensable. This paper proposes a con-
ditional probability based directional sim-
ilarity measure to acquire verb entailment
pairs on a large scale. We targeted 52,562
verb types that were derived from 108
Japanese Web documents, without regard
for whether they were used in daily life
or only in specific fields. In an evaluation
of the top 20,000 verb entailment pairs ac-
quired by previous methods and ours, we
found that our similarity measure outper-
formed the previous ones. Our method
also worked well for the top 100,000 re-
sults.
