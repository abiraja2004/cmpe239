We describe a new information fusion 
approach to integrate facts extracted 
from cross-media objects (videos and 
texts) into a coherent common represen-
tation including multi-level knowledge 
(concepts, relations and events). Beyond 
standard information fusion, we ex-
ploited video extraction results and sig-
nificantly improved text Information Ex-
traction. We further extended our meth-
ods to multi-lingual environment (Eng-
lish, Arabic and Chinese) by presenting 
a case study on cross-lingual comparable 
corpora acquisition based on video com-
parison.
