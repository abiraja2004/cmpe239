  
Open-Domain Question Answering systems 
(QA) performs the task of detecting text 
fragments in a collection of documents that 
contain the response to user?s queries. 
These systems use high complexity tools that 
reduce its applicability to the treatment of 
small amounts of text. Consequently, when 
working on large document collections, QA 
systems apply Information Retrieval (IR) 
techniques to reduce drastically text 
collections to a tractable quantity of 
relevant text. In this paper, we propose a 
novel Passage Retrieval (PR) model that 
performs this task with better performance 
for QA purposes than current best IR 
systems
