models and methods in bilingual lexicon 
extraction, either from parallel or 
comparable corpora, in specialized domains. 
First, a special attention is given to the use 
of multilingual thesauri, and different search 
strategies based on such thesauri are 
investigated. Then, a method to combine the 
different models for bilingual lexicon 
extraction is presented. Our results show 
that the combination of the models 
significantly improves results, and that the 
use of the hierarchical information contained 
in our thesaurus, UMLS/MeSH, is of 
primary importance. Lastly, methods for 
bilingual terminology extraction and 
thesaurus enrichment are discussed.
