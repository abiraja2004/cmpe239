Abstract 
In this paper, we study different centrality 
measures being used in predicting noun 
phrases appearing in the abstracts of sci-
entific articles. Our experimental results 
show that centrality measures improve the 
accuracy of the prediction in terms of 
both precision and recall. We also found 
that the method of constructing Noun 
Phrase Network significantly influences 
the accuracy when using the centrality 
heuristics itself, but is negligible when it 
is used together with other text features in 
decision trees.
