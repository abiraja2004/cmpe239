 
Sino-Korean words, which are historically 
borrowed from Chinese language, could be 
represented with both Hanja (Chinese 
characters) and Hangeul (Korean characters) 
writings. Previous Korean Input Method 
Editors (IMEs) provide only a simple 
dictionary-based approach for Hangeul-Hanja 
conversion. This paper presents a sentence-
based statistical model for Hangeul-Hanja 
conversion, with word tokenization included 
as a hidden process. As a result, we reach 
91.4% of character accuracy and 81.4% of 
word accuracy in terminology domain, when 
only very limited Hanja data is available.
