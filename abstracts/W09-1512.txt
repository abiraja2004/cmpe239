Integrating rules and statistical systems is a
challenge often faced by natural language pro-
cessing system builders. A common sub-
class is integrating high precision rules with a
Markov statistical sequence classifier. In this
paper we suggest that using such rules to con-
strain the sequence classifier decoder results
in superior accuracy and efficiency. In a case
study of a named entity tagging system, we
provide evidence that this method of combina-
tion does prove efficient than other methods.
The accuracy was the same.
