 
We discuss an automatic method for the construction of 
hypertext links within and between ewspaper articles. 
The method comprises three steps: determining the lexical 
chains in a text, building links between the paragraphs of
articles, and building links between articles. Lexical chains 
capture the semantic relations between words that occur 
throughout a text. Each chain is a set of related words that 
captures a portion of the cohesive structure of a text. By 
considering the distribution of chains within an article, we 
can build links between the paragraphs. By computing the 
similarity of the chains contained in two different articles, 
we can decide whether or not to place a link between them. 
We also describe the results of an evaluation performed to 
test he methodology.
