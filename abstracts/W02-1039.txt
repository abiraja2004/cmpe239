There has been much interest in us-
ing phrasal movement to improve statis-
tical machine translation. We explore
how well phrases cohere across two lan-
guages, specifically English and French,
and examine the particular conditions un-
der which they do not. We demonstrate
that while there are cases where coherence
is poor, there are many regularities which
can be exploited by a statistical machine
translation system. We also compare three
variant syntactic representations to deter-
mine which one has the best properties
with respect to cohesion.
