The Right Frontier Constraint (RFC), as a
constraint on the attachment of new con-
stituents to an existing discourse struc-
ture, has important implications for the in-
terpretation of anaphoric elements in dis-
course and for Machine Learning (ML) ap-
proaches to learning discourse structures.
In this paper we provide strong empirical
support for SDRT?s version of RFC. The
analysis of about 100 doubly annotated
documents by five different naive annota-
tors shows that SDRT?s RFC is respected
about 95% of the time. The qualitative
analysis of presumed violations that we
have performed shows that they are either
click-errors or structural misconceptions.
