Have2eat is a popular mobile application
available for iPhone and Android-based de-
vices that helps users to find and assess
nearby restaurants. It lists restaurants lo-
cated around the device and provides a quick
highlight about the opinions expressed by
online reviewers. Have2eat summarizes tex-
tual reviews by extracting relevant sentences
and by automatically generating detailed rat-
ings about specific aspects of the restaurant.
A compact one-screen digest allows users to
quickly access the information they need, ex-
pand to full review pages, and report their ex-
perience online by entering ratings and com-
ments.
