 
We are going to present a technique of 
preposition disambiguation based on 
sense discriminative patterns, which are 
acquired using a variant of Angluin?s al-
gorithm. They represent the essential in-
formation extracted from a particular 
type of local contexts we call Chain 
Clarifying Relationship contexts. The 
data set and the results we present are 
from the Semeval task, WSD of Preposi-
tion (Litkowski 2007).
