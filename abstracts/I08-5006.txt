 
This paper reports about the development 
of a Named Entity Recognition (NER) sys-
tem for South and South East Asian lan-
guages, particularly for Bengali, Hindi, Te-
lugu, Oriya and Urdu as part of the 
IJCNLP-08 NER Shared Task

. We have 
used the statistical Conditional Random 
Fields (CRFs). The system makes use of 
the different contextual information of the 
words along with the variety of features 
that are helpful in predicting the various 
named entity (NE) classes. The system uses 
both the language independent as well as 
language dependent features. The language 
independent features are applicable for all 
the languages. The language dependent 
features have been used for Bengali and 
Hindi only. One of the difficult tasks of 
IJCNLP-08 NER Shared task was to iden-
tify the nested named entities (NEs) though 
only the type of the maximal NEs were 
given. To identify nested NEs, we have 
used rules that are applicable for all the 
five languages. In addition to these rules, 
gazetteer lists have been used for Bengali 
and Hindi. The system has been trained 
with Bengali (122,467 tokens), Hindi 
(502,974 tokens), Telugu (64,026 tokens), 
Oriya (93,173 tokens) and Urdu (35,447 
tokens) data. The system has been tested 
with the 30,505 tokens of Bengali, 38,708 
tokens of Hindi, 6,356 tokens of Telugu,

24,640 tokens of Oriya and 3,782 tokens of 
Urdu. Evaluation results have demonstrated 
the highest maximal F-measure of 53.36%, 
nested F-measure of 53.46% and lexical F-
measure of 59.39% for Bengali.
