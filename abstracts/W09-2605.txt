Grammar extraction in deep formalisms
has received remarkable attention in re-
cent years. We recognise its value, but try
to create a more precision-oriented gram-
mar, by hand-crafting a core grammar, and
learning lexical types and lexical items
from a treebank. The study we performed
focused on German, and we used the Tiger
treebank as our resource. A completely
hand-written grammar in the framework of
HPSG forms the inspiration for our core
grammar, and is also our frame of refer-
ence for evaluation. 1
