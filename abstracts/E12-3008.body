In this work I address the challenge of aug-
menting n-gram language models accord-
ing to prior linguistic intuitions. I argue
that the family of hierarchical Pitman-Yor
language models is an attractive vehicle
through which to address the problem, and
demonstrate the approach by proposing a
model for German compounds. In an em-
pirical evaluation, the model outperforms
the Kneser-Ney model in terms of perplex-
ity, and achieves preliminary improvements
in English-German translation.
