Using keyword overlaps to identify pla-
giarism can result in many false negatives
and positives: substitution of synonyms
for each other reduces the similarity be-
tween works, making it difficult to rec-
ognize plagiarism; overlap in ambiguous
keywords can falsely inflate the similar-
ity of works that are in fact different in
content. Plagiarism detection based on
verbatim similarity of works can be ren-
dered ineffective when works are para-
phrased even in superficial and immate-
rial ways. Considering linguistic informa-
tion related to creative aspects of writing
can improve identification of plagiarism
by adding a crucial dimension to evalu-
ation of similarity: documents that share
linguistic elements in addition to content
are more likely to be copied from each
other. In this paper, we present a set of
low-level syntactic structures that capture
creative aspects of writing and show that
information about linguistic similarities
of works improves recognition of plagia-
rism (over tfidf-weighted keywords alone)
when combined with similarity measure-
ments based on tfidf-weighted keywords.
