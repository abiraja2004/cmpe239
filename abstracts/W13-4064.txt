We present an analysis of several pub-
licly available automatic speech recogniz-
ers (ASRs) in terms of their suitability for
use in different types of dialogue systems.
We focus in particular on cloud based
ASRs that recently have become available
to the community. We include features
of ASR systems and desiderata and re-
quirements for different dialogue systems,
taking into account the dialogue genre,
type of user, and other features. We then
present speech recognition results for six
different dialogue systems. The most in-
teresting result is that different ASR sys-
tems perform best on the data sets. We
also show that there is an improvement
over a previous generation of recognizers
on some of these data sets. We also inves-
tigate language understanding (NLU) on
the ASR output, and explore the relation-
ship between ASR and NLU performance.
