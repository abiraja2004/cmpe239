We describe a mechanism which receives
as input a segmented argument composed
of NL sentences, and generates an inter-
pretation. Our mechanism relies on the
Minimum Message Length Principle for
the selection of an interpretation among
candidate options. This enables our mech-
anism to cope with noisy input in terms
of wording, beliefs and argument struc-
ture; and reduces its reliance on a partic-
ular knowledge representation. The per-
formance of our system was evaluated by
distorting automatically generated argu-
ments, and passing them to the system
for interpretation. In 75% of the cases,
the interpretations produced by the system
matched precisely or almost-precisely the
representation of the original arguments.
