Applying the noisy channel model to
search query spelling correction requires
an error model and a language model.
Typically, the error model relies on a
weighted string edit distance measure.
The weights can be learned from pairs
of misspelled words and their corrections.
This paper investigates using the Expec-
tation Maximization algorithm to learn
edit distance weights directly from search
query logs, without relying on a corpus of
paired words.
