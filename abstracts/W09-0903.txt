In this paper we present the first step in a larger
series of experiments for the induction of pred-
icate/argument structures. The structures that
we are inducing are very similar to the con-
ceptual structures that are used in Frame Se-
mantics (such as FrameNet). Those structures
are called messages and they were previously
used in the context of a multi-document sum-
marization system of evolving events. The se-
ries of experiments that we are proposing are
essentially composed from two stages. In the
first stage we are trying to extract a represen-
tative vocabulary of words. This vocabulary
is later used in the second stage, during which
we apply to it various clustering approaches in
order to identify the clusters of predicates and
arguments?or frames and semantic roles, to
use the jargon of Frame Semantics. This paper
presents in detail and evaluates the first stage.
