We present a corpus analysis of how Ital-
ian connectives are translated into LIS, the
Italian Sign Language. Since corpus re-
sources are scarce, we propose an align-
ment method between the syntactic trees
of the Italian sentence and of its LIS trans-
lation. This method, and clustering ap-
plied to its outputs, highlight the differ-
ent ways a connective can be rendered in
LIS: with a corresponding sign, by affect-
ing the location or shape of other signs, or
being omitted altogether. We translate
these findings into a computational model
that will be integrated into the pipeline of
an existing Italian-LIS rendering system.
Initial experiments to learn the four possi-
ble translations with Decision Trees give
promising results.
