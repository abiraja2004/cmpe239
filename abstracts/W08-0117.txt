An attempt was made to statistically estimate
proposals which survived the discussion to
be incorporated in the final agreement in an
instance of a Japanese design conversation.
Low level speech and vision features of hearer
behaviors corresponding to aiduti, noddings
and gaze were found to be a positive pre-
dictor of survival. The result suggests that
non-linguistic hearer responses work as im-
plicit proposal filters in consensus building,
and could provide promising candidate fea-
tures for the purpose of recognition and sum-
marization of meeting events.
