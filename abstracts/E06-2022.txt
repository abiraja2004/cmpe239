Morphologically complex terms com-
posed from Greek or Latin elements are
frequent in scientific and technical texts.
Word forming units are thus relevant cues
for the identification of terms in domain-
specific texts. This article describes a
method for the automatic extraction of
terms relying on the detection of classi-
cal prefixes and word-initial combining
forms. Word-forming units are identi-
fied using a regular expression. The sys-
tem then extracts terms by selecting words
which either begin or coalesce with these
elements. Next, terms are grouped in fam-
ilies which are displayed as a weighted list
in HTML format.
