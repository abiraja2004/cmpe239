 
We present a translation model based on 
dependency trees. The model adopts a tree-
to-string approach and extends Phrase-
Based translation (PBT) by using the de-
pendency tree of the source sentence for 
selecting translation options and for reor-
dering them. Decoding is done by translat-
ing each node in the tree and combining its 
translations with those of its head in alter-
native orders with respect to its siblings. 
Reordering of the siblings exploits a heu-
ristic based on the syntactic information 
from the parse tree which is learned from 
the corpus. The decoder uses the same 
phrase tables produced by a PBT system 
for looking up translations of single words 
or of partial sub-trees. A mathematical 
model is presented and experimental re-
sults are discussed.
