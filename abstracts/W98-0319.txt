 
The structure of a discourse is reflected in many as- 
pects of its linguistic realization, including its lexi- 
cal, prosodic, syntactic, and semantic nature. Multi- 
party dialog contains a particular kind of discourse 
structure, the dialog act (DA). Like other types of 
structure, the dialog act sequence of a conversation 
is also reflected in its lexical, prosodic, and syntac- 
tic realization. This paper presents a preliminary in- 
vestigation into the realization of a particular class 
of dialog acts which play an essential structuring 
role in dialog, the backchannels or acknowledge- 
ments tokens. We discuss the lexical, prosodic, and 
syntactic realization of these and subsumed or re- 
lated dialog acts like continuers, assessments, yes- 
answers, agreements, and incipient-speakership. 
We show that lexical knowledge plays a role in 
distinguishing these dialog acts, despite the wide- 
spread ambiguity of words such as yeah, and that 
prosodic knowledge plays a role in DA identifica- 
tion for certain DA types, while lexical cues may 
be sufficient for the remainder. Finally, our investi- 
gation of the syntax of assessments suggests that at 
least some dialog acts have a very constrained syn- 
tactic realization, aper-dialog act 'microsyntax'.
