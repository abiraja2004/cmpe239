Given the restrictions on the subjects and
objects that any given verb may take, it seems
likely that children might learn verbs partly
by exploiting statistical regularities in co-
occurrences between verbs and noun phrases.
Pronouns are the most common NPs in the
speech that children hear. We demonstrate
that pronouns systematically partition several
important classes of verbs, and that a simple
statistical learner can exploit these
regularities to narrow the range of possible
verbs that are consistent with an incomplete
utterance. Taken together, these results
suggest that children might use regularities in
pronoun/verb co-occurrences to help learn
verbs, though whether this is actually so
remains a topic for further research.
