This paper explores the problem of detecting
sentence-level forum authority claims in on-
line discussions. Using a maximum entropy
model, we explore a variety of strategies for
extracting lexical features in a sparse train-
ing scenario, comparing knowledge- and data-
driven methods (and combinations). The aug-
mentation of lexical features with parse con-
text is also investigated. We find that cer-
tain markup features perform remarkably well
alone, but are outperformed by data-driven
selection of lexical features augmented with
parse context.
