We describe a new representation of the
content vocabulary of a text we call word
association profile that captures the pro-
portions of highly associated, mildly asso-
ciated, unassociated, and dis-associated
pairs of words that co-exist in the given
text. We illustrate the shape of the dis-
tirbution and observe variation with genre
and target audience. We present a study
of the relationship between quality of writ-
ing and word association profiles. For a
set of essays written by college graduates
on a number of general topics, we show
that the higher scoring essays tend to have
higher percentages of both highly asso-
ciated and dis-associated pairs, and lower
percentages of mildly associated pairs of
words. Finally, we use word association
profiles to improve a system for automated
scoring of essays.
