Tree-based translation models, which ex-
ploit the linguistic syntax of source lan-
guage, usually separate decoding into two
steps: parsing and translation. Although
this separation makes tree-based decoding
simple and efficient, its translation perfor-
mance is usually limited by the number
of parse trees offered by parser. Alter-
natively, we propose to parse and trans-
late jointly by casting tree-based transla-
tion as parsing. Given a source-language
sentence, our joint decoder produces a
parse tree on the source side and a transla-
tion on the target side simultaneously. By
combining translation and parsing mod-
els in a discriminative framework, our ap-
proach significantly outperforms a forest-
based tree-to-string system by 1.1 ab-
solute BLEU points on the NIST 2005
Chinese-English test set. As a parser,
our joint decoder achieves an F1 score of
80.6% on the Penn Chinese Treebank.
