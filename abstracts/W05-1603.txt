Since its first implementation in 1995, the shallow
NLG system TG/2 has been used as a component in
many NLG applications that range from very shal-
low template systems to in-depth realization en-
gines. TG/2 has continuously been refined, the Java
brother implementation XtraGen has become avail-
able, and the grammar development environment
eGram today allows for designing grammars on a
more abstract level. Besides a better understanding
of the usability of shallow systems like TG/2 has
emerged. Time has come to summarize the devel-
opments and look forward to new borders.
