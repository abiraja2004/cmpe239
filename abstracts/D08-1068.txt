Machine learning approaches to coreference
resolution are typically supervised, and re-
quire expensive labeled data. Some unsuper-
vised approaches have been proposed (e.g.,
Haghighi and Klein (2007)), but they are less
accurate. In this paper, we present the first un-
supervised approach that is competitive with
supervised ones. This is made possible by
performing joint inference across mentions,
in contrast to the pairwise classification typ-
ically used in supervised methods, and by us-
ingMarkov logic as a representation language,
which enables us to easily express relations
like apposition and predicate nominals. On
MUC and ACE datasets, our model outper-
forms Haghigi and Klein?s one using only a
fraction of the training data, and often matches
or exceeds the accuracy of state-of-the-art su-
pervised models.
