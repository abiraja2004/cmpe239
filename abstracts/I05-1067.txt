. We present a new method for computing semantic relatedness of con-
cepts. The method relies solely on the structure of a conceptual network and
eliminates the need for performing additional corpus analysis. The network struc-
ture is employed to generate artificial conceptual glosses. They replace textual
definitions proper written by humans and are processed by a dictionary based
metric of semantic relatedness [1]. We implemented the metric on the basis of
GermaNet, the German counterpart of WordNet, and evaluated the results on a
German dataset of 57 word pairs rated by human subjects for their semantic re-
latedness. Our approach can be easily applied to compute semantic relatedness
based on alternative conceptual networks, e.g. in the domain of life sciences.
