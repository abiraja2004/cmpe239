We present a novel method of statisti-
cal morphological generation, i.e. the pre-
diction of inflected word forms given
lemma, part-of-speech and morphological
features, aimed at robustness to unseen in-
puts. Our system uses a trainable classifier
to predict ?edit scripts? that are then used
to transform lemmas into inflected word
forms. Suffixes of lemmas are included as
features to achieve robustness. We evalu-
ate our system on 6 languages with a vary-
ing degree of morphological richness. The
results show that the system is able to learn
most morphological phenomena and gen-
eralize to unseen inputs, producing sig-
nificantly better results than a dictionary-
based baseline.
