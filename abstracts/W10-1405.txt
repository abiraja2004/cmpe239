We show that na??ve modeling of morphosyn-
tactic agreement in a Constituency-Based
(CB) statistical parsing model is worse than
none, whereas a linguistically adequate way
of modeling inflectional morphology in CB
parsing leads to improved performance. In
particular, we show that an extension of the
Relational-Realizational (RR) model that in-
corporates agreement features is superior to
CB models that treat morphosyntax as state-
splits (SP), and that the RR model benefits
more from inflectional features. We focus on
parsing Hebrew and report the best result to
date, F184.13 for parsing off of gold-tagged
text, 5% error reduction from previous results.
