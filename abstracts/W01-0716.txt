Information about the animacy of
nouns is important for a wide range of
tasks in NLP. In this paper, we present
a method for determining the animacy
of English nouns using WordNet and
machine learning techniques. Our
method firstly categorises the senses
from WordNet using an annotated
corpus and then uses this information
in order to classify nouns for which
the sense is not known. Our evaluation
results show that the accuracy of the
classification of a noun is around 97%
and that animate entities are more
difficult to identify than inanimate
ones.
