The Open-domain Question Answering 
system (QA) has been attached great 
attention for its capacity of providing 
compact and precise results for Xsers.
The question classification is an 
essential part in the system, affecting 
the accuracy of it. The paper studies 
question classification through machine 
learning approaches, namely, different 
classifiers and multiple classifier 
combination method. By using 
compositive statistic and rule classifiers, 
and by introducing dependency 
structure from Minipar and linguistic 
knowledge from Wordnet into question 
representation, the research shows high 
accuracy in question classification.
