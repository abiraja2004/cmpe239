Human tutors detect and respond to student
emotional states, but current machine tutors do
not. Our preliminary machine learning experi-
ments involving transcription, emotion annota-
tion and automatic feature extraction from our
human-human spoken tutoring corpus indicate
that the spoken tutoring system we are devel-
oping can be enhanced to automatically predict
and adapt to student emotional states.
