 
For 20 years, information extraction has fo-
cused on facts expressed in text. In contrast, 
this paper is a snapshot of research in progress 
on inferring properties and relationships 
among participants in dialogs, even though 
these properties/relationships need not be ex-
pressed as facts. For instance, can a machine 
detect that someone is attempting to persuade 
another to action or to change beliefs or is as-
serting their credibility? We report results on 
both English and Arabic discussion forums.
