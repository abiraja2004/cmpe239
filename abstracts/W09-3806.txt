Most cellular telephones use numeric key-
pads, where texting is supported by dic-
tionaries and frequency models. Given a
key sequence, the entry system recognizes
the matching words and proposes a rank-
ordered list of candidates. The ranking
quality is instrumental to an effective en-
try.
This paper describes a new method to en-
hance entry that combines syntax and lan-
guage models. We first investigate com-
ponents to improve the ranking step: lan-
guage models and semantic relatedness.
We then introduce a novel syntactic model
to capture the word context, optimize
ranking, and then reduce the number of
keystrokes per character (KSPC) needed
to write a text. We finally combine this
model with the other components and we
discuss the results.
We show that our syntax-based model
reaches an error reduction in KSPC of
12.4% on a Swedish corpus over a base-
line using word frequencies. We also show
that bigrams are superior to all the other
models. However, bigrams have a mem-
ory footprint that is unfit for most devices.
Nonetheless, bigrams can be further im-
proved by the addition of syntactic mod-
els with an error reduction that reaches
29.4%.
