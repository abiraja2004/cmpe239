Determining the stance expressed by an
author from a post written for a two-sided
debate in an online debate forum is a
relatively new problem in opinion min-
ing. We extend a state-of-the-art learning-
based approach to debate stance classifica-
tion by (1) inducing lexico-syntactic pat-
terns based on syntactic dependencies and
semantic frames that aim to capture the
meaning of a sentence and provide a gen-
eralized representation of it; and (2) im-
proving the classification of a test post via
a novel way of exploiting the information
in other test posts with the same stance.
Empirical results on four datasets demon-
strate the effectiveness of our extensions.
