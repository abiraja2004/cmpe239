This paper presents on-going research
on automatic extraction of bilingual
lexicon from English-Japanese paral-
lel corpora. The main objective of
this paper is to examine various N-
gram models of generating transla-
tion units for bilingual lexicon ex-
traction. Three N-gram models, a
baseline model (Bound-length N-gram)
and two new models (Chunk-bound N-
gram and Dependency-linked N-gram)
are compared. An experiment with
10000 English-Japanese parallel sen-
tences shows that Chunk-bound N-
gram produces the best result in terms
of accuracy (83%) as well as coverage
(60%) and it improves approximately
by 13% in accuracy and by 5-9% in
coverage from the previously proposed
baseline model.
