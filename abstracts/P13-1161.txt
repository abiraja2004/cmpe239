This paper addresses the task of fine-
grained opinion extraction ? the identi-
fication of opinion-related entities: the
opinion expressions, the opinion hold-
ers, and the targets of the opinions, and
the relations between opinion expressions
and their targets and holders. Most ex-
isting approaches tackle the extraction
of opinion entities and opinion relations
in a pipelined manner, where the inter-
dependencies among different extraction
stages are not captured. We propose a joint
inference model that leverages knowledge
from predictors that optimize subtasks
of opinion extraction, and seeks a glob-
ally optimal solution. Experimental re-
sults demonstrate that our joint inference
approach significantly outperforms tradi-
tional pipeline methods and baselines that
tackle subtasks in isolation for the problem
of opinion extraction.
