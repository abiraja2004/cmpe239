In this study, we try to apply SVMs to the se-
mantic role labeling task, which is one of the
multiclass problems. As a result, we propose a
two-phase semantic role labeling model which
consists of the identification phase and the clas-
sification phase. We first identify semantic ar-
guments, and then assign semantic roles to the
identified semantic arguments. By taking the
two-phase approach, we can alleviate the un-
balanced class distribution problem, and select
the features appropriate for each task.
