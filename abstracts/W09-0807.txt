The Arabic language is a collection of
multiple variants, among which Modern
Standard Arabic (MSA) has a special sta-
tus as the formal written standard language
of the media, culture and education across
the Arab world. The other variants are in-
formal spoken dialects that are the media
of communication for daily life. Arabic di-
alects differ substantially from MSA and
each other in terms of phonology, mor-
phology, lexical choice and syntax. In this
paper, we describe a system that automat-
ically identifies the Arabic dialect (Gulf,
Iraqi, Levantine, Egyptian and MSA) of a
speaker given a sample of his/her speech.
The phonotactic approach we use proves
to be effective in identifying these di-
alects with considerable overall accuracy
? 81.60% using 30s test utterances.
