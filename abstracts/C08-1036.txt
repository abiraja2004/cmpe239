 
Semantic relatedness between words is 
important to many NLP tasks, and nu-
merous measures exist which use a vari-
ety of resources. Thus far, such work is 
confined to measuring similarity between 
two words (or two texts), and only a 
handful utilize the web as a corpus. This 
paper introduces a distributional similar-
ity measure which uses internet search 
counts and also extends to calculating the 
similarity within word-groups. The 
evaluation results are encouraging: for 
word-pairs, the correlations with human 
judgments are comparable with state-of-
the-art web-search page-count heuristics. 
When used to measure similarities within 
sets of 10 words, the results correlate 
highly (up to 0.8) with those expected.  
Relatively little comparison has been 
made between the results of different 
search-engines. Here, we compare ex-
perimental results from Google, Win-
dows Live Search and Yahoo and find 
noticeable differences.
