Events described in textual narratives do not
always occur in neat, chronological order but
occur, for example, during or overlapping
each other or as simultaneous events. Summa-
rizations of narratives, however, benefit from
a simpler, linear ordering of events. This pa-
per describes an approach for modeling events
in text as event intervals and for generating
linear orders of event intervals, useful for the
summarization of events or as the basis for
question answering systems. Linear orders are
derived through reducing the set of thirteen
possible event interval relations to a set of
only before or equal relations. The mapping
of event interval relations into before/after se-
quences requires the support of additional
constraints in order to preserve the original
semantics of the events presented in the text
and to derive plausible orders of events.
