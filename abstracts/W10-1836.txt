 
The revised Arabic PropBank (APB) reflects 
a number of changes to the data and the proc-
ess of PropBanking. Several changes stem 
from Treebank revisions. An automatic proc-
ess was put in place to map existing annota-
tion to the new trees. We have revised the 
original 493 Frame Files from the Pilot APB 
and added 1462 new files for a total of 1955 
Frame Files with 2446 framesets. In addition 
to a heightened attention to sense distinctions 
this cycle includes a greater attempt to ad-
dress complicated predicates such as light 
verb constructions and multi-word expres-
sions. New tools facilitate the data tagging 
and also simplify frame creation.
