In contrast with the booming increase of inter-
net data, state-of-art QA (question answering)
systems, otherwise, concerned data from spe-
cific domains or resources such as search en-
gine snippets, online forums and Wikipedia in
a somewhat isolated way. Users may welcome
a more general QA system for its capability
to answer questions of various sources, inte-
grated from existed specialized sub-QA en-
gines. In this framework, question classifica-
tion is the primary task.
However, the current paradigms of question
classification were focused on some speci-
fied type of questions, i.e. factoid questions,
which are inappropriate for the general QA.
In this paper, we propose a new question clas-
sification paradigm, which includes a ques-
tion taxonomy suitable to the general QA and
a question classifier based on MLN (Markov
logic network), where rule-based methods and
statistical methods are unified into a single
framework in a fuzzy discriminative learning
approach. Experiments show that our method
outperforms traditional question classification
approaches.
