This paper describes our submissions,
cmu-heafield-combo, to the ten tracks
of the 2011 Workshop on Machine Transla-
tion?s system combination task. We show how
the combination scheme operates by flexibly
aligning system outputs then searching a
space constructed from the alignments.
Humans judged our combination the best on
eight of ten tracks.
