We present a derivation of the alignment tem-
plate model for statistical machine translation
and an implementation of the model using
weighted finite state transducers. The approach
we describe allows us to implement each con-
stituent distribution of the model as a weighted
finite state transducer or acceptor. We show
that bitext word alignment and translation un-
der the model can be performed with standard
FSM operations involving these transducers.
One of the benefits of using this framework
is that it obviates the need to develop special-
ized search procedures, even for the generation
of lattices or N-Best lists of bitext word align-
ments and translation hypotheses. We evaluate
the implementation of the model on the French-
to-English Hansards task and report alignment
and translation performance.
