In an automatic speech recognition system us-
ing a tied-mixture acoustic model, the main
cost in CPU time and memory lies not in
the evaluation and storage of Gaussians them-
selves but rather in evaluating the mixture
likelihoods for each state output distribution.
Using a simple entropy-based technique for
pruning the mixture weight distributions, we
can achieve a significant speedup in recogni-
tion for a 5000-word vocabulary with a negli-
gible increase in word error rate. This allows
us to achieve real-time connected-word dicta-
tion on an ARM-based mobile device.
