Scholars of Classics cite ancient texts by
using abridged citations called canonical
references. In the scholarly digital library,
canonical references create a complex tex-
tile of links between ancient and modern
sources reflecting the deep hypertextual
nature of texts in this field. This paper
aims to demonstrate the suitability of Con-
ditional Random Fields (CRF) for extract-
ing this particular kind of reference from
unstructured texts in order to enhance the
capabilities of navigating and aggregating
scholarly electronic resources. In partic-
ular, we developed a parser which recog-
nizes word level n-grams of a text as be-
ing canonical references by using a CRF
model trained with both positive and neg-
ative examples.
