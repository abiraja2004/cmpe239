 
This paper, submitted as an entry for the 
NERSSEAL-2008 shared task, describes a 
system build for Named Entity Recognition 
for South and South East Asian Languages.  
Our paper combines machine learning 
techniques with language specific heuris-
tics to model the problem of NER for In-
dian languages. The system has been tested 
on five languages: Telugu, Hindi, Bengali, 
Urdu and Oriya. It uses CRF (Conditional 
Random Fields) based machine learning, 
followed by post processing which in-
volves using some heuristics or rules. The 
system is specifically tuned for Hindi and 
Telugu, we also report the results for the 
other four languages.
