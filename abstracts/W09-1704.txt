 
In this paper we present two approaches to 
automatically extract cross-lingual predi-
cate clusters, based on bilingual parallel 
corpora and cross-lingual information ex-
traction. We demonstrate how these clus-
ters can be used to improve the NIST 
Automatic Content Extraction (ACE) event 
extraction task1. We propose a new induc-
tive learning framework to automatically 
augment background data for low-
confidence events and then conduct global 
inference. Without using any additional 
data or accessing the baseline algorithms 
this approach obtained significant im-
provement over a state-of-the-art bilingual 
(English and Chinese) event extraction sys-
tem.
