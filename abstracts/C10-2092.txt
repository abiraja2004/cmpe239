Text documents are complex high dimen-
sional objects. To effectively visualize
such data it is important to reduce its di-
mensionality and visualize the low dimen-
sional embedding as a 2-D or 3-D scatter
plot. In this paper we explore dimension-
ality reduction methods that draw upon
domain knowledge in order to achieve a
better low dimensional embedding and vi-
sualization of documents. We consider
the use of geometries specified manually
by an expert, geometries derived automat-
ically from corpus statistics, and geome-
tries computed from linguistic resources.
