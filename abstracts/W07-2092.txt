This paper is an outcome of ongoing re-
search and presents an unsupervised method
for automatic word sense induction (WSI)
and disambiguation (WSD). The induction
algorithm is based on modeling the co-
occurrences of two or more words using
hypergraphs. WSI takes place by detect-
ing high-density components in the co-
occurrence hypergraphs. WSD assigns to
each induced cluster a score equal to the sum
of weights of its hyperedges found in the lo-
cal context of the target word. Our system
participates in SemEval-2007 word sense in-
duction and discrimination task.
