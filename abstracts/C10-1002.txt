Multi-word expressions constitute a sig-
nificant portion of the lexicon of every
natural language, and handling them cor-
rectly is mandatory for various NLP appli-
cations. Yet such entities are notoriously
hard to define, and are consequently miss-
ing from standard lexicons and dictionar-
ies. Multi-word expressions exhibit id-
iosyncratic behavior on various levels: or-
thographic, morphological, syntactic and
semantic. In this work we take advan-
tage of the morphological and syntactic
idiosyncrasy of Hebrew noun compounds
and employ it to extract such expressions
from text corpora. We show that relying
on linguistic information dramatically im-
proves the accuracy of compound extrac-
tion, reducing over one third of the errors
compared with the best baseline.
