We describe a novel approach for inducing
unsupervised part-of-speech taggers for lan-
guages that have no labeled training data, but
have translated text in a resource-rich lan-
guage. Our method does not assume any
knowledge about the target language (in par-
ticular no tagging dictionary is assumed),
making it applicable to a wide array of
resource-poor languages. We use graph-based
label propagation for cross-lingual knowl-
edge transfer and use the projected labels
as features in an unsupervised model (Berg-
Kirkpatrick et al, 2010). Across eight Eu-
ropean languages, our approach results in an
average absolute improvement of 10.4% over
a state-of-the-art baseline, and 16.7% over
vanilla hidden Markov models induced with
the Expectation Maximization algorithm.
