In this paper, we empirically demonstrate
what we call the domain restriction hy-
pothesis, claiming that semantically re-
lated terms extracted from a corpus tend
to be semantically coherent. We apply
this hypothesis to define a post-processing
module for the output of Espresso, a state
of the art relation extraction system, show-
ing that irrelevant and erroneous relations
can be filtered out by our module, in-
creasing the precision of the final output.
Results are confirmed by both quantita-
tive and qualitative analyses, showing that
very high precision can be reached.
