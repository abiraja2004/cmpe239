This paper introduces algorithms for non-
projective parsing based on dual decomposi-
tion. We focus on parsing algorithms for non-
projective head automata, a generalization of
head-automata models to non-projective struc-
tures. The dual decomposition algorithms are
simple and efficient, relying on standard dy-
namic programming and minimum spanning
tree algorithms. They provably solve an LP
relaxation of the non-projective parsing prob-
lem. Empirically the LP relaxation is very of-
ten tight: for many languages, exact solutions
are achieved on over 98% of test sentences.
The accuracy of our models is higher than pre-
vious work on a broad range of datasets.
