tokenization system through HMM-based 
chunking. Experiments show that such a 
system can well deal with the unknown word 
problem in Chinese word tokenization. 
The second term in (2-1) is the mutual 
information between T  and . In order to 
simplify the computation of this term, we assume 
mutual information independence (2-2):
