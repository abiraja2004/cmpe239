 
This paper presents a novel information sys-
tem integrating advanced information extrac-
tion technology and automatic hyper-linking. 
Extracted entities are mapped into a domain 
ontology that relates concepts to a selection of 
hyperlinks. For information extraction, we use 
SProUT, a generic platform for the develop-
ment and use of multilingual text processing 
components. By combining finite-state and 
unification-based formalisms, the grammar 
formalism used in SProUT offers both pro-
cessing efficiency and a high degree of decal-
rativeness. The ExtraLink demo system show-
cases the extraction of relevant concepts from 
German texts in the tourism domain, offering 
the direct connection to associated web docu-
ments on demand.
