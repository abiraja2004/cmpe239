We apply the idea of weight pushing
(Mohri, 1997) to CKY parsing with fixed
context-free grammars. Applied after
rule binarization, weight pushing takes the
weight from the original grammar rule and
pushes it down across its binarized pieces,
allowing the parser to make better prun-
ing decisions earlier in the parsing pro-
cess. This process can be viewed as gen-
eralizing weight pushing from transduc-
ers to hypergraphs. We examine its ef-
fect on parsing efficiency with various bi-
narization schemes applied to tree sub-
stitution grammars from previous work.
We find that weight pushing produces dra-
matic improvements in efficiency, espe-
cially with small amounts of time and with
large grammars.
