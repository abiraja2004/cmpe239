Large-scale web-search engines are generally
designed for linear text. The linear text repre-
sentation is suboptimal for audio search, where
accuracy can be significantly improved if the
search includes alternate recognition candi-
dates, commonly represented as word lattices.
This paper proposes a method for indexing
word lattices that is suitable for large-scale
web-search engines, requiring only limited
code changes.
The proposed method, called Time-based
Merging for Indexing (TMI), first converts the
word lattice to a posterior-probability represen-
tation and then merges word hypotheses with
similar time boundaries to reduce the index
size. Four alternative approximations are pre-
sented, which differ in index size and the strict-
ness of the phrase-matching constraints.
Results are presented for three types of typi-
cal web audio content, podcasts, video clips,
and online lectures, for phrase spotting and rel-
evance ranking. Using TMI indexes that are
only five times larger than corresponding linear-
text indexes, phrase spotting was improved over
searching top-1 transcripts by 25-35%, and rel-
evance ranking by 14%, at only a small loss
compared to unindexed lattice search.
