This paper describes the Cross-Lingual
Word Sense Disambiguation system UvT-
WSD1, developed at Tilburg University,
for participation in two SemEval-2 tasks:
the Cross-Lingual Word Sense Disam-
biguation task and the Cross-Lingual Lex-
ical Substitution task. The UvT-WSD1
system makes use of k-nearest neighbour
classifiers, in the form of single-word ex-
perts for each target word to be disam-
biguated. These classifiers can be con-
structed using a variety of local and global
context features, and these are mapped
onto the translations, i.e. the senses,
of the words. The system works for a
given language-pair, either English-Dutch
or English-Spanish in the current imple-
mentation, and takes a word-aligned par-
allel corpus as its input.
