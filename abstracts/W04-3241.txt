This paper provides evidence for Genzel and Char-
niak?s (2002) entropy rate principle, which predicts
that the entropy of a sentence increases with its po-
sition in the text. We show that this principle holds
for individual sentences (not just for averages), but
we also find that the entropy rate effect is partly
an artifact of sentence length, which also correlates
with sentence position. Secondly, we evaluate a set
of predictions that the entropy rate principle makes
for human language processing; using a corpus of
eye-tracking data, we show that entropy and pro-
cessing effort are correlated, and that processing ef-
fort is constant throughout a text.
