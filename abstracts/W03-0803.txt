This paper reports work aimed at develop-
ing an open, distributed learning environ-
ment, OLLIE, where researchers can ex-
periment with different Machine Learning
(ML) methods for Information Extraction.
Once the required level of performance is
reached, the ML algorithms can be used to
speed up the manual annotation process.
OLLIE uses a browser client while data
storage and ML training is performed on
servers. The different ML algorithms use
a unified programming interface; the inte-
gration of new ones is straightforward.
