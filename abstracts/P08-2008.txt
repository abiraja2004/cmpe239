 
We propose a novel method for extracting 
semantic information about a verb's arguments 
and apply it to Verb Sense Disambiguation 
(VSD). We contrast this method with two 
popular approaches to retrieving this informa-
tion and show that it improves the perform-
ance of our VSD system and outperforms the 
other two approaches
