Many NLP tasks rely on accurate statis-
tics from large corpora. Tracking com-
plete statistics is memory intensive, so recent
work has proposed using compact approx-
imate ?sketches? of frequency distributions.
We describe 10 sketch methods, including ex-
isting and novel variants. We compare and
study the errors (over-estimation and under-
estimation) made by the sketches. We evaluate
several sketches on three important NLP prob-
lems. Our experiments show that one sketch
performs best for all the three tasks.
