The AMI Meeting Corpus is now publicly
available, including manual annotation files
generated in the NXT XML format, but
lacking explicit metadata for the 171 meet-
ings of the corpus. To increase the usability
of this important resource, a representation
format based on relational databases is pro-
posed, which maximizes informativeness,
simplicity and reusability of the metadata
and annotations. The annotation files are
converted to a tabular format using an eas-
ily adaptable XSLT-based mechanism, and
their consistency is verified in the process.
Metadata files are generated directly in the
IMDI XML format from implicit informa-
tion, and converted to tabular format using
a similar procedure. The results and tools
will be freely available with the AMI Cor-
pus. Sharing the metadata using the Open
Archives network will contribute to increase
the visibility of the AMI Corpus.
