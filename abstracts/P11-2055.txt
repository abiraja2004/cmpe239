This paper describes a set of exploratory ex-
periments for a multilingual classification-
based approach to Word Sense Disambigua-
tion. Instead of using a predefined monolin-
gual sense-inventory such as WordNet, we use
a language-independent framework where the
word senses are derived automatically from
word alignments on a parallel corpus. We built
five classifiers with English as an input lan-
guage and translations in the five supported
languages (viz. French, Dutch, Italian, Span-
ish and German) as classification output. The
feature vectors incorporate both the more tra-
ditional local context features, as well as bi-
nary bag-of-words features that are extracted
from the aligned translations. Our results
show that the ParaSense multilingual WSD
system shows very competitive results com-
pared to the best systems that were evaluated
on the SemEval-2010 Cross-Lingual Word
Sense Disambiguation task for all five target
languages.
