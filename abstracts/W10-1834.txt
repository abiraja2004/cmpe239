In this paper, we argue for and demonstrate
the use of Prolog as a tool to query an-
notated corpora. We present a case study
based on the German T?Ba-D/Z Treebank
to show that flexible and efficient corpus
querying can be started with a minimal
amount of effort. We end this paper with a
brief discussion of performance, that sug-
gests that the approach is both fast enough
and scalable.
