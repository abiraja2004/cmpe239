Rephrasing text spans is a common task
when revising a text. However, traditional
dictionaries often cannot provide direct as-
sistance to writers in performing this task.
In this article, we describe an approach
to obtain a monolingual phrase lexicon
using techniques used in Statistical Ma-
chine Translation. A part to be rephrased
is first translated into a pivot language,
and then translated back into the origi-
nal language. Models for assessing flu-
ency, meaning preservation and lexical di-
vergence are used to rank possible rephras-
ings, and their relative weight can be tuned
by the user so as to better address her
needs. An evaluation shows that these
models can be used successfully to select
rephrasings that are likely to be useful to a
writer.
