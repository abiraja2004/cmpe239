This paper describes our submission for Se-
mEval2013 Task 2: Sentiment Analysis in
Twitter. For the limited data condition we use
a lexicon-based model. The model uses an af-
fective lexicon automatically generated from a
very large corpus of raw web data. Statistics
are calculated over the word and bigram af-
fective ratings and used as features of a Naive
Bayes tree model. For the unconstrained data
scenario we combine the lexicon-based model
with a classifier built on maximum entropy
language models and trained on a large exter-
nal dataset. The two models are fused at the
posterior level to produce a final output. The
approach proved successful, reaching rank-
ings of 9th and 4th in the twitter sentiment
analysis constrained and unconstrained sce-
nario respectively, despite using only lexical
features.
