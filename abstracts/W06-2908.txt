We present a method for recognizing se-
mantic role arguments using a kernel on
weighted marked ordered labeled trees
(the WMOLT kernel). We extend the
kernels on marked ordered labeled trees
(Kazama and Torisawa, 2005) so that the
mark can be weighted according to its im-
portance. We improve the accuracy by
giving more weights on subtrees that con-
tain the predicate and the argument nodes
with this ability. Although Kazama and
Torisawa (2005) presented fast training
with tree kernels, the slow classification
during runtime remained to be solved. In
this paper, we give a solution that uses an
efficient DP updating procedure applica-
ble in argument recognition. We demon-
strate that the WMOLT kernel improves
the accuracy, and our speed-up method
makes the recognition more than 40 times
faster than the naive classification.
