 
If information extraction wants to make its 
results more accurate, it will have to resort 
increasingly to a coherent implementation of 
natural language semantics. In this paper, we 
will focus on the extraction of semantic case 
roles from texts. After setting the essential 
theoretical framework, we will argue that it 
is possible to detect case roles on the basis 
of morphosyntactic and lexical surface 
phenomena. We will give a concise 
overview of our methodology and of a 
preliminary test that seems to confirm our 
hypotheses.
