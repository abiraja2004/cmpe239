Automatic image annotation is an attrac-
tive approach for enabling convenient ac-
cess to images found in a variety of docu-
ments. Since image captions and relevant
discussions found in the text can be useful
for summarizing the content of images, it
is also possible that this text can be used to
generate salient indexing terms. Unfortu-
nately, this problem is generally domain-
specific because indexing terms that are
useful in one domain can be ineffective
in others. Thus, we present a supervised
machine learning approach to image an-
notation utilizing non-lexical features1 ex-
tracted from image-related text to select
useful terms. We apply this approach to
several subdomains of the biomedical sci-
ences and show that we are able to reduce
the number of ineffective indexing terms.
