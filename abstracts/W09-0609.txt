In this paper, we explore a corpus of
human-produced referring expressions to
see to what extent we can learn the referen-
tial behaviour the corpus represents. De-
spite a wide variation in the way subjects
refer across a set of ten stimuli, we demon-
strate that component elements of the re-
ferring expression generation process ap-
pear to generalise across participants to a
significant degree. This leads us to pro-
pose an alternative way of thinking of re-
ferring expression generation, where each
attribute in a description is provided by a
separate heuristic.
