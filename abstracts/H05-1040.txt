Question classification is an important
step in factual question answering (QA)
and other dialog systems. Several at-
tempts have been made to apply statistical
machine learning approaches, including
Support Vector Machines (SVMs) with
sophisticated features and kernels. Curi-
ously, the payoff beyond a simple bag-of-
words representation has been small. We
show that most questions reveal their class
through a short contiguous token subse-
quence, which we call its informer span.
Perfect knowledge of informer spans can
enhance accuracy from 79.4% to 88%
using linear SVMs on standard bench-
marks. In contrast, standard heuristics
based on shallow pattern-matching give
only a 3% improvement, showing that the
notion of an informer is non-trivial. Us-
ing a novel multi-resolution encoding of
the question?s parse tree, we induce a Con-
ditional Random Field (CRF) to identify
informer spans with about 85% accuracy.
Then we build a meta-classifier using a
linear SVM on the CRF output, enhancing
accuracy to 86.2%, which is better than all
published numbers.
