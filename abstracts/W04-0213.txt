A corpus of German newspaper commentaries
has been assembled and annotated with differ-
ent information (and currently, to different de-
grees): part-of-speech, syntax, rhetorical struc-
ture, connectives, co-reference, and information
structure. The paper explains the design deci-
sions taken in the annotations, and describes a
number of applications using this corpus with
its multi-layer annotation.
