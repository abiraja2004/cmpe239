In machine learning, whether one can
build a more accurate classifier by using
unlabeled data (semi-supervised learning)
is an important issue. Although a num-
ber of semi-supervised methods have been
proposed, their effectiveness on NLP tasks
is not always clear. This paper presents
a novel semi-supervised method that em-
ploys a learning paradigm which we call
structural learning. The idea is to find
?what good classifiers are like? by learn-
ing from thousands of automatically gen-
erated auxiliary classification problems on
unlabeled data. By doing so, the common
predictive structure shared by the multiple
classification problems can be discovered,
which can then be used to improve perfor-
mance on the target problem. The method
produces performance higher than the pre-
vious best results on CoNLL?00 syntac-
tic chunking and CoNLL?03 named entity
chunking (English and German).
