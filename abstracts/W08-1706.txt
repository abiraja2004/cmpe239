 
The paper presents a code for enumerat-
ing verb-construction templates, from 
which lexical type inventories of compu-
tational grammars can be derived, and 
test suites can be systematically devel-
oped. The templates also serve for de-
scriptive and typological research. The 
code is string-based, with divisions into 
slots providing modularity and flexibility 
of specification.
