This paper describes an approach to learn-
ing concept definitions which operates on
fully parsed text. A subcorpus of the
Dutch version of Wikipedia was searched
for sentences which have the syntactic
properties of definitions. Next, we ex-
perimented with various text classifica-
tion techniques to distinguish actual defi-
nitions from other sentences. A maximum
entropy classifier which incorporates fea-
tures referring to the position of the sen-
tence in the document as well as various
syntactic features, gives the best results.
