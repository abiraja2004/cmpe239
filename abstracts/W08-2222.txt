Boxer is an open-domain software component for semantic analysis of
text, based on Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG) and Discourse
Representation Theory (DRT). Used together with the C&C tools, Boxer
reaches more than 95% coverage on newswire texts. The semantic repre-
sentations produced by Boxer, known as Discourse Representation Struc-
tures (DRSs), incorporate a neo-Davidsonian representations for events,
using the VerbNet inventory of thematic roles. The resulting DRSs can
be translated to ordinary first-order logic formulas and be processing by
standard theorem provers for first-order logic. Boxer?s performance on
the shared task for comparing semantic represtations was promising. It
was able to produce complete DRSs for all seven texts. Manually in-
specting the output revealed that: (a) the computed predicate argument
structure was generally of high quality, in particular dealing with hard
constructions involving control or coordination; (b) discourse structure
triggered by conditionals, negation or discourse adverbs was overall cor-
rectly computed; (c) some measure and time expressions are correctly
analysed, others aren?t; (d) several shallow analyses are given for lexical
phrases that require deep analysis; (e) bridging references and pronouns
are not resolved in most cases. Boxer is distributed with the C&C tools
and freely available for research purposes.
