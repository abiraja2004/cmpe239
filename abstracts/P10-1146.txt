Statistical  translation  models  that  try  to
capture the recursive structure of language
have been widely adopted over the last few
years. These  models  make  use  of  vary-
ing amounts of information from linguis-
tic theory: some use none at all, some use
information about the grammar of the tar-
get language, some use information about
the grammar of the source language. But
progress  has  been  slower  on  translation
models  that  are  able  to  learn  the  rela-
tionship  between  the  grammars  of  both
the source and target  language. We dis-
cuss the reasons why this has been a chal-
lenge, review existing attempts to meet this
challenge, and show how some old and
new ideas can be combined into a  sim-
ple approach that uses both source and tar-
get syntax for significant improvements in
translation accuracy.
