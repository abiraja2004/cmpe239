In this paper, we present a novel approach
for authorship attribution, the task of iden-
tifying the author of a document, using
probabilistic context-free grammars. Our
approach involves building a probabilistic
context-free grammar for each author and
using this grammar as a language model
for classification. We evaluate the perfor-
mance of our method on a wide range of
datasets to demonstrate its efficacy.
