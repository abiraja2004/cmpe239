This paper proposes a framework for automat-
ically engineering features for two important
tasks of question answering: answer sentence
selection and answer extraction. We represent
question and answer sentence pairs with lin-
guistic structures enriched by semantic infor-
mation, where the latter is produced by auto-
matic classifiers, e.g., question classifier and
Named Entity Recognizer. Tree kernels ap-
plied to such structures enable a simple way to
generate highly discriminative structural fea-
tures that combine syntactic and semantic in-
formation encoded in the input trees. We con-
duct experiments on a public benchmark from
TREC to compare with previous systems for
answer sentence selection and answer extrac-
tion. The results show that our models greatly
improve on the state of the art, e.g., up to 22%
on F1 (relative improvement) for answer ex-
traction, while using no additional resources
and no manual feature engineering.
