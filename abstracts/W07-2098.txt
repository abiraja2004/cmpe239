We describe the Sheffield system used
in TempEval-2007. Our system takes
a machine-learning (ML) based approach,
treating temporal relation assignment as a
simple classification task and using features
easily derived from the TempEval data, i.e.
which do not require ?deeper? NLP analy-
sis. We aimed to explore three questions:
(1) How well would a ?lite? approach of
this kind perform? (2) Which features con-
tribute positively to system performance?
(3) Which ML algorithm is better suited for
the TempEval tasks? We used the Weka
ML workbench to facilitate experimenting
with different ML algorithms. The paper de-
scribes our system and supplies preliminary
answers to the above questions.
