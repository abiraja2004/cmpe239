In this paper, we describe the Korea Univer-
sity system that participated in the HOO 2012
Shared Task on the correction of preposition
and determiner errors in non-native speaker
texts. We focus our work on training the sys-
tem on a large collection of error-tagged texts
provided by the HOO 2012 Shared Task or-
ganizers and incrementally applying several
methods to achieve better performance.
