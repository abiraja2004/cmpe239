Direkt Profil is an automatic analyzer of
texts written in French as a second lan-
guage. Its objective is to produce an eval-
uation of the developmental stage of stu-
dents under the form of a grammatical
learner profile. Direkt Profil carries out
a sentence analysis based on developmen-
tal sequences, i.e. local morphosyntactic
phenomena linked to a development in the
acquisition of French.
The paper presents the corpus that we use
to develop the system and briefly, the de-
velopmental sequences. Then, it describes
the annotation that we have defined, the
parser, and the user interface. We con-
clude by the results obtained so far: on the
test corpus the systems obtains a recall of
83% and a precision of 83%.
