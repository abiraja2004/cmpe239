The use of deep syntactic information such
as typed dependencies has been shown
to be very effective in Information Ex-
traction. Despite this potential, the pro-
cess of manually creating rule-based in-
formation extractors that operate on de-
pendency trees is not intuitive for persons
without an extensive NLP background. In
this system demonstration, we present a
tool and a workflow designed to enable
initiate users to interactively explore the
effect and expressivity of creating Infor-
mation Extraction rules over dependency
trees. We introduce the proposed five step
workflow for creating information extrac-
tors, the graph query based rule language,
as well as the core features of the PROP-
MINER tool.
