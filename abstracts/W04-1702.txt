 
E-learning paves the way to a new type of 
course, more student centred, granulized, on 
demand, and highly interactive. Natural 
Language Processing (NLP) technologies 
associated with other multimedia technologies 
can help to address the major issues raised by 
this new type of courses: interaction, 
personalization and reliable information 
access. This paper presents Exills, a true e-
learning solution which integrates natural 
language processing tools and virtual reality1. 
Exills is unique in that,, unlike most of the 
language learning systems, it focuses on 
improving learners? performance rather than 
learners? competence.
