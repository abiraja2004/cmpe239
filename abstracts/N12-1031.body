We investigate the problem of automatically
converting from a dependency representa-
tion to a phrase structure representation, a
key aspect of understanding the relationship
between these two representations for NLP
work. We implement a new approach to this
problem, based on a small number of su-
pertags, along with an encoding of some of
the underlying principles of the Penn Tree-
bank guidelines. The resulting system signifi-
cantly outperforms previous work in such au-
tomatic conversion. We also achieve compara-
ble results to a system using a phrase-structure
parser for the conversion. A comparison with
our system using either the part-of-speech tags
or the supertags provides some indication of
what the parser is contributing.
