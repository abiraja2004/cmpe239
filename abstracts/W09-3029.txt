 
We describe the Hindi Discourse Relation 
Bank project, aimed at developing a large 
corpus annotated with discourse relations. 
We adopt the lexically grounded approach of 
the Penn Discourse Treebank, and describe 
our classification of Hindi discourse connec-
tives, our modifications to the sense classifi-
cation of discourse relations, and some cross-
linguistic comparisons based on some initial 
annotations carried out so far.
