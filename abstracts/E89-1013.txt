 
This paper presents a constraint logic programming 
language cu-Prolog and introduces a simple Japanese 
parser based on Japanese Phrase Structure Grammar 
(JPSG) as a suitable application of cu-Prolog. 
cu-Prolog adopts constraint unification i stead of 
the normal Prolog unification. In cu-Prolog, con- 
straints in terms of user defined predicates can be 
directly added to the program clauses. Such a clause 
is called Constraint Added Horn Clause (CAHC}. 
Unlike conventional CLP systems, cu-Prolog deals 
with constraints about symbolic or combinatorial ob- 
jects. For natural anguage processing, such con- 
straints are more important than those on numeri- 
cal or boolean objects. In comparison with normal 
Prolog, cu-Prolog has more descriptive power, and is 
more declarative. It enables a natural implementa- 
tion of JPSG and other unification based grammar 
formalisms.
