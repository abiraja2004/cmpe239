We investigate novel approaches to re-
sponsive overlap behaviors in dialogue
systems, opening possibilities for systems
to interrupt, acknowledge or complete a
user?s utterance while it is still in progress.
Our specific contributions are a method for
determining when a system has reached a
point of maximal understanding of an on-
going user utterance, and a prototype im-
plementation that shows how systems can
use this ability to strategically initiate sys-
tem completions of user utterances. More
broadly, this framework facilitates the im-
plementation of a range of overlap behav-
iors that are common in human dialogue,
but have been largely absent in dialogue
systems.
