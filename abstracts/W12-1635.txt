Ambiguous or open-ended requests to a di-
alogue system result in more complex dia-
logues. We present a semantic-specificity met-
ric to gauge this complexity for dialogue sys-
tems that access a relational database. An ex-
periment where a simulated user makes re-
quests to a dialogue system shows that seman-
tic specificity correlates with dialogue length.
