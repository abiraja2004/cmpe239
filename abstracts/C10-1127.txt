Strategic business decision making in-
volves the analysis of market forecasts.
Today, the identification and aggregation
of relevant market statements is done by
human experts, often by analyzing doc-
uments from the World Wide Web. We
present an efficient information extrac-
tion chain to automate this complex nat-
ural language processing task and show
results for the identification part. Based
on time and money extraction, we iden-
tify sentences that represent statements on
revenue using support vector classifica-
tion. We provide a corpus with German
online news articles, in which more than
2,000 such sentences are annotated by do-
main experts from the industry. On the
test data, our statement identification al-
gorithm achieves an overall precision and
recall of 0.86 and 0.87 respectively.
