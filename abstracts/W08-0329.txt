Confusion network decoding has been the
most successful approach in combining out-
puts from multiple machine translation (MT)
systems in the recent DARPA GALE and
NIST Open MT evaluations. Due to the vary-
ing word order between outputs from differ-
ent MT systems, the hypothesis alignment
presents the biggest challenge in confusion
network decoding. This paper describes an
incremental alignment method to build confu-
sion networks based on the translation edit rate
(TER) algorithm. This new algorithm yields
significant BLEU score improvements over
other recent alignment methods on the GALE
test sets and was used in BBN?s submission to
the WMT08 shared translation task.
