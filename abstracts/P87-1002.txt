 
This paper describes a compositional semantics 
for temporal expressions as part of the meaning 
representation language (MRL) of the JANUS system, 
a natural language understanding and generation sys- 
tem under joint development by BBN Laboratoires 
and the Information Sciences Institute. 1 The analysis 
is based on a higher order intansional ogic described 
in detail in Hinrichs, Ayuso and Scha (1987). Tem- 
poral expressions of English are translated into this 
language as quantifiers over times which bind tem- 
poral indices on predicates. The semantic evaluation 
of time-dependent predicates is defined relative to a 
set of discourse contexts, which, following Reichen- 
bach (1947), include the parameters of speech time 
and reference time. The resulting context-dependent 
and multi-indexed interpretation of temporal expres- 
sions solves a set of well-known problems that arise 
when traditional systems of tense logic are applied to 
natural language semantics. Based on the principle 
of rule-to-rule translation, the compositional nature of 
the analysis provides a straightforward and well- 
defined interface between the parsing component and 
the semantic interpretation component of JANUS.
