. Corpus-based stochastic language models have achieved significant 
success in speech recognition, but construction of a corpus pertaining to a 
specific application is a difficult task. This paper introduces a Case-Based 
Reasoning system to generate natural language corpora. In comparison to 
traditional natural language generation approaches, this system overcomes the 
inflexibility of template-based methods while avoiding the linguistic 
sophistication of rule-based packages. The evaluation of the system indicates 
our approach is effective in generating users? specifications or queries as 98% 
of the generated sentences are grammatically correct. The study result also 
shows that the language model derived from the generated corpus can 
significantly outperform a general language model or a dictation grammar.
