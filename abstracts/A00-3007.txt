 
We have developed a word sense 
disambiguation algorithm, following Cheng and 
Wilensky (1997), to disambiguate among 
WordNet synsets. This algorithm is to be used in 
a cross-language information retrieval system, 
CINDOR, which indexes queries and documents 
in a language-neutral concept representation 
based on WordNet synsets. Our goal is to 
improve retrieval precision through word sense 
disambiguation. An evaluation against human 
disambiguation judgements suggests promise for 
our approach.
