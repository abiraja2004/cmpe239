This paper presents a uniform approach to
data extraction from syntactically annotated
corpora encoded in XML. XQuery, which
incorporates XPath, has been designed as
a query language for XML. The combina-
tion of XPath and XQuery offers flexibility
and expressive power, while corpus specific
functions can be added to reduce the com-
plexity of individual extraction tasks. We il-
lustrate our approach using examples from
dependency treebanks for Dutch.
