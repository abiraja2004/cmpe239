In this paper we extend the application
of our statistical pattern classification ap-
proach to question answering (QA) which
has previously been applied successfully
to English and Japanese to develop two
prototype QA systems in Chinese and
Swedish. We show what data is necessary
to achieve this and also evaluate the per-
formance of the two new systems using a
translation of the TREC 2003 factoid QA
task. While performance for Chinese and
Swedish is found to be lower than that for
the more developed English and Japanese
systems we explain why this is the case
and offer solutions for their improvement.
All systems form the basis of our pub-
licly accessible web-based multilingual
QA system at http://asked.jp.
