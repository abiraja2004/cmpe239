veloped for the SemEval-2010 task of disam-
biguating sentiment ambiguous adjectives 
(hereinafter referred to SAA). Our system cre-
ated a new word library named SAA-Oriented 
Library consisting of positive words, negative 
words, negative words related to SAA, posi-
tive words related to SAA, and inverse words, 
etc. Based on the syntactic parsing, we ana-
lyzed the relationship between SAA and the 
keywords and handled other special processes 
by extracting such words in the relevant sen-
tences to disambiguate sentiment ambiguous 
adjectives. Our micro average accuracy is 
0.942, which puts our system in the first place.
