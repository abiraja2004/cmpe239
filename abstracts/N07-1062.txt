In phrase-based statistical machine transla-
tion, the phrase-table requires a large amount
of memory. We will present an efficient repre-
sentation with two key properties: on-demand
loading and a prefix tree structure for the
source phrases.
We will show that this representation scales
well to large data tasks and that we are able
to store hundreds of millions of phrase pairs
in the phrase-table. For the large Chinese?
English NIST task, the memory requirements
of the phrase-table are reduced to less than
20MB using the new representation with no
loss in translation quality and speed. Addi-
tionally, the new representation is not limited
to a specific test set, which is important for
online or real-time machine translation.
One problem in speech translation is the
matching of phrases in the input word graph
and the phrase-table. We will describe a novel
algorithm that effectively solves this com-
binatorial problem exploiting the prefix tree
data structure of the phrase-table. This algo-
rithm enables the use of significantly larger
input word graphs in a more efficient way re-
sulting in improved translation quality.
