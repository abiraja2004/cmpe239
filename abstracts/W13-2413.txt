This paper reports on some experiments
aiming at tuning a rule-based NER sys-
tem designed for detecting names in Pol-
ish online news to the processing of tar-
geted Twitter streams. In particular, one
explores whether the performance of the
baseline NER system can be improved
through the incremental application of
knowledge-poor methods for name match-
ing and guessing. We study various set-
tings and combinations of the methods and
present evaluation results on five corpora
gathered from Twitter, centred around ma-
jor events and known individuals.
