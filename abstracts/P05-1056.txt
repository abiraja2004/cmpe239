Sentence boundary detection in speech is
important for enriching speech recogni-
tion output, making it easier for humans to
read and downstream modules to process.
In previous work, we have developed hid-
den Markov model (HMM) and maximum
entropy (Maxent) classifiers that integrate
textual and prosodic knowledge sources
for detecting sentence boundaries. In this
paper, we evaluate the use of a condi-
tional random field (CRF) for this task
and relate results with this model to our
prior work. We evaluate across two cor-
pora (conversational telephone speech and
broadcast news speech) on both human
transcriptions and speech recognition out-
put. In general, our CRF model yields a
lower error rate than the HMM and Max-
ent models on the NIST sentence bound-
ary detection task in speech, although it
is interesting to note that the best results
are achieved by three-way voting among
the classifiers. This probably occurs be-
cause each model has different strengths
and weaknesses for modeling the knowl-
edge sources.
