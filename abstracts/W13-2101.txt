Statistical natural language generation
from abstract meaning representations
presupposes large corpora consisting of
text?meaning pairs. Even though such
corpora exist nowadays, or could be con-
structed using robust semantic parsing, the
simple alignment between text and mean-
ing representation is too coarse for de-
veloping robust (statistical) NLG systems.
By reformatting semantic representations
as graphs, fine-grained alignment can be
obtained. Given a precise alignment at the
word level, the complete surface form of
a meaning representations can be deduced
using a simple declarative rule.
