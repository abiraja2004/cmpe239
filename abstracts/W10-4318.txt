We describe an approach to improving
the naturalness of a social dialogue sys-
tem, Talkie, by adding disfluencies and
other content-independent enhancements
to synthesized conversations. We investi-
gated whether listeners perceive conversa-
tions with these improvements as natural
(i.e., human-like) as human-human con-
versations. We also assessed their ability
to correctly identify these conversations as
between humans or computers. We find
that these enhancements can improve the
perceived naturalness of conversations for
observers ?overhearing? the dialogues.
