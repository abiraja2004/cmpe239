In this paper we describe content determina-
tion issues involved in the Atlas.txt project,
which aims to automatically describe geo-
referenced information such as census data as
text for the visually-impaired (VI). Texts com-
municating geo-referenced census informa-
tion contain census data abstractions and their
corresponding geographic references. Be-
cause visually impaired users find interpreting
geographic references hard, we hypothesized
that an introduction message about the under-
lying geography should help the users to in-
terpret the geographic references easily. We
performed user studies to design and evaluate
the introduction message. An initial evalua-
tion study with several sighted users and one
partially sighted user showed that an introduc-
tion message is certainly preferred by most
participants. Many of them used an introduc-
tion message themselves when they described
maps textually. But the study also showed
that the introduction message made no differ-
ence when the participants were asked to draw
maps using the information in the textual de-
scriptions.
