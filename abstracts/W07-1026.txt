The shift from paper to electronic docu-
ments has caused the curation of informa-
tion sources in large electronic databases
to become more generalized. In the bio-
medical domain, continuing efforts aim at 
refining indexing tools to assist with the 
update and maintenance of databases such 
as MEDLINE?. In this paper, we evaluate 
two statistical methods of producing 
MeSH? indexing recommendations for 
the genetics literature, including recom-
mendations involving subheadings, which 
is a novel application for the methods. We 
show that a generic representation of the 
documents yields both better precision 
and recall. We also find that a domain-
specific representation of the documents 
can contribute to enhancing recall.
