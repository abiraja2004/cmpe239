example, there are 23 cities named ?Buffalo? in 
the U.S.  Country names such as ?Canada?, 
?Brazil? and ?China? are also city names in the 
USA. Almost every city has a Main Street or 
Broadway. Such ambiguity needs to be handled 
before we can refer to location names for 
visualization of related extracted events. This 
paper presents a hybrid approach for location 
normalization which combines (i) lexical 
grammar driven by local context constraints, (ii) 
graph search for maximum spanning tree and 
(iii) integration of semi-automatically derived 
default senses. The focus is on resolving 
ambiguities for the following types of location 
names: island, town, city, province, and country. 
The results are promising with 93.8% accuracy 
on our test collections.
