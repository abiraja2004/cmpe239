 
A number of research and software development 
groups have developed name identification 
technology, but few have addressed the issue of 
cross-document coreference, or identifying the 
same named entities across documents. In a 
collection of documents, where there are 
multiple discourse contexts, there exists a many- 
to-many correspondence b tween names and 
entities, making it a challenge to automatically 
map them correctly. Recently, Bagga and 
Baldwin proposed a method for determining 
whether two names refer to the same entity by 
measuring the similarity between the document 
contexts in which they appear. Inspired by their 
approach, we have revisited our current cross- 
document coreference heuristics that make 
relatively simple decisions based on matching 
strings and entity types. We have devised an 
improved and promising algorithm, which we 
discuss in this paper.
