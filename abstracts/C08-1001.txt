Addressing the task of acquiring semantic
relations between events from a large cor-
pus, we first argue the complementarity be-
tween the pattern-based relation-oriented
approach and the anchor-based argument-
oriented approach. We then propose a two-
phased approach, which first uses lexico-
syntactic patterns to acquire predicate pairs
and then uses two types of anchors to iden-
tify shared arguments. The present results
of our empirical evaluation on a large-scale
Japanese Web corpus have shown that (a)
the anchor-based filtering extensively im-
proves the accuracy of predicate pair ac-
quisition, (b) the two types of anchors are
almost equally contributive and combining
them improves recall without losing accu-
racy, and (c) the anchor-based method also
achieves high accuracy in shared argument
identification.
