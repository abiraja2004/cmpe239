This paper explores ways to detect errors
in aligned corpora, using very little tech-
nology. In the first method, applicable
to any aligned corpus, we consider align-
ment as a string-to-string mapping. Treat-
ing the target string as a label, we ex-
amine each source string to find incon-
sistencies in alignment. Despite setting
up the problem on a par with grammat-
ical annotation, we demonstrate crucial
differences in sorting errors from legiti-
mate variations. The second method ex-
amines phrase nodes which are predicted
to be aligned, based on the alignment of
their yields. Both methods are effective in
complementary ways.
