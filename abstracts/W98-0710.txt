 
This paper explores the relationship between Word- 
Net and other conventional linguistically-based lex- 
ical resources. We introduce an algorithm for align- 
ing word senses from different resources, and use 
it in our exper~nent to sketch the role played by 
WordNet, as far as sense discrimination is concerned, 
when put in the context of other lexical databases. 
The results show how and where the resources sys- 
tematically differ from one another with respect to 
the degree of polysemy, and suggest how we can (i) 
overcome the inadequacy of individual resources to 
achieve an overall balanced degree of sense discrim- 
ination, and (ii) use a combination of semantic clas- 
sification schemes to enrich lexical information for 
NLP.
