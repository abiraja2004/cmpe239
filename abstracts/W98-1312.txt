: \[Morphology, Morphotactics, Finite State, Separated Dependencies\] 
This paper examines dependencies between separated (non-adjacent) morphemes in natural- 
language words and a variety of ways to constrain them in finite-state morphology. Methods 
include running separate constraining transducers at runtime, composing in constraints at 
compile time, feature unification, and the use of FLAG DIACRITICS. Examples are provided 
from Modern Standard Arabic. In choosing a practical solution, developers must iveigh the 
size, performance and flexibility of the overall system.
