 
This paper discusses an information 
extraction (IE) system, Textract, in natural 
language (NL) question answering (QA) and 
examines the role of IE in QA application. It 
shows: (i) Named Entity tagging is an 
important component for QA, (ii) an NL 
shallow parser provides a structural basis for 
questions, and (iii) high-level domain 
independent IE can result in a QA 
breakthrough.
