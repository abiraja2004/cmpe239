In terms of both speed and mem-
ory consumption, graph unification
remains the most expensive com-
ponent of unification-based gram-
mar parsing. We present a tech-
nique to reduce the memory usage
of unification algorithms consider-
ably, without increasing execution
times. Also, the proposed algorithm
is thread-safe, providing an efficient
algorithm for parallel processing as
well.
