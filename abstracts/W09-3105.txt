We propose using active learning for tag-
ging extractive reference summary of lec-
ture speech. The training process of
feature-based summarization model usu-
ally requires a large amount of train-
ing data with high-quality reference sum-
maries. Human production of such sum-
maries is tedious, and since inter-labeler
agreement is low, very unreliable. Ac-
tive learning helps assuage this problem by
automatically selecting a small amount of
unlabeled documents for humans to hand
correct. Our method chooses the unla-
beled documents according to the similar-
ity score between the document and the
comparable resource?PowerPoint slides.
After manual correction, the selected doc-
uments are returned to the training pool.
Summarization results show an increasing
learning curve of ROUGE-L F-measure,
from 0.44 to 0.514, consistently higher
than that of using randomly chosen train-
ing samples.
