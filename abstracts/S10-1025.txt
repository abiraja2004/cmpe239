We present two systems that select the
most appropriate Spanish substitutes for
a marked word in an English test sen-
tence. These systems were official en-
tries to the SemEval-2010 Cross-Lingual
Lexical Substitution task. The first sys-
tem, SWAT-E, finds Spanish substitutions
by first finding English substitutions in
the English sentence and then translating
these substitutions into Spanish using an
English-Spanish dictionary. The second
system, SWAT-S, translates each English
sentence into Spanish and then finds the
Spanish substitutions in the Spanish sen-
tence. Both systems exceeded the base-
line and all other participating systems by
a wide margin using one of the two official
scoring metrics.
