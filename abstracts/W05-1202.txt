This work explores computing distribu-
tional similarity between sub-parses, i.e.,
fragments of a parse tree, as an extension
to general lexical distributional similarity
techniques. In the same way that lexical
distributional similarity is used to estimate
lexical semantic similarity, we propose us-
ing distributional similarity between sub-
parses to estimate the semantic similarity of
phrases. Such a technique will allow us to
identify paraphrases where the component
words are not semantically similar. We
demonstrate the potential of the method by
applying it to a small number of examples
and showing that the paraphrases are more
similar than the non-paraphrases.
