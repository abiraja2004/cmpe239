The proper interpretation of prepositions
is an important issue for automatic natu-
ral language understanding. We present
an approach towards PP interpretation as
part of a natural language understanding
system which has been successfully em-
ployed in various NLP tasks for informa-
tion retrieval and question answering. Our
approach is based on the so-called Multi-
Net paradigm, a knowledge representation
formalism especially designed for the rep-
resentation of natural language semantics.
The paper describes how the information
about the semantic interpretation of PPs is
represented in the lexicon and in PP inter-
pretation rules and how this information
is used during semantic analysis. More-
over, we report on experiments that eval-
uate the impact of using this information
about PP interpretation on the CLEF ques-
tion answering task.
