This paper presents the first demonstration
of a statistical spoken dialogue system that
uses automatic belief compression to rea-
son over complex user goal sets. Reasoning
over the power set of possible user goals al-
lows complex sets of user goals to be rep-
resented, which leads to more natural dia-
logues. The use of the power set results in a
massive expansion in the number of belief
states maintained by the Partially Observ-
able Markov Decision Process (POMDP)
spoken dialogue manager. A modified form
of Value Directed Compression (VDC) is
applied to the POMDP belief states produc-
ing a near-lossless compression which re-
duces the number of bases required to rep-
resent the belief distribution.
