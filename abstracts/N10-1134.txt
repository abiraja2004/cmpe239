We treat the text summarization problem as
maximizing a submodular function under a
budget constraint. We show, both theoretically
and empirically, a modified greedy algorithm
can efficiently solve the budgeted submodu-
lar maximization problem near-optimally, and
we derive new approximation bounds in do-
ing so. Experiments on DUC?04 task show
that our approach is superior to the best-
performing method from the DUC?04 evalu-
ation on ROUGE-1 scores.
