Information extraction techniques automati-
cally create structured databases from un-
structured data sources, such as the Web or
newswire documents. Despite the successes of
these systems, accuracy will always be imper-
fect. For many reasons, it is highly desirable to
accurately estimate the confidence the system
has in the correctness of each extracted field.
The information extraction system we evalu-
ate is based on a linear-chain conditional ran-
dom field (CRF), a probabilistic model which
has performed well on information extraction
tasks because of its ability to capture arbitrary,
overlapping features of the input in a Markov
model. We implement several techniques to es-
timate the confidence of both extracted fields
and entire multi-field records, obtaining an av-
erage precision of 98% for retrieving correct
fields and 87% for multi-field records.
