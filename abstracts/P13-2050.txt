 
Comparable corpora are important basic re-
sources in cross-language information pro-
cessing. However, the existing methods of 
building comparable corpora, which use inter-
translate words and relative features, cannot 
evaluate the topical relation between document 
pairs. This paper adopts the bilingual LDA 
model to predict the topical structures of the 
documents and proposes three algorithms of 
document similarity in different languages. 
Experiments show that the novel method can 
obtain similar documents with consistent top-
ics own better adaptability and stability per-
formance.
