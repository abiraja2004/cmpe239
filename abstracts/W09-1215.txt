 
This paper describes a pipelined approach for 
CoNLL-09 shared task on joint learning of 
syntactic and semantic dependencies. In the 
system, we handle syntactic dependency pars-
ing with a transition-based approach and util-
ize MaltParser as the base model. For SRL, 
we utilize a Maximum Entropy model to iden-
tify predicate senses and classify arguments. 
Experimental results show that the average 
performance of our system for all languages 
achieves 67.81% of macro F1 Score, 78.01% 
of syntactic accuracy, 56.69% of semantic la-
beled F1, 71.66% of macro precision and 
64.66% of micro recall.
