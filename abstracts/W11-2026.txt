Mental modeling is crucial for natural human-
robot interactions (HRI). Yet, effective mech-
anisms that enable reasoning about and com-
munication of mental states are not available.
We propose to utilize adverbial cues, routinely
employed by humans, for this goal and present
a novel algorithm that integrates adverbial
modifiers with belief revision and expression,
phrasing utterances based on Gricean conver-
sational maxims. The algorithm is demon-
strated in a simple HRI scenario.
