We consider the problem of predictive infer-
ence for probabilistic binary sequence label-
ing models under F-score as utility. For a
simple class of models, we show that the
number of hypotheses whose expected F-
score needs to be evaluated is linear in the
sequence length and present a framework for
efficiently evaluating the expectation of many
common loss/utility functions, including the
F-score. This framework includes both exact
and faster inexact calculation methods.
