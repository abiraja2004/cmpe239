Previous research applying kernel meth-
ods to natural language parsing have fo-
cussed on proposing kernels over parse
trees, which are hand-crafted based on do-
main knowledge and computational con-
siderations. In this paper we propose a
method for defining kernels in terms of
a probabilistic model of parsing. This
model is then trained, so that the param-
eters of the probabilistic model reflect the
generalizations in the training data. The
method we propose then uses these trained
parameters to define a kernel for rerank-
ing parse trees. In experiments, we use
a neural network based statistical parser
as the probabilistic model, and use the
resulting kernel with the Voted Percep-
tron algorithm to rerank the top 20 parses
from the probabilistic model. This method
achieves a significant improvement over
the accuracy of the probabilistic model.
