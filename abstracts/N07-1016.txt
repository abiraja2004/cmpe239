The task of identifying synonymous re-
lations and objects, or Synonym Resolu-
tion (SR), is critical for high-quality infor-
mation extraction. The bulk of previous
SR work assumed strong domain knowl-
edge or hand-tagged training examples.
This paper investigates SR in the con-
text of unsupervised information extrac-
tion, where neither is available. The pa-
per presents a scalable, fully-implemented
system for SR that runs in O(KN log N)
time in the number of extractions N and
the maximum number of synonyms per
word, K. The system, called RESOLVER,
introduces a probabilistic relational model
for predicting whether two strings are
co-referential based on the similarity of
the assertions containing them. Given
two million assertions extracted from the
Web, RESOLVER resolves objects with
78% precision and an estimated 68% re-
call and resolves relations with 90% pre-
cision and 35% recall.
