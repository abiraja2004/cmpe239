We propose to bring together two kinds of
linguistic resources?interlinear glossed
text (IGT) and a language-independent
precision grammar resource?to automat-
ically create precision grammars in the
context of language documentation. This
paper takes the first steps in that direction
by extracting major-constituent word or-
der and case system properties from IGT
for a diverse sample of languages.
