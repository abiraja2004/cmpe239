 
We propose a transformation based sen-
tence splitting method for statistical ma-
chine translation. Transformations are ex-
panded to improve machine translation 
quality after automatically obtained from 
manually split corpus. Through a series of 
experiments we show that the transforma-
tion based sentence splitting is effective 
pre-processing to long sentence translation.
