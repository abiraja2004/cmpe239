  
Memory-based learning, keeping full memory 
ofleaxning material, appeaxs a viable approach 
to learning N-~ tasks, and is often superior 
in genera~sation accuracy to eager learning 
approaches that abstract from learning mate- 
riaL Here we investigate three pa~'tial memory- 
based learning approaches which remove from 
memory specific task instance types estimated 
to be exceptional. The three approaches ach 
implement one heuristic function for estimat- 
ing exceptiona\]ity of instance types: (i) typi- 
catty, (ii) class prediction strength, and (fii) 
friencfly-neighbourhood size. Experiments are 
performed with the memory-based l arning al- 
gorithm IBI-IG trained on English word pro- 
nunciatlon. We find that removing instance 
types with low prediction strength (il) is the 
only tested method which does not seriously 
harm generallsation accuracy. We conclude 
that keeping full memory of types rather than 
tokens, and excluding minority ambiguities ap- 
pear to be the only performance-preserving op- 
timi~tions of memory-based leaxning.
