The  Simple  English Wikipedia  provides  a 
simplified  version  of  Wikipedia's  English 
articles  for  readers  with  special  needs. 
However,  there are fewer efforts  to make 
information  in  Wikipedia  in  other 
languages  accessible  to  a  large  audience. 
This work proposes the use of a syntactic 
simplification  engine  with  high  precision 
rules  to  automatically  generate  a  Simple 
Portuguese Wikipedia on demand, based on 
user interactions with the main Portuguese 
Wikipedia.  Our  estimates  indicated that  a 
human  can  simplify  about  28,000 
occurrences  of  analysed  patterns  per 
million  words,  while  our  system  can 
correctly simplify 22,200 occurrences, with 
estimated f-measure 77.2%.
