We present a game-theoretic model of bar-
gaining over a metaphor in the context of
political communication, find its equilib-
rium, and use it to rationalize observed
linguistic behavior. We argue that game
theory is well suited for modeling dis-
course as a dynamic resulting from a num-
ber of conflicting pressures, and suggest
applications of interest to computational
linguists.
