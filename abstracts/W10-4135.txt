For the competition of Chinese word seg-
mentation held in the first CIPS-SIGHNA
joint conference. We applied a subword-
based word segmenter using CRFs and ex-
tended the segmenter with OOV words
recognized by Accessor Variety. More-
over, we proposed several post-processing
rules to improve the performance. Our
system achieved promising OOV recall
among all the participants.
