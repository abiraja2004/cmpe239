 
We report progress on adding affect-
detection to a program for virtual dra-
matic improvisation, monitored by a hu-
man director. We have developed an af-
fect-detection module to control an 
automated virtual actor and to contribute 
to the automation of directorial functions. 
The work also involves basic research 
into how affect is conveyed through 
metaphor. The project contributes to the 
application of sentiment and subjectivity 
analysis to the creation of emotionally 
believable synthetic agents for interactive 
narrative environments.
