 
This paper explores a hybrid approach to 
temporal information extraction within the 
TimeML framework. Particularly, we focus on 
our initial efforts to apply machine learning 
techniques to identify temporal relations as 
defined in a constrained manner by the 
TempEval-2007 task. We explored several 
machine learning models and human rules to 
infer temporal relations based on the features 
available in TimeBank, as well as a number of 
other features extracted by our in-house tools. 
We participated in all three sub-tasks of the 
TempEval task in SemEval-2007 workshop 
and the evaluation shows that we achieved 
comparable results in Task A & B and 
competitive results in Task C.
