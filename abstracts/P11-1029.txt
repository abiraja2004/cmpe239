Information retrieval (IR) and figurative
language processing (FLP) could scarcely
be more different in their treatment of lan-
guage and meaning. IR views language as
an open-ended set of mostly stable signs
with which texts can be indexed and re-
trieved, focusing more on a text?s potential
relevance than its potential meaning. In
contrast, FLP views language as a system
of unstable signs that can be used to talk
about the world in creative new ways.
There is another key difference: IR is prac-
tical, scalable and robust, and in daily use
by millions of casual users. FLP is neither
scalable nor robust, and not yet practical
enough to migrate beyond the lab. This pa-
per thus presents a mutually beneficial hy-
brid of IR and FLP, one that enriches IR
with new operators to enable the non-literal
retrieval of creative expressions, and which
also transplants FLP into a robust, scalable
framework in which practical applications
of linguistic creativity can be implemented.
