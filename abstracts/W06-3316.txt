Resolving anaphora is an important step
in the identification of named entities such
as genes and proteins in biomedical sci-
entific articles. The goal of this work
is to resolve associative and coreferential
anaphoric expressions making use of the
rich domain resources (such as databases
and ontologies) available for the biomed-
ical area, instead of annotated training
data. The results are comparable to ex-
tant state-of-the-art supervised methods in
the same domain. The system is integrated
into an interactive tool designed to assist
FlyBase curators by aiding the identifica-
tion of the salient entities in a given paper
as a first step in the aggregation of infor-
mation about them.
