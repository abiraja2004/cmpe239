This paper studies the problem of mining
named entity translations from compara-
ble corpora with some ?asymmetry?. Un-
like the previous approaches relying on the
?symmetry? found in parallel corpora, the
proposed method is tolerant to asymme-
try often found in comparable corpora, by
distinguishing different semantics of rela-
tions of entity pairs to selectively prop-
agate seed entity translations on weakly
comparable corpora. Our experimental
results on English-Chinese corpora show
that our selective propagation approach
outperforms the previous approaches in
named entity translation in terms of the
mean reciprocal rank by up to 0.16 for or-
ganization names, and 0.14 in a low com-
parability case.
