 
In this paper, we propose a novel 
paradigm for the Chinese-to-English 
speech-to-speech (S2S) translation, which 
is interactive under the guidance of 
dialogue management. In this approach, 
the input utterance is first pre-processed 
and then serially translated by the 
template-based translator and the inter-
lingua based translator. The dialogue 
management mechanism (DMM) is 
employed to supervise the interactive 
analysis for disambiguation of the input. 
The interaction is led by the system, so 
the system always acts on its own 
initiative in the interactive procedure. In 
this approach, the complicated semantic 
analysis is not involved.
