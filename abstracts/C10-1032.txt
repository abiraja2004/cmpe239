The integration of facts derived from information extraction
systems into existing knowledge bases requires a system to
disambiguate entity mentions in the text. This is challeng-
ing due to issues such as non-uniform variations in entity
names, mention ambiguity, and entities absent from a knowl-
edge base. We present a state of the art system for entity dis-
ambiguation that not only addresses these challenges but also
scales to knowledge bases with several million entries using
very little resources. Further, our approach achieves perfor-
mance of up to 95% on entities mentioned from newswire
and 80% on a public test set that was designed to include
challenging queries.
