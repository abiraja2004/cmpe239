 
This paper explores the research issue and 
methodology of a query focused multi-
document summarizer. Considering its pos-
sible application area is Web, the computa-
tion is clearly divided into offline and 
online tasks. At initial preprocessing stage 
an offline document graph is constructed, 
where the nodes are basically paragraphs of 
the documents and edge scores are defined 
as the correlation measure between the 
nodes. At query time, given a set of key-
words, each node is assigned a query de-
pendent score, the initial graph is expanded 
and keyword search is performed over the 
graph to find a spanning tree identifying 
relevant nodes satisfying the keywords. 
Paragraph ordering of the output summary 
is taken care of so that the output looks co-
herent. Although all the examples, shown 
in this paper are based on English language, 
we show that our system is useful in gener-
ating query dependent summarization for 
non- English languages also. We also pre-
sent the evaluation of the system.
