We show that the intelligent use of one small
piece of contextual information?a document?s
publication date?can improve the performance
of classifiers trained on a text categorization
task. We focus on academic research docu-
ments, where the date of publication undoubt-
edly has an effect on an author?s choice of
words. To exploit this contextual feature, we
propose the technique of temporal feature mod-
ification, which takes various sources of lexi-
cal change into account, including changes in
term frequency, associative strength between
terms and categories, and dynamic categoriza-
tion systems. We present results of classifi-
cation experiments using both full text papers
and abstracts of conference proceedings, show-
ing improved classification accuracy across the
whole collection, with performance increases
of greater than 40% when temporal features
are exploited. The technique is fast, classifier-
independent, and works well even when mak-
ing only a few modifications.
