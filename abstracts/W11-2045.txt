The Automatic Content Linking Device is a
just-in-time document retrieval system that
monitors an ongoing dialogue or monologue
and enriches it with potentially related docu-
ments from local repositories or from the Web.
The documents are found using queries that
are built from the dialogue words, obtained
through automatic speech recognition. Re-
sults are displayed in real time to the dialogue
participants, or to people watching a recorded
dialogue or a talk. The system can be demon-
strated in both settings.
