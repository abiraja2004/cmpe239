 
The Malaysian Language is a 
formation of subject, predicate and 
object. The subject is the noun that take 
the action on the object and the 
predicate is the verb phrase in the 
sentence. Without a good corpus that 
can provide the part of speech, parsing 
is a complex process. As an option to 
the parsing, this paper discusses a way 
to identify the subject and the 
predicate, known as the pola-grammar 
technique. A pola or a pattern to be 
identified in the sentence are the 
Adjunct, Subject, Conjunction, 
Predicate and Object.
