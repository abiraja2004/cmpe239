We apply the C4.5 decision tree learner in interpret-
ing Japanese relative clause constructions, based
around shallow syntactic and semantic processing.
In parameterising data for use with C4.5, we pro-
pose and test various means of reducing intra-
clausal interpretational ambiguity, and cross index-
ing the overall analysis of cosubordinated relative
clause constructions. We additionally investigate
the disambiguating effect of the different parame-
ter types used, and establish upper bounds for the
task.
