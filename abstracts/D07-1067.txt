In this paper, we study the problem of auto-
matically segmenting written text into para-
graphs. This is inherently a sequence label-
ing problem, however, previous approaches
ignore this dependency. We propose a novel
approach for automatic paragraph segmen-
tation, namely training Semi-Markov mod-
els discriminatively using a Max-Margin
method. This method allows us to model
the sequential nature of the problem and to
incorporate features of a whole paragraph,
such as paragraph coherence which cannot
be used in previous models. Experimental
evaluation on four text corpora shows im-
provement over the previous state-of-the art
method on this task.
