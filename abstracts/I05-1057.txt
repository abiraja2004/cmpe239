. Biomedical named entity recognition (NER) is a difficult
problem in biomedical information processing due to the widespread am-
biguity of terms out of context and extensive lexical variations. This pa-
per presents a two-phase biomedical NER consisting of term boundary
detection and semantic labeling. By dividing the problem, we can adopt
an effective model for each process. In our study, we use two exponential
models, conditional random fields and maximum entropy, at each phase.
Moreover, results by this machine learning based model are refined by
rule-based postprocessing implemented using a finite state method. Ex-
periments show it achieves the performance of F-score 71.19% on the
JNLPBA 2004 shared task of identifying 5 classes of biomedical NEs.
