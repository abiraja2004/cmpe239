We present a novel approach to natural lan-
guage generation (NLG) that applies hierar-
chical reinforcement learning to text genera-
tion in the wayfinding domain. Our approach
aims to optimise the integration of NLG tasks
that are inherently different in nature, such
as decisions of content selection, text struc-
ture, user modelling, referring expression gen-
eration (REG), and surface realisation. It
also aims to capture existing interdependen-
cies between these areas. We apply hierar-
chical reinforcement learning to learn a gen-
eration policy that captures these interdepen-
dencies, and that can be transferred to other
NLG tasks. Our experimental results?in a
simulated environment?show that the learnt
wayfinding policy outperforms a baseline pol-
icy that takes reasonable actions but without
optimization.
