 
In this paper, we present the WIRE system for human intelligence reporting and discuss chal-lenges of deploying spoken language under-standing systems for the military, particularly for dismounted warfighters. Using the PARADISE evaluation paradigm, we show that performance models derived using standard metrics can account for 68% of the variance of User Satisfaction. We discuss the implication of these results and how the evaluation paradigm may be modified for the military domain.
