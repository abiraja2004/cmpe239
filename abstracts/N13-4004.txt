 Meaning Representations and richer event
representations will also be touched on.
Details of machine learning approaches will be provided, beginning with fully
supervised approaches that use the annotated corpora as training material. The
importance of syntactic parse information and the contributions of different feature
choices, including tree kernels, will be discussed, as well as the advantages and
disadvantages of particular machine learning algorithms and approaches such as
joint inference. Appropriate considerations for evaluation will be presented as well
as successful uses of semantic role labeling in NLP applications.
We will also cover techniques for exploiting unlabeled corpora and transfer-
ring models across languages. These include methods, which project annotations
across languages using parallel data, induce representations solely from unlabeled
corpora (unsupervised methods) or exploit a combination of a small amount of hu-
man annotation and a large unlabeled corpus (semi-supervised techniques). We
will discuss methods based on different machine learning paradigms, including
generative Bayesian models, graph-based algorithms and bootstrapping style tech-
niques.
