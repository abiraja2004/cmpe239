Multilingual speakers switch between lan-
guages in online and spoken communication.
Analyses of large scale multilingual data re-
quire automatic language identification at the
word level. For our experiments with mul-
tilingual online discussions, we first tag the
language of individual words using language
models and dictionaries. Secondly, we incor-
porate context to improve the performance.
We achieve an accuracy of 98%. Besides word
level accuracy, we use two new metrics to
evaluate this task.
