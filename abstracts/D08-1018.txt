We present a study on how grammar binariza-
tion empirically affects the efficiency of the
CKY parsing. We argue that binarizations af-
fect parsing efficiency primarily by affecting
the number of incomplete constituents gener-
ated, and the effectiveness of binarization also
depends on the nature of the input. We pro-
pose a novel binarization method utilizing rich
information learnt from training corpus. Ex-
perimental results not only show that differ-
ent binarizations have great impacts on pars-
ing efficiency, but also confirm that our learnt
binarization outperforms other existing meth-
ods. Furthermore we show that it is feasible to
combine existing parsing speed-up techniques
with our binarization to achieve even better
performance.
