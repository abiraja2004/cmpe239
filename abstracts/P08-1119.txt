We present a novel approach to weakly super-
vised semantic class learning from the web,
using a single powerful hyponym pattern com-
bined with graph structures, which capture
two properties associated with pattern-based
extractions: popularity and productivity. In-
tuitively, a candidate is popular if it was dis-
covered many times by other instances in the
hyponym pattern. A candidate is productive
if it frequently leads to the discovery of other
instances. Together, these two measures cap-
ture not only frequency of occurrence, but also
cross-checking that the candidate occurs both
near the class name and near other class mem-
bers. We developed two algorithms that begin
with just a class name and one seed instance
and then automatically generate a ranked list
of new class instances. We conducted exper-
iments on four semantic classes and consis-
tently achieved high accuracies.
