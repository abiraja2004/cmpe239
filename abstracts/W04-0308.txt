Deterministic dependency parsing is a robust
and efficient approach to syntactic parsing of
unrestricted natural language text. In this pa-
per, we analyze its potential for incremental
processing and conclude that strict incremen-
tality is not achievable within this framework.
However, we also show that it is possible to min-
imize the number of structures that require non-
incremental processing by choosing an optimal
parsing algorithm. This claim is substantiated
with experimental evidence showing that the al-
gorithm achieves incremental parsing for 68.9%
of the input when tested on a random sample
of Swedish text. When restricted to sentences
that are accepted by the parser, the degree of
incrementality increases to 87.9%.
