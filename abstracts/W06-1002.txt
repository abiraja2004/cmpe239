 
The role of lexical resources is often un-
derstated in NLP research. The complex-
ity of Chinese, Japanese and Korean 
(CJK) poses special challenges to devel-
opers of NLP tools, especially in the area 
of word segmentation (WS), information 
retrieval (IR), named entity extraction 
(NER), and machine translation (MT). 
These difficulties are exacerbated by the 
lack of comprehensive lexical resources, 
especially for proper nouns, and the lack 
of a standardized orthography, especially 
in Japanese. This paper summarizes some 
of the major linguistic issues in the de-
velopment NLP applications that are de-
pendent on lexical resources, and dis-
cusses the central role such resources 
should play in enhancing the accuracy of 
NLP tools.
