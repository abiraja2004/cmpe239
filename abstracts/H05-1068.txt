While there have been many successful applica-
tions of machine learning methods to tasks in NLP,
learning algorithms are not typically designed to
optimize NLP performance metrics. This paper
evaluates an ensemble selection framework de-
signed to optimize arbitrary metrics and automate
the process of algorithm selection and parameter
tuning. We report the results of experiments that in-
stantiate the framework for three NLP tasks, using
six learning algorithms, a wide variety of parame-
terizations, and 15 performance metrics. Based on
our results, we make recommendations for subse-
quent machine-learning-based research for natural
language learning.
