Named entity recognition systems sometimes
have difficulty when applied to data from do-
mains that do not closely match the training
data. We first use a simple rule-based tech-
nique for domain adaptation. Data for robust
validation of the technique is then generated,
and we use crowdsourcing techniques to show
that this strategy produces reliable results even
on data not seen by the rule designers. We
show that it is possible to extract large im-
provements on the target data rapidly at low
cost using these techniques.
