This paper presents a probabilistic model
for resolution of non-pronominal anaphora
in biomedical texts. The model seeks to
find the antecedents of anaphoric expres-
sions, both coreferent and associative ones,
and also to identify discourse-new expres-
sions. We consider only the noun phrases
referring to biomedical entities. The model
reaches state-of-the art performance: 56-
69% precision and 54-67% recall on coref-
erent cases, and reasonable performance
on different classes of associative cases.
