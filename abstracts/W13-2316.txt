In this paper, we present an annotation tool
developed specifically for manual senti-
ment analysis of social media posts. The
tool provides facilities for general and tar-
get based opinion marking on different
type of posts (i.e. comparative, ironic,
conditional) with a web based UI which
supports synchronous annotation. It is
also designed as a SaaS (Software as a
Service). The tool?s outstanding features
are easy and fast annotation interface, de-
tailed sentiment levels, multi-client sup-
port, easy to manage administrative mod-
ules and linguistic annotation capabilities.
