This paper addresses the problem of dy-
namic model parameter selection for log-
linear model based statistical machine
translation (SMT) systems. In this work,
we propose a principled method for this
task by transforming it to a test data de-
pendent development set selection prob-
lem. We present two algorithms for au-
tomatic development set construction, and
evaluated our method on several NIST
data sets for the Chinese-English trans-
lation task. Experimental results show
that our method can effectively adapt
log-linear model parameters to different
test data, and consistently achieves good
translation performance compared with
conventional methods that use a fixed
model parameter setting across different
data sets.
