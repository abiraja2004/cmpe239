This paper presents a prototype dia-
logue system, K3 , in which a user can
instruct agents through speech input to
manipulate various objects in a 3-D vir-
tual world. In this paper, we focus
on two distinctive features of the K3
system: plan-based anaphora resolution
and handling vagueness in spatial ex-
pressions. After an overview of the sys-
tem architecture, each of these features
is described. We also look at the future
research agenda of this system.
