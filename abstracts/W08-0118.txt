Voice-Rate is an experimental dialog system
through which a user can call to get prod-
uct information. In this paper, we describe
an optimal dialog management algorithm for
Voice-Rate. Our algorithm uses a POMDP
framework, which is probabilistic and cap-
tures uncertainty in speech recognition and
user knowledge. We propose a novel method
to learn a user knowledge model from a review
database. Simulation results show that the
POMDP system performs significantly better
than a deterministic baseline system in terms
of both dialog failure rate and dialog interac-
tion time. To the best of our knowledge, our
work is the first to show that a POMDP can
be successfully used for disambiguation in a
complex voice search domain like Voice-Rate.
