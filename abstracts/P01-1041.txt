Named entity (NE) recognition is a
task in which proper nouns and nu-
merical information in a document are
detected and classified into categories
such as person, organization, location,
and date. NE recognition plays an es-
sential role in information extraction
systems and question answering sys-
tems. It is well known that hand-crafted
systems with a large set of heuris-
tic rules are difficult to maintain, and
corpus-based statistical approaches are
expected to be more robust and require
less human intervention. Several statis-
tical approaches have been reported in
the literature. In a recent Japanese NE
workshop, a maximum entropy (ME)
system outperformed decision tree sys-
tems and most hand-crafted systems.
Here, we propose an alternative method
based on a simple rule generator and
decision tree learning. Our exper-
iments show that its performance is
comparable to the ME approach. We
also found that it can be trained more
efficiently with a large set of training
data and that it improves readability.
