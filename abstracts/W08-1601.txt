 
This paper presents a CRF (Conditional 
Random Field) model for Semantic 
Chunk Annotation in a Chinese Question 
and Answering System (SCACQA). The 
model was derived from a corpus of real 
world questions, which are collected 
from some discussion groups on the 
Internet. The questions are supposed to 
be answered by other people, so some of 
the questions are very complex. Mutual 
information was adopted for feature se-
lection.  The training data collection con-
sists of 14000 sentences and the testing 
data collection consists of 4000 sentences. 
The result shows an F-score of 93.07%.
