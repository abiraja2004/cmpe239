An ideal summarization system should pro-
duce summaries that have high content cov-
erage and linguistic quality. Many state-of-
the-art summarization systems focus on con-
tent coverage by extracting content-dense sen-
tences from source articles. A current research
focus is to process these sentences so that they
read fluently as a whole. The current AE-
SOP task encourages research on evaluating
summaries on content, readability, and over-
all responsiveness. In this work, we adapt
a machine translation metric to measure con-
tent coverage, apply an enhanced discourse
coherence model to evaluate summary read-
ability, and combine both in a trained regres-
sion model to evaluate overall responsiveness.
The results show significantly improved per-
formance over AESOP 2011 submitted met-
rics.
