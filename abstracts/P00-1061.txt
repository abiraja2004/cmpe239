We present a new approach to
stochastic modeling of constraint-
based grammars that is based on log-
linear models and uses EM for esti-
mation from unannotated data. The
techniques are applied to an LFG
grammar for German. Evaluation on
an exact match task yields 86% pre-
cision for an ambiguity rate of 5.4,
and 90% precision on a subcat frame
match for an ambiguity rate of 25.
Experimental comparison to train-
ing from a parsebank shows a 10%
gain from EM training. Also, a new
class-based grammar lexicalization is
presented, showing a 10% gain over
unlexicalized models.
