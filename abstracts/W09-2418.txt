We describe the TempEval-2 task which is
currently in preparation for the SemEval-2010
evaluation exercise. This task involves iden-
tifying the temporal relations between events
and temporal expressions in text. Six distinct
subtasks are defined, ranging from identifying
temporal and event expressions, to anchoring
events to temporal expressions, and ordering
events relative to each other.
