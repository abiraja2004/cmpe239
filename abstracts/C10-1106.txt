Model minimization has been shown to
work well for the task of unsupervised
part-of-speech tagging with a dictionary.
In (Ravi and Knight, 2009), the authors in-
voke an integer programming (IP) solver
to do model minimization. However,
solving this problem exactly using an
integer programming formulation is in-
tractable for practical purposes. We pro-
pose a novel two-stage greedy approxima-
tion scheme to replace the IP. Our method
runs fast, while yielding highly accurate
tagging results. We also compare our
method against standard EM training, and
show that we consistently obtain better
tagging accuracies on test data of varying
sizes for English and Italian.
