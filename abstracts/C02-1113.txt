We present an engine for text adventures ? computer
games with which the player interacts using natu-
ral language. The system employs current meth-
ods from computational linguistics and an efficient
inference system for description logic to make the
interaction more natural. The inference system is
especially useful in the linguistic modules dealing
with reference resolution and generation and we
show how we use it to rank different readings in
the case of referential and syntactic ambiguities. It
turns out that the player?s utterances are naturally
restricted in the game scenario, which simplifies the
language processing task.
