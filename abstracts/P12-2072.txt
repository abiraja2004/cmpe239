We present a novel approach to the task of
word lemmatisation. We formalise lemmati-
sation as a category tagging task, by describ-
ing how a word-to-lemma transformation rule
can be encoded in a single label and how a
set of such labels can be inferred for a specific
language. In this way, a lemmatisation sys-
tem can be trained and tested using any super-
vised tagging model. In contrast to previous
approaches, the proposed technique allows us
to easily integrate relevant contextual informa-
tion. We test our approach on eight languages
reaching a new state-of-the-art level for the
lemmatisation task.
