The ARC project (for Architecture
Represented Computationally) is an at-
tempt to reproduce in computer form the
architectural historian?s mental model of
the Gothic cathedral. This model includes
the background information necessary to
understand a natural language architectural
description. Our first task is to formalize
the description of Gothic cathedrals in a
logical language, and provide a means for
translating into this language from natural
language. Such a system could then be
used by architectural historians and others
to facilitate the task of gathering and using
information from architectural descriptions.
We believe the ARC Project will represent
an important contribution to the preservation
of cultural heritage, because it will offer
a logical framework for understanding the
description of landmark monuments of the
past. This paper presents an outline of our
plan for the ARC system, and examines some
of the issues we face in implementing it.
