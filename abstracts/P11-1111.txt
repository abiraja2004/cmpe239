In this work, we present a novel approach
to the generation task of ordering prenomi-
nal modifiers. We take a maximum entropy
reranking approach to the problem which ad-
mits arbitrary features on a permutation of
modifiers, exploiting hundreds of thousands of
features in total. We compare our error rates to
the state-of-the-art and to a strong Google n-
gram count baseline. We attain a maximum
error reduction of 69.8% and average error re-
duction across all test sets of 59.1% compared
to the state-of-the-art and a maximum error re-
duction of 68.4% and average error reduction
across all test sets of 41.8% compared to our
Google n-gram count baseline.
