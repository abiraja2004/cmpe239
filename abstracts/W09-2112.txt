This paper explores the issue of automatically
generated ungrammatical data and its use in
error detection, with a focus on the task of
classifying a sentence as grammatical or un-
grammatical. We present an error generation
tool called GenERRate and show how Gen-
ERRate can be used to improve the perfor-
mance of a classifier on learner data. We de-
scribe initial attempts to replicate Cambridge
Learner Corpus errors using GenERRate.
