 
Nested Named Entities (nested NEs), one 
containing another, are commonly seen in 
biomedical text, e.g., accounting for 
16.7% of all named entities in GENIA 
corpus. While many works have been 
done in recognizing non-nested NEs, 
nested NEs have been largely neglected. 
In this work, we treat the task as a binary 
classification problem and solve it using 
Support Vector Machines. For each token 
in nested NEs, we use two schemes to set 
its class label: labeling as the outmost 
entity or the inner entity. Our preliminary 
results show that while the outmost 
labeling tends to work better in 
recognizing the outmost entities, the inner 
labeling recognizes the inner NEs better. 
This result should be useful for 
recognition of nested NEs.
