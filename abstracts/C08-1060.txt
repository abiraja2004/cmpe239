Media reporting shapes public opinion
which can in turn influence events, partic-
ularly in political elections, in which can-
didates both respond to and shape public
perception of their campaigns. We use
computational linguistics to automatically
predict the impact of news on public per-
ception of political candidates. Our sys-
tem uses daily newspaper articles to pre-
dict shifts in public opinion as reflected
in prediction markets. We discuss various
types of features designed for this problem.
The news system improves market predic-
tion over baseline market systems.
