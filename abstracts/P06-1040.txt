 
We present an unsupervised learning al-
gorithm that mines large text corpora for 
patterns that express implicit semantic re-
lations. For a given input word pair 
YX :  with some unspecified semantic 
relations, the corresponding output list of 
patterns mPP ,,1   is ranked according 
to how well each pattern iP  expresses the 
relations between X  and Y . For exam-
ple, given ostrich=X  and bird=Y , the 
two highest ranking output patterns are 
?X is the largest Y? and ?Y such as the 
X?. The output patterns are intended to 
be useful for finding further pairs with 
the same relations, to support the con-
struction of lexicons, ontologies, and se-
mantic networks. The patterns are sorted 
by pertinence, where the pertinence of a 
pattern iP  for a word pair YX :  is the 
expected relational similarity between the 
given pair and typical pairs for iP . The 
algorithm is empirically evaluated on two 
tasks, solving multiple-choice SAT word 
analogy questions and classifying seman-
tic relations in noun-modifier pairs. On 
both tasks, the algorithm achieves state-
of-the-art results, performing signifi-
cantly better than several alternative pat-
tern ranking algorithms, based on tf-idf.
