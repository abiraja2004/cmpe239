This paper describes the TALP-UPC par-
ticipation in the WMT?13 Shared Task
on Quality Estimation (QE). Our partic-
ipation is reduced to task 1.2 on System
Selection. We used a broad set of fea-
tures (86 for German-to-English and 97
for English-to-Spanish) ranging from stan-
dard QE features to features based on
pseudo-references and semantic similarity.
We approached system selection by means
of pairwise ranking decisions. For that,
we learned Random Forest classifiers es-
pecially tailored for the problem. Evalua-
tion at development time showed consider-
ably good results in a cross-validation ex-
periment, with Kendall?s ? values around
0.30. The results on the test set dropped
significantly, raising different discussions
to be taken into account.
