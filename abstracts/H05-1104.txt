Experimental research in psycholinguis-
tics has demonstrated a parallelism effect
in coordination: speakers are faster at pro-
cessing the second conjunct of a coordi-
nate structure if it has the same internal
structure as the first conjunct. We show
that this phenomenon can be explained by
the prevalence of parallel structures in cor-
pus data. We demonstrate that parallelism
is not limited to coordination, but also ap-
plies to arbitrary syntactic configurations,
and even to documents. This indicates that
the parallelism effect is an instance of a
general syntactic priming mechanism in
human language processing.
