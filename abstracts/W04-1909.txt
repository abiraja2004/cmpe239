 
This paper proposes and evaluates the use of 
linguistic information in the pre-processing 
phase of text mining tasks. We present several 
experiments comparing our proposal for 
selection of terms based on linguistic 
knowledge with usual techniques applied in 
the field. The results show that part of speech 
information is useful for the pre-processing 
phase of text categorization and clustering, as 
an alternative for stop words and stemming.
