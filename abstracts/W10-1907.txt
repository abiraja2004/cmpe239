We describe a concept-based summariza-
tion system for biomedical documents and
show that its performance can be improved
using Word Sense Disambiguation. The
system represents the documents as graphs
formed from concepts and relations from
the UMLS. A degree-based clustering al-
gorithm is applied to these graphs to dis-
cover different themes or topics within
the document. To create the graphs, the
MetaMap program is used to map the
text onto concepts in the UMLS Metathe-
saurus. This paper shows that applying a
graph-based Word Sense Disambiguation
algorithm to the output of MetaMap im-
proves the quality of the summaries that
are generated.
