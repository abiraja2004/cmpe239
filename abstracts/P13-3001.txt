Morphologically rich languages such as
Turkish may benefit from morphological
analysis in natural language tasks. In this
study, we examine the effects of morpho-
logical analysis on text categorization task
in Turkish. We use stems and word cate-
gories that are extracted with morphologi-
cal analysis as main features and compare
them with fixed length stemmers in a bag
of words approach with several learning
algorithms. We aim to show the effects
of using varying degrees of morphological
information.
