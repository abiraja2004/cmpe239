Today, the named entity recognition task is
considered as fundamental, but it involves
some specific difficulties in terms of anno-
tation. Those issues led us to ask the fun-
damental question of what the annotators
should annotate and, even more important,
for which purpose. We thus identify the
applications using named entity recogni-
tion and, according to the real needs of
those applications, we propose to seman-
tically define the elements to annotate. Fi-
nally, we put forward a number of method-
ological recommendations to ensure a co-
herent and reliable annotation scheme.
