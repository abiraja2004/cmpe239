 
Temporal reference is an issue of determining 
how events relate to one another. Determining 
temporal relations relies on the combination of 
the information, which is explicit or implicit in 
a language. This paper reports a computational 
model for determining temporal relations in 
Chinese. The model takes into account the ef-
fects of linguistic features, such as tense/aspect, 
temporal connectives, and discourse structures, 
and makes use of the fact that events are repre-
sented in different temporal structures. A ma-
chine learning approach, Weighted Bayesian 
Classifier, is developed to map their combined 
effects to the corresponding relations. An em-
pirical study is conducted to investigate differ-
ent combination methods, including lexical-
based, grammatical-based, and role-based 
methods. When used in combination, the 
weights of the features may not be equal. Incor-
porating with an optimization algorithm, the 
weights are fine tuned and the improvement is 
remarkable.
