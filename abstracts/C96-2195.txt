 
In this paper we present the specification and the struc- 
ture of EDR Electronic Dictionary which was developed 
in a nine-year project. The first version of EDR dictio- 
nary (V1.0) and its revised version (V1.5) are "already re- 
leased and are now utilized at many sites for both aca- 
demic and commercial purposes. We also describe the 
current status how the EDR dictionary is utilized. Finally 
we will give the outline of the new R&D project which 
EDR will launch in fiscal 1996.
