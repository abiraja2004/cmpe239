We explore a rule-based methodology for the
BioNLP?09 Shared Task on Event Extrac-
tion, using dependency parsing as the under-
lying principle for extracting and characteriz-
ing events. We approach the speculation and
negation detection task with the same princi-
ple. Evaluation results demonstrate the util-
ity of this syntax-based approach and point out
some shortcomings that need to be addressed
in future work.
