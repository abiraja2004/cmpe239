We present a library of implemented
HPSG analyses for argument optional-
ity based on typological studies of this
phenomenon in the world?s languages,
developed in the context of a grammar
customization system that pairs a cross-
linguistic core grammar with extensions
for non-universal phenomena on the ba-
sis of user input of typological proper-
ties. Our analyses are compatible with
multiple intersecting phenomena, includ-
ing person, number, gender, tense, aspect
and morphological rule formulation. We
achieve 80-100% coverage on test suites
from 10 natural languages.
