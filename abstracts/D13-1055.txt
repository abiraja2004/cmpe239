In this paper, we analyze a novel set of fea-
tures for the task of automatic edit category
classification. Edit category classification as-
signs categories such as spelling error correc-
tion, paraphrase or vandalism to edits in a doc-
ument. Our features are based on differences
between two versions of a document includ-
ing meta data, textual and language properties
and markup. In a supervised machine learning
experiment, we achieve a micro-averaged F1
score of .62 on a corpus of edits from the En-
glish Wikipedia. In this corpus, each edit has
been multi-labeled according to a 21-category
taxonomy. A model trained on the same
data achieves state-of-the-art performance on
the related task of fluency edit classification.
We apply pattern mining to automatically la-
beled edits in the revision histories of different
Wikipedia articles. Our results suggest that
high-quality articles show a higher degree of
homogeneity with respect to their collabora-
tion patterns as compared to random articles.
