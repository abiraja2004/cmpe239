This paper describes an extremely lexi-
calized probabilistic model for fast and
accurate HPSG parsing. In this model,
the probabilities of parse trees are de-
fined with only the probabilities of select-
ing lexical entries. The proposed model
is very simple, and experiments revealed
that the implemented parser runs around
four times faster than the previous model
and that the proposed model has a high
accuracy comparable to that of the previ-
ous model for probabilistic HPSG, which
is defined over phrase structures. We
also developed a hybrid of our probabilis-
tic model and the conventional phrase-
structure-based model. The hybrid model
is not only significantly faster but also sig-
nificantly more accurate by two points of
precision and recall compared to the pre-
vious model.
