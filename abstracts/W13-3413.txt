This paper describes a seminar course de-
signed by IBM and Columbia University
on the topic of Semantic Technologies,
in particular as used in IBM WatsonTM
? a large scale Question Answering sys-
tem which famously won at Jeopardy! R?
against two human grand champions. It
was first offered at Columbia University
during the 2013 spring semester, and will
be offered at other institutions starting in
the fall semester. We describe the course?s
first successful run and its unique features:
a class centered around a specific indus-
trial technology; a large-scale class project
which student teams can choose to par-
ticipate in and which serves as the ba-
sis for an open source project that will
continue to grow each time the course is
offered; publishable papers, demos and
start-up ideas; evidence that the course can
be self-evaluating, which makes it poten-
tially appropriate for an online setting; and
a unique model where a large company
trains instructors and contributes to creat-
ing educational material at no charge to
qualifying institutions.
