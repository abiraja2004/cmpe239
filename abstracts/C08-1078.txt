The ability to correctly classify sentences
that describe events is an important task for
many natural language applications such
as Question Answering (QA) and Sum-
marisation. In this paper, we treat event
detection as a sentence level text classifi-
cation problem. We compare the perfor-
mance of two approaches to this task: a
Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier
and a Language Modeling (LM) approach.
We also investigate a rule based method
that uses hand crafted lists of terms derived
from WordNet. These terms are strongly
associated with a given event type, and can
be used to identify sentences describing in-
stances of that type. We use two datasets in
our experiments, and evaluate each tech-
nique on six distinct event types. Our re-
sults indicate that the SVM consistently
outperform the LM technique for this task.
More interestingly, we discover that the
manual rule based classification system is
a very powerful baseline that outperforms
the SVM on three of the six event types.
