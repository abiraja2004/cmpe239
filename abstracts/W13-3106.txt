In this paper we present a linear model for
the problem of text summarization, where
a summary preserves the information cov-
erage as much as possible in comparison
to the original document set. We reduce
the problem of finding the best summary
to the problem of finding the point on a
convex polytope closest to the given hy-
perplane, and solve it efficiently with the
help of fractional linear programming. We
supply here an overview of our system, ti-
tled POLY2, that participated in the Multi-
Ling contest at ACL 2013.
