In this paper we model discussions in online
political blogs. To do this, we extend Latent
Dirichlet Allocation (Blei et al, 2003), in var-
ious ways to capture different characteristics
of the data. Our models jointly describe the
generation of the primary documents (posts)
as well as the authorship and, optionally, the
contents of the blog community?s verbal reac-
tions to each post (comments). We evaluate
our model on a novel comment prediction task
where the models are used to predict which
blog users will leave comments on a given
post. We also provide a qualitative discussion
about what the models discover.
