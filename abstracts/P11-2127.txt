We investigate full-scale shortest-derivation
parsing (SDP), wherein the parser selects an
analysis built from the fewest number of train-
ing fragments. Shortest derivation parsing
exhibits an unusual range of behaviors. At
one extreme, in the fully unpruned case, it
is neither fast nor accurate. At the other ex-
treme, when pruned with a coarse unlexical-
ized PCFG, the shortest derivation criterion
becomes both fast and surprisingly effective,
rivaling more complex weighted-fragment ap-
proaches. Our analysis includes an investi-
gation of tie-breaking and associated dynamic
programs. At its best, our parser achieves an
accuracy of 87% F1 on the English WSJ task
with minimal annotation, and 90% F1 with
richer annotation.
