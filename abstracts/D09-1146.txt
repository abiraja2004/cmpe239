This paper presents preliminary results on
the detection of cultural differences from
people?s experiences in various countries
from two perspectives: tourists and lo-
cals. Our approach is to develop proba-
bilistic models that would provide a good
framework for such studies. Thus, we pro-
pose here a new model, ccLDA, which
extends over the Latent Dirichlet Alloca-
tion (LDA) (Blei et al, 2003) and cross-
collection mixture (ccMix) (Zhai et al,
2004) models on blogs and forums. We
also provide a qualitative and quantitative
analysis of the model on the cross-cultural
data.
