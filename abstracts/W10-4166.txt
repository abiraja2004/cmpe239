 
In this paper, we describe the implementation 
of an unsupervised learning method for 
Chinese word sense induction in 
CIPS-SIGHAN-2010 bakeoff. We present 
three individual clustering algorithms and the 
ensemble of them, and discuss in particular 
different approaches to represent text and 
select features. Our main system based on 
cluster ensemble achieves 79.33% in F-score, 
the best result of this WSI task. Our 
experiments also demonstrate the versatility 
and effectiveness of the proposed model on 
data sparseness problems.
