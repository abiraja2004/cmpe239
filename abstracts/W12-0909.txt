English phonotactic learning is modeled by
means of the PHACTS algorithm, a topo-
logical neuronal receptive field implement-
ing a phonotactic activation function aimed
at capturing both local (i.e., phonemic) and
global (i.e., word-level) similarities among
strings. Limits and merits of the model are
presented.
