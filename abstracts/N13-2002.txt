Annotated corpora play a significant role in
many NLP applications. However, annota-
tion by humans is time-consuming and costly.
In this paper, a high recall predictor based
on a cost-sensitive learner is proposed as a
method to semi-automate the annotation of
unbalanced classes. We demonstrate the ef-
fectiveness of our approach in the context of
one form of unbalanced task: annotation of
transcribed human-human dialogues for pres-
ence/absence of uncertainty. In two data
sets, our cost-matrix based method of uncer-
tainty annotation achieved high levels of re-
call while maintaining acceptable levels of ac-
curacy. The method is able to reduce human
annotation effort by about 80% without a sig-
nificant loss in data quality, as demonstrated
by an extrinsic evaluation showing that results
originally achieved using manually-obtained
uncertainty annotations can be replicated us-
ing semi-automatically obtained uncertainty
annotations.
