In this paper, we present a unified model for
the automatic induction of word senses from
text, and the subsequent disambiguation of
particular word instances using the automati-
cally extracted sense inventory. The induction
step and the disambiguation step are based on
the same principle: words and contexts are
mapped to a limited number of topical dimen-
sions in a latent semantic word space. The in-
tuition is that a particular sense is associated
with a particular topic, so that different senses
can be discriminated through their association
with particular topical dimensions; in a similar
vein, a particular instance of a word can be dis-
ambiguated by determining its most important
topical dimensions. The model is evaluated on
the SEMEVAL-2010 word sense induction and
disambiguation task, on which it reaches state-
of-the-art results.
