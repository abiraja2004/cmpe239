In this paper we describe a natural language
generation system which takes as its input a
set of assertions encoded as a semantic graph
and outputs a data structure connecting the se-
mantic graph to a text which expresses those
assertions, encoded as a TAG syntactic tree.
The scope of the system is restricted to con-
trolled natural language, and this allows the
generator to work within a tightly restricted
domain of locality. We can exploit this fea-
ture of the system to ensure fast and efficient
generation, and also to make the generator re-
liable by providing a rapid algorithm which
can exhaustively test at compile time the com-
pleteness of the linguistic resources with re-
spect to the range of potential meanings. The
system can be exported for deployment with
a minimal build of the semantic and linguistic
resources that is verified to ensure that no run-
time errors will result from missing resources.
The framework is targeted at using natural lan-
guage generation technology to build semantic
web applications where machine-readable in-
formation can be automatically expressed in
natural language on demand.
