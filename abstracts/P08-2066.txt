Researchers typically evaluate word predic-
tion using keystroke savings, however, this
measure is not straightforward. We present
several complications in computing keystroke
savings which may affect interpretation and
comparison of results. We address this prob-
lem by developing two gold standards as a
frame for interpretation. These gold standards
measure the maximum keystroke savings un-
der two different approximations of an ideal
language model. The gold standards addition-
ally narrow the scope of deficiencies in a word
prediction system.
