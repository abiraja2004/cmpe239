Virtual evidence (VE), first introduced
by (Pearl, 1988), provides a convenient
way of incorporating prior knowledge into
Bayesian networks. This work general-
izes the use of VE to undirected graph-
ical models and, in particular, to condi-
tional random fields (CRFs). We show
that VE can be naturally encoded into a
CRF model as potential functions. More
importantly, we propose a novel semi-
supervised machine learning objective for
estimating a CRF model integrated with
VE. The objective can be optimized us-
ing the Expectation-Maximization algo-
rithm while maintaining the discriminative
nature of CRFs. When evaluated on the
CLASSIFIEDS data, our approach signif-
icantly outperforms the best known solu-
tions reported on this task.
