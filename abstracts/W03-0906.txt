We argue that the detection of entailment and
contradiction relations between texts is a min-
imal metric for the evaluation of text under-
standing systems. Intensionality, which is
widespread in natural language, raises a number
of detection issues that cannot be brushed aside.
We describe a contexted clausal representation,
derived from approaches in formal semantics,
that permits an extended range of intensional
entailments and contradictions to be tractably
detected.
