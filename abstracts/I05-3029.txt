We used a production segmentation 
system, which draws heavily on a large 
dictionary derived from processing a 
large amount (over 150 million Chinese 
characters) of synchronous textual data 
gathered from various Chinese speech 
communities, including Beijing, Hong 
Kong, Taipei, and others. We run this 
system in two tracks in the Second In-
ternational Chinese Word Segmenta-
tion Bakeoff, with Backward Maximal 
Matching (right-to-left) as the primary 
mechanism. We also explored the use 
of a number of supplementary features 
offered by the large dictionary in post-
processing, in an attempt to resolve 
ambiguities and detect unknown words. 
While the results might not have 
reached their fullest potential, they 
nevertheless reinforced the importance 
and usefulness of a large dictionary as a 
basis for segmentation, and the impli-
cation of following a uniform standard 
on the segmentation performance on 
data from various sources.
