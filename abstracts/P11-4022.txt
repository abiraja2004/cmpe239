Social networking and micro-blogging sites
are stores of opinion-bearing content created
by human users. We describe C-Feel-It, a sys-
tem which can tap opinion content in posts
(called tweets) from the micro-blogging web-
site, Twitter. This web-based system catego-
rizes tweets pertaining to a search string as
positive, negative or objective and gives an ag-
gregate sentiment score that represents a senti-
ment snapshot for a search string. We present
a qualitative evaluation of this system based
on a human-annotated tweet corpus.
