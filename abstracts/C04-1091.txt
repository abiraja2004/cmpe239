The decoding problem in Statistical Ma-
chine Translation (SMT) is a computation-
ally hard combinatorial optimization prob-
lem. In this paper, we propose a new al-
gorithmic framework for solving the decod-
ing problem and demonstrate its utility. In
the new algorithmic framework, the decod-
ing problem can be solved both exactly and
approximately. The key idea behind the
framework is the modeling of the decod-
ing problem as one that involves alternat-
ing maximization of two relatively simpler
subproblems. We show how the subprob-
lems can be solved efficiently and how their
solutions can be combined to arrive at a so-
lution for the decoding problem. A fam-
ily of provably fast decoding algorithms can
be derived from the basic techniques under-
lying the framework and we present a few
illustrations. Our first algorithm is a prov-
ably linear time search algorithm. We use
this algorithm as a subroutine in the other
algorithms. We believe that decoding algo-
rithms derived from our framework can be
of practical significance.
