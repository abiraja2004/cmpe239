Corpus based approaches to machine transla-
tion (MT) rely on the availability of parallel
corpora. In this paper we explore the effec-
tiveness of Mechanical Turk for creating par-
allel corpora. We explore the task of sen-
tence translation, both into and out of a lan-
guage. We also perform preliminary experi-
ments for the task of phrase translation, where
ambiguous phrases are provided to the turker
for translation in isolation and in the context
of the sentence it originated from.
