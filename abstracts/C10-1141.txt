 
Near-synonyms are useful knowledge re-
sources for many natural language applica-
tions such as query expansion for information 
retrieval (IR) and paraphrasing for text gen-
eration. However, near-synonyms are not nec-
essarily interchangeable in contexts due to 
their specific usage and syntactic constraints. 
Accordingly, it is worth to develop algorithms 
to verify whether near-synonyms do match the 
given contexts. In this paper, we consider the 
near-synonym substitution task as a classifica-
tion task, where a classifier is trained for each 
near-synonym set to classify test examples 
into one of the near-synonyms in the set. We 
also propose the use of discriminative training 
to improve classifiers by distinguishing posi-
tive and negative features for each near-
synonym. Experimental results show that the 
proposed method achieves higher accuracy 
than both pointwise mutual information (PMI) 
and n-gram-based methods that have been 
used in previous studies.
