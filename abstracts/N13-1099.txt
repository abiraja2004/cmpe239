We present a method of improving the perfor-
mance of dialog act tagging in identifying mi-
nority classes by using per-class feature opti-
mization and a method of choosing the class
based not on confidence, but on a cascade of
classifiers. We show that it gives a minor-
ity class F-measure error reduction of 22.8%,
while also reducing the error for other classes
and the overall error by about 10%.
