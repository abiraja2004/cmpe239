We provide two different methods for
bounding search when parsing with freer
word-order languages. Both of these can
be thought of as exploiting alternative
sources of constraints not commonly used
in CFGs, in order to make up for the lack
of more rigid word-order and the standard
algorithms that use the assumption of rigid
word-order implicitly. This work is pre-
liminary in that it has not yet been evalu-
ated on a large-scale grammar/corpus for a
freer word-order language.
