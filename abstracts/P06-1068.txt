This paper presents a study on if and how
automatically extracted keywords can be
used to improve text categorization. In
summary we show that a higher perfor-
mance ? as measured by micro-averaged
F-measure on a standard text categoriza-
tion collection ? is achieved when the
full-text representation is combined with
the automatically extracted keywords. The
combination is obtained by giving higher
weights to words in the full-texts that
are also extracted as keywords. We also
present results for experiments in which
the keywords are the only input to the cat-
egorizer, either represented as unigrams
or intact. Of these two experiments, the
unigrams have the best performance, al-
though neither performs as well as head-
lines only.
