in a natural anguage interface. The proposed approach 
uses a dialogue manager as the overall control mecha- 
nism. The dialogue manager accesses domain independ- 
ent resources for interpretation, generation and back- 
ground system access. It also uses information from do- 
main dependent knowledge sources, which are custom- 
ized for various applications. 
Instead of using complex plan-based reasoning, the 
dialogue manager uses information about possible inter- 
action structures and information from the specific dia- 
logue situation to manage the dialogue. This is 
motivated from the analysis of a series of experiments 
where users interacted with a simulated natural language 
interface. The dialogue manager integrates information 
about segment types and moves into a hierarchical dia- 
logue tree. The dialogue tree is accessed through ascore- 
board which uses exchangeable access functions. The 
control is distributed and the dialogue is directed from 
action plans in the nodes in the dialogue tree.
