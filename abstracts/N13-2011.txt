Review mining and summarization has been
a hot topic for the past decade. A lot of ef-
fort has been devoted to aspect detection and
sentiment analysis under the assumption that
every review has the same utility for related
tasks. However, reviews are not equally help-
ful as indicated by user-provided helpfulness
assessment associated with the reviews. In
this thesis, we propose a novel review sum-
marization framework which summarizes re-
view content under the supervision of auto-
mated assessment of review helpfulness. This
helpfulness-guided framework can be easily
adapted to traditional review summarization
tasks, for a wide range of domains.
