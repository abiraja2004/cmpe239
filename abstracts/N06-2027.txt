Natural language generation (NLG) refers
to the process of producing text in a spo-
ken language, starting from an internal
knowledge representation structure. Aug-
mentative and Alternative Communica-
tion (AAC) deals with the development
of devices and tools to enable basic con-
versation for language-impaired people.
We present an applied prototype of an
AAC-NLG system generating written out-
put in English and Hebrew from a se-
quence of Bliss symbols. The system does
not ?translate? the symbols sequence, but
instead, it dynamically changes the com-
munication board as the choice of sym-
bols proceeds according to the syntactic
and semantic content of selected symbols,
generating utterances in natural language
through a process of semantic authoring.
