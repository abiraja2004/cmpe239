This work provides the essential founda-
tions for modular construction of (typed)
unification grammars for natural lan-
guages. Much of the information in such
grammars is encoded in the signature, and
hence the key is facilitating a modularized
development of type signatures. We intro-
duce a definition of signature modules and
show how two modules combine. Our def-
initions are motivated by the actual needs
of grammar developers obtained through a
careful examination of large scale gram-
mars. We show that our definitions meet
these needs by conforming to a detailed set
of desiderata.
