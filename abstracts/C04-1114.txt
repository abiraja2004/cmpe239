 
Texts from the medical domain are an 
important task for natural language 
processing. This paper investigates the 
usefulness of a large medical database (the 
Unified Medical Language System) for the 
translation of dialogues between doctors and 
patients using a statistical machine translation 
system. We are able to show that the 
extraction of a large dictionary and the usage 
of semantic type information to generalize the 
training data significantly improves the 
translation performance.
