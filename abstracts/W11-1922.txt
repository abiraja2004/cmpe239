This paper presents our participation in the
CoNLL-2011 shared task, Modeling Unre-
stricted Coreference in OntoNotes. Corefer-
ence resolution, as a difficult and challenging
problem in NLP, has attracted a lot of atten-
tion in the research community for a long time.
Its objective is to determine whether two men-
tions in a piece of text refer to the same en-
tity. In our system, we implement mention de-
tection and coreference resolution seperately.
For mention detection, a simple classification
based method combined with several effective
features is developed. For coreference resolu-
tion, we propose a link type based pre-cluster
pair model. In this model, pre-clustering of all
the mentions in a single document is first per-
formed. Then for different link types, different
classification models are trained to determine
wheter two pre-clusters refer to the same en-
tity. The final clustering results are generated
by closest-first clustering method. Official test
results for closed track reveal that our method
gives a MUC F-score of 59.95%, a B-cubed
F-score of 63.23%, and a CEAF F-score of
35.96% on development dataset. When using
gold standard mention boundaries, we achieve
MUC F-score of 55.48%, B-cubed F-score of
61.29%, and CEAF F-score of 32.53%.
