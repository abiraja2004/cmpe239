 
Many existing approaches for measuring text 
complexity tend to overestimate the complexi-
ty levels of informational texts while simulta-
neously underestimating the complexity levels 
of literary texts. We present a two-stage esti-
mation technique that successfully addresses 
this problem.  At Stage 1, each text is classi-
fied into one or another of three possible ge-
nres:  informational, literary or mixed.  Next, 
at Stage 2, a complexity score is generated for 
each text by applying one or another of three 
possible prediction models:  one optimized for 
application to informational texts, one opti-
mized for application to literary texts, and one 
optimized for application to mixed texts.  
Each model combines lexical, syntactic and 
discourse features, as appropriate, to best rep-
licate human complexity judgments. We dem-
onstrate that resulting text complexity 
predictions are both unbiased, and highly cor-
related with classifications provided by expe-
rienced educators.
