In this paper, we propose a machine learning al-
gorithm for shallow semantic parsing, extend-
ing the work of Gildea and Jurafsky (2002),
Surdeanu et al (2003) and others. Our al-
gorithm is based on Support Vector Machines
which we show give an improvement in perfor-
mance over earlier classifiers. We show perfor-
mance improvements through a number of new
features and measure their ability to general-
ize to a new test set drawn from the AQUAINT
corpus.
