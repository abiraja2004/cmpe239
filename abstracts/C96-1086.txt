 
We describe a similarity calculation 
model called IFSM (Inherited Feature 
Similarity Measure) between objects 
(words/concepts) based on their com- 
mon and distinctive features. We pro- 
pose an implementation method for ob- 
taining features based on abstracted 
triples extracted fi'om a large text eorpus 
utilizing taxonomical knowledge. This 
model represents an integration of tradi- 
tional methods, i.e,. relation b~used sin> 
itarity measure and distribution based 
similarity measure. An experiment, us- 
ing our new concept abstraction method 
which we <'all the fiat probability group- 
ing method, over 80,000 surface triples, 
shows that the abstraction level of 3000 
is a good basis for feature description.
