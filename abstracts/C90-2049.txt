 
To resolve structural ambiguities in syntactic analysis of 
natural anguage, which are caused by prepositional phrase 
attachment, relative clause attachment, and so on, we de- 
veloped an experimental system called tile Dependency An- 
al!lzcr. The system uses instances of dependency structures 
extracted froth a terminology dictionary as a knowledge 
ba.~e. Structural (attachment) ambiguity is represented 
by showing that a word has several words as c;tndidate 
modiliees. Tim system resolves uch ambiguity as follows. 
First, it searches the knowledge base for modification re- 
lationships (dependencies) between the word and each of 
its possible modifiees, then assigns an order of preference 
to these relationships, and finally seieets the most prefer- 
able deper.dency. The knowledge base can be constructed 
semi-automatically, since the source of knowledge xists in 
the form of texts, and these sentences can be analyzed by 
the parser and transformed into dependency structures by 
the system. We are realizing knowledge bootstrapping by 
adding the outputs of the system to its knowledge base.
