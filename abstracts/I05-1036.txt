. This paper studies the problem of mining relational data
hidden in natural language text. In particular, it approaches the relation
classification problem with the strategy of transductive learning. Dif-
ferent algorithms are presented and empirically evaluated on the ACE
corpus. We show that transductive learners exploiting various lexical and
syntactic features can achieve promising classification performance. More
importantly, transductive learning performance can be significantly im-
proved by using an induced similarity function.
