An important task in information retrieval is to
identify sentences that contain important relation-
ships between key concepts. In this work, we
propose a novel approach to automatically extract
sentence patterns that contain interactions involv-
ing concepts of molecular biology. A pattern is
defined in this work as a sequence of specialized
Part-of-Speech (POS) tags that capture the struc-
ture of key sentences in the scientific literature.
Each candidate sentence for the classification task
is encoded as a POS array and then aligned to
a collection of pre-extracted patterns. The qual-
ity of the alignment is expressed as a pairwise
alignment score. The most innovative component
of this work is the use of a Genetic Algorithm
(GA) to maximize the classification performance
of the alignment scoring scheme. The system
achieves an F-score of 0.834 in identifying sen-
tences which describe interactions between bio-
logical entities. This performance is mostly af-
fected by the quality of the preprocessing steps
such as term identification and POS tagging.
