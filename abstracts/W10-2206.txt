In this paper we apply the multi-way de-
composition method PARAFAC in order to
detect the most prominent sound changes
in dialect variation. We investigate various
phonetic patterns, both in stressed and un-
stressed syllables. We proceed from regu-
lar sound correspondences which are auto-
matically extracted from the aligned tran-
scriptions and analyzed using PARAFAC.
This enables us to analyze simultaneously
the co-occurrence patterns of all sound
correspondences found in the data set and
determine the most important factors of
the variation. The first ten dimensions are
examined in more detail by recovering the
geographical distribution of the extracted
correspondences. We also compare dia-
lect divisions based on the extracted cor-
respondences to the divisions based on the
whole data set and to the traditional schol-
arship as well. The results show that PAR-
AFAC can be successfully used to detect
the linguistic basis of the automatically
obtained dialect divisions.
