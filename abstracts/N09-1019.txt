We describe a generative model for clustering
named entities which also models named en-
tity internal structure, clustering related words
by role. The model is entirely unsupervised;
it uses features from the named entity itself
and its syntactic context, and coreference in-
formation from an unsupervised pronoun re-
solver. The model scores 86% on the MUC-7
named-entity dataset. To our knowledge, this
is the best reported score for a fully unsuper-
vised model, and the best score for a genera-
tive model.
