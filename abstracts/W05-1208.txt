 
This paper proposes a general probabilis-
tic setting that formalizes a probabilistic 
notion of textual entailment.  We further 
describe a particular preliminary model 
for lexical-level entailment, based on 
document cooccurrence probabilities, 
which follows the general setting. The 
model was evaluated on two application 
independent datasets, suggesting the rele-
vance of such probabilistic approaches for 
entailment modeling.
