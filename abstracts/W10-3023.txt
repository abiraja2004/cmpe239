 
We present our CoNLL-2010 Shared Task 
system in the paper. The system operates in 
three steps: sequence labeling, syntactic de-
pendency parsing, and classification. We have 
participated in the Shared Task 1. Our experi-
mental results measured by the in-domain and 
cross-domain F-scores on the biological do-
main are 81.11% and 67.99%, and on the 
Wikipedia domain 55.48% and 55.41%.
