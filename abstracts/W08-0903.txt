King Alfred is the name of both an innovative
textbook and a computational environment de-
ployed in parallel in an undergraduate course
on Anglo-Saxon literature. This paper de-
tails the ways in which it brings dynamically-
generated resources to the aid of the language
student. We store the feature-rich grammar
of Anglo-Saxon in a bi-level glossary, provide
an annotation context for use during the trans-
lation task, and are currently working toward
the implementation of automatic evaluation of
student-generated translations.
