This paper proposes a method for evaluating the
validity of partial parse trees constructed in incre-
mental parsing. Our method is based on stochastic
incremental parsing, and it incrementally evaluates
the validity for each partial parse tree on a word-
by-word basis. In our method, incremental parser
returns partial parse trees at the point where the va-
lidity for the partial parse tree becomes greater than
a threshold. Our technique is effective for improv-
ing the accuracy of incremental parsing.
