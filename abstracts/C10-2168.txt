Given the increasing need to process mas-
sive amounts of textual data, efficiency of
NLP tools is becoming a pressing concern.
Parsers based on lexicalised grammar for-
malisms, such as TAG and CCG, can be
made more efficient using supertagging,
which for CCG is so effective that every
derivation consistent with the supertagger
output can be stored in a packed chart.
However, wide-coverage CCG parsers still
produce a very large number of deriva-
tions for typical newspaper or Wikipedia
sentences. In this paper we investigate
two forms of chart pruning, and develop a
novel method for pruning complete cells
in a parse chart. The result is a wide-
coverage CCG parser that can process al-
most 100 sentences per second, with lit-
tle or no loss in accuracy over the baseline
with no pruning.
