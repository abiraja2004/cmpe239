 
This paper is to introduce our participation in 
the WMT13 shared tasks on Quality Estima-
tion for machine translation without using ref-
erence translations. We submitted the results 
for Task 1.1 (sentence-level quality estima-
tion), Task 1.2 (system selection) and Task 2 
(word-level quality estimation). In Task 1.1, 
we used an enhanced version of BLEU metric 
without using reference translations to evalu-
ate the translation quality. In Task 1.2, we uti-
lized a probability model Na?ve Bayes (NB) as 
a classification algorithm with the features 
borrowed from the traditional evaluation met-
rics. In Task 2, to take the contextual infor-
mation into account, we employed a discrimi-
native undirected probabilistic graphical mod-
el Conditional random field (CRF), in addition 
to the NB algorithm. The training experiments 
on the past WMT corpora showed that the de-
signed methods of this paper yielded promis-
ing results especially the statistical models of 
CRF and NB. The official results show that 
our CRF model achieved the highest F-score 
0.8297 in binary classification of Task 2.
