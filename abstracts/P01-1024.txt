We describe a new framework for de-
pendency grammar, with a modular de-
composition of immediate dependency
and linear precedence. Our approach
distinguishes two orthogonal yet mutu-
ally constraining structures: a syntactic
dependency tree and a topological de-
pendency tree. The syntax tree is non-
projective and even non-ordered, while
the topological tree is projective and
partially ordered.
