The TUNA Challenge was a set of three shared
tasks at REG?08, all of which used data from
the TUNA Corpus. The three tasks covered
attribute selection for referring expressions
(TUNA-AS), realisation (TUNA-R) and end-to-
end referring expression generation (TUNA-
REG). 8 teams submitted a total of 33 systems
to the three tasks, with an additional submis-
sion to the Open Track. The evaluation used
a range of automatically computed measures.
In addition, an evaluation experiment was car-
ried out using the peer outputs for the TUNA-
REG task. This report describes each task and
the evaluation methods used, and presents the
evaluation results.
