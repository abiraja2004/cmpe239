 
This paper proposes an algorithm for cau-
sality inference based on a set of lexical 
knowledge bases that contain information 
about such items as event role, is-a hier-
archy, relevant relation, antonymy, and 
other features. These lexical knowledge 
bases have mainly made use of lexical 
features and symbols in HowNet. Several 
types of questions are experimented to 
test the effectiveness of the algorithm here 
proposed. Particularly in this paper, the 
question form of ?why? is dealt with to 
show how causality inference works.
