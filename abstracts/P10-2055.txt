 
It is a fundamental and important task to ex-
tract key phrases from documents. Generally, 
phrases in a document are not independent in 
delivering the content of the document. In or-
der to capture and make better use of their re-
lationships in key phrase extraction, we sug-
gest exploring the Wikipedia knowledge to 
model a document as a semantic network, 
where both n-ary and binary relationships 
among phrases are formulated. Based on a 
commonly accepted assumption that the title 
of a document is always elaborated to reflect 
the content of a document and consequently 
key phrases tend to have close semantics to the 
title, we propose a novel semi-supervised key 
phrase extraction approach in this paper by 
computing the phrase importance in the se-
mantic network, through which the influence 
of title phrases is propagated to the other 
phrases iteratively. Experimental results dem-
onstrate the remarkable performance of this 
approach.
