Word Sense Induction (WSI) is an unsu-
pervised approach for learning the multiple
senses of a word. Graph-based approaches to
WSI frequently represent word co-occurrence
as a graph and use the statistical properties
of the graph to identify the senses. We rein-
terpret graph-based WSI as community detec-
tion, a well studied problem in network sci-
ence. The relations in the co-occurrence graph
give rise to word communities, which distin-
guish senses. Our results show competitive
performance on the SemEval-2010 WSI Task.
