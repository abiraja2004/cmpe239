We propose a novel model to automatically
extract transliteration pairs from parallel cor-
pora. Our model is efficient, language pair
independent and mines transliteration pairs in
a consistent fashion in both unsupervised and
semi-supervised settings. We model transliter-
ation mining as an interpolation of translitera-
tion and non-transliteration sub-models. We
evaluate on NEWS 2010 shared task data and
on parallel corpora with competitive results.
