In this paper, we detail a method for do-
main specific, multi-category emotion recog-
nition, based on human computation. We cre-
ate an Amazon Mechanical Turk1 task that
elicits emotion labels and phrase-emotion as-
sociations from the participants. Using the
proposed method, we create an emotion lex-
icon, compatible with the 20 emotion cate-
gories of the Geneva Emotion Wheel. GEW
is the first computational resource that can be
used to assign emotion labels with such a high
level of granularity. Our emotion annotation
method also produced a corpus of emotion la-
beled sports tweets. We compared the cross-
validated version of the lexicon with existing
resources for both the positive/negative and
multi-emotion classification problems. We
show that the presented domain-targeted lex-
icon outperforms the existing general purpose
ones in both settings. The performance gains
are most pronounced for the fine-grained emo-
tion classification, where we achieve an accu-
racy twice higher than the benchmark.2
