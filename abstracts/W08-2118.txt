In this paper, we present a novel morphol-
ogy preprocessing technique for Arabic-
English translation. We exploit the Arabic
morphology-English alignment to learn a
model removing nonaligned Arabic mor-
phemes. The model is an instance of
the Conditional Random Field (Lafferty et
al., 2001) model; it deletes a morpheme
based on the morpheme?s context. We
achieved around two BLEU points im-
provement over the original Arabic trans-
lation for both a travel-domain system
trained on 20K sentence pairs and a news
domain system trained on 177K sentence
pairs, and showed a potential improvement
for a large-scale SMT system trained on 5
million sentence pairs.
