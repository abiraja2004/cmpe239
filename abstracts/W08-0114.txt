This paper presents a novel framework for
building symbol-level control modules of an-
imated agents and robots having a spoken di-
alogue interface. It features distributed mod-
ules called experts each of which is special-
ized to perform certain kinds of tasks. A com-
mon interface that all experts must support is
specified, and any kind of expert can be incor-
porated if it has the interface. Several modules
running in parallel coordinate the experts by
accessing them through the interface, so that
the whole system can achieve flexible control,
such as interruption handling and parallel task
execution.
