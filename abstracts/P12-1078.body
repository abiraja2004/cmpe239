We propose a latent variable model to enhance
historical analysis of large corpora. This work
extends prior work in topic modelling by in-
corporating metadata, and the interactions be-
tween the components in metadata, in a gen-
eral way. To test this, we collect a corpus
of slavery-related United States property law
judgements sampled from the years 1730 to
1866. We study the language use in these
legal cases, with a special focus on shifts in
opinions on controversial topics across differ-
ent regions. Because this is a longitudinal
data set, we are also interested in understand-
ing how these opinions change over the course
of decades. We show that the joint learning
scheme of our sparse mixed-effects model im-
proves on other state-of-the-art generative and
discriminative models on the region and time
period identification tasks. Experiments show
that our sparse mixed-effects model is more
accurate quantitatively and qualitatively inter-
esting, and that these improvements are robust
across different parameter settings.
