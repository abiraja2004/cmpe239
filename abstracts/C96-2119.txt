 
This paper describes our work-in-progress in au- 
tomatic English-to-Korean text; translation. This 
work is an initial step toward the ultimate goal of 
text and speech translation for enhanced nmltilin- 
gual and multinational operations. For riffs pui- 
pose, we have adopted an interlintlua pproach 
with natural language understmlding (TINA) and 
generation (GENESIS) modules at the core. We 
tackle the ambiguity problem t)y incorporating 
syntactic and semantic ategories in |;he anal- 
ysis grammar. Our system is capable of pro- 
ducing accurate translation of comt)lex sentences 
(38 words) and sentence fragments as well as av- 
erage le.ngth (12 words) grammatical sentences. 
Two types of sysl, em ewJuatiou have 1)een car- 
ried out: one for grammar coverage and the other 
for overall performance. \],br system robustness, 
integration of two subsystems i under way: (i) 
a rule-based part-of-speech tagger to handle tin- 
known words/constructions, and (if) a word-for- 
word translator to handle other system failures.
