Translated bi-texts contain complemen-
tary language cues, and previous work
on Named Entity Recognition (NER)
has demonstrated improvements in perfor-
mance over monolingual taggers by pro-
moting agreement of tagging decisions be-
tween the two languages. However, most
previous approaches to bilingual tagging
assume word alignments are given as fixed
input, which can cause cascading errors.
We observe that NER label information
can be used to correct alignment mis-
takes, and present a graphical model that
performs bilingual NER tagging jointly
with word alignment, by combining two
monolingual tagging models with two uni-
directional alignment models. We intro-
duce additional cross-lingual edge factors
that encourage agreements between tag-
ging and alignment decisions. We design
a dual decomposition inference algorithm
to perform joint decoding over the com-
bined alignment and NER output space.
Experiments on the OntoNotes dataset
demonstrate that our method yields signif-
icant improvements in both NER and word
alignment over state-of-the-art monolin-
gual baselines.
