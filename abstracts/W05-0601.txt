Research on document similarity has
shown that complex representations are
not more accurate than the simple bag-of-
words. Term clustering, e.g. using latent
semantic indexing, word co-occurrences
or synonym relations using a word ontol-
ogy have been shown not very effective.
In particular, when to extend the similar-
ity function external prior knowledge is
used, e.g. WordNet, the retrieval system
decreases its performance. The critical is-
sues here are methods and conditions to
integrate such knowledge.
In this paper we propose kernel func-
tions to add prior knowledge to learn-
ing algorithms for document classifica-
tion. Such kernels use a term similarity
measure based on the WordNet hierarchy.
The kernel trick is used to implement such
space in a balanced and statistically co-
herent way. Cross-validation results show
the benefit of the approach for the Support
Vector Machines when few training data is
available.
