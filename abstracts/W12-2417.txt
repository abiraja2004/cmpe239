 
The application of natural language process-ing (NLP) in the biology and medical domain crosses many fields from Healthcare Informa-tion to Bioinformatics to NLP itself.  In order to make sense of how these fields relate and intersect, we have created ?MedLingMap? (www.medlingmap.org) which is a compila-tion of references with a multi-faceted index.  The initial focus has been creating the infra-structure and populating it with references an-notated with facets such as topic, resources used (ontologies, tools, corpora), and organi-zations.  Simultaneously we are applying NLP techniques to the text to find clusters, key terms and other relationships.  The goal for this paper is to introduce MedLingMap to the community and show how it can be a power-ful tool for research and exploration in the field. 1
