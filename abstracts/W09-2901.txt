Multiword Expressions (MWEs) are one
of the stumbling blocks for more precise
Natural Language Processing (NLP) sys-
tems. Particularly, the lack of coverage
of MWEs in resources can impact nega-
tively on the performance of tasks and ap-
plications, and can lead to loss of informa-
tion or communication errors. This is es-
pecially problematic in technical domains,
where a significant portion of the vocab-
ulary is composed of MWEs. This pa-
per investigates the use of a statistically-
driven alignment-based approach to the
identification of MWEs in technical cor-
pora. We look at the use of several sources
of data, including parallel corpora, using
English and Portuguese data from a corpus
of Pediatrics, and examining how a sec-
ond language can provide relevant cues for
this tasks. We report results obtained by
a combination of statistical measures and
linguistic information, and compare these
to the reported in the literature. Such an
approach to the (semi-)automatic identifi-
cation of MWEs can considerably speed
up lexicographic work, providing a more
targeted list of MWE candidates.
