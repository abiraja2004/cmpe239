In this paper a sentence compression tool is de-
scribed. We describe how an input sentence gets
analysed by using a.o. a tagger, a shallow parser
and a subordinate clause detector, and how, based
on this analysis, several compressed versions of this
sentence are generated, each with an associated es-
timated probability. These probabilities were esti-
mated from a parallel transcript/subtitle corpus. To
avoid ungrammatical sentences, the tool also makes
use of a number of rules. The evaluation was done
on three different pronunciation speeds, averaging
sentence reduction rates of 40% to 17%. The num-
ber of reasonable reductions ranges between 32.9%
and 51%, depending on the average estimated pro-
nunciation speed.
