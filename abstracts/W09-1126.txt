This paper presents a method for automatic
topic identification using an encyclopedic
graph derived from Wikipedia. The sys-
tem is found to exceed the performance of
previously proposed machine learning algo-
rithms for topic identification, with an annota-
tion consistency comparable to human anno-
tations.
