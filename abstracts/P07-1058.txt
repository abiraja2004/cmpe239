Obtaining large volumes of inference knowl-
edge, such as entailment rules, has become
a major factor in achieving robust seman-
tic processing. While there has been sub-
stantial research on learning algorithms for
such knowledge, their evaluation method-
ology has been problematic, hindering fur-
ther research. We propose a novel evalua-
tion methodology for entailment rules which
explicitly addresses their semantic proper-
ties and yields satisfactory human agreement
levels. The methodology is used to compare
two state of the art learning algorithms, ex-
posing critical issues for future progress.
