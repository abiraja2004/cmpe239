In this paper we report our experiments
in creating a parallel corpus using Ger-
man/Simple German documents from the
web. We require parallel data to build a
statistical machine translation (SMT) sys-
tem that translates from German into Sim-
ple German. Parallel data for SMT sys-
tems needs to be aligned at the sentence
level. We applied an existing monolingual
sentence alignment algorithm. We show
the limits of the algorithm with respect to
the language and domain of our data and
suggest ways of circumventing them.
