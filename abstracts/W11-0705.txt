We examine sentiment analysis on Twitter
data. The contributions of this paper are: (1)
We introduce POS-specific prior polarity fea-
tures. (2) We explore the use of a tree kernel to
obviate the need for tedious feature engineer-
ing. The new features (in conjunction with
previously proposed features) and the tree ker-
nel perform approximately at the same level,
both outperforming the state-of-the-art base-
line.
