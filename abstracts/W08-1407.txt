This paper reports an initial study that aims
to assess the viability of a state-of-the-art
multi-document summarizer for automatic
captioning of geo-referenced images. The
automatic captioning procedure requires
summarizing multiple web documents that
contain information related to images? lo-
cation. We use SUMMA (Saggion and
Gaizauskas, 2005) to generate generic and
query-based multi-document summaries
and evaluate them using ROUGE evalua-
tion metrics (Lin, 2004) relative to human
generated summaries. Results show that,
even though query-based summaries per-
form better than generic ones, they are still
not selecting the information that human
participants do. In particular, the areas
of interest that human summaries display
(history, travel information, etc.) are not
contained in the query-based summaries.
For our future work in automatic image
captioning this result suggests that devel-
oping the query-based summarizer further
and biasing it to account for user-specific
requirements will prove worthwhile.
