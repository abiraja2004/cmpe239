Fine-grained sense distinctions are one of
the major obstacles to successful Word
Sense Disambiguation. In this paper,
we present a method for reducing the
granularity of the WordNet sense inven-
tory based on the mapping to a manually
crafted dictionary encoding sense hierar-
chies, namely the Oxford Dictionary of
English. We assess the quality of the map-
ping and the induced clustering, and eval-
uate the performance of coarse WSD sys-
tems in the Senseval-3 English all-words
task.
