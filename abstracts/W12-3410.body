Dependency parsing has been shown to im-
prove NLP systems in certain languages and
in many cases helps achieve state of the art re-
sults in NLP applications, in particular appli-
cations for free word order languages. Mor-
phologically rich languages are often short on
training data or require much higher amounts
of training data due to the increased size of
their lexicon. This paper examines a new
approach for addressing morphologically rich
languages with little training data to start.
Using Tamil as our test language, we cre-
ate 9 dependency parse models with a lim-
ited amount of training data. Using these
models we train an SVM classifier using only
the model agreements as features. We use
this SVM classifier on an edge by edge deci-
sion to form an ensemble parse tree. Using
only model agreements as features allows this
method to remain language independent and
applicable to a wide range of morphologically
rich languages.
We show a statistically significant 5.44%
improvement over the average dependency
model and a statistically significant 0.52% im-
provement over the best individual system.
