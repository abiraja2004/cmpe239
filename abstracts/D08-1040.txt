In this paper we present a textual dialogue
system that uses word associations retrieved
from the Web to create propositions. We also
show experiment results for the role of modal-
ity generation. The proposed system automat-
ically extracts sets of words related to a con-
versation topic set freely by a user. After the
extraction process, it generates an utterance,
adds a modality and verifies the semantic re-
liability of the proposed sentence. We evalu-
ate word associations extracted form the Web,
and the results of adding modality. Over 80%
of the extracted word associations were evalu-
ated as correct. Adding modality improved the
system significantly for all evaluation criteria.
We also show how our system can be used as
a simple and expandable platform for almost
any kind of experiment with human-computer
textual conversation in Japanese. Two exam-
ples with affect analysis and humor generation
are given.
