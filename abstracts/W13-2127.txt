This position paper presents an on-going
work on a natural language generation
framework that is particularly tailored for
summary text generation from body area
networks. We present an overview of
the main challenges when considering this
type of sensor devices used for at home
monitoring of health parameters. This pa-
per describes the first steps towards the im-
plementation of a system which collects
information from heart rate and respira-
tion rate using a wearable sensor. The pa-
per further outlines the direction for future
work and in particular the challenges for
NLG in this application domain.
