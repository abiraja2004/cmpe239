We present a comparative study on Ma-
chine Translation Evaluation according to
two different criteria: Human Likeness
and Human Acceptability. We provide
empirical evidence that there is a relation-
ship between these two kinds of evalu-
ation: Human Likeness implies Human
Acceptability but the reverse is not true.
From the point of view of automatic eval-
uation this implies that metrics based on
Human Likeness are more reliable for sys-
tem tuning.
Our results also show that current evalua-
tion metrics are not always able to distin-
guish between automatic and human trans-
lations. In order to improve the descrip-
tive power of current metrics we propose
the use of additional syntax-based met-
rics, and metric combinations inside the
QARLA Framework.
