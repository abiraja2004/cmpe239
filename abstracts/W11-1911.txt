This paper presents our error tolerable sys-
tem for coreference resolution in CoNLL-
2011(Pradhan et al, 2011) shared task (closed
track). Different from most previous reported
work, we detect mention candidates based on
packed forest instead of single parse tree, and
we use beam search algorithm based on the
Bell Tree to create entities. Experimental re-
sults show that our methods achieve promising
results on the development set.
