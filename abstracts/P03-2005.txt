 
Multimodal dialogue systems allow users 
to input information in multiple modali-
ties. These systems can handle simultane-
ous or sequential composite multimodal 
input. Different coordination schemes re-
quire such systems to capture, collect and 
integrate user input in different modali-
ties, and then respond to a joint interpreta-
tion. We performed a study to understand 
the variability of input in multimodal dia-
logue systems and to evaluate methods to 
perform the collection of input informa-
tion. An enhancement in the form of in-
corporation of a dynamic time window to 
a multimodal input fusion module was 
proposed in the study. We found that the 
enhanced module provides superior tem-
poral characteristics and robustness when 
compared to previous methods.
