The rapid growth of geotagged social media
raises new computational possibilities for in-
vestigating geographic linguistic variation. In
this paper, we present a multi-level generative
model that reasons jointly about latent topics
and geographical regions. High-level topics
such as ?sports? or ?entertainment? are ren-
dered differently in each geographic region,
revealing topic-specific regional distinctions.
Applied to a new dataset of geotagged mi-
croblogs, our model recovers coherent top-
ics and their regional variants, while identi-
fying geographic areas of linguistic consis-
tency. The model also enables prediction of
an author?s geographic location from raw text,
outperforming both text regression and super-
vised topic models.
