According to previous work on pedophile psy-
chology and cyberpedophilia, sentiments and
emotions in texts could be a good clue to de-
tect online sexual predation. In this paper, we
have suggested a list of high-level features, in-
cluding sentiment and emotion based ones, for
detection of online sexual predation. In partic-
ular, since pedophiles are known to be emo-
tionally unstable, we were interested in inves-
tigating if emotion-based features could help
in their detection. We have used a corpus of
predators? chats with pseudo-victims down-
loaded from www.perverted-justice.com and
two negative datasets of different nature: cy-
bersex logs available online and the NPS chat
corpus. Naive Bayes classification based on
the proposed features achieves accuracies of
up to 94% while baseline systems of word and
character n-grams can only reach up to 72%.
