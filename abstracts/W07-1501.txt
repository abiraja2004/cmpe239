 In this paper we describe the Graph Anno-tation Format (GrAF) and show how it is used represent not only independent lin-guistic annotations, but also sets of merged annotations as a single graph. To demon-strate this, we have automatically trans-duced several different annotations of the Wall Street Journal corpus into GrAF and show how the annotations can then be merged, analyzed, and visualized using standard graph algorithms and tools. We also discuss how, as a standard graph rep-resentation, it allows for the application of well-established graph traversal and analysis algorithms to produce information about interactions and commonalities among merged annotations. GrAF is an extension of the Linguistic Annotation Framework (LAF) (Ide and Romary, 2004, 2006) developed within ISO TC37 SC4 and as such, implements state-of-the-art best practice guidelines for representing linguistic annotations. 1
