MIT?s Audio Notebook added great value to the
note-taking process by retaining audio record-
ings, e.g. during lectures or interviews. The key
was to provide users ways to quickly and easily
access portions of interest in a recording. Sev-
eral non-speech-recognition based techniques
were employed. In this paper we present a
system to search directly the audio record-
ings by key phrases. We have identified the
user requirements as accurate ranking of phrase
matches, domain independence, and reasonable
response time. We address these requirements
by a hybrid word/phoneme search in lattices,
and a supporting indexing scheme. We will in-
troduce the ranking criterion, a unified hybrid
posterior-lattice representation, and the index-
ing algorithm for hybrid lattices. We present
results for five different recording sets, includ-
ing meetings, telephone conversations, and in-
terviews. Our results show an average search
accuracy of 84%, which is dramatically better
than a direct search in speech recognition tran-
scripts (less than 40% search accuracy).
