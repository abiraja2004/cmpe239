The Semeval task 5 was an opportunity
for experimenting with the key term ex-
traction module of GROBID, a system for
extracting and generating bibliographical
information from technical and scientific
documents. The tool first uses GROBID?s
facilities for analyzing the structure of sci-
entific articles, resulting in a first set of
structural features. A second set of fea-
tures captures content properties based on
phraseness, informativeness and keyword-
ness measures. Two knowledge bases,
GRISP and Wikipedia, are then exploited
for producing a last set of lexical/semantic
features. Bagged decision trees appeared
to be the most efficient machine learning
algorithm for generating a list of ranked
key term candidates. Finally a post rank-
ing was realized based on statistics of co-
usage of keywords in HAL, a large Open
Access publication repository.
