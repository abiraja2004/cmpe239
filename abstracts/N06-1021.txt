We develop dependency parsers for Ara-
bic, English, Chinese, and Czech using
Bayes Point Machines, a training algo-
rithm which is as easy to implement as
the perceptron yet competitive with large
margin methods. We achieve results com-
parable to state-of-the-art in English and
Czech, and report the first directed depen-
dency parsing accuracies for Arabic and
Chinese. Given the multilingual nature of
our experiments, we discuss some issues
regarding the comparison of dependency
parsers for different languages.
