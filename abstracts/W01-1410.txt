Grammar Association is a technique for
Machine Translation and Language Un-

tistical and structural models involved
in the translation process are automat-
ically built from bilingual examples,
and the optimal translation of new sen-
tences can be efficiently found by Dy-
namic Programming algorithms. This
paper presents and discusses Grammar
Association state of the art, including a
new statistical model: Loco C.
