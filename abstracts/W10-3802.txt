We present two contributions to gram-
mar driven translation. First, since both
Inversion Transduction Grammar and
Linear Inversion Transduction Gram-
mars have been shown to produce bet-
ter alignments then the standard word
alignment tool, we investigate how the
trade-off between speed and end-to-end
translation quality extends to the choice
of grammar formalism. Second, we
prove that Linear Transduction Gram-
mars (LTGs) generate the same transduc-
tions as Linear Inversion Transduction
Grammars, and present a scheme for ar-
riving at LTGs by bilingualizing Linear
Grammars. We also present a method for
obtaining Inversion Transduction Gram-
mars from Linear (Inversion) Transduc-
tion Grammars, which can speed up
grammar induction from parallel corpora
dramatically.
