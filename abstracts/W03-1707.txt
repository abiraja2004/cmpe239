In this paper, we describe an approach to
annotate the propositions in the Penn Chi-
nese Treebank. We describe how diathe-
sis alternation patterns can be used to
make coarse sense distinctions for Chi-
nese verbs as a necessary step in anno-
tating the predicate-structure of Chinese
verbs. We then discuss the representation
scheme we use to label the semantic argu-
ments and adjuncts of the predicates. We
discuss several complications for this type
of annotation and describe our solutions.
We then discuss how a lexical database
with predicate-argument structure infor-
mation can be used to ensure consistent
annotation. Finally, we discuss possible
applications for this resource.
