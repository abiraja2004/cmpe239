This paper describes a new part-of-speech tag-
ger including multiword unit (MWU) identifi-
cation. It is based on a Conditional Random
Field model integrating language-independent
features, as well as features computed from
external lexical resources. It was imple-
mented in a finite-state framework composed
of a preliminary finite-state lexical analysis
and a CRF decoding using weighted finite-
state transducer composition. We showed that
our tagger reaches state-of-the-art results for
French in the standard evaluation conditions
(i.e. each multiword unit is already merged in
a single token). The evaluation of the tagger
integrating MWU recognition clearly shows
the interest of incorporating features based on
MWU resources.
