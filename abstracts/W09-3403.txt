 
Lexicon is in important resource in any kind of 
language processing application. Corpus-based 
lexica have several advantages over other tra-
ditional approaches. The lexicon developed for 
Sinhala was based on the text obtained from a 
corpus of 10 million words drawn from di-
verse genres. The words extracted from the 
corpus have been labeled with parts of speech 
categories defined according to a novel classi-
fication proposed for Sinhala. The lexicon re-
ports 80% coverage over unrestricted text ob-
tained from online sources. The lexicon has 
been implemented in Lexical Mark up Frame-
work.
