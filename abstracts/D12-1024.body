We present a new approach to the problem
of automatic text summarization called Au-
tomatic Summarization using Reinforcement
Learning (ASRL) in this paper, which models
the process of constructing a summary within
the framework of reinforcement learning and
attempts to optimize the given score function
with the given feature representation of a sum-
mary. We demonstrate that the method of re-
inforcement learning can be adapted to auto-
matic summarization problems naturally and
simply, and other summarizing techniques,
such as sentence compression, can be easily
adapted as actions of the framework.
The experimental results indicated ASRL was
superior to the best performing method in
DUC2004 and comparable to the state of the
art ILP-style method, in terms of ROUGE
scores. The results also revealed ASRL can
search for sub-optimal solutions efficiently
under conditions for effectively selecting fea-
tures and the score function.
