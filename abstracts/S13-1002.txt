We combine logical and distributional rep-
resentations of natural language meaning by
transforming distributional similarity judg-
ments into weighted inference rules using
Markov Logic Networks (MLNs). We show
that this framework supports both judg-
ing sentence similarity and recognizing tex-
tual entailment by appropriately adapting the
MLN implementation of logical connectives.
We also show that distributional phrase simi-
larity, used as textual inference rules created
on the fly, improves its performance.
