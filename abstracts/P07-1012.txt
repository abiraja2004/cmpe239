Speech recognition in many morphologi-
cally rich languages suffers from a very high
out-of-vocabulary (OOV) ratio. Earlier work
has shown that vocabulary decomposition
methods can practically solve this problem
for a subset of these languages. This pa-
per compares various vocabulary decompo-
sition approaches to open vocabulary speech
recognition, using Estonian speech recogni-
tion as a benchmark. Comparisons are per-
formed utilizing large models of 60000 lex-
ical items and smaller vocabularies of 5000
items. A large vocabulary model based on
a manually constructed morphological tag-
ger is shown to give the lowest word er-
ror rate, while the unsupervised morphol-
ogy discovery method Morfessor Baseline
gives marginally weaker results. Only the
Morfessor-based approach is shown to ade-
quately scale to smaller vocabulary sizes.
