This paper presents a series of measure-
ments of the accuracy of speech under-
standing when grammar-based or robust
approaches are used. The robust ap-
proaches considered here are based on sta-
tistical language models (SLMs) with the
interpretation being carried out by phrase-
spotting or robust parsing methods. We
propose a simple process to leverage ex-
isting grammars and logged utterances
to upgrade grammar-based applications to
become more robust to out-of-coverage
inputs. All experiments herein are run
on data collected from deployed directed
dialog applications and show that SLM-
based techniques outperform grammar-
based ones without requiring any change
in the application logic.
