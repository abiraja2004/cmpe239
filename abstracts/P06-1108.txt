In this paper we present how the auto-
matic extraction of events from text can
be used to both classify narrative texts ac-
cording to plot quality and produce advice
in an interactive learning environment in-
tended to help students with story writing.
We focus on the story rewriting task, in
which an exemplar story is read to the stu-
dents and the students rewrite the story in
their own words. The system automati-
cally extracts events from the raw text, for-
malized as a sequence of temporally or-
dered predicate-arguments. These events
are given to a machine-learner that pro-
duces a coarse-grained rating of the story.
The results of the machine-learner and the
extracted events are then used to generate
fine-grained advice for the students.
