 
Previous methods usually conduct the 
keyphrase extraction task for single docu-
ments separately without interactions for 
each document, under the assumption 
that the documents are considered inde-
pendent of each other. This paper pro-
poses a novel approach named Col-
labRank to collaborative single-document 
keyphrase extraction by making use of 
mutual influences of multiple documents 
within a cluster context. CollabRank is 
implemented by first employing the clus-
tering algorithm to obtain appropriate 
document clusters, and then using the 
graph-based ranking algorithm for col-
laborative single-document keyphrase ex-
traction within each cluster. Experimental 
results demonstrate the encouraging per-
formance of the proposed approach. Dif-
ferent clustering algorithms have been 
investigated and we find that the system 
performance relies positively on the qual-
ity of document clusters.
