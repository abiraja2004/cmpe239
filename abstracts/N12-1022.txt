In a large-scale study of how people find top-
ical shifts in written text, 27 annotators were
asked to mark topically continuous segments
in 20 chapters of a novel. We analyze the re-
sulting corpus for inter-annotator agreement
and examine disagreement patterns. The re-
sults suggest that, while the overall agree-
ment is relatively low, the annotators show
high agreement on a subset of topical breaks
? places where most prominent topic shifts
occur. We recommend taking into account
the prominence of topical shifts when evalu-
ating topical segmentation, effectively penal-
izing more severely the errors on more impor-
tant breaks. We propose to account for this in a
simple modification of the windowDiff metric.
We discuss the experimental results of evaluat-
ing several topical segmenters with and with-
out considering the importance of the individ-
ual breaks, and emphasize the more insightful
nature of the latter analysis.
