 
In this paper we present a semantic 
study of motion complexes (ie. of a mo- 
tion verb followed by a spatial preposi- 
tion). We focus on the spatial and the 
temporal intrinsic semantic properties of 
the motion verbs, on the one hand, and 
of the spatial prepositions, on the other 
hand. Then we address the problem of 
combining these basic semantics in or- 
der to formally and automatically de- 
rive the spatiotemporal semantics of a 
motion complex from the spatiotempo- 
ral properties of its components.
