We present a search-based approach to au-
tomatic surface realization given a cor-
pus of domain sentences. Using heuris-
tic search based on a statistical language
model and a structure we introduce called
an inheritance table we overgenerate a
set of complete syntactic-semantic trees
that are consistent with the given seman-
tic structure and have high likelihood rela-
tive to the language model. These trees are
then lexicalized, linearized, scored, and
ranked. This model is being developed to
generate real-time navigation instructions.
