 
We describe the way we adapted a text 
analysis tool for annotating with the Lin-
guistic Description Scheme of MPEG-7 
text related to and extracted from multi-
media content. Practically applied in the 
DIRECT-INFO EC R&D project we 
show how such linguistic annotation con-
tributes to semantic annotation of multi-
modal analysis systems, demonstrating 
also the use of the XML schema of 
MPEG-7 for supporting cross-media se-
mantic content annotation.
