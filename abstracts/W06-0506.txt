 
Learning taxonomy for technical terms is 
difficult and tedious task, especially 
when new terms should be included. The 
goal of this paper is to assign taxonomic 
relations among technical terms. We pro-
pose new approach to the problem that 
relies on term specificity and similarity 
measures. Term specificity and similarity 
are necessary conditions for taxonomy 
learning, because highly specific terms 
tend to locate in deep levels and semanti-
cally similar terms are close to each other 
in taxonomy. We analyzed various fea-
tures used in previous researches in view 
of term specificity and similarity, and ap-
plied optimal features for term specificity 
and similarity to our method.
