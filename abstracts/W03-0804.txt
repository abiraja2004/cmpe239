This paper describes the outline of a linguistic
annotation framework under development by
ISO TC37 SC WG1-1. This international
standard will provide an architecture for the
creation, annotation, and manipulation of lin-
guistic resources and processing software. The
outline described here results from a meeting
of approximately 20 experts in the field, who
determined the principles and fundamental
structure of the framework. The goal is to
provide maximum flexibility for encoders and
annotators, while at the same time enabling
interchange and re-use of annotated linguistic
resources.
