Structured perceptrons are attractive due
to their simplicity and speed, and have
been used successfully for tuning the
weights of binary features in a machine
translation system. In attempting to apply
them to tuning the weights of real-valued
features with highly skewed distributions,
we found that they did not work well. This
paper describes a modification to the up-
date step and compares the performance
of the resulting algorithm to standard min-
imum error-rate training (MERT). In ad-
dition, preliminary results for combining
MERT or structured-perceptron tuning of
the log-linear feature weights with coordi-
nate ascent of other translation system pa-
rameters are presented.
