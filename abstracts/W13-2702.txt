Language transformation can be defined
as translating between diachronically dis-
tinct language variants. We investigate the
transformation of Middle Dutch into Mod-
ern Dutch by means of machine transla-
tion. We demonstrate that by using char-
acter overlap the performance of the ma-
chine translation process can be improved
for this task.
