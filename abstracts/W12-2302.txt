Hindi is an Indian language which is rela-
tively rich in morphology. A few morpholog-
ical analyzers of this language have been de-
veloped. However, they give only inflectional
analysis of the language. In this paper, we
present our Hindi derivational morphological
analyzer. Our algorithm upgrades an existing
inflectional analyzer to a derivational analyzer
and primarily achieves two goals. First, it suc-
cessfully incorporates derivational analysis in
the inflectional analyzer. Second, it also in-
creases the coverage of the inflectional analy-
sis of the existing inflectional analyzer.
