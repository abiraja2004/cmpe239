  
In creating an English grammar 
checking software product, we 
implemented a large-coverage rammar 
based on the dependency grammar 
formalism. This implementation 
required some adaptation of current 
linguistic description to prevent serious 
overgeneration f parse trees. Here, ? we 
present one particular example, that of 
preposition stranding and dangling 
prepositions, where implementing an 
alternative to existing linguistic analyses 
is warranted to limit such over- 
generation.
