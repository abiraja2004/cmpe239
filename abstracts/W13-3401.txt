 
This paper describes the process of composing 
problems that are suitable for competitions in 
linguistics.  The type of problems described is 
?Rosetta Stone??a bilingual problem where 
typically one of the languages is unknown, and 
the other is the native language of the person 
solving the problem.  The process includes se-
lecting phenomena, composing and arranging 
the data and assignments in order to illustrate 
the phenomena, and verifying the solvability 
and complexity of the problem.
