 
We present a simple algorithm for 
clustering semantic patterns based on 
distributional similarity and use cluster 
memberships to guide semi-supervised 
pattern discovery. We apply this 
approach to the task of relation 
extraction. The evaluation results 
demonstrate that our novel 
bootstrapping procedure significantly 
outperforms a standard bootstrapping. 
Most importantly, our algorithm can 
effectively prevent semantic drift and 
provide semi-supervised learning with a 
natural stopping criterion.
