We propose a method ?Interactive Paraphras-
ing? which enables users to interactively para-
phrase words in a document by their definitions,
making use of syntactic annotation and word
sense annotation. Syntactic annotation is used
for managing smooth integration of word sense
definitions into the original document, and word
sense annotation for retrieving the correct word
sense definition for a word in a document. In
this way, documents can be paraphrased so that
they fit into the original context, preserving the
semantics and improving the readability at the
same time. No extra layer (window) is necessary
for showing the word sense definition as in con-
ventional methods, and other natural language
processing techniques such as summarization,
translation, and voice synthesis can be easily
applied to the results.
