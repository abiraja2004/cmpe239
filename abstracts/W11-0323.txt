We investigate the use of Semi-Supervised
Learning (SSL) in opinion detection both in
sparse data situations and for domain adapta-
tion. We show that co-training reaches the best
results in an in-domain setting with small la-
beled data sets, with a maximum absolute gain
of 33.5%. For domain transfer, we show that
self-training gains an absolute improvement in
labeling accuracy for blog data of 16% over
the supervised approach with target domain
training data.
