In this paper we introduce a joint arc-factored
model for syntactic and semantic dependency
parsing. The semantic role labeler predicts
the full syntactic paths that connect predicates
with their arguments. This process is framed
as a linear assignment task, which allows
to control some well-formedness constraints.
For the syntactic part, we define a standard
arc-factored dependency model that predicts
the full syntactic tree. Finally, we employ dual
decomposition techniques to produce consis-
tent syntactic and predicate-argument struc-
tures while searching over a large space of
syntactic configurations. In experiments on
the CoNLL-2009 English benchmark we ob-
serve very competitive results.
