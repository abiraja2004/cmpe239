 
Computational models of infant word 
segmentation have not been tested on a 
wide range of languages. This paper ap-
plies a phonotactic segmentation model 
to Korean. In contrast to the underseg-
mentation pattern previously found in 
English and Russian, the model exhibited 
more oversegmentation errors and more 
errors overall. Despite the high error rate, 
analysis suggested that lexical acquisition 
might not be problematic, provided that 
infants attend only to frequently seg-
mented items.
