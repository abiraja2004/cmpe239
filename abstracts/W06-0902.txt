Work on the interpretation of temporal ex-
pressions in text has generally been pur-
sued in one of two paradigms: the for-
mal semantics approach, where an attempt
is made to provide a well-grounded theo-
retical basis for the interpretation of these
expressions, and the more pragmatically-
focused approach represented by the de-
velopment of the TIMEX2 standard, with
its origins in work in information extrac-
tion. The former emphasises formal ele-
gance and consistency; the latter empha-
sises broad coverage for practical applica-
tions. In this paper, we report on the de-
velopment of a framework that attempts
to integrate insights from both perspec-
tives, with the aim of achieving broad cov-
erage of the domain in a well-grounded
manner from a formal perspective. We
focus in particular on the development
of a compact notation for representing
the semantics of underspecified tempo-
ral expressions that can be used to pro-
vide component-level evaluation of sys-
tems that interpret such expressions.
