Named entity phrases are some of the
most difficult phrases to translate because
new phrases can appear from nowhere,
and because many are domain specific, not
to be found in bilingual dictionaries. We
present a novel algorithm for translating
named entity phrases using easily obtain-
able monolingual and bilingual resources.
We report on the application and evalua-
tion of this algorithm in translating Arabic
named entities to English. We also com-
pare our results with the results obtained
from human translations and a commer-
cial system for the same task.
