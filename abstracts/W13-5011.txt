This paper presents a system that performs
skill extraction from text documents. It out-
puts a list of professional skills that are rele-
vant to a given input text. We argue that the
system can be practical for hiring and man-
agement of personnel in an organization. We
make use of the texts and the hyperlink graph
of Wikipedia, as well as a list of professional
skills obtained from the LinkedIn social net-
work. The system is based on first computing
similarities between an input document and
the texts of Wikipedia pages and then using a
biased, hub-avoiding version of the Spreading
Activation algorithm on the Wikipedia graph
in order to associate the input document with
skills.
