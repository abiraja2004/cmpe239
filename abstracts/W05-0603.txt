In order to achieve the long-range goal
of semantic interpretation of noun com-
pounds, it is often necessary to first de-
termine their syntactic structure. This pa-
per describes an unsupervised method for
noun compound bracketing which extracts
statistics from Web search engines using a
?2 measure, a new set of surface features,
and paraphrases. On a gold standard, the
system achieves results of 89.34% (base-
line 66.80%), which is a sizable improve-
ment over the state of the art (80.70%).
