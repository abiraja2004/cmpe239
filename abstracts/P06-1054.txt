We present a novel classifier-based deter-
ministic parser for Chinese constituency
parsing. Our parser computes parse trees
from bottom up in one pass, and uses
classifiers to make shift-reduce decisions.
Trained and evaluated on the standard
training and test sets, our best model (us-
ing stacked classifiers) runs in linear time
and has labeled precision and recall above
88% using gold-standard part-of-speech
tags, surpassing the best published re-
sults. Our SVM parser is 2-13 times faster
than state-of-the-art parsers, while produc-
ing more accurate results. Our Maxent
and DTree parsers run at speeds 40-270
times faster than state-of-the-art parsers,
but with 5-6% losses in accuracy.
