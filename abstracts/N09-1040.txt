This paper presents a novel unsupervised
method for hierarchical topic segmentation.
Lexical cohesion ? the workhorse of unsu-
pervised linear segmentation ? is treated as
a multi-scale phenomenon, and formalized
in a Bayesian setting. Each word token is
modeled as a draw from a pyramid of la-
tent topic models, where the structure of the
pyramid is constrained to induce a hierarchi-
cal segmentation. Inference takes the form
of a coordinate-ascent algorithm, iterating be-
tween two steps: a novel dynamic program
for obtaining the globally-optimal hierarchi-
cal segmentation, and collapsed variational
Bayesian inference over the hidden variables.
The resulting system is fast and accurate, and
compares well against heuristic alternatives.
