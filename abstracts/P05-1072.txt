Semantic role labeling is the process of
annotating the predicate-argument struc-
ture in text with semantic labels. In this
paper we present a state-of-the-art base-
line semantic role labeling system based
on Support Vector Machine classifiers.
We show improvements on this system
by: i) adding new features including fea-
tures extracted from dependency parses,
ii) performing feature selection and cali-
bration and iii) combining parses obtained
from semantic parsers trained using dif-
ferent syntactic views. Error analysis of
the baseline system showed that approx-
imately half of the argument identifica-
tion errors resulted from parse errors in
which there was no syntactic constituent
that aligned with the correct argument. In
order to address this problem, we com-
bined semantic parses from a Minipar syn-
tactic parse and from a chunked syntac-
tic representation with our original base-
line system which was based on Charniak
parses. All of the reported techniques re-
sulted in performance improvements.
