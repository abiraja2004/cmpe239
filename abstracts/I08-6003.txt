 
Discovering parallel corpora on the web is 
a challenging task. In this paper, we use 
cross-language information retrieval tech-
niques in combination with structural fea-
tures to retrieve candidate page pairs from 
a commercial search engine. The candidate 
page pairs are then filtered using tech-
niques described by Resnik and Smith 
(2003) to determine if they are translations. 
The results allow the comparison of effi-
ciency of different parameter settings and 
provide an estimate for the percentage of 
pages that are parallel for a certain lan-
guage pair.
