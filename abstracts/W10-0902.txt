We previously proposed a packed graphical
representation to succinctly represent a huge
number of alternative semantic representa-
tions of a given sentence. We also showed that
this representation could improve text inter-
pretation accuracy considerably because the
system could postpone resolving ambiguity
until more evidence accumulates. This paper
discusses our plan to build an end-to-end text
reading system based on our packed represen-
tation.
