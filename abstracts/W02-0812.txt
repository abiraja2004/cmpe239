This paper presents an evaluation of an
ensemble?based system that participated
in the English and Spanish lexical sample
tasks of SENSEVAL-2. The system com-
bines decision trees of unigrams, bigrams,
and co?occurrences into a single classi-
fier. The analysis is extended to include
the SENSEVAL-1 data.
