We discuss some of the practical issues that
arise from decoding with general synchronous
context-free grammars. We examine problems
caused by unary rules and we also examine
how virtual nonterminals resulting from bina-
rization can best be handled. We also inves-
tigate adding more flexibility to synchronous
context-free grammars by adding glue rules
and phrases.
