We present in this paper methods to improve
HMM-based part-of-speech (POS) tagging
of Mandarin. We model the emission prob-
ability of an unknown word using all the
characters in the word, and enrich the stan-
dard left-to-right trigram estimation of word
emission probabilities with a right-to-left
prediction of the word by making use of the
current and next tags. In addition, we utilize
the RankBoost-based reranking algorithm
to rerank the N-best outputs of the HMM-
based tagger using various n-gram, mor-
phological, and dependency features. Two
methods are proposed to improve the gen-
eralization performance of the reranking al-
gorithm. Our reranking model achieves an
accuracy of 94.68% using n-gram and mor-
phological features on the Penn Chinese
Treebank 5.2, and is able to further improve
the accuracy to 95.11% with the addition of
dependency features.
