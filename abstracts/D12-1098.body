Many natural language processing problems
involve constructing large nearest-neighbor
graphs. We propose a system called FLAG
to construct such graphs approximately from
large data sets. To handle the large amount
of data, our algorithm maintains approximate
counts based on sketching algorithms. To
find the approximate nearest neighbors, our
algorithm pairs a new distributed online-PMI
algorithm with novel fast approximate near-
est neighbor search algorithms (variants of
PLEB). These algorithms return the approxi-
mate nearest neighbors quickly. We show our
system?s efficiency in both intrinsic and ex-
trinsic experiments. We further evaluate our
fast search algorithms both quantitatively and
qualitatively on two NLP applications.
