 
Chinese Word Segmentation(WS), Name 
Entity Recognition(NER) and Part-Of-
Speech(POS) are three important Chinese 
Corpus annotation tasks. With the great 
improvement in these annotations on some 
corpus, now, the robustness, a capability of 
keeping good performances for a system by 
automatically fitting the different corpus 
and standards, become a focal problem. 
This paper introduces the work on 
robustness of WS and POS annotation 
systems from Beijing University of Posts 
and Telecommunications(BUPT), and two 
NER systems. The WS system combines a 
basic WS tagger with an adaptor used to fit 
a specific standard given. POS taggers are 
built for different standards under a two 
step frame, both steps use ME but with 
incremental features. A multiple 
knowledge source system and a less 
knowledge Conditional Random Field 
(CRF) based systems are used for NER. 
Experiments show that our WS and POS 
systems are robust.
