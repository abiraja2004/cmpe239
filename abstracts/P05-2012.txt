In this paper a method to incorporate lin-
guistic information regarding single-word
and compound verbs is proposed, as a
first step towards an SMT model based
on linguistically-classified phrases. By
substituting these verb structures by the
base form of the head verb, we achieve
a better statistical word alignment perfor-
mance, and are able to better estimate the
translation model and generalize to unseen
verb forms during translation. Preliminary
experiments for the English - Spanish lan-
guage pair are performed, and future re-
search lines are detailed.
