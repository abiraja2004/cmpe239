We present an unsupervised model for joint
phrase alignment and extraction using non-
parametric Bayesian methods and inversion
transduction grammars (ITGs). The key con-
tribution is that phrases of many granulari-
ties are included directly in the model through
the use of a novel formulation that memorizes
phrases generated not only by terminal, but
also non-terminal symbols. This allows for
a completely probabilistic model that is able
to create a phrase table that achieves com-
petitive accuracy on phrase-based machine
translation tasks directly from unaligned sen-
tence pairs. Experiments on several language
pairs demonstrate that the proposed model
matches the accuracy of traditional two-step
word alignment/phrase extraction approach
while reducing the phrase table to a fraction
of the original size.
