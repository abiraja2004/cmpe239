 
Stochastic ategorial grammars (SCGs) are 
introduced as a more appropriate formal- 
ism for statistical language learners to es- 
timate than stochastic ontext free gram- 
mars. As a vehicle for demonstrating SCG 
estimation, we show, in terms of crossing 
rates and in coverage, that when training 
material is limited, SCG estimation using 
the Minimum Description Length Princi- 
ple is preferable to SCG estimation using 
an indifferent prior.
