In this paper we describe the system used to
participate in the sub task 5b in the Phrasal Se-
mantics challenge (task 5) in SemEval 2013.
This sub task consists in discriminating lit-
eral and figurative usage of phrases with
compositional and non-compositional mean-
ings in context. The proposed approach is
based on part-of-speech tags, stylistic features
and distributional statistics gathered from the
same development-training-test text collec-
tion. The system obtained a relative improve-
ment in accuracy against the most-frequent-
class baseline of 49.8% in the ?unseen con-
texts? (LexSample) setting and 8.5% in ?un-
seen phrases? (AllWords).
