Most attempts to integrate FrameNet in NLP
systems have so far failed because of its lim-
ited coverage. In this paper, we investigate the
applicability of distributional and WordNet-
based models on the task of lexical unit induc-
tion, i.e. the expansion of FrameNet with new
lexical units. Experimental results show that
our distributional and WordNet-based models
achieve good level of accuracy and coverage,
especially when combined.
