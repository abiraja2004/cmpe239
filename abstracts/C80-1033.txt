 
Story-processing systems have to deal, or avoid 
dealing, with INFERENCE CONTROL ' '6 '  I i ,  13. 
when designing one such system 2, we were great- 
ly helped by the "(ERC)RC" expression for con- 
notation I. Our system is specialised in multi - 
faceted descriptions of characters (not, how- 
ever, in the most d i f f i cu l t  problems of beliefs 
about beliefs 4 and 8): here we present another 
aspect of the story character processing, name- 
ly the recursive EXPLANATION of inconsistencies 
appearing in the description of a character. 
We give a very schematic system overview, then 
some details about the CONNOTATION rules and an 
example of their  application to a story.

in the processing of a robot who asked what the 
moon is made of. As Barthes then remarks, con- 
notations may be based on a set of in i t ia l  ex- 
pressions rather than on a single one, which is 
expressed by (EiRCl, E2RC 2 . . . . .  EnRCn) R C 
This seems to be an essential feature of conno- 
tations, since i t  allows emphasis on 'connoted' 
contents by means of an accumulation of signi- 
f iers .  Another feature, elegantly i l lust rated 
in ' l 'envers des signes ' i0 by the two steps 
( ("vo i le"  RC("navire"))RC("po~sie"))RC("rh~to- 
r ique"),  is their  recurs iv i ty.
