In this paper1 we introduce eXtensible
MetaGrammar, a system that facilitates
the development of tree based grammars.
This system includes both (1) a formal lan-
guage adapted to the description of lin-
guistic information and (2) a compiler for
this language. It applies techniques of
logic programming (e.g. Warren?s Ab-
stract Machine), thus providing an effi-
cient and theoretically motivated frame-
work for the processing of linguistic meta-
descriptions.
