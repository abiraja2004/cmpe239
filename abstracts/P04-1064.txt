Aligning words from sentences which are mutual
translations is an important problem in different set-
tings, such as bilingual terminology extraction, Ma-
chine Translation, or projection of linguistic fea-
tures. Here, we view word alignment as matrix fac-
torisation. In order to produce proper alignments,
we show that factors must satisfy a number of con-
straints such as orthogonality. We then propose an
algorithm for orthogonal non-negative matrix fac-
torisation, based on a probabilistic model of the
alignment data, and apply it to word alignment. This
is illustrated on a French-English alignment task
from the Hansard.
