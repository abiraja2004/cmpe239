The Japanese language has various types
of compound functional expressions,
which are very important for recogniz-
ing the syntactic structures of Japanese
sentences and for understanding their
semantic contents. In this paper, we
formalize the task of identifying Japanese
compound functional expressions in a
text as a chunking problem. We apply a
machine learning technique to this task,
where we employ that of Support Vector
Machines (SVMs). We show that the pro-
posed method significantly outperforms
existing Japanese text processing tools.
