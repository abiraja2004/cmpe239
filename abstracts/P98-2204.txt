 
I propose a model for determining the hearer's at- 
tentional state which depends olely on a list of 
salient discourse entities (S-list). The ordering 
among the elements of the S-list covers also the 
function of the backward-looking center in the cen- 
tering model. The ranking criteria for the S-list 
are based on the distinction between hearer-old and 
hearer-new discourse ntities and incorporate pref- 
erences for inter- and intra-sentential anaphora. The 
model is the basis for an algorithm which operates 
incrementally, word by word.
