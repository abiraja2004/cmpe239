We present a novel approach for find-
ing discontinuities that outperforms pre-
viously published results on this task.
Rather than using a deeper grammar for-
malism, our system combines a simple un-
lexicalized PCFG parser with a shallow
pre-processor. This pre-processor, which
we call a trace tagger, does surprisingly
well on detecting where discontinuities
can occur without using phase structure
information.
