 
In this paper, the search engine Intuition is 
described. It allows the user to navigate 
through the documents retrieved with a given 
query. Several ?browse help? functions are 
provided by the engine and described here: 
conceptualisation, named entities, similar 
documents and entity visualization. They 
intend to ?save the user?s time?. In order to 
evaluate the amount of time these features can 
save, an evaluation was made. It involves 6 
users, 18 queries and the corpus is made of 16 
years of the newspaper Le Monde. The results 
show that, with the different features, a user 
get faster to the needed information. fewer 
non-relevant documents are read (filtering) 
and more relevant documents are retrieved in 
less time.
