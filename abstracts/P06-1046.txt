Accurately representing synonymy using
distributional similarity requires large vol-
umes of data to reliably represent infre-
quent words. However, the na??ve nearest-
neighbour approach to comparing context
vectors extracted from large corpora scales
poorly (O(n2) in the vocabulary size).
In this paper, we compare several existing
approaches to approximating the nearest-
neighbour search for distributional simi-
larity. We investigate the trade-off be-
tween efficiency and accuracy, and find
that SASH (Houle and Sakuma, 2005) pro-
vides the best balance.
