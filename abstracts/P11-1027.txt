N -gram language models are a major resource
bottleneck in machine translation. In this pa-
per, we present several language model imple-
mentations that are both highly compact and
fast to query. Our fastest implementation is
as fast as the widely used SRILM while re-
quiring only 25% of the storage. Our most
compact representation can store all 4 billion
n-grams and associated counts for the Google
n-gram corpus in 23 bits per n-gram, the most
compact lossless representation to date, and
even more compact than recent lossy compres-
sion techniques. We also discuss techniques
for improving query speed during decoding,
including a simple but novel language model
caching technique that improves the query
speed of our language models (and SRILM)
by up to 300%.
