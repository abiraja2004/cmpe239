Text prediction is the task of suggesting
text while the user is typing. Its main aim
is to reduce the number of keystrokes that
are needed to type a text. In this paper, we
address the influence of text type and do-
main differences on text prediction quality.
By training and testing our text predic-
tion algorithm on four different text types
(Wikipedia, Twitter, transcriptions of con-
versational speech and FAQ) with equal
corpus sizes, we found that there is a clear
effect of text type on text prediction qual-
ity: training and testing on the same text
type gave percentages of saved keystrokes
between 27 and 34%; training on a differ-
ent text type caused the scores to drop to
percentages between 16 and 28%.
In our case study, we compared a num-
ber of training corpora for a specific data
set for which training data is sparse: ques-
tions about neurological issues. We found
that both text type and topic domain play
a role in text prediction quality. The
best performing training corpus was a set
of medical pages from Wikipedia. The
second-best result was obtained by leave-
one-out experiments on the test questions,
even though this training corpus was much
smaller (2,672 words) than the other cor-
pora (1.5 Million words).
