We present an iterative technique to gener-
ate phrase tables for SMT, which is based
on force-aligning the training data with
a modified translation decoder. Differ-
ent from previous work, we completely
avoid the use of a word alignment or
phrase extraction heuristics, moving to-
wards a more principled phrase generation
and probability estimation. During train-
ing, we allow the decoder to generate new
phrases on-the-fly and increment the max-
imum phrase length in each iteration. Ex-
periments are carried out on the IWSLT
2011 Arabic-English task, where we are
able to reach moderate improvements on a
state-of-the-art baseline with our training
method. The resulting phrase table shows
only a small overlap with the heuristically
extracted one, which demonstrates the re-
strictiveness of limiting phrase selection
by a word alignment or heuristics. By
interpolating the heuristic and the trained
phrase table, we can improve over the
baseline by 0.5% BLEU and 0.5% TER.
