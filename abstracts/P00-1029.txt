An approach to automatic detection
of syllable structure is presented. We
demonstrate a novel application of
EM-based clustering to multivariate
data, exemplied by the induction
of 3- and 5-dimensional probabilis-
tic syllable classes. The qualitative
evaluation shows that the method
yields phonologically meaningful syl-
lable classes. We then propose a
novel approach to grapheme-to-pho-
neme conversion and show that syl-
lable structure represents valuable
information for pronunciation sys-
tems.
