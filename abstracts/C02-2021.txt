A detailed approach has been developed for
core aspects of the task of understanding a
broad class of metaphorical utterances. The
utterances in question are those that depend
on known metaphorical mappings but that
nevertheless contain elements not mapped
by those mappings. A reasoning system has
been implemented that partially instantiates
the theoretical approach. The system, called
ATT-Meta, will be demonstrated. The paper
briefly indicates how the system works, and
outlines some specific aspects of the system,
approach and the overall project.
