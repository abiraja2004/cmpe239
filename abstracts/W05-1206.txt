This paper argues that local textual in-
ferences come in three well-defined vari-
eties (entailments, conventional implica-
tures/presuppositions, and conversational
implicatures) and one less clearly defined
one, generally available world knowledge.
Based on this taxonomy, it discusses some
of the examples in the PASCAL text suite
and shows that these examples do not fall
into any of them. It proposes to enlarge the
test suite with examples that are more di-
rectly related to the inference patterns dis-
cussed.
