In this paper, a generic system that gener-
ates parsers from parsing schemata is ap-
plied to the particular case of the XTAG
English grammar. In order to be able to
generate XTAG parsers, some transforma-
tions are made to the grammar, and TAG
parsing schemata are extended with fea-
ture structure unification support and a
simple tree filtering mechanism. The gen-
erated implementations allow us to study
the performance of different TAG parsers
when working with a large-scale, wide-
coverage grammar.
