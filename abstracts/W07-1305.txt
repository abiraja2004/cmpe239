 
In this paper we use the Reeks Nederlandse 
Dialectatlassen as a source for the recon-
struction of a ?proto-language? of Dutch 
dialects. We used 360 dialects from loca-
tions in the Netherlands, the northern part 
of Belgium and French-Flanders. The den-
sity of dialect locations is about the same 
everywhere. For each dialect we recon-
structed 85 words. For the reconstruction of 
vowels we used knowledge of Dutch his-
tory, and for the reconstruction of conso-
nants we used well-known tendencies 
found in most textbooks about historical 
linguistics. We validated results by com-
paring the reconstructed forms with pro-
nunciations according to a proto-Germanic 
dictionary (K?bler, 2003). For 46% of the 
words we reconstructed the same vowel or 
the closest possible vowel when the vowel 
to be reconstructed was not found in the 
dialect material. For 52% of the words all 
consonants we reconstructed  were the 
same. For 42% of the words, only one con-
sonant was differently reconstructed. We 
measured the divergence of Dutch dialects 
from their ?proto-language?. We measured 
pronunciation distances to the proto-
language we reconstructed ourselves and 
correlated them with pronunciation dis-
tances we measured to proto-Germanic 
based on the dictionary. Pronunciation dis-
tances were measured using Levenshtein 
distance, a string edit distance measure. We 
found a relatively strong correlation 
(r=0.87).
