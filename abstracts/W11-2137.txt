We present the results we obtain using our
RegMT system, which uses transductive re-
gression techniques to learn mappings be-
tween source and target features of given par-
allel corpora and use these mappings to gen-
erate machine translation outputs. Our train-
ing instance selection methods perform fea-
ture decay for proper selection of training in-
stances, which plays an important role to learn
correct feature mappings. RegMT uses L2
regularized regression as well as L1 regular-
ized regression for sparse regression estima-
tion of target features. We present transla-
tion results using our training instance selec-
tion methods, translation results using graph
decoding, system combination results with
RegMT, and performance evaluation with the
F1 measure over target features as a metric for
evaluating translation quality.
