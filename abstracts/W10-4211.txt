Abstract
In this paper we present a complete sys-
tem for automatically generating natural
language abstracts of meeting conversa-
tions. This system is comprised of com-
ponents relating to interpretation of the
meeting documents according to a meet-
ing ontology, transformation or content
selection from that source representation
to a summary representation, and gener-
ation of new summary text. In a forma-
tive user study, we compare this approach
to gold-standard human abstracts and ex-
tracts to gauge the usefulness of the dif-
ferent summary types for browsing meet-
ing conversations. We find that our auto-
matically generated summaries are ranked
significantly higher than human-selected
extracts on coherence and usability crite-
ria. More generally, users demonstrate a
strong preference for abstract-style sum-
maries over extracts.
