Most work on word sense disambiguation has
assumed that word usages are best labeled
with a single sense. However, contextual am-
biguity or fine-grained senses can potentially
enable multiple sense interpretations of a us-
age. We present a new SemEval task for evalu-
ating Word Sense Induction and Disambigua-
tion systems in a setting where instances may
be labeled with multiple senses, weighted by
their applicability. Four teams submitted nine
systems, which were evaluated in two settings.
