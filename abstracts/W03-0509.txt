 
Automatic Multi-Document summarization is still hard 
to realize. Under such circumstances, we believe, it is 
important to observe how humans are doing the same 
task, and look around for different strategies. 
We prepared 100 document sets similar to the ones 
used in the DUC multi-document summarization task. 
For each document set, several people prepared the 
following data and we conducted a survey. 
A) Free style summarization 
B) Sentence Extraction type summarization 
C) Axis (type of main topic) 
D) Table style summary 
In particular, we will describe the last two in detail, 
as these could lead to a new direction for multi-
summarization research.
