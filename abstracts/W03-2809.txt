 
This paper attacks one part of the 
question "Are evaluation methods, 
metrics and resources reusable" by 
arguing that a set of ISO standards 
developed for the evaluation of software 
in general are as applicable to natural 
language processing software as to any 
other. Main features of the ISO proposals 
are presented, and a number of 
applications where they have been 
applied are mentioned, although not 
discussed in any detail. 
Acknowledgements 
The work recorded here is far from being all my 
own. I would like first to record my thanks to 
Nigel Bevan, technical editor of the ISO 
standards discussed for much interesting and 
enlightening discussion. Then many thanks must 
go to all my colleagues in the EAGLES and ISLE 
projects, especially Sandra Manzi and Andrei 
Popescu-Belis. Finally, I must thank all those 
whose work on applying the standards reported 
here provoked reflection and helped to convince  
me of the value of the approach: Marc Blasband, 
Maria Canelli, Dominique Estival, Daniele 
Grasso, V?ronique Sauron, Marianne Starlander 
and Nancy Underwood.
