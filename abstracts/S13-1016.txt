This paper deals with knowledge-based text
processing which aims at an intuitive notion
of textual similarity. Entities and relations rel-
evant for a particular domain are identified and
disambiguated by means of semi-supervised
machine learning techniques and resulting an-
notations are applied for computing typed-
similarity of individual texts.
The work described in this paper particularly
shows effects of the mentioned processes in
the context of the *SEM 2013 pilot task on
typed-similarity, a part of the Semantic Tex-
tual Similarity shared task. The goal is to
evaluate the degree of semantic similarity be-
tween semi-structured records. As the evalu-
ation dataset has been taken from Europeana
? a collection of records on European cultural
heritage objects ? we focus on computing a se-
mantic distance on field author which has the
highest potential to benefit from the domain
knowledge.
Specific features that are employed in our sys-
tem BUT-TYPED are briefly introduced to-
gether with a discussion on their efficient ac-
quisition. Support Vector Regression is then
used to combine the features and to provide a
final similarity score. The system ranked third
on the attribute author among 15 submitted
runs in the typed-similarity task.
