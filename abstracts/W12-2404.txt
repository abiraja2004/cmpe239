We investigate the task of assigning medi-
cal events in clinical narratives to discrete
time-bins. The time-bins are defined to cap-
ture when a medical event occurs relative to
the hospital admission date in each clinical
narrative. We model the problem as a se-
quence tagging task using Conditional Ran-
dom Fields. We extract a combination of lexi-
cal, section-based and temporal features from
medical events in each clinical narrative. The
sequence tagging system outperforms a sys-
tem that does not utilize any sequence infor-
mation modeled using a Maximum Entropy
classifier. We present results with both hand-
tagged as well as automatically extracted fea-
tures. We observe over 8% improvement in
overall tagging accuracy with the inclusion of
sequence information.
