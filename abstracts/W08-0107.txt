We introduce the Degrees of Grounding
model, which defines the extent to which ma-
terial being discussed in a dialogue has been
grounded. This model has been developed and
evaluated by a corpus analysis, and includes a
set of types of evidence of understanding, a set
of degrees of groundedness, a set of ground-
ing criteria, and methods for identifying each
of these. We describe how this model can be
used for dialogue management.
