This paper examines how grammatical and
memory constraints explain gradience in
superiority violation acceptability. A com-
putational model encoding both categories
of constraints is compared to experimental
evidence. By formalizing memory capac-
ity as beam-search in the parser, the model
predicts gradience evident in human data.
To predict attachment behavior, the parser
must be sensitive to the types of nominal
intervenors that occur between a wh-filler
and its head. The results suggest memory
is more informative for modeling violation
gradience patterns than grammatical con-
straints.
