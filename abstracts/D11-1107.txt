Traditional computational approaches to re-
ferring expression generation operate in a de-
liberate manner, choosing the attributes to be
included on the basis of their ability to dis-
tinguish the intended referent from its dis-
tractors. However, work in psycholinguis-
tics suggests that speakers align their refer-
ring expressions with those used previously in
the discourse, implying less deliberate choice
and more subconscious reuse. This raises the
question as to which is a more accurate char-
acterisation of what people do. Using a cor-
pus of dialogues containing 16,358 referring
expressions, we explore this question via the
generation of subsequent references in shared
visual scenes. We use a machine learning ap-
proach to referring expression generation and
demonstrate that incorporating features that
correspond to the computational tradition does
not match human referring behaviour as well
as using features corresponding to the process
of alignment. The results support the view that
the traditional model of referring expression
generation that is widely assumed in work on
natural language generation may not in fact
be correct; our analysis may also help explain
the oft-observed redundancy found in human-
produced referring expressions.
