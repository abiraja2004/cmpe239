This paper presents a semi-supervised learn-
ing framework for mining Chinese-English
lexicons from large amount of Chinese Web
pages. The issue is motivated by the ob-
servation that many Chinese neologisms are
accompanied by their English translations in
the form of parenthesis. We classify par-
enthetical translations into bilingual abbrevi-
ations, transliterations, and translations. A
frequency-based term recognition approach is
applied for extracting bilingual abbreviations.
A self-training algorithm is proposed for min-
ing transliteration and translation lexicons. In
which, we employ available lexicons in terms
of morpheme levels, i.e., phoneme correspon-
dences in transliteration and grapheme (e.g.,
suffix, stem, and prefix) correspondences in
translation. The experimental results verified
the effectiveness of our approaches.
