Hierarchical phrase-based models pro-
vide a powerful mechanism to capture
non-local phrase reorderings for statis-
tical machine translation (SMT). How-
ever, many phrase reorderings are arbi-
trary because the models are weak on de-
termining phrase boundaries for pattern-
matching. This paper presents a novel
approach to learn phrase boundaries di-
rectly from word-aligned corpus without
using any syntactical information. We use
phrase boundaries, which indicate the be-
ginning/ending of phrase reordering, as
soft constraints for decoding. Experi-
mental results and analysis show that the
approach yields significant improvements
over the baseline on large-scale Chinese-
to-English translation.
