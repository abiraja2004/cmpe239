In this paper we report on experiments
with three preprocessing strategies for im-
proving translation output in a statistical
MT system. In training, two reordering
strategies were studied: (i) reorder on the
basis of the alignments from Giza++, and
(ii) reorder by moving all verbs to the
end of segments. In translation, out-of-
vocabulary words were preprocessed in a
knowledge-lite fashion to identify a likely
equivalent. All three strategies were im-
plemented for our English?German sys-
tem submitted to the WMT10 shared task.
Combining them lead to improvements in
both language directions.
