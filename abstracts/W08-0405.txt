The paper presents an extension of a dynamic
programming (DP) decoder for phrase-based
SMT (Koehn, 2004; Och and Ney, 2004) that
tightly integrates POS-based re-order rules
(Crego and Marino, 2006) into a left-to-right
beam-search algorithm, rather than handling
them in a pre-processing or re-order graph
generation step. The novel decoding algo-
rithm can handle tens of thousands of rules
efficiently. An improvement over a standard
phrase-based decoder is shown on an Arabic-
English translation task with respect to trans-
lation accuracy and speed for large re-order
window sizes.
