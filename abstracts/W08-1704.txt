Grammar development makes up a large
part of the multilingual rule-based appli-
cation development cycle. One way to
decrease the required grammar develop-
ment efforts is to base the systems on
multilingual grammar resources. This pa-
per presents a detailed description of a
parametrization mechanism used for build-
ing multilingual grammar rules. We show
how these rules, which had originally been
designed and developed for typologically
different languages (English, Japanese and
Finnish) are applied to a new language
(Greek). The developed shared grammar
system has been implemented for a do-
main specific speech-to-speech translation
application. A majority of these rules
(54%) are shared amongst the four lan-
guages, 75% of the rules are shared for at
least two languages. The main benefit of
the described approach is shorter develop-
ment cycles for new system languages.
