A good decoding algorithm is critical
to the success of any statistical machine
translation system. The decoder?s job is
to find the translation that is most likely
according to set of previously learned
parameters (and a formula for combin-
ing them). Since the space of possi-
ble translations is extremely large, typ-
ical decoding algorithms are only able
to examine a portion of it, thus risk-
ing to miss good solutions. In this pa-
per, we compare the speed and out-
put quality of a traditional stack-based
decoding algorithm with two new de-
coders: a fast greedy decoder and a
slow but optimal decoder that treats de-
coding as an integer-programming opti-
mization problem.
