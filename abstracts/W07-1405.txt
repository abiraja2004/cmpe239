This paper describes on-going efforts to an-
notate  a  corpus  of  almost  16000  answer 
pairs with an estimated 69000 fine-grained 
entailment relationships.  We illustrate the 
need for  more detailed classification than 
currently  exists  and  describe  our  corpus 
and annotation scheme.  We discuss early 
statistical  analysis showing substantial  in-
ter-annotator  agreement  even  at  the  fine-
grained level.  The corpus described here, 
which is  the only one providing such de-
tailed annotations,  will  be made available 
as a public resource later this year (2007). 
This is expected to enable application de-
velopment that is currently not practical.
