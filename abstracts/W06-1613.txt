Citation function is defined as the author?s
reason for citing a given paper (e.g. ac-
knowledgement of the use of the cited
method). The automatic recognition of the
rhetorical function of citations in scientific
text has many applications, from improve-
ment of impact factor calculations to text
summarisation and more informative ci-
tation indexers. We show that our anno-
tation scheme for citation function is re-
liable, and present a supervised machine
learning framework to automatically clas-
sify citation function, using both shallow
and linguistically-inspired features. We
find, amongst other things, a strong re-
lationship between citation function and
sentiment classification.
