In this paper we classify the temporal relations
between pairs of events on an article-wide ba-
sis. This is in contrast to much of the exist-
ing literature which focuses on just event pairs
which are found within the same or adjacent
sentences. To achieve this, we leverage on dis-
course analysis as we believe that it provides
more useful semantic information than typical
lexico-syntactic features. We propose the use
of several discourse analysis frameworks, in-
cluding 1) Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST),
2) PDTB-styled discourse relations, and 3)
topical text segmentation. We explain how
features derived from these frameworks can be
effectively used with support vector machines
(SVM) paired with convolution kernels. Ex-
periments show that our proposal is effective
in improving on the state-of-the-art signifi-
cantly by as much as 16% in terms of F1, even
if we only adopt less-than-perfect automatic
discourse analyzers and parsers. Making use
of more accurate discourse analysis can fur-
ther boost gains to 35%.
