 
The paper describes a data driven dependency 
parsing approach which uses clausal informa-
tion of a sentence to improve the parser per-
formance. The clausal information is added 
automatically during the parsing process. We 
demonstrate the experiments on Hindi, a lan-
guage with relatively rich case marking sys-
tem and free-word-order. All the experiments 
are done using a modified version of 
MSTParser. We did all the experiments on the 
ICON 2009 parsing contest data. We achieved 
an improvement of 0.87% and 0.77% in unla-
beled attachment and labeled attachment accu-
racies respectively over the baseline parsing 
accuracies.
