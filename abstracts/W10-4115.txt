 
Relation extraction is a fundamental 
task in information extraction that 
identifies the semantic relationships 
between two entities in the text. In this 
paper, a novel model based on Deep 
Belief Network (DBN) is first 
presented to detect and classify the 
relations among Chinese entities. The 
experiments conducted on the 
Automatic Content Extraction (ACE) 
2004 dataset demonstrate that the 
proposed approach is effective in 
handling high dimensional feature 
space including character N-grams, 
entity types and the position 
information. It outperforms the state-
of-the-art learning models such as 
SVM or BP neutral network.
