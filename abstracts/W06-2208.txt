Most works on relation extraction assume
considerable human effort for making an
annotated corpus or for knowledge engi-
neering. Generic patterns employed in
KnowItAll achieve unsupervised, high-
precision extraction, but often result in low
recall. This paper compares two boot-
strapping methods to expand recall that
start with automatically extracted seeds
by KnowItAll. The first method is string
pattern learning, which learns string con-
texts adjacent to a seed tuple. The second
method learns less restrictive patterns that
include bags of words and relation-specific
named entity tags. Both methods improve
the recall of the generic pattern method. In
particular, the less restrictive pattern learn-
ing method can achieve a 250% increase
in recall at 0.87 precision, compared to the
generic pattern method.
