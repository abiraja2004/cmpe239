Despite an increasing amount of research
on biomedical named entity recognition,
there has been not enough work done on
disease mention recognition. Difficulty of
obtaining adequate corpora is one of the
key reasons which hindered this particu-
lar research. Previous studies argue that
correct identification of disease mentions
is the key issue for further improvement
of the disease-centric knowledge extrac-
tion tasks. In this paper, we present a ma-
chine learning based approach that uses
a feature set tailored for disease mention
recognition and outperforms the state-of-
the-art results. The paper also discusses
why a feature set for the well studied
gene/protein mention recognition task is
not necessarily equally effective for other
biomedical semantic types such as dis-
eases.
