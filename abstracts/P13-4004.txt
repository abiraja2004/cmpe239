This paper presents AnnoMarket, an open
cloud-based platform which enables re-
searchers to deploy, share, and use lan-
guage processing components and re-
sources, following the data-as-a-service
and software-as-a-service paradigms. The
focus is on multilingual text analysis re-
sources and services, based on an open-
source infrastructure and compliant with
relevant NLP standards. We demonstrate
how the AnnoMarket platform can be used
to develop NLP applications with little
or no programming, to index the results
for enhanced browsing and search, and
to evaluate performance. Utilising Anno-
Market is straightforward, since cloud in-
frastructural issues are dealt with by the
platform, completely transparently to the
user: load balancing, efficient data upload
and storage, deployment on the virtual ma-
chines, security, and fault tolerance.
