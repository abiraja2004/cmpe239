Information-oriented document labeling is a
special document multi-labeling task where
the target labels refer to a specific information
instead of the topic of the whole document.
These kind of tasks are usually solved by look-
ing up indicator phrases and analyzing their
local context to filter false positive matches.
Here, we introduce an approach for machine
learning local content shifters which detects
irrelevant local contexts using just the origi-
nal document-level training labels. We handle
content shifters in general, instead of learn-
ing a particular language phenomenon detec-
tor (e.g. negation or hedging) and form a sin-
gle system for document labeling and content
shift detection. Our empirical results achieved
24% error reduction ? compared to supervised
baseline methods ? on three document label-
ing tasks.
