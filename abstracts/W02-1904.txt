 
This paper presents an approach to FAQ 
mining via a list detection algorithm. List 
detection is very important for data 
collection since list has been widely used for 
representing data and information on the 
Web. By analyzing the rendering of FAQs 
on the Web, we found a fact that all FAQs 
are always fully/partially represented in a 
list-like form. There are two ways to author 
a list on the Web. One is to use some 
specific tags, e.g. <li> tag for HTML. The 
lists authored in this way can be easily 
detected by parsing those special tags. 
Another way uses other tags instead of the 
special tags. Unfortunately, many lists are 
authored in the second way. To detect lists, 
therefore, we present an algorithm, which is 
independent of Web languages. By 
combining the algorithm with some domain 
knowledge, we detect and collect FAQs 
from the Web. The mining task achieved a 
performance of 72.54% recall and 80.16% 
precision rates.
