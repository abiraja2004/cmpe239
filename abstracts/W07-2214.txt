This paper identifies two orthogonal dimen-
sions of context sensitivity, the first being
context sensitivity in concurrency and the
second being structural context sensitivity.
We present an example from natural lan-
guage which seems to require both types of
context sensitivity, and introduce partially
ordered multisets (pomsets) mcfgs as a for-
malism which succintly expresses both.
