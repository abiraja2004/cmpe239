We tackle the previously unaddressed
problem of unsupervised determination of
the optimal morphological segmentation
for statistical machine translation (SMT)
and propose a segmentation metric that
takes into account both sides of the SMT
training corpus. We formulate the objec-
tive function as the posterior probability of
the training corpus according to a genera-
tive segmentation-translation model. We
describe how the IBM Model-1 transla-
tion likelihood can be computed incremen-
tally between adjacent segmentation states
for efficient computation. Submerging the
proposed segmentation method in a SMT
task from morphologically-rich Turkish to
English does not exhibit the expected im-
provement in translation BLEU scores and
confirms the robustness of phrase-based
SMT to translation unit combinatorics.
A positive outcome of this work is the
described modification to the sequential
search algorithm of Morfessor (Creutz and
Lagus, 2007) that enables arbitrary-fold
parallelization of the computation, which
unexpectedly improves the translation per-
formance as measured by BLEU.
