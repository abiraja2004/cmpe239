We explore the use of morphological anal-
ysis as preprocessing for protein name
tagging. Our method finds protein names
by chunking based on a morpheme, the
smallest unit determined by the morpho-
logical analysis. This helps to recognize
the exact boundaries of protein names.
Moreover, our morphological analyzer
can deal with compounds. This offers
a simple way to adapt name descriptions
from biomedical resources for language
processing. Using GENIA corpus 3.01,
our method attains f-score of 70 points for
protein molecule names, and 75 points for
protein names including molecules, fami-
lies and domains.
