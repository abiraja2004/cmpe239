 
Applied discourse analysis is a hot topic in In- 
formation Retrieval (IR) and the related field 
of Information Extraction (IE). Although in- 
teresting observations about discourse can be 
made "by hand," applications require large 
quantities of data about language - -  data 
which is rather uninteresting. This paper in- 
vestigates u ing statistical analysis over a body 
of text to suggest new rules for recognizing 
named entities.
