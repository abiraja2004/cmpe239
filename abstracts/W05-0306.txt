We investigated of the characteristics of
in-text causal relations. We designed
causal relation tags. With our designed
tag set, three annotators annotated 750
Japanese newspaper articles. Then, using
the annotated corpus, we investigated the
causal relation instances from some view-
points. Our quantitative study shows that
what amount of causal relation instances
are present, where these relation instances
are present, and which types of linguistic
expressions are used for expressing these
relation instances in text.
