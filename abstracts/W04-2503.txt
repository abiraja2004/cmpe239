In this paper we discuss the applicability of the
knowledge representation and reasoning lan-
guage AnsProlog for the design and implemen-
tation of query answering systems. We con-
sider a motivating example, and illustrate how
AnsProlog can be used to represent defaults,
causal relations, and other types of common-
sense knowledge needed to properly answer
non-trivial questions about the example?s do-
main.
