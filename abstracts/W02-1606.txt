  
This paper presents a method to resolve 
word sense ambiguity in a 
Korean-to-Japanese machine translation 
system using neural networks. The 
execution of our neural network model is 
based on the concept codes of a thesaurus. 
Most previous word sense disambiguation 
approaches based on neural networks have 
limitations due to their huge feature set size. 
By contrast, we reduce the number of 
features of the network to a practical size by 
using concept codes as features rather than 
the lexical words themselves.
