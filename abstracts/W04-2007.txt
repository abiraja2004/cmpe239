The UNL project (Universal Networking Lan-
guage) proposes a standard for encoding the
meaning of natural language utterances as se-
mantic hypergraphs, intended to be used as
pivot in multilingual information and commu-
nication systems. Several deconverters permit
to automatically translate UNL utterances into
natural languages. However, a rough enconver-
tion from natural language texts to UNL expres-
sions is usually done interactively with editors
specially designed for the UNL project or by
hand (which is very time-consuming and diffi-
cult to extrapolate to huge amounts of data).
In this paper, we address the issue of using an
existing incremental robust parser as main re-
source to enconverting French utterances into
UNL expressions.
