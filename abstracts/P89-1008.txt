 
Conversationally relevant descriptions are definite 
descriptions that are not merely tools for the iden- 
tification of a referent, but are also crucial to the dis- 
course in other respects. I analyze the uses of such 
descriptions in assertions as conveying a particular 
~ype of conversational implicatures. Such implics- 
tures can be represented within the framework of 
possible world semantics. The analysis is extended 
to non-assertive illocutionary acts on the one hand, 
and to indefinite descriptions on the other.
