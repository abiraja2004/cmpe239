In this paper we present results from two pi-
lot studies which show that using the Amazon
Mechanical Turk for preposition error anno-
tation is as effective as using trained raters,
but at a fraction of the time and cost. Based
on these results, we propose a new evaluation
method which makes it feasible to compare
two error detection systems tested on different
learner data sets.
