 
Name origin recognition is to identify the 
source language of a personal or location 
name.  Some early work used either rule-
based or statistical methods with single 
knowledge source. In this paper, we cast the 
name origin recognition as a multi-class 
classification problem and approach the 
problem using Maximum Entropy method. 
In doing so, we investigate the use of differ-
ent features, including phonetic rules, n-
gram statistics and character position infor-
mation for name origin recognition. Ex-
periments on a publicly available personal 
name database show that the proposed ap-
proach achieves an overall accuracy of 
98.44% for names written in English and 
98.10% for names written in Chinese, which 
are significantly and consistently better than 
those in reported work.
