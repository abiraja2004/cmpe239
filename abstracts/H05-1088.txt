We present Evita, an application for rec-
ognizing events in natural language texts.
Although developed as part of a suite of
tools aimed at providing question answer-
ing systems with information about both
temporal and intensional relations among
events, it can be used independently as
an event extraction tool. It is unique in
that it is not limited to any pre-established
list of relation types (events), nor is it re-
stricted to a specific domain. Evita per-
forms the identification and tagging of
event expressions based on fairly simple
strategies, informed by both linguistic-
and statistically-based data. It achieves a
performance ratio of 80.12% F-measure.1
