 
This paper addresses the issue of 
designing embodied conversational 
agents that exhibit appropriate posture 
shifts during dialogues with human 
users.  Previous research has noted the 
importance of hand gestures, eye gaze 
and head nods in conversations 
between embodied agents and humans. 
We present an analysis of human 
monologues and dialogues that 
suggests that postural shifts can be 
predicted as a function of discourse 
state in monologues, and discourse and 
conversation state in dialogues. On the 
basis of these findings, we have 
implemented an embodied 
conversational agent that uses 
Collagen in such a way as to generate 
postural shifts.
