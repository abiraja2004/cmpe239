We address Question Answering (QA) for biograph-
ical questions, i.e., questions asking for biographi-
cal facts about persons. The domain of biographical
documents differs from other restricted domains in
that the available collections of biographies are in-
herently incomplete: a major challenge is to answer
questions about persons for whom biographical in-
formation is not present in biography collections.
We present BioGrapher, a biographical QA system
that addresses this problem by machine learning al-
gorithms for biography classification. BioGrapher
first attempts to answer a question by searching in
a given collection of biographies, using techniques
tailored for the restricted nature of the domain. If
a biography is not found, BioGrapher attempts to
find an answer on the web: it retrieves documents
using a web search engine, filters these using the bi-
ography classifier, and then extracts answers from
documents classified as biographies. Our empirical
results show that biographical classification, prior to
answer extraction, improves the results.
