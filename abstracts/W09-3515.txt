This paper describes our system for
?NEWS 2009 Machine Transliteration
Shared Task? (NEWS 2009). We only par-
ticipated in the standard run, which is a
direct orthographical mapping (DOP) be-
tween two languages without using any
intermediate phonemic mapping. We
propose a new two-step conditional ran-
dom field (CRF) model for DOP machine
transliteration, in which the first CRF seg-
ments a source word into chunks and the
second CRF maps the chunks to a word
in the target language. The two-step CRF
model obtains a slightly lower top-1 ac-
curacy when compared to a state-of-the-
art n-gram joint source-channel model.
The combination of the CRF model with
the joint source-channel leads to improve-
ments in all the tasks. The official re-
sult of our system in the NEWS 2009
shared task confirms the effectiveness of
our system; where we achieved 0.627 top-
1 accuracy for Japanese transliterated to
Japanese Kanji(JJ), 0.713 for English-to-
Chinese(E2C) and 0.510 for English-to-
Japanese Katakana(E2J) .
