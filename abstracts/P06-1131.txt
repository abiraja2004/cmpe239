This paper presents an approach to incrementally
generating locative expressions. It addresses the is-
sue of combinatorial explosion inherent in the con-
struction of relational context models by: (a) con-
textually defining the set of objects in the context
that may function as a landmark, and (b) sequenc-
ing the order in which spatial relations are consid-
ered using a cognitively motivated hierarchy of re-
lations, and visual and discourse salience.
