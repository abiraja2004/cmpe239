In this paper, we examine the idea of
technology-assisted co-construction, where
the communication partner of an AAC user
can make guesses about the intended mes-
sages, which are included in the user?s word
completion/prediction interface. We run some
human trials to simulate this new interface
concept, with subjects predicting words as the
user?s intended message is being generated in
real time with specified typing speeds. Re-
sults indicate that people can provide substan-
tial keystroke savings by providing word com-
pletion or prediction, but that the savings are
not as high as n-gram language models. In-
terestingly, the language model and human
predictions are complementary in certain key
ways ? humans doing a better job in some
circumstances on contextually salient nouns.
We discuss implications of the enhanced co-
construction interface for real-time message
generation in AAC direct selection devices.
