We explore the presence of indicators of
psychological distress in the linguistic be-
havior of subjects in a corpus of semi-
structured virtual human interviews. At
the level of aggregate dialogue-level fea-
tures, we identify several significant dif-
ferences between subjects with depres-
sion and PTSD when compared to non-
distressed subjects. At a more fine-grained
level, we show that significant differences
can also be found among features that
represent subject behavior during specific
moments in the dialogues. Finally, we
present statistical classification results that
suggest the potential for automatic assess-
ment of psychological distress in individ-
ual interactions with a virtual human dia-
logue system.
