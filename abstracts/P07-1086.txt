In this paper we present methods for im-
proving the disambiguation of noun phrase
(NP) coordination within the framework of a
lexicalised history-based parsing model. As
well as reducing noise in the data, we look at
modelling two main sources of information
for disambiguation: symmetry in conjunct
structure, and the dependency between con-
junct lexical heads. Our changes to the base-
line model result in an increase in NP coor-
dination dependency f-score from 69.9% to
73.8%, which represents a relative reduction
in f-score error of 13%.
