Hierarchical faceted metadata is a proven
and popular approach to organizing infor-
mation for navigation of information col-
lections. More recently, digital libraries
have begun to adopt faceted navigation for
collections of scholarly holdings. A key
impediment to further adoption is the need
for the creation of subject-oriented faceted
metadata. The Castanet alorithm was de-
veloped for the purpose of (semi) auto-
mated creation of such structures. This pa-
per describes the application of Castanet to
journal title content, and presents an eval-
uation suggesting its efficacy. This is fol-
lowed by a discussion of areas for future
work.
