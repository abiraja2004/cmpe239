Hierarchical Models increase the re-
ordering capabilities of MT systems
by introducing non-terminal symbols to
phrases that map source language (SL)
words/phrases to the correct position
in the target language (TL) translation.
Building translations via discontiguous
TL phrases increases the difficulty of lan-
guage modeling, however, introducing the
need for heuristic techniques such as cube
pruning (Chiang, 2005), for example.
An additional possibility to aid language
modeling in hierarchical systems is to use
a language model that models fluency of
words not using their local context in the
string, as in traditional language models,
but instead using the deeper context of
a word. In this paper, we explore the
potential of deep syntax language mod-
els providing an interesting comparison
with the traditional string-based language
model. We include an experimental evalu-
ation that compares the two kinds of mod-
els independently of any MT system to in-
vestigate the possible potential of integrat-
ing a deep syntax language model into Hi-
erarchical SMT systems.
