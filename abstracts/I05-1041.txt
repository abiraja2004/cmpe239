. This paper proposes an approach to improve statistical word align-
ment with ensemble methods. Two ensemble methods are investigated: bagging 
and cross-validation committees. On these two methods, both weighted voting 
and unweighted voting are compared under the word alignment task. In addi-
tion, we analyze the effect of different sizes of training sets on the bagging 
method. Experimental results indicate that both bagging and cross-validation 
committees improve the word alignment results regardless of weighted voting 
or unweighted voting. Weighted voting performs consistently better than un-
weighted voting on different sizes of training sets.
