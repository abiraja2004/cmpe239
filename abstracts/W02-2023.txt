The regularity of named entities is used to learn
names and to extract named entities. Having only
a few name elements and a set of patterns the al-
gorithm learns new names and its elements. A
verification step assures quality using a large
background corpus. Further improvement is
reached through classifying the newly learnt
elements on character level. Moreover, unsuper-
vised rule learning is discussed.
