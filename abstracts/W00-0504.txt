 
We describe a system which supports 
English text queries searching for 
Mandarin Chinese spoken documents. 
This is one of the first attempts to tightly 
couple speech recognition with machine 
translation technologies for cross-media 
and cross-language retrieval. The 
Mandarin Chinese news audio are indexed 
with word and subword units by speech 
recognition. Translation of these multi- 
scale units can effect cross-language 
information retrieval. The integrated 
technologies will be evaluated based on 
the performance of translingnal speech 
retrieval.
