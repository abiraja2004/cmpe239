In this paper we compare three approaches to
adverbial positioning using lexical, syntactic,
semantic and sentence-level features. We find
that: (a), one- and two-stage classification-
based approaches can achieve almost 86% ac-
curacy in determining the absolute position of
adverbials; (b) a classifier trained with only
syntactic features gives performance close to
that of a classifier trained with all features; and
(c) a surface realizer incorporating a two-stage
classifier for adverbial positioning as the sec-
ond stage gives improvements of at least 10%
in simple string accuracy over a baseline real-
izer for sentences containing adverbials.
