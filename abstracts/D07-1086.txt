Query segmentation is the process of tak-
ing a user?s search-engine query and di-
viding the tokens into individual phrases
or semantic units. Identification of these
query segments can potentially improve
both document-retrieval precision, by first
returning pages which contain the exact
query segments, and document-retrieval re-
call, by allowing query expansion or substi-
tution via the segmented units. We train and
evaluate a machine-learned query segmenta-
tion system that achieves 86% segmentation-
decision accuracy on a gold standard set of
segmented noun phrase queries, well above
recently published approaches. Key en-
ablers of this high performance are features
derived from previous natural language pro-
cessing work in noun compound bracketing.
For example, token association features be-
yond simple N-gram counts provide power-
ful indicators of segmentation.
