 
We have carried out a series of coverage 
evaluations of diverse types of parsers us-
ing texts from several genres such as news-
paper, religious, legal and biomedical texts. 
We compared the overall coverage of the 
evaluated parsers and analyzed the differ-
ences by text genre. The results indicate 
that the coverage typically drops several 
percentage points when parsers are faced 
with texts on genres other than newspapers.
