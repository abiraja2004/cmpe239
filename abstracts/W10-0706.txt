Mechanical Turk is useful for generating
complex speech resources like conversational
speech transcription. In this work, we ex-
plore the next step of eliciting narrations of
Wikipedia articles to improve accessibility for
low-literacy users. This task proves a use-
ful test-bed to implement qualitative vetting
of workers based on difficult to define metrics
like narrative quality. Working with the Me-
chanical Turk API, we collected sample nar-
rations, had other Turkers rate these samples
and then granted access to full narration HITs
depending on aggregate quality. While narrat-
ing full articles proved too onerous a task to
be viable, using other Turkers to perform vet-
ting was very successful. Elicitation is possi-
ble on Mechanical Turk, but it should conform
to suggested best practices of simple tasks that
can be completed in a streamlined workflow.
