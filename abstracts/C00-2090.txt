 
We propose a dynamic programming 
algorithm for calculaing the similarity 
between two segmeuts of words of the same 
language. The similarity is considered as a 
vector whose coordinates refer to the levels 
of analysis of the segments. This algorithm 
is extremely efficient for retrieving the best 
example in Translation Memory systems. 
The calculus being constructive, it also gives 
the correspondences between the words of 
the two segments. This allows the extension 
of Translation Memory systems towards 
Example-based Machiue Translation.
