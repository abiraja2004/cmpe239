The design of practical language applica-
tions by means of statistical approaches
requires annotated data, which is one of
the most critical constraint. This is par-
ticularly true for Spoken Dialog Systems
since considerably domain-specific con-
ceptual annotation is needed to obtain ac-
curate Language Understanding models.
Since data annotation is usually costly,
methods to reduce the amount of data are
needed. In this paper, we show that bet-
ter feature representations serve the above
purpose and that structure kernels pro-
vide the needed improved representation.
Given the relatively high computational
cost of kernel methods, we apply them to
just re-rank the list of hypotheses provided
by a fast generative model. Experiments
with Support Vector Machines and differ-
ent kernels on two different dialog cor-
pora show that our re-ranking models can
achieve better results than state-of-the-art
approaches when small data is available.
