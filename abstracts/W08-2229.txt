Temporal expressions that refer to a part of a calendar area in terms of
common calendar divisions are studied. Our claim is that such a ?cal-
endar expression" (CE) can be described by a succession of operators
operating on a calendar base (CB). These operators are categorized: a
pointing operator that transform a CB into a CE; a focalizing/shifting op-
erator that reduces or shifts the CE into another CE, and finally a zoning
operator that provides the wanted CE from this last CE. Relying on these
operators, a set of annotations is presented which are used to automat-
ically annotate biographic texts. A software application, plugged in the
platformNavitext, is described that builds a calendar view of a biographic
text.
