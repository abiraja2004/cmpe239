We present the first ever results show-
ing that tuning a machine translation sys-
tem against a semantic frame based ob-
jective function, MEANT, produces more
robustly adequate translations than tun-
ing against BLEU or TER as measured
across commonly used metrics and human
subjective evaluation. Moreover, for in-
formal web forum data, human evalua-
tors preferredMEANT-tuned systems over
BLEU- or TER-tuned systems by a sig-
nificantly wider margin than that for for-
mal newswire?even though automatic se-
mantic parsing might be expected to fare
worse on informal language. We argue
that by preserving themeaning of the trans-
lations as captured by semantic frames
right in the training process, an MT sys-
tem is constrained to make more accu-
rate choices of both lexical and reorder-
ing rules. As a result, MT systems tuned
against semantic frame based MT evalu-
ation metrics produce output that is more
adequate. Tuning a machine translation
system against a semantic frame based ob-
jective function is independent of the trans-
lation model paradigm, so, any transla-
tion model can benefit from the semantic
knowledge incorporated to improve trans-
lation adequacy through our approach.
