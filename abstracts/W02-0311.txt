Information Extraction (IE), defined as
the activity to extract structured knowl-
edge from unstructured text sources, of-
fers new opportunities for the exploitation
of biological information contained in the
vast amounts of scientific literature. But
while IE technology has received increas-
ing attention in the area of molecular bi-
ology, there have not been many exam-
ples of IE systems successfully deployed
in end-user applications. We describe
the development of PASTAWeb, a WWW-
based interface to the extraction output of
PASTA, an IE system that extracts protein
structure information from MEDLINE ab-
stracts. Key characteristics of PASTAWeb
are the seamless integration of the PASTA
extraction results (templates) with WWW-
based technology, the dynamic generation
of WWW content from ?static? data and
the fusion of information extracted from
multiple documents.
