In this paper we present a multiclassifier
approach for multilabel document classifi-
cation problems, where a set of k-NN clas-
sifiers is used to predict the category of
text documents based on different training
subsampling databases. These databases
are obtained from the original training
database by random subsampling. In or-
der to combine the predictions generated
by the multiclassifier, Bayesian voting is
applied. Through all the classification pro-
cess, a reduced dimension vector represen-
tation obtained by Singular Value Decom-
position (SVD) is used for training and
testing documents. The good results of our
experiments give an indication of the po-
tentiality of the proposed approach.
