Several grammars have been proposed
for modeling RNA pseudoknotted struc-
ture. In this paper, we focus on multiple
context-free grammars (MCFGs), which
are natural extension of context-free gram-
mars and can represent pseudoknots, and
extend a specific subclass of MCFGs to
a probabilistic model called SMCFG. We
present a polynomial time parsing algo-
rithm for finding the most probable deriva-
tion tree and a probability parameter esti-
mation algorithm. Furthermore, we show
some experimental results of pseudoknot
prediction using SMCFG algorithm.
