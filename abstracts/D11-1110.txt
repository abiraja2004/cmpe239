We propose a relaxed correspondence as-
sumption for cross-lingual projection of con-
stituent syntax, which allows a supposed
constituent of the target sentence to corre-
spond to an unrestricted treelet in the source
parse. Such a relaxed assumption fundamen-
tally tolerates the syntactic non-isomorphism
between languages, and enables us to learn
the target-language-specific syntactic idiosyn-
crasy rather than a strained grammar di-
rectly projected from the source language syn-
tax. Based on this assumption, a novel con-
stituency projection method is also proposed
in order to induce a projected constituent tree-
bank from the source-parsed bilingual cor-
pus. Experiments show that, the parser trained
on the projected treebank dramatically out-
performs previous projected and unsupervised
parsers.
