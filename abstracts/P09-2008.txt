Most NLP applications work under the as-
sumption that a user input is error-free;
thus, word segmentation (WS) for written
languages that use word boundary mark-
ers (WBMs), such as spaces, has been re-
garded as a trivial issue. However, noisy
real-world texts, such as blogs, e-mails,
and SMS, may contain spacing errors that
require correction before further process-
ing may take place. For the Korean lan-
guage, many researchers have adopted a
traditional WS approach, which eliminates
all spaces in the user input and re-inserts
proper word boundaries. Unfortunately,
such an approach often exacerbates the
word spacing quality for user input, which
has few or no spacing errors; such is the
case, because a perfect WS model does
not exist. In this paper, we propose a
novel WS method that takes into consider-
ation the initial word spacing information
of the user input. Our method generates
a better output than the original user in-
put, even if the user input has few spacing
errors. Moreover, the proposed method
significantly outperforms a state-of-the-art
Korean WS model when the user input ini-
tially contains less than 10% spacing er-
rors, and performs comparably for cases
containing more spacing errors. We be-
lieve that the proposed method will be a
very practical pre-processing module.
