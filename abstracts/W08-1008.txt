The ACL 2008 Workshop on Parsing German
features a shared task on parsing German. The
goal of the shared task was to find reasons
for the radically different behavior of parsers
on the different treebanks and between con-
stituent and dependency representations. In
this paper, we describe the task and the data
sets. In addition, we provide an overview of
the test results and a first analysis.
