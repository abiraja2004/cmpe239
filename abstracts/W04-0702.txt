By combining information extraction and re-
cord linkage techniques, we have created a re-
pository of references to attorneys, judges, and 
expert witnesses across a broad range of text 
sources.  These text sources include news, 
caselaw, law reviews, Medline abstracts, and 
legal briefs among others. We briefly describe 
our cross document co-reference resolution al-
gorithm and discuss applications these re-
solved references enable. Among these 
applications is one that shows summaries of 
relationships chains between individuals based 
on their document co-occurrence and cross 
document co-references.
