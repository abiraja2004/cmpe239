 
For natural language understanding systems designed for domains including relatively 
complex equipment, it is not sufficient o use general knowledge about his equipment. 
We show problems which can be solved only if the system has access to a detailed 
equipment model. We discuss features of such models, in particular, their ability to 
simulate the equipment's behavior. As an illustration, we describe a simulation model 
for an air compressor. Finally, we demonstrate how to find referents in ~is model for 
nominal compounds.
