In this paper, a supervised learning system of
word sense disambiguation is presented. It is
based on conditional maximum entropy models.
This system acquires the linguistic knowledge
from an annotated corpus and this knowledge
is represented in the form of features. Several
types of features have been analyzed using the
SENSEVAL-2 data for the Spanish lexical sam-
ple task. Such analysis shows that instead of
training with the same kind of information for
all words, each one is more eectively learned
using a dierent set of features. This best-
feature-selection is used to build some systems
based on dierent maximum entropy classiers,
and a voting system helped by a knowledge-
based method.
