This paper introduces a novel unsupervised
approach to semantic role induction that uses
a generative Bayesian model. To the best of
our knowledge, it is the first model that jointly
clusters syntactic verbs arguments into seman-
tic roles, and also creates verbs classes ac-
cording to the syntactic frames accepted by
the verbs. The model is evaluated on French
and English, outperforming, in both cases, a
strong baseline. On English, it achieves re-
sults comparable to state-of-the-art unsuper-
vised approaches to semantic role induction.
