Knowledge of the anaphoricity of a noun phrase
might be profitably exploited by a coreference sys-
tem to bypass the resolution of non-anaphoric noun
phrases. Perhaps surprisingly, recent attempts to
incorporate automatically acquired anaphoricity in-
formation into coreference systems, however, have
led to the degradation in resolution performance.
This paper examines several key issues in com-
puting and using anaphoricity information to im-
prove learning-based coreference systems. In par-
ticular, we present a new corpus-based approach to
anaphoricity determination. Experiments on three
standard coreference data sets demonstrate the ef-
fectiveness of our approach.
