We report on our experience with building a
statistical MT system from scratch, includ-
ing the creation of a small parallel Tamil-
English corpus, and the results of a task-
based pilot evaluation of statistical MT sys-
tems trained on sets of ca. 1300 and ca.
5000 parallel sentences of Tamil and English
data. Our results show that even with appar-
ently incomprehensible system output, hu-
mans without any knowledge of Tamil can
achieve performance rates as high as 86%
accuracy for topic identification, 93% recall
for document retrieval, and 64% recall on
question answering (plus an additional 14%
partially correct answers).
