We point out several problems in scaling-
up statistical approaches to spoken dia-
logue systems to enable them to deal with
complex but natural user goals, such as
disjunctive and negated goals and prefer-
ences. In particular, we explore restric-
tions imposed by current independence as-
sumptions in POMDP dialogue models.
This position paper proposes the use of
Automatic Belief Compression methods to
remedy these problems.
