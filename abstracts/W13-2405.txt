Frequently asked questions (FAQ) are an
efficient way of communicating domain-
specific information to the users. Unlike
general purpose retrieval engines, FAQ re-
trieval engines have to address the lexi-
cal gap between the query and the usu-
ally short answer. In this paper we de-
scribe the design and evaluation of a FAQ
retrieval engine for Croatian. We frame
the task as a binary classification prob-
lem, and train a model to classify each
FAQ as either relevant or not relevant for
a given query. We use a variety of se-
mantic textual similarity features, includ-
ing term overlap and vector space features.
We train and evaluate on a FAQ test col-
lection built specifically for this purpose.
Our best-performing model reaches 0.47
of mean reciprocal rank, i.e., on average
ranks the relevant answer among the top
two returned answers.
