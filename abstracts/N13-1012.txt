Humans identify word boundaries in continu-
ous speech by combining multiple cues; exist-
ing state-of-the-art models, though, look at a
single cue. We extend the generative model of
Goldwater et al(2006) to segment using sylla-
ble stress as well as phonemic form. Our new
model treats identification of word boundaries
and prevalent stress patterns in the language as
a joint inference task. We show that this model
improves segmentation accuracy over purely
segmental input representations, and recov-
ers the dominant stress pattern of the data.
Additionally, our model retains high perfor-
mance even without single-word utterances.
We also demonstrate a discrepancy in the per-
formance of our model and human infants on
an artificial-language task in which stress cues
and transition-probability information are pit-
ted against one another. We argue that this dis-
crepancy indicates a bound on rationality in
the mechanisms of human segmentation.
