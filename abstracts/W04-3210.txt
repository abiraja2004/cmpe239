In this paper we investigate whether paragraphs can
be identified automatically in different languages
and domains. We propose a machine learning ap-
proach which exploits textual and discourse cues
and we assess how well humans perform on this
task. Our best models achieve an accuracy that is
significantly higher than the best baseline and, for
most data sets, comes to within 6% of human per-
formance.
