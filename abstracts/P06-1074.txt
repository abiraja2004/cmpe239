 
General information retrieval systems are 
designed to serve all users without con-
sidering individual needs. In this paper, 
we propose a novel approach to person-
alized search. It can, in a unified way, 
exploit and utilize implicit feedback in-
formation, such as query logs and imme-
diately viewed documents. Moreover, our 
approach can implement result re-ranking 
and query expansion simultaneously and 
collaboratively. Based on this approach, 
we develop a client-side personalized web 
search agent PAIR (Personalized Assis-
tant for Information Retrieval), which 
supports both English and Chinese. Our 
experiments on TREC and HTRDP col-
lections clearly show that the new ap-
proach is both effective and efficient.
