We present two web-based, interactive tools
for creating and visualizing sub-sentential
alignments of parallel text. Yawat is a tool
to support distributed, manual word- and
phrase-alignment of parallel text through an
intuitive, web-based interface. Kwipc is an
interface for displaying words or bilingual
word pairs in parallel, word-aligned context.
A key element of the tools presented here
is the interactive visualization: alignment
information is shown only for one pair of
aligned words or phrases at a time. This
allows users to explore the alignment space
interactively without being overwhelmed by
the amount of information available.
