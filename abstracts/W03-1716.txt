 
The Semantic Knowledge-base of Con-
temporary Chinese (SKCC) is a large 
scale Chinese semantic resource devel-
oped by the Institute of Computational 
Linguistics of Peking University. It pro-
vides a large amount of semantic informa-
tion such as semantic hierarchy and 
collocation features for 66,539 Chinese 
words and their English counterparts. Its 
POS and semantic classification represent 
the latest progress in Chinese linguistics 
and language engineering. The descrip-
tions of semantic attributes are fairly 
thorough, comprehensive and authorita-
tive. The paper introduces the outline of 
SKCC, and indicates that it is effective for 
word sense disambiguation in MT appli-
cations and is likely to be important for 
general Chinese language processing.
