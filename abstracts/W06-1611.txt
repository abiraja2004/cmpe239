 
In this paper we study the utility of dis-
course structure for spoken dialogue per-
formance modeling. We experiment with 
various ways of exploiting the discourse 
structure: in isolation, as context infor-
mation for other factors (correctness and 
certainty) and through trajectories in the 
discourse structure hierarchy. Our corre-
lation and PARADISE results show that, 
while the discourse structure is not useful 
in isolation, using the discourse structure 
as context information for other factors 
or via trajectories produces highly predic-
tive parameters for performance analysis.
