. One of issues in the bootstrapping for named entity recogni-
tion is how to control annotation errors introduced at every iteration. In
this paper, we present several heuristics for reducing such errors using
external resources such as WordNet, encyclopedia and Web documents.
The bootstrapping is applied for identifying and classifying fine-grained
geographic named entities, which are useful for applications such as in-
formation extraction and question answering, as well as standard named
entities such as PERSON and ORGANIZATION. The experiments show
the usefulness of the suggested heuristics and the learning curve evalu-
ated at each bootstrapping loop. When our approach was applied to a
newspaper corpus, it could achieve 87 F1 value, which is quite promising
for the fine-grained named entity recognition task.
