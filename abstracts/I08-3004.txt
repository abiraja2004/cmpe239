In the context of the IJCNLP workshop
on Natural Language Processing (NLP) for
Less Privileged Languages, we discuss the
obstacles to research on such languages.
We also briefly discuss the ways to make
progress in removing these obstacles. We
mention some previous work and comment
on the papers selected for the workshop.
