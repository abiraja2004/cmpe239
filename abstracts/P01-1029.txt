This paper proposes a description of
German word order including phe-
nomena considered as complex,
such as scrambling, (partial) VP
fronting and verbal pied piping. Our
description relates a syntactic de-
pendency structure directly to a
topological hierarchy without re-
sorting to movement or similar
mechanisms.1
