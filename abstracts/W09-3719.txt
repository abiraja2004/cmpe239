Using the RST annotated corpus [Carlson et al, 2003], we use sim-
ple statistics on the distribution of discourse markers or cue phrases
as evidence of the three-way distinction of Contrast relations, Con-
trast, Antithesis and Concession, recognized in standard Rhetor-
ical Structure Theory (RST, Mann and Thompson 1987). We also
show that however, an intuitive marker of Contrast, is not actually
used statistically significantly more often in Contrast relations than in
Cause-Effect relations. These results highlight the need for empirically
based discourse marker identification rather than the intuitive method
that is the current norm.
