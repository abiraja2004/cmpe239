 
Summarization evaluation has been always a chal-
lenge to researchers in the document summariza-
tion field. Usually, human involvement is 
necessary to evaluate the quality of a summary. 
Here we present a new method for automatic  
evaluation of text summaries by using document 
graphs. Data from Document Understanding Con-
ference 2002 (DUC-2002) has been used in the 
experiment. We propose measuring the similarity 
between two summaries or between a summary 
and a document based on the concepts/entities and 
relations between them in the text.
