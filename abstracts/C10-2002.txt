The use of semantic information to im-
prove IR is a long-standing goal. This pa-
per presents a novel Document Expansion
method based on a WordNet-based system
to find related concepts and words. Ex-
pansion words are indexed separately, and
when combined with the regular index,
they improve the results in three datasets
over a state-of-the-art IR engine. Consid-
ering that many IR systems are not robust
in the sense that they need careful fine-
tuning and optimization of their parame-
ters, we explored some parameter settings.
The results show that our method is spe-
cially effective for realistic, non-optimal
settings, adding robustness to the IR en-
gine. We also explored the effect of doc-
ument length, and show that our method
is specially successful with shorter docu-
ments.
