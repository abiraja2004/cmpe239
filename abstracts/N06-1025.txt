In this paper we present an extension of
a machine learning based coreference res-
olution system which uses features in-
duced from different semantic knowledge
sources. These features represent knowl-
edge mined from WordNet and Wikipedia,
as well as information about semantic role
labels. We show that semantic features in-
deed improve the performance on differ-
ent referring expression types such as pro-
nouns and common nouns.
