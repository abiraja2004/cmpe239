We present a constituent parsing-based
reordering technique that improves the
performance of the state-of-the-art Eng-
lish-to-Japanese phrase translation sys-
tem that includes distortion models by
4.76 BLEU points. The phrase transla-
tion model with reordering applied at the
pre-processing stage outperforms a syn-
tax-based translation system that incor-
porates a phrase translation model, a hi-
erarchical phrase-based translation
model and a tree-to-string grammar. We
also show that combining constituent re-
ordering and  the syntax model improves
the translation quality by additional  0.84
BLEU points.
