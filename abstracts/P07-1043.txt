We translate sentence generation from TAG
grammars with semantic and pragmatic in-
formation into a planning problem by encod-
ing the contribution of each word declara-
tively and explicitly. This allows us to ex-
ploit the performance of off-the-shelf plan-
ners. It also opens up new perspectives on
referring expression generation and the rela-
tionship between language and action.
