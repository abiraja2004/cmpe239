The quality of annotated data is crucial for
supervised learning. To eliminate errors in
single annotated data, a second round of an-
notation is often used. However, is it abso-
lutely necessary to double annotate every ex-
ample? We show that it is possible to reduce
the amount of the second round of annotation
by more than half without sacrificing the per-
formance.
