This work discusses translation results for
the four Euparl data sets which were made
available for the shared task ?Exploit-
ing Parallel Texts for Statistical Machine
Translation?. All results presented were
generated by using a statistical machine
translation system which implements a
log-linear combination of feature func-
tions along with a bilingual n-gram trans-
lation model.
