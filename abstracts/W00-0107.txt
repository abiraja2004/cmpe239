 
This paper will describe a way to organize the salient 
objects, their attributes, and relationships between 
the objects in a given domain. This organization 
allows us to assign an information value to each col- 
lection, and to the domain as a whole, which cor- 
responds to the number of things to "talk about" 
in the domain. This number gives a measure of se- 
mantic complexity; that is, it will correspond to the 
number of objects, attributes, and relationships in 
the domain, but not to the level of syntactic diver- 
sity allowed when conveying these meanings. 
Defining a measure of semantic omplexity for a 
dialog system domain will give an insight towards 
making a complexity measurement standard. With 
such a standard, natural anguage programmers can 
measure the feasibility of making a natural lan- 
guage interface, compare different language proces- 
sors' ability to handle more and more complex do- 
mains, and quantify the abilities of the current state 
of the art in natural anguage processors.
