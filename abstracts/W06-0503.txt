One of the challenging tasks in the con-
text of the Semantic Web is to automati-
cally extract instances of binary relations
from Web documents ? for example all
pairs of a person and the corresponding
birthdate. In this paper, we present LEILA,
a system that can extract instances of ar-
bitrary given binary relations from natu-
ral language Web documents ? without
human interaction. Different from previ-
ous approaches, LEILA uses a deep syn-
tactic analysis. This results in consistent
improvements over comparable systems
(such as e.g. Snowball or TextToOnto).
