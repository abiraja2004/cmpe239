U-Compare is a UIMA-based workflow
construction platform for building natu-
ral language processing (NLP) applica-
tions from heterogeneous language re-
sources (LRs), without the need for pro-
gramming skills. U-Compare has been
adopted within the context of the META-
NET Network of Excellence, and over
40 LRs that process 15 European lan-
guages have been added to the U-Compare
component library. In line with META-
NET?s aims of increasing communication
between citizens of different European
countries, U-Compare has been extended
to facilitate the development of a wider
range of applications, including both mul-
tilingual and multimodal workflows. The
enhancements exploit the UIMA Subject
of Analysis (Sofa) mechanism, that allows
different facets of the input data to be rep-
resented. We demonstrate how our cus-
tomised extensions to U-Compare allow
the construction and testing of NLP appli-
cations that transform the input data in dif-
ferent ways, e.g., machine translation, au-
tomatic summarisation and text-to-speech.
