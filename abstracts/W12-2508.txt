We present a method of authorship attribution
and stylometry that exploits hierarchical infor-
mation in phrase-structures. Contrary to much
previous work in stylometry, we focus on con-
tent words rather than function words. Texts
are parsed to obtain phrase-structures, and com-
pared with texts to be analyzed. An efficient
tree kernel method identifies common tree frag-
ments among data of known authors and un-
known texts. These fragments are then used to
identify authors and characterize their styles.
Our experiments show that the structural infor-
mation from fragments provides complemen-
tary information to the baseline trigram model.
