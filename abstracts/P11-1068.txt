We develop a general dynamic programming
technique for the tabulation of transition-based
dependency parsers, and apply it to obtain
novel, polynomial-time algorithms for parsing
with the arc-standard and arc-eager models. We
also show how to reverse our technique to ob-
tain new transition-based dependency parsers
from existing tabular methods. Additionally,
we provide a detailed discussion of the con-
ditions under which the feature models com-
monly used in transition-based parsing can be
integrated into our algorithms.
