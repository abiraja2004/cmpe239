The appropriateness of paraphrases for words de-
pends often on context: ?grab? can replace ?catch?
in ?catch a ball?, but not in ?catch a cold?. Struc-
tured Vector Space (SVS) (Erk and Pad?, 2008) is
a model that computes word meaning in context
in order to assess the appropriateness of such para-
phrases. This paper investigates ?best-practice? pa-
rameter settings for SVS, and it presents a method to
obtain large datasets for paraphrase assessment from
corpora with WSD annotation.
