We present our entries for the SemEval-
2013 cross-language word-sense disambigua-
tion task (Lefever and Hoste, 2013). We
submitted three systems based on classifiers
trained on local context features, with some
elaborations. Our three systems, in increasing
order of complexity, were: maximum entropy
classifiers trained to predict the desired target-
language phrase using only monolingual fea-
tures (we called this system L1); similar clas-
sifiers, but with the desired target-language
phrase for the other four languages as features
(L2); and lastly, networks of five classifiers,
over which we do loopy belief propagation to
solve the classification tasks jointly (MRF).
