The Manually Annotated Sub-Corpus
(MASC) project provides data and annota-
tions to serve as the base for a community-
wide annotation effort of a subset of the
American National Corpus. The MASC
infrastructure enables the incorporation of
contributed annotations into a single, us-
able format that can then be analyzed as
it is or ported to any of a variety of other
formats. MASC includes data from a
much wider variety of genres than exist-
ing multiply-annotated corpora of English,
and the project is committed to a fully
open model of distribution, without re-
striction, for all data and annotations pro-
duced or contributed. As such, MASC
is the first large-scale, open, community-
based effort to create much needed lan-
guage resources for NLP. This paper de-
scribes the MASC project, its corpus and
annotations, and serves as a call for con-
tributions of data and annotations from the
language processing community.
