This paper describes the system that was sub-
mitted in the *SEM 2013 Semantic Textual
Similarity shared task. The task aims to find
the similarity score between a pair of sen-
tences. We describe a Universal Network-
ing Language (UNL) based semantic extrac-
tion system for measuring the semantic simi-
larity. Our approach combines syntactic and
word level similarity measures along with the
UNL based semantic similarity measures for
finding similarity scores between sentences.
