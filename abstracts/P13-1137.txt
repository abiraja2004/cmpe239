Abstract
We address the challenge of generating natu-
ral language abstractive summaries for spoken
meetings in a domain-independent fashion.
We apply Multiple-Sequence Alignment to in-
duce abstract generation templates that can be
used for different domains. An Overgenerate-
and-Rank strategy is utilized to produce and
rank candidate abstracts. Experiments us-
ing in-domain and out-of-domain training on
disparate corpora show that our system uni-
formly outperforms state-of-the-art supervised
extract-based approaches. In addition, human
judges rate our system summaries significantly
higher than compared systems in fluency and
overall quality.
