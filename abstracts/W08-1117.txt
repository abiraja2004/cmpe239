A dialogue system can present itself and/or
address the user as an active agent by means
of linguistic constructions in personal style, or
suppress agentivity by using impersonal style.
We describe how we generate and control per-
sonal and impersonal style variation in the out-
put of SAMMIE, a multimodal in-car dialogue
system for an MP3 player. We carried out an
experiment to compare subjective evaluation
judgments and input style alignment behavior
of users interacting with versions of the sys-
tem generating output in personal vs. imper-
sonal style. Although our results are consis-
tent with earlier findings obtained with simu-
lated systems, the effects are weaker.
