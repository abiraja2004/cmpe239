When only a small amount of manually anno-
tated data is available, application of a boot-
strapping method is often considered to com-
pensate for the lack of sufcient training ma-
terial for a machine-learning method. The
paper reports a series of experimental results
of bootstrapping for protein name recogni-
tion. The results show that the performance
changes signicantly according to the choice
of text collection where the training samples
to bootstrap, and that an improvement can be
obtained only with a well chosen text collec-
tion.
