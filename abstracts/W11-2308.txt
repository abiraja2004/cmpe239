In this paper, we propose a new approach to
readability assessment with a specific view to
the task of text simplification: the intended
audience includes people with low literacy
skills and/or with mild cognitive impairment.
READ?IT represents the first advanced read-
ability assessment tool for what concerns Ital-
ian, which combines traditional raw text fea-
tures with lexical, morpho-syntactic and syn-
tactic information. In READ?IT readability
assessment is carried out with respect to both
documents and sentences where the latter rep-
resents an important novelty of the proposed
approach creating the prerequisites for align-
ing the readability assessment step with the
text simplification process. READ?IT shows
a high accuracy in the document classification
task and promising results in the sentence clas-
sification scenario.
