 
We present a class-based approach to building a 
verb lexicon that makes explicit the close asso- 
ciation between syntax and semantics for Levin 
classes. We have used Lexicalized Tree Adjoin- 
ing Grammars to capture the syntax associated with 
each verb class and have augmented the trees to in- 
clude selectional restrictions. In addition, semantic 
predicates are associated with each tree, which al- 
low for a colnpositional interpretation.
