In this paper, we investigate the practical
applicability of Co-Training for the task
of building a classifier for reference reso-
lution. We are concerned with the ques-
tion if Co-Training can significantly re-
duce the amount of manual labeling work
and still produce a classifier with an ac-
ceptable performance.
