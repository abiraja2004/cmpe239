We present an implemented model of story
understanding and apply it to the understand-
ing of a children?s story. We argue that un-
derstanding a story consists of building multi-
representation models of the story and that
story models are efficiently constructed using
a satisfiability solver. We present a computer
program that contains multiple representations
of commonsense knowledge, takes a narrative
as input, transforms the narrative and represen-
tations of commonsense knowledge into a sat-
isfiability problem, runs a satisfiability solver,
and produces models of the story as output.
The narrative, models, and representations are
expressed in the language of Shanahan?s event
calculus.
