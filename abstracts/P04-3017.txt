For biomedical information extraction, most sys-
tems use syntactic patterns on verbs (anchor verbs)
and their arguments. Anchor verbs can be se-
lected by focusing on their arguments. We propose
to use predicate-argument structures (PASs), which
are outputs of a full parser, to obtain verbs and their
arguments. In this paper, we evaluated PAS method
by comparing it to a method using part of speech
(POSs) pattern matching. POS patterns produced
larger results with incorrect arguments, and the re-
sults will cause adverse effects on a phase selecting
appropriate verbs.
