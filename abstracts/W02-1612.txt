The rapid growth of Internet Technology,
especially user friendliness approach, helps
increase the number of Internet users and the
amount of information in the cyberspace.
There is a countless amount of information in
languages. This has spread developments of
MT systems. The focus of our approach is to
increase the reusability of those MT systems
by using Cross System machine translation.
Using natural language as an intermediate
language, such as English, will help us use the
information in Internet qualitatively. In this
paper, we point out some problems that may
cause the efficiency to decrease when a
sentence is translated from a second language
to a third language. A novel method is
proposed to solve this problem.
