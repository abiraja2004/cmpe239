In this paper we describe the Institute for
Logic, Language and Computation (Uni-
versity of Amsterdam) phrase-based statisti-
cal machine translation system for English-
to-German translation proposed within the
EMNLP-WMT 2011 shared task. The main
novelty of the submitted system is a syntax-
driven pre-translation reordering algorithm
implemented as source string permutation via
transfer of the source-side syntax tree.
