Most statistical parsers have used the gram-
mar induction approach, in which a stochastic
grammar is induced from a treebank. An alter-
native approach is to induce a controller for a
given parsing automaton. Such controllers may
be stochastic; here, we focus on greedy con-
trollers, which result in deterministic parsers.
We use decision trees to learn the controllers.
The resulting parsers are surprisingly accurate
and robust, considering their speed and simplic-
ity. They are almost as fast as current part-of-
speech taggers, and considerably more accurate
than a basic unlexicalized PCFG parser. We
also describe Markov parsing models, a general
framework for parser modeling and control, of
which the parsers reported here are a special
case.
