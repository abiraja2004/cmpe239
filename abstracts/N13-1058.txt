 
This paper examines the efficacy of the appli-
cation of a pre-existing technique in the area 
of event-event temporal relationship identifi-
cation. We attempt to both reproduce the re-
sults of said technique, as well as extend the 
previous work with application to a newly-
created domain of biographical data. We find 
that initially the simpler feature sets perform 
as expected, but that the final improvement to 
the feature set underperforms. In response, we 
provide an analysis of the individual features 
and identify differences existing between two 
corpora.
