We evaluate semantic relatedness mea-
sures on different German datasets show-
ing that their performance depends on: (i)
the definition of relatedness that was un-
derlying the construction of the evalua-
tion dataset, and (ii) the knowledge source
used for computing semantic relatedness.
We analyze how the underlying knowl-
edge source influences the performance
of a measure. Finally, we investigate the
combination of wordnets andWikipedia to
improve the performance of semantic re-
latedness measures.
