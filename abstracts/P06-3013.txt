 
We present the implementation of a system 
which extracts not only lexicalized gram-
mars but also feature-based lexicalized 
grammars from Korean Sejong Treebank. 
We report on some practical experiments 
where we extract TAG grammars and tree 
schemata. Above all, full-scale syntactic 
tags and well-formed morphological analy-
sis in Sejong Treebank allow us to extract 
syntactic features. In addition, we modify 
Treebank for extracting lexicalized gram-
mars and convert lexicalized grammars into 
tree schemata to resolve limited lexical 
coverage problem of extracted lexicalized 
grammars.
