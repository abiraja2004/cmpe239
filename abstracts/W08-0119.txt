This paper investigates the claim that a di-
alogue manager modelled as a Partially Ob-
servable Markov Decision Process (POMDP)
can achieve improved robustness to noise
compared to conventional state-based dia-
logue managers. Using the Hidden Infor-
mation State (HIS) POMDP dialogue man-
ager as an exemplar, and an MDP-based dia-
logue manager as a baseline, evaluation results
are presented for both simulated and real dia-
logues in a Tourist Information Domain. The
results on the simulated data show that the
inherent ability to model uncertainty, allows
the POMDP model to exploit alternative hy-
potheses from the speech understanding sys-
tem. The results obtained from a user trial
show that the HIS system with a trained policy
performed significantly better than the MDP
baseline.
