 
This paper describes a heuristic approach to 
automatically identifying which senses of a machine- 
readable dictionary (MRD) headword are 
semantically related versus those which correspond 
to fundamentally different senses of the word. The 
inclusion of this information in a lexical database 
profoundly alters the nature of sense disambiguation: 
the appropriate "sense" of a polysemous word may 
now correspond to some set  of  related senses. Our 
technique offers benefits both for on-line semantic 
processing and for the challenging task of mapping 
word senses across multiple MRDs in creating a 
merged lexical database.
