 
     This article describes the construction 
of a morphological, syntactic and semantic 
analyzer to operate a high-grade search 
engine for Hebrew texts. A good search 
engine must be complete  and accurate. In 
Hebrew or Arabic script most of the 
vowels are not written, many particles are 
attached to the word without space, a 
double consonant is written with one 
letter, and some letters signify both vowels 
and consonants. Thus, almost every string 
of characters may designate many words 
(the average in Hebrew is almost three 
words). As a consequence, deciphering a 
word necessitates reading the whole 
sentence. Our model is Fillmore?s 
framework of an expression with a verb as 
its center. The engine eliminates readings 
of words unsuited to the syntax or the 
semantic structure of the sentence. In 
every verbal entry of our conceptual 
dictionary the features of the noun phrases 
(NP?s)  required by the verb are included. 
When all the correct readings of all the 
strings of characters in the sentence have 
been identified, the program chooses the 
proper occurrences of the searched word 
in the text. Approximately 95% of the 
results by our search engine match those 
in the query.
