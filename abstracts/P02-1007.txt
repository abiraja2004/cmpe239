In Optimality-Theoretic Syntax, optimiza-
tion with unrestricted expressive power on
the side of the OT constraints is unde-
cidable. This paper provides a proof for
the decidability of optimization based on
constraints expressed with reference to lo-
cal subtrees (which is in the spirit of OT
theory). The proof builds on Kaplan and
Wedekind?s (2000) construction showing
that LFG generation produces context-
free languages.
