In this article, we present a simple and ef-
fective approach for extracting bilingual lex-
icon from comparable corpora enhanced with
parallel corpora. We make use of structural
characteristics of the documents comprising
the comparable corpus to extract parallel sen-
tences with a high degree of quality. We then
use state-of-the-art techniques to build a spe-
cialized bilingual lexicon from these sentences
and evaluate the contribution of this lexicon
when added to the comparable corpus-based
alignment technique. Finally, the value of this
approach is demonstrated by the improvement
of translation accuracy for medical words.
