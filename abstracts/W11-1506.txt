 
In this paper, we report on how historical 
events are extracted from text within the Se-
mantics of History research project. The project 
aims at the creation of resources for a historical 
information retrieval system that can handle the 
time-based dynamics and varying perspectives 
of Dutch historical archives. The historical 
event extraction module will be used for mu-
seum collections, allowing users to search for 
exhibits related to particular historical events or 
actors within time periods and geographic 
areas, extracted from accompanying text. We 
present here the methodology and tools used for 
the purpose of historical event extraction along-
side with the first evaluation results.
