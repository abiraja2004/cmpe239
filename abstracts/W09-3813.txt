 We present an efficient approach for dis-course parsing within and across sen-tences, where the unit of processing is an entire document, and not a single sen-tence.  We apply shift-reduce algorithms for dependency and constituent parsing to determine syntactic dependencies for the sentences in a document, and subse-quently a Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) tree for the entire document.  Our results show that our linear-time shift-reduce framework achieves high accu-racy and a large improvement in effi-ciency compared to a state-of-the-art ap-proach based on chart parsing with dy-namic programming.  1
