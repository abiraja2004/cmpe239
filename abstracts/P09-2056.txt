The Columbia Arabic Treebank (CATiB)
is a database of syntactic analyses of Ara-
bic sentences. CATiB contrasts with pre-
vious approaches to Arabic treebanking
in its emphasis on speed with some con-
straints on linguistic richness. Two ba-
sic ideas inspire the CATiB approach: no
annotation of redundant information and
using representations and terminology in-
spired by traditional Arabic syntax. We
describe CATiB?s representation and an-
notation procedure, and report on inter-
annotator agreement and speed.
