We describe DFKI?s statistical based submis-
sion to the 2012 WMT evaluation. The sub-
mission is based on the freely available ma-
chine translation toolkit Jane, which supports
phrase-based and hierarchical phrase-based
translation models. Different setups have been
tested and combined using a sentence selec-
tion method.
