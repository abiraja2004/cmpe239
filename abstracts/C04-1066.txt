We introduce a character-based chunking for un-
known word identification in Japanese text. A major
advantage of our method is an ability to detect low
frequency unknown words of unrestricted character
type patterns. The method is built upon SVM-based
chunking, by use of character n-gram and surround-
ing context of n-best word segmentation candidates
from statistical morphological analysis as features.
It is applied to newspapers and patent texts, achiev-
ing 95% precision and 55-70% recall for newspa-
pers and more than 85% precision for patent texts.
