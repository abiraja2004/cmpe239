We present a framework for word align-
ment based on log-linear models. All
knowledge sources are treated as feature
functions, which depend on the source
langauge sentence, the target language
sentence and possible additional vari-
ables. Log-linear models allow statis-
tical alignment models to be easily ex-
tended by incorporating syntactic infor-
mation. In this paper, we use IBM Model
3 alignment probabilities, POS correspon-
dence, and bilingual dictionary cover-
age as features. Our experiments show
that log-linear models significantly out-
perform IBM translation models.
