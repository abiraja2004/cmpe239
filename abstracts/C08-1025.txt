We present procedures which pool lexical
information estimated from unlabeled data
via the Inside-Outside algorithm, with lex-
ical information from a treebank PCFG.
The procedures produce substantial im-
provements (up to 31.6% error reduction)
on the task of determining subcategoriza-
tion frames of novel verbs, relative to a
smoothed Penn Treebank-trained PCFG.
Even with relatively small quantities of
unlabeled training data, the re-estimated
models show promising improvements in
labeled bracketing f-scores on Wall Street
Journal parsing, and substantial benefit
in acquiring the subcategorization prefer-
ences of low-frequency verbs.
