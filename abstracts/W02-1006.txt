In this paper, we evaluate a vari-
ety of knowledge sources and super-
vised learning algorithms for word sense
disambiguation on SENSEVAL-2 and
SENSEVAL-1 data. Our knowledge
sources include the part-of-speech of
neighboring words, single words in the
surrounding context, local collocations,
and syntactic relations. The learning al-
gorithms evaluated include Support Vec-
tor Machines (SVM), Naive Bayes, Ad-
aBoost, and decision tree algorithms. We
present empirical results showing the rela-
tive contribution of the component knowl-
edge sources and the different learning
algorithms. In particular, using all of
these knowledge sources and SVM (i.e.,
a single learning algorithm) achieves ac-
curacy higher than the best official scores
on both SENSEVAL-2 and SENSEVAL-1
test data.
