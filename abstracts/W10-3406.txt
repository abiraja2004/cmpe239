To test our approach, we first build conceptual classes using syntactic and semantic information provided by a cor-pus. The concepts can be the input of a dictionary. Our web-mining approach deals with a cognitive process which simulates human reasoning based on the enumeration principle. The experiments reveal the interest of our approach by adding new relevant terms to existing conceptual classes.
