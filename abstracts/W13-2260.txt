We present a method for inference in hi-
erarchical phrase-based translation, where
both optimisation and sampling are per-
formed in a common exact inference
framework related to adaptive rejection
sampling. We also present a first imple-
mentation of that method along with ex-
perimental results shedding light on some
fundamental issues. In hierarchical transla-
tion, inference needs to be performed over
a high-complexity distribution defined by
the intersection of a translation hypergraph
and a target language model. We replace
this intractable distribution by a sequence
of tractable upper-bounds for which exact
optimisers and samplers are easy to obtain.
Our experiments show that exact inference
is then feasible using only a fraction of the
time and space that would be required by
the full intersection, without recourse to
pruning techniques that only provide ap-
proximate solutions. While the current im-
plementation is limited in the size of inputs
it can handle in reasonable time, our exper-
iments provide insights towards obtaining
future speedups, while staying in the same
general framework.
