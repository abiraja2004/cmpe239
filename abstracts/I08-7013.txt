 
Research in Parts-of-Speech (POS) tagset 
design for European and East Asian lan-
guages started with a mere listing of impor-
tant morphosyntactic features in one lan-
guage and has matured in later years to-
wards hierarchical tagsets, decomposable 
tags, common framework for multiple lan-
guages (EAGLES) etc. Several tagsets 
have been developed in these languages 
along with large amount of annotated data 
for furthering research. Indian Languages 
(ILs) present a contrasting picture with 
very little research in tagset design issues. 
We present our work in designing a com-
mon POS-tagset framework for ILs, which 
is the result of in-depth analysis of eight 
languages from two major families, viz. 
Indo-Aryan and Dravidian. Our framework 
follows hierarchical tagset layout similar to 
the EAGLES guidelines, but with signifi-
cant changes as needed for the ILs.
