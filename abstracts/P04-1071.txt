We explore the descriptive power, in terms of syn-
tactic phenomena, of a formalism that extends Tree-
Adjoining Grammar (TAG) by adding a fourth level
of hierarchical decomposition to the three levels
TAG already employs. While extending the descrip-
tive power minimally, the additional level of decom-
position allows us to obtain a uniform account of a
range of phenomena that has heretofore been dif-
ficult to encompass, an account that employs uni-
tary elementary structures and eschews synchro-
nized derivation operations, and which is, in many
respects, closer to the spirit of the intuitions under-
lying TAG-based linguistic theory than previously
considered extensions to TAG.
