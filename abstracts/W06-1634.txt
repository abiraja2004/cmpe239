This paper presents a method of automat-
ically constructing information extraction
patterns on predicate-argument structures
(PASs) obtained by full parsing from a
smaller training corpus. Because PASs
represent generalized structures for syn-
tactical variants, patterns on PASs are ex-
pected to be more generalized than those
on surface words. In addition, patterns
are divided into components to improve
recall and we introduce a Support Vector
Machine to learn a prediction model using
pattern matching results. In this paper, we
present experimental results and analyze
them on how well protein-protein interac-
tions were extracted from MEDLINE ab-
stracts. The results demonstrated that our
method improved accuracy compared to a
machine learning approach using surface
word/part-of-speech patterns.
