Adequate confirmation for keywords is in-
dispensable in spoken dialogue systems
to eliminate misunderstandings caused by
speech recognition errors. Spoken lan-
guage also inherently includes out-of-
domain phrases and redundant expressions
such as disfluency, which do not contribute
to task achievement. It is necessary to
appropriately make confirmation for im-
portant portions. However, a set of key-
words necessary to achieve the tasks can-
not be predefined in retrieval for a large-
scale knowledge base unlike conventional
database query tasks. In this paper, we
describe two statistical measures for iden-
tifying portions to be confirmed. A rele-
vance score represents the matching degree
with the target knowledge base. A sig-
nificance score detects portions that conse-
quently affect the retrieval results. These
measures are defined based on information
that is automatically derived from the tar-
get knowledge base. An experimental eval-
uation shows that our method improved the
success rate of retrieval by generating con-
firmation more efficiently than using a con-
ventional confidence measure.
