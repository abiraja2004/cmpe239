 
Kamp's Discourse Representation Theory is a major 
breakthrough regarding the systematic translation 
of natural language discourse into logical form. We 
have therefore chosen to marry the User Specialty 
Languages System, which was originally designed as 
a natural language frontend to a relational database 
system, with this new theory. In the paper we try 
to show taking - for the sake of simplicity - Kemp's 
fragment of English how this is achieved. The re- 
search reported is going on in the context of the 
pro ject  Linguistics and Logic Based Legal Expert 
System under taken  joint ly by the IBM He ide lberg  
Scient i f ic  Center  and the Universit~it T i ib ingen.
