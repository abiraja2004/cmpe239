This paper presents a survey on the role of
negation in sentiment analysis. Negation
is a very common linguistic construction
that affects polarity and, therefore, needs
to be taken into consideration in sentiment
analysis.
We will present various computational ap-
proaches modeling negation in sentiment
analysis. We will, in particular, focus
on aspects, such as level of representation
used for sentiment analysis, negation word
detection and scope of negation. We will
also discuss limits and challenges of nega-
tion modeling on that task.
