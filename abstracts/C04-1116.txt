We present a text mining method for finding
synonymous expressions based on the distribu-
tional hypothesis in a set of coherent corpora.
This paper proposes a new methodology to im-
prove the accuracy of a term aggregation system
using each author?s text as a coherent corpus.
Our approach is based on the idea that one per-
son tends to use one expression for one mean-
ing. According to our assumption, most of the
words with similar context features in each au-
thor?s corpus tend not to be synonymous expres-
sions. Our proposedmethod improves the accu-
racy of our term aggregation system, showing
that our approach is successful.
