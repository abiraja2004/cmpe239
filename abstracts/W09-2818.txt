In this paper, we describe our contribution to
the Generation Challenge 2009 for the tasks of
generating Referring Expressions to the Main
Subject References (MSR) and Named Enti-
ties Generation (NEG). To generate the refer-
ring expressions, we employ the Conditional
Random Fields (CRF) learning technique due
to the fact that the selection of an expres-
sion depends on the selection of the previ-
ous references. CRFs fit very well to this
task since they are designed for the labeling
of sequences. For the MSR task, our system
has a String Accuracy of 0.68 and a REG08-
Type Accuracy of 0.76 and for the NEG task a
String Accuracy of 0.79 and REG08-Type Ac-
curacy of 0.83.
