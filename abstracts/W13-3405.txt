 
The Australian Computational and Linguistics 
Olympiad (OzCLO) started in 2008 in only 
two locations and has since grown to a na-
tionwide competition with almost 1500 high 
school students participating in 2013. An Aus-
tralian team has participated in the Interna-
tional Linguistics Olympiad (ILO) every year 
since 2009. This paper describes how the 
competition is run (with a regional First 
Round and a final National Round) and the or-
ganisation of the competition (a National 
Steering Committee and Local Organising 
Committees for each region) and discusses the 
particular challenges faced by Australia (tim-
ing of the competition and distance between 
the major population centres). One major fac-
tor in the growth and success of OzCLO has 
been the introduction of the online competi-
tion, allowing participation of students from 
rural and remote country areas. The organisa-
tion relies on the good-will and volunteer 
work of university and school staff but the 
strong interest among students and teachers 
shows that OzCLO is responding to a demand 
for linguistic challenges.
