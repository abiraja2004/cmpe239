Measuring the relative compositionality
of Multi-word Expressions (MWEs) is
crucial to Natural Language Processing.
Various collocation based measures have
been proposed to compute the relative
compositionality of MWEs. In this paper,
we define novel measures (both colloca-
tion based and context based measures) to
measure the relative compositionality of
MWEs of V-N type. We show that the
correlation of these features with the hu-
man ranking is much superior to the cor-
relation of the traditional features with the
human ranking. We then integrate the pro-
posed features and the traditional features
using a SVM based ranking function to
rank the collocations of V-N type based
on their relative compositionality. We
then show that the correlation between the
ranks computed by the SVM based rank-
ing function and human ranking is signif-
icantly better than the correlation between
ranking of individual features and human
ranking.
