 While a great effort has concerned the de-velopment of fully integrated modular un-derstanding systems, few researches have focused on the problem of unifying exist-ing linguistic formalisms with cognitive processing models. The Situated Construc-tional Interpretation Model is one of these attempts. In this model, the notion of ?con-struction? has been adapted in order to be able to mimic the behavior of Production Systems. The Construction Grammar ap-proach establishes a model of the relations between linguistic forms and meaning, by the mean of constructions. The latter can be considered as pairings from a topologically structured space to an unstructured space, in some way a special kind of production rules.
