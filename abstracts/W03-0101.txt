Here we present work on using spatial knowl-
edge in conjunction with information extrac-
tion (IE). Considerable volume of location data
was imported in a knowledge base (KB) with
entities of general importance used for seman-
tic annotation, indexing, and retrieval of text.
The Semantic Web knowledge representation
standards are used, namely RDF(S). An exten-
sive upper-level ontology with more than two
hundred classes is designed. With respect to the
locations, the goal was to include the most im-
portant categories considering public and tasks
not specially related to geography or related ar-
eas. The locations data is derived from num-
ber of publicly available resources and com-
bined to assure best performance for domain-
independent named-entity recognition in text.
An evaluation and comparison to high perfor-
mance IE application is given.
