A mixture of positive (friendly) and nega-
tive (antagonistic) relations exist among users
in most social media applications. However,
many such applications do not allow users to
explicitly express the polarity of their interac-
tions. As a result most research has either ig-
nored negative links or was limited to the few
domains where such relations are explicitly
expressed (e.g. Epinions trust/distrust). We
study text exchanged between users in online
communities. We find that the polarity of the
links between users can be predicted with high
accuracy given the text they exchange. This
allows us to build a signed network represen-
tation of discussions; where every edge has
a sign: positive to denote a friendly relation,
or negative to denote an antagonistic relation.
We also connect our analysis to social psy-
chology theories of balance. We show that the
automatically predicted networks are consis-
tent with those theories. Inspired by that, we
present a technique for identifying subgroups
in discussions by partitioning singed networks
representing them.
