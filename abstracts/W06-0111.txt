 
The BA-construction refers to a special 
grammatical structure in Mandarin 
Chinese. It is an extremely important 
syntactic structure in Chinese, which is 
frequently used in daily life. The study of 
the BA-construction has attracted the 
attention of almost all linguists who are 
interested in this language. Yet it is a 
quite complex and difficult linguistic 
phenomenon and it is hard to analyze it 
satisfactorily to cope with the syntactic 
structure(s) of another language which 
does not possess this kind of construction 
(e.g. in machine translation). This paper 
discusses a few methods on how some of 
the English imperative sentences are 
realized by the Chinese BA-construction 
which is mandatory in transferring 
certain source language (SL) information 
into target language (TL) in an 
experimental machine translation (MT) 
system.  We also introduce the basic 
syntactic structures of the BA-
construction and explain how we 
formalize and control these structures to 
satisfy our need. Some features related to 
the BA-construction, such as 
obligatoriness versus the optionality, the 
semantics as well as the properties of the 
elements preceding and following the BA 
are also discussed. Finally we suggest 
that by constraining the variations of the 
formalized patterns of the BA-
construction, a better MT could be 
reached.
