Machine Translation (MT) as well as
other bilingual applications strongly
rely on word alignment. Efficient align-
ment techniques have been proposed
but are mainly evaluated on pairs of
languages where the notion of word
is mostly clear. We concentrated our
effort on the English-Inuktitut word
alignment shared task and report on
two approaches we implemented and a
combination of both.
