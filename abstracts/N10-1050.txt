The class of Linear Inversion Transduction
Grammars (LITGs) is introduced, and used to
induce a word alignment over a parallel cor-
pus. We show that alignment via Stochas-
tic Bracketing LITGs is considerably faster
than Stochastic Bracketing ITGs, while still
yielding alignments superior to the widely-
used heuristic of intersecting bidirectional
IBM alignments. Performance is measured as
the translation quality of a phrase-based ma-
chine translation system built upon the word
alignments, and an improvement of 2.85 BLEU
points over baseline is noted for French?
English.
