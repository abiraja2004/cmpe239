Data driven POS tagging has achieved good
performance for English, but can still lag be-
hind linguistic rule based taggers for mor-
phologically complex languages, such as Ice-
landic. We extend a statistical tagger to han-
dle fine grained tagsets and improve over the
best Icelandic POS tagger. Additionally, we
develop a case tagger for non-local case and
gender decisions. An error analysis of our sys-
tem suggests future directions.
