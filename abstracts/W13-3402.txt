 
The paper is focused on self-contained linguis-
tic problems based on text corpora. We argue 
that corpus-based problems differ from tradi-
tional linguistic problems because they make it 
possible to represent language variation. Fur-
thermore, they often require basic statistical 
thinking from the students. The practical value 
of using data obtained from text corpora for 
teaching linguistics through linguistic prob-
lems is shown.
