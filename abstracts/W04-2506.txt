Modern Question/Answering systems rely on
expected answer types for processing ques-
tions. The answer type is a semantic cate-
gory provided by Named Entity recognizer or
by semantic hierarchies. We argue in this pa-
per that Q/A systems should take advantage
of the topic information by exploiting several
models of question and answer categorization.
The matching of the question category with the
answer category allows the system to filter out
many incorrect answers.
