 
We present results of our experiments 
with the application of machine learning 
on binary blog classification, i.e. deter-
mining whether a given web page is a 
blog page. We have gathered a corpus in 
excess of half a million blog or blog-like 
pages and pre-classified them using a 
simple baseline. We investigate which 
algorithms attain the best results for our 
classification problem and experiment 
with resampling techniques, with the aim 
of utilising our large dataset to improve 
upon our baseline. We show that the ap-
plication of off-the-shelf machine learn-
ing technology to perform binary blog 
classification offers substantial improve-
ment over our baseline. Further gains can 
sometimes be achieved using resampling 
techniques, but these improvements are 
relatively small compared to the initial 
gain.
