We present a method for utilizing unan-
notated sentences to improve a semantic
parser which maps natural language (NL)
sentences into their formal meaning rep-
resentations (MRs). Given NL sentences
annotated with their MRs, the initial su-
pervised semantic parser learns the map-
ping by training Support Vector Machine
(SVM) classifiers for every production in
the MR grammar. Our new method ap-
plies the learned semantic parser to the
unannotated sentences and collects unla-
beled examples which are then used to
retrain the classifiers using a variant of
transductive SVMs. Experimental results
show the improvements obtained over
the purely supervised parser, particularly
when the annotated training set is small.
