Many statistical translation models can be
regarded as weighted logical deduction.
Under this paradigm, we use weights from
the expectation semiring (Eisner, 2002), to
compute first-order statistics (e.g., the ex-
pected hypothesis length or feature counts)
over packed forests of translations (lat-
tices or hypergraphs). We then introduce
a novel second-order expectation semir-
ing, which computes second-order statis-
tics (e.g., the variance of the hypothe-
sis length or the gradient of entropy).
This second-order semiring is essential for
many interesting training paradigms such
as minimum risk, deterministic anneal-
ing, active learning, and semi-supervised
learning, where gradient descent optimiza-
tion requires computing the gradient of en-
tropy or risk. We use these semirings in an
open-source machine translation toolkit,
Joshua, enabling minimum-risk training
for a benefit of up to 1.0 BLEU point.
