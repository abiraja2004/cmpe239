This paper describes NomBank, a project that
will provide argument structure for instances of
common nouns in the Penn Treebank II corpus.
NomBank is part of a larger effort to add ad-
ditional layers of annotation to the Penn Tree-
bank II corpus. The University of Pennsylva-
nia?s PropBank, NomBank and other annota-
tion projects taken together should lead to the
creation of better tools for the automatic analy-
sis of text. This paper describes the NomBank
project in detail including its specifications and
the process involved in creating the resource.
