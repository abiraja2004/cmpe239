This paper describes the first system for
large-scale acquisition of subcategorization
frames (SCFs) from English corpus data
which can be used to acquire comprehen-
sive lexicons for verbs, nouns and adjectives.
The system incorporates an extensive rule-
based classifier which identifies 168 verbal,
37 adjectival and 31 nominal frames from
grammatical relations (GRs) output by a ro-
bust parser. The system achieves state-of-
the-art performance on all three sets.
