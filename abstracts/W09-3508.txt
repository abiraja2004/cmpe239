We use a Phrase-Based Statistical Ma-
chine Translation approach to Translitera-
tion where the words are replaced by char-
acters and sentences by words. We employ
the standard SMT tools like GIZA++ for
learning alignments and Moses for learn-
ing the phrase tables and decoding. Be-
sides tuning the standard SMT parame-
ters, we focus on tuning the Character Se-
quence Model (CSM) related parameters
like order of the CSM, weight assigned to
CSM during decoding and corpus used for
CSM estimation. Our results show that
paying sufficient attention to CSM pays
off in terms of increased transliteration ac-
curacies.
