 
Word segmentation is a process to divide a 
sentence into meaningful units called ?word 
unit? [ISO/DIS 24614-1]. What is a word 
unit is judged by principles for its internal in-
tegrity and external use constraints. A word 
unit?s internal structure is bound by prin-
ciples of lexical integrity, unpredictability 
and so on in order to represent one syntacti-
cally meaningful unit. Principles for external 
use include language economy and frequency 
such that word units could be registered in a 
lexicon or any other storage for practical re-
duction of processing complexity for the fur-
ther syntactic processing after word segmen-
tation. Such principles for word segmentation 
are applied for Chinese, Japanese and Korean, 
and impacts of the standard are discussed.
