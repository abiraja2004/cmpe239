Query expansion is an effective technique to
improve the performance of information re-
trieval systems. Although hand-crafted lexi-
cal resources, such as WordNet, could provide
more reliable related terms, previous stud-
ies showed that query expansion using only
WordNet leads to very limited performance
improvement. One of the main challenges is
how to assign appropriate weights to expanded
terms. In this paper, we re-examine this prob-
lem using recently proposed axiomatic ap-
proaches and find that, with appropriate term
weighting strategy, we are able to exploit
the information from lexical resources to sig-
nificantly improve the retrieval performance.
Our empirical results on six TREC collec-
tions show that query expansion using only
hand-crafted lexical resources leads to signif-
icant performance improvement. The perfor-
mance can be further improved if the proposed
method is combined with query expansion us-
ing co-occurrence-based resources.
