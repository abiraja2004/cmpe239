 
We describe on-going work in the devel-
opment of a cross-language question-
answering framework for the open do-
main. An overview of the framework is 
being provided, some details on the im-
portant concepts of a flexible framework 
are presented and two cross-cutting as-
pects (cross-linguality and credibility) for 
question-answering systems are up for 
discussion.
