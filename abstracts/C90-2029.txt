 
In a proposal, Vijay-Shanker and Joshi presented a definition for combining ttw two formalisms Tree 
Adjoining Grammars and PATR unification. The essential idea for that combination is the separation 
of the two recursion operations - adjoining and unification - to preserve all properties of both 
formalisms which is not desirable for natural anguage applications. In this paper, a definition for the 
integrated use of both processes i  given and the remaining properties of the resulting formalism are 
discussed - especially weighing the appropriateness ofthis d~finition for natural anguage processing.
