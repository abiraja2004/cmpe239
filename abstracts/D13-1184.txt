Wikification, commonly referred to as Disam-
biguation to Wikipedia (D2W), is the task of
identifying concepts and entities in text and
disambiguating them into the most specific
corresponding Wikipedia pages. Previous ap-
proaches to D2W focused on the use of lo-
cal and global statistics over the given text,
Wikipedia articles and its link structures, to
evaluate context compatibility among a list of
probable candidates. However, these meth-
ods fail (often, embarrassingly), when some
level of text understanding is needed to sup-
port Wikification. In this paper we introduce
a novel approach to Wikification by incorpo-
rating, along with statistical methods, richer
relational analysis of the text. We provide an
extensible, efficient and modular Integer Lin-
ear Programming (ILP) formulation of Wik-
ification that incorporates the entity-relation
inference problem, and show that the ability
to identify relations in text helps both candi-
date generation and ranking Wikipedia titles
considerably. Our results show significant im-
provements in both Wikification and the TAC
Entity Linking task.
