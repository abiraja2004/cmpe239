In this paper, we present a two-stage ap-
proach to acquire Japanese unknown mor-
phemes from text with full POS tags as-
signed to them. We first acquire unknown
morphemes only making a morphology-
level distinction, and then apply semantic
classification to acquired nouns. One ad-
vantage of this approach is that, at the sec-
ond stage, we can exploit syntactic clues
in addition to morphological ones because
as a result of the first stage acquisition, we
can rely on automatic parsing. Japanese
semantic classification poses an interest-
ing challenge: proper nouns need to be
distinguished from common nouns. It
is because Japanese has no orthographic
distinction between common and proper
nouns and no apparent morphosyntactic
distinction between them. We explore
lexico-syntactic clues that are extracted
from automatically parsed text and inves-
tigate their effects.
