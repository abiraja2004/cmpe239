Models of lexical semantics are core paradigms in most NLP applica-
tions, such as dialogue, information extraction and document understand-
ing. Unfortunately, the coverage of currently available resources (e.g.
FrameNet) is still unsatisfactory. This paper presents a largely applicable
approach for extending frame semantic resources, combining word sense
information derived fromWordNet and corpus-based distributional infor-
mation. We report a large scale evaluation over the English FrameNet,
and results on extending FrameNet to the Italian language, as the basis of
the development of a full FrameNet for Italian.
