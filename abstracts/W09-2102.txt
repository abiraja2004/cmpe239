 
Assessment of reading proficiency is typically 
done by asking subjects to read a text passage 
silently and then answer questions related to 
the text. An alternate approach, measuring 
reading-aloud proficiency, has been shown to 
correlate well with the aforementioned com-
mon method and is used as a paradigm in this 
paper.  
We describe a system that is able to automati-
cally score two types of children?s read speech 
samples (text passages and word lists), using 
automatic speech recognition and the target 
criterion ?correctly read words per minute?. 
Its performance is dependent on the data type 
(passages vs. word lists) as well as on the rela-
tive difficulty of passages or words for indi-
vidual readers. Pearson correlations with 
human assigned scores are around 0.86 for 
passages and around 0.80 for word lists.
