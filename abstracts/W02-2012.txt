This paper presents the ongoing project
Computational Models of First Language
Acquisition, together with its current
product, the learning algorithm GraSp.
GraSp is designed specifically for
inducing grammars from large, unlabelled
corpora of spontaneous (i.e. unscripted)
speech. The learning algorithm does not
assume a predefined grammatical
taxonomy; rather the determination of
categories and their relations is considered
as part of the learning task. While GraSp
learning can be used for a range of
practical tasks, the long-term goal of the
project is to contribute to the debate of
innate linguistic knowledge ? under the
hypothesis that there is no such.
