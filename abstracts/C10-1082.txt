This paper analyzes the contribution of se-
mantic roles to TimeML event recognition
and classification. For that purpose, an
approach using conditional random fields
with a variety of morphosyntactic features
plus semantic roles features is developed
and evaluated. Our system achieves an
F1 of 81.4% in recognition and a 64.2%
in classification. We demonstrate that the
application of semantic roles improves the
performance of the presented system, es-
pecially for nominal events.
