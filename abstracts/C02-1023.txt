In some contexts, well-formed natural language
cannot be expected as input to information or
communication systems. In these contexts, the
use of grammar-independent input (sequences of
uninflected semantic units like e.g. language-
independent icons) can be an answer to the users?
needs. However, this requires that an intelligent sys-
tem should be able to interpret this input with rea-
sonable accuracy and in reasonable time. Here we
propose a method allowing a purely semantic-based
analysis of sequences of semantic units. It uses
an algorithm inspired by the idea of ?chart pars-
ing? known in Natural Language Processing, which
stores intermediate parsing results in order to bring
the calculation time down.
