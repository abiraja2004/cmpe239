Previous research has shown that the mean-
ing of many noun-noun compounds N
1
N
2
can be approximated reasonably well by
paraphrasing clauses of the form ?N
2
that
. . . N
1
?, where ?. . . ? stands for a verb
with or without a preposition. For exam-
ple, malaria mosquito is a ?mosquito that
carries malaria?. Evaluating the quality of
such paraphrases is the theme of Task 9 at
SemEval-2010. This paper describes some
background, the task definition, the process
of data collection and the task results. We
also venture a few general conclusions be-
fore the participating teams present their
systems at the SemEval-2010 workshop.
There were 5 teams who submitted 7 sys-
tems.
