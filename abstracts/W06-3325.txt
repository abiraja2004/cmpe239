 
In modern biology, digitization of biosys-
tematics publications is an important task. 
Extraction of taxonomic names from such 
documents is one of its major issues. This 
is because these names identify the various 
genera and species. This article reports on 
our experiences with learning techniques 
for this particular task. We say why estab-
lished Named-Entity Recognition tech-
niques are somewhat difficult to use in our 
context. One reason is that we have only 
very little training data available. Our ex-
periments show that a combining approach 
that relies on regular expressions, heuris-
tics, and word-level language recognition 
achieves very high precision and recall and 
allows to cope with those difficulties.
