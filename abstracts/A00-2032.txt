 
Given the lack of word delimiters in written 
Japanese, word segmentation is generally consid- 
ered a crucial first step in processing Japanese texts. 
Typical Japanese segmentation algorithms rely ei-

data. In contrast, we introduce a novel statistical 
method utilizing unsegmented training data, with 
performance on kanji sequences comparable to and 
sometimes surpassing that of morphological nalyz- 
ers over a variety of error metrics.
