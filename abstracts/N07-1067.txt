This paper addresses the task of provid-
ing extended responses to questions re-
garding specialized topics. This task is an
amalgam of information retrieval, topical
summarization, and Information Extrac-
tion (IE). We present an approach which
draws on methods from each of these ar-
eas, and compare the effectiveness of this
approach with a query-focused summa-
rization approach. The two systems are
evaluated in the context of the prosecution
queries like those in the DARPA GALE
distillation evaluation.
