This paper concerns the discourse under-
standing process in spoken dialogue sys-
tems. This process enables the system to
understand user utterances based on the
context of a dialogue. Since multiple can-
didates for the understanding result can
be obtained for a user utterance due to
the ambiguity of speech understanding, it
is not appropriate to decide on a single
understanding result after each user ut-
terance. By holding multiple candidates
for understanding results and resolving the
ambiguity as the dialogue progresses, the
discourse understanding accuracy can be
improved. This paper proposes a method
for resolving this ambiguity based on sta-
tistical information obtained from dia-
logue corpora. Unlike conventional meth-
ods that use hand-crafted rules, the pro-
posed method enables easy design of the
discourse understanding process. Experi-
ment results have shown that a system that
exploits the proposed method performs
sufficiently and that holding multiple can-
didates for understanding results is effec-
tive.
