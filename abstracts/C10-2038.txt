Precision-oriented search results such as
those typically returned by the major
search engines are vulnerable to issues of
polysemy. When the same term refers to
different things, the dominant sense is pre-
ferred in the rankings of search results.
In this paper, we propose a novel tech-
nique in the context of web search that uti-
lizes contextual terms provided by users
for query disambiguation, making it pos-
sible to prefer other senses without alter-
ing the original query.
