In this paper we report an empirical study
on semi-supervised Chinese word segmenta-
tion using co-training. We utilize two seg-
menters: 1) a word-based segmenter lever-
aging a word-level language model, and 2)
a character-based segmenter using character-
level features within a CRF-based sequence
labeler. These two segmenters are initially
trained with a small amount of segmented
data, and then iteratively improve each other
using the large amount of unlabelled data.
Our experimental results show that co-training
captures 20% and 31% of the performance
improvement achieved by supervised training
with an order of magnitude more data for the
SIGHAN Bakeoff 2005 PKU and CU corpora
respectively.
