Within the information-theoretical frame-
work described by (Rissanen, 1989; de
Marcken, 1996; Goldsmith, 2001), point-
ers are used to avoid repetition of phono-
logical material. Work with which we
are familiar has assumed that there is only
one way in which items could be pointed
to. The purpose of this paper is to de-
scribe and compare several different meth-
ods, each of which satisfies MDL?s ba-
sic requirements, but which have different
consequences for the treatment of linguis-
tic phenomena. In particular, we assess
the conditions under which these different
ways of pointing yield more compact de-
scriptions of the data, both from a theoret-
ical and an empirical perspective.
