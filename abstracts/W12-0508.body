We present a joint system for named entity
recognition (NER) and entity linking (EL),
allowing for named entities mentions ex-
tracted from textual data to be matched to
uniquely identifiable entities. Our approach
relies on combined NER modules which
transfer the disambiguation step to the EL
component, where referential knowledge
about entities can be used to select a correct
entity reading. Hybridation is a main fea-
ture of our system, as we have performed
experiments combining two types of NER,
based respectively on symbolic and statis-
tical techniques. Furthermore, the statisti-
cal EL module relies on entity knowledge
acquired over a large news corpus using a
simple rule-base disambiguation tool. An
implementation of our system is described,
along with experiments and evaluation re-
sults on French news wires. Linking ac-
curacy reaches up to 87%, and the NER F-
score up to 83%.
