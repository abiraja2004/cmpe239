Content-based approaches to detecting
mobile spam to date have focused mainly
on analyzing the topical aspect of a SMS
message (what it is about) but not on the
stylistic aspect (how it is written). In this
paper, as a preliminary step, we investigate
the utility of commonly used stylistic fea-
tures based on shallow linguistic analysis
for learning mobile spam filters. Experi-
mental results show that the use of stylis-
tic information is potentially effective for
enhancing the performance of the mobile
spam filters.
