The average results obtained by unsupervised
statistical parsers have greatly improved in the
last few years, but on many specific sentences
they are of rather low quality. The output of
such parsers is becoming valuable for vari-
ous applications, and it is radically less expen-
sive to create than manually annotated training
data. Hence, automatic selection of high qual-
ity parses created by unsupervised parsers is
an important problem.
In this paper we present PUPA, a POS-based
Unsupervised Parse Assessment algorithm.
The algorithm assesses the quality of a parse
tree using POS sequence statistics collected
from a batch of parsed sentences. We eval-
uate the algorithm by using an unsupervised
POS tagger and an unsupervised parser, se-
lecting high quality parsed sentences from En-
glish (WSJ) and German (NEGRA) corpora.
We show that PUPA outperforms the leading
previous parse assessment algorithm for su-
pervised parsers, as well as a strong unsuper-
vised baseline. Consequently, PUPA allows
obtaining high quality parses without any hu-
man involvement.
