Evaluating systems that correct errors in
non-native writing is difficult because of
the possibility of multiple correct answers
and the variability in human agreement.
This paper seeks to improve the best prac-
tice of such evaluation by analyzing the
frequency of multiple correct answers and
identifying factors that influence agree-
ment levels in judging the usage of articles
and noun number.
