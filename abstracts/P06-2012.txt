This paper presents an unsupervised learn-
ing approach to disambiguate various rela-
tions between name entities by use of vari-
ous lexical and syntactic features from the
contexts. It works by calculating eigen-
vectors of an adjacency graph?s Laplacian
to recover a submanifold of data from a
high dimensionality space and then per-
forming cluster number estimation on the
eigenvectors. Experiment results on ACE
corpora show that this spectral cluster-
ing based approach outperforms the other
clustering methods.
