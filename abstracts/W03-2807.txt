 
An external lexicon quality measure 
called the L-measure is derived from the 
F-measure (Rijsbergen, 1979; Larsen and 
Aone, 1999). The typically small sample 
sizes available for minority languages and 
the evaluation of Semitic language lexi-
cons are two main factors considered. 
Large-scale evaluation results for the 
Maltilex Corpus are presented (Rosner et 
al., 1999).
