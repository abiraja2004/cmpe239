. This paper presents a definition question answering approach, which 
is capable of mining textual definitions from large collections of documents. In 
order to automatically identify definition sentences from a large collection of 
documents, we utilize the existing definitions in the Web knowledge bases in-
stead of hand-crafted rules or annotated corpus. Effective methods are adopted to 
make full use of Web knowledge bases, and they promise high quality response 
to definition questions. We applied our system in the TREC 2004 definition 
question-answering task and achieved an encouraging performance with the F-
measure score of 0.404, which was ranked second among all the submitted runs.
