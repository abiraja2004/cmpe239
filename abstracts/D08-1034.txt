 
In recent years, with the development of Chi-
nese semantically annotated corpus, such as 
Chinese Proposition Bank and Normalization 
Bank, the Chinese semantic role labeling 
(SRL) task has been boosted. Similar to Eng-
lish, the Chinese SRL can be divided into two 
tasks: semantic role identification (SRI) and 
classification (SRC). Many features were in-
troduced into these tasks and promising re-
sults were achieved. In this paper, we mainly 
focus on the second task: SRC. After exploit-
ing the linguistic discrepancy between num-
bered arguments and ARGMs, we built a se-
mantic role classifier based on a hierarchical 
feature selection strategy. Different from the 
previous SRC systems, we divided SRC into 
three sub tasks in sequence and trained models 
for each sub task. Under the hierarchical ar-
chitecture, each argument should first be de-
termined whether it is a numbered argument 
or an ARGM, and then be classified into fine-
gained categories. Finally, we integrated the 
idea of exploiting argument interdependence 
into our system and further improved the per-
formance. With the novel method, the classi-
fication precision of our system is 94.68%, 
which outperforms the strong baseline signifi-
cantly. It is also the state-of-the-art on Chi-
nese SRC.
