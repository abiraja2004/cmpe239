When aligning very different language pairs,
the most important needs are the use of struc-
tural information and the capability of gen-
erating one-to-many or many-to-many corre-
spondences. In this paper, we propose a
novel phrase alignment method which models
word or phrase dependency relations in depen-
dency tree structures of source and target lan-
guages. The dependency relation model is a
kind of tree-based reordering model, and can
handle non-local reorderings which sequen-
tial word-based models often cannot handle
properly. The model is also capable of esti-
mating phrase correspondences automatically
without any heuristic rules. Experimental re-
sults of alignment show that our model could
achieve F-measure 1.7 points higher than the
conventional word alignment model with sym-
metrization algorithms.
