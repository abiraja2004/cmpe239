In this work we investigate methods to en-
able the detection of a specific type of tex-
tual entailment (strict entailment), start-
ing from the preliminary assumption that
these relations are often clearly expressed
in texts. Our method is a statistical ap-
proach based on what we call textual en-
tailment patterns, prototypical sentences
hiding entailment relations among two ac-
tivities. We experimented the proposed
method using the entailment relations of
WordNet as test case and the web as cor-
pus where to estimate the probabilities;
obtained results will be shown.
