We present Minimum Bayes-Risk (MBR) de-
coding for statistical machine translation. This
statistical approach aims to minimize expected
loss of translation errors under loss functions
that measure translation performance. We de-
scribe a hierarchy of loss functions that incor-
porate different levels of linguistic information
from word strings, word-to-word alignments
from an MT system, and syntactic structure
from parse-trees of source and target language
sentences. We report the performance of the
MBR decoders on a Chinese-to-English trans-
lation task. Our results show that MBR decod-
ing can be used to tune statistical MT perfor-
mance for specific loss functions.
