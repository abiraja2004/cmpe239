 
This paper presents a translation model that is 
based on tree sequence alignment, where a tree 
sequence refers to a single sequence of sub-
trees that covers a phrase. The model leverages 
on the strengths of both phrase-based and lin-
guistically syntax-based method. It automati-
cally learns aligned tree sequence pairs with 
mapping probabilities from word-aligned bi-
parsed parallel texts. Compared with previous 
models, it not only captures non-syntactic 
phrases and discontinuous phrases with lin-
guistically structured features, but also sup-
ports multi-level structure reordering of tree 
typology with larger span. This gives our 
model stronger expressive power than other re-
ported models. Experimental results on the 
NIST MT-2005 Chinese-English translation 
task show that our method statistically signifi-
cantly outperforms the baseline systems.
