 
This paper describes our system submitted to 
*SEM 2013 Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) 
core task which aims to measure semantic si-
milarity of two given text snippets. In this 
shared task, we propose an interpolation STS 
model named Model_LIM integrating Fra-
meNet parsing information, which has a good 
performance with low time complexity com-
pared with former submissions.
