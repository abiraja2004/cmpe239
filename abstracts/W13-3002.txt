Adjuncts are characteristically optional,
but many, such as adverbs and adjectives,
are strictly ordered. In Minimalist Gram-
mars (MGs), it is straightforward to ac-
count for optionality or ordering, but not
both. I present an extension of MGs, MGs
with Adjunction, which accounts for op-
tionality and ordering simply by keeping
track of two pieces of information at once:
the original category of the adjoined-to
phrase, and the category of the adjunct
most recently adjoined. By imposing a
partial order on the categories, the Adjoin
operation can require that higher adjuncts
precede lower adjuncts, but not vice versa,
deriving order.
