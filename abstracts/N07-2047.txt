We present a novel machine translation
framework based on kernel regression
techniques. In our model, the translation
task is viewed as a string-to-string map-
ping, for which a regression type learning
is employed with both the source and the
target sentences embedded into their ker-
nel induced feature spaces. We report the
experiments on a French-English transla-
tion task showing encouraging results.
