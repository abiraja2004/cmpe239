In human translation, translators first make
draft translations and then modify them.
This paper analyses these modifications, in
order to identify the features that trigger
modification. Our goal is to construct a sys-
tem that notifies (English-to-Japanese) vol-
unteer translators of awkward translations.
After manually classifying the basic modifi-
cation patterns, we analysed the factors that
trigger a change in verb voice from passive
to active using SVM. An experimental re-
sult shows good prospects for the automatic
identification of candidates for modification.
