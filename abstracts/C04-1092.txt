This paper presents a versatile system
intended to acquire paraphrastic phrases
from a representative corpus. In order to
decrease the time spent on the elaboration of
resources for NLP system (for example
Information Extraction, IE hereafter), we
suggest to use a knowledge acquisition
module that helps extracting new
information despite linguistic variation
(textual entailment). This knowledge is
automatically derived from the text
collection, in interaction with a large
semantic network.
