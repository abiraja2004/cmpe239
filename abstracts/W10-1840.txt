In this paper, we apply the annota-
tion scheme design methodology defined
in (Bunt, 2010) and demonstrate its use
for generating a mapping from an exist-
ing annotation scheme to a representa-
tion in GrAF format. The most impor-
tant features of this methodology are (1)
the distinction of the abstract and con-
crete syntax of an annotation language;
(2) the specification of a formal seman-
tics for the abstract syntax; and (3) the
formalization of the relation between ab-
stract and concrete syntax, which guar-
antees that any concrete syntax inherits
the semantics of the abstract syntax, and
thus guarantees meaning-preserving map-
pings between representation formats. By
way of illustration, we apply this map-
ping strategy to annotations from ISO-
TimeML, PropBank, and FrameNet.
