 
The rapid development of language tools 
using machine learning techniques for less 
computerized languages requires appropri-
ately tagged corpus. A Bengali news cor-
pus has been developed from the web ar-
chive of a widely read Bengali newspaper. 
A web crawler retrieves the web pages in 
Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) 
format from the news archive. At present, 
the corpus contains approximately 34 mil-
lion wordforms. The date, location, re-
porter and agency tags present in the web 
pages have been automatically named en-
tity (NE) tagged. A portion of this partially 
NE tagged corpus has been manually anno-
tated with the sixteen NE tags with the help 
of Sanchay Editor1, a text editor for Indian 
languages. This NE tagged corpus contains 
150K wordforms. Additionally, 30K word-
forms have been manually annotated with 
the twelve NE tags as part of the IJCNLP-
08 NER Shared Task for South and South 
East Asian Languages 2 . A table driven 
semi-automatic NE tag conversion routine 
has been developed in order to convert the 
sixteen-NE tagged corpus to the twelve-NE 
tagged corpus. The 150K NE tagged cor-
pus has been used to develop Named Entity 
Recognition (NER) system in Bengali us-
ing pattern directed shallow parsing ap-
proach, Hidden Markov Model (HMM), 
Maximum Entropy (ME) Model, Condi-

tional Random Field (CRF) and Support 
Vector Machine (SVM). Experimental re-
sults of the 10-fold cross validation test 
have demonstrated that the SVM based 
NER system performs the best with an 
overall F-Score of 91.8%.
