We introduce synchronous tree adjoining
grammars (TAG) into tree-to-string transla-
tion, which converts a source tree to a target
string. Without reconstructing TAG deriva-
tions explicitly, our rule extraction algo-
rithm directly learns tree-to-string rules from
aligned Treebank-style trees. As tree-to-string
translation casts decoding as a tree parsing
problem rather than parsing, the decoder still
runs fast when adjoining is included. Less
than 2 times slower, the adjoining tree-to-
string system improves translation quality by
+0.7 BLEU over the baseline system only al-
lowing for tree substitution on NIST Chinese-
English test sets.
