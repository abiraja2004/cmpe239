For languages with complex morpholo-
gies, limited resources and tools, and/or
lack of standard grammars, developing an-
notated resources can be a challenging
task. Annotated resources developed un-
der time/money constraints for such lan-
guages tend to tradeoff depth of represen-
tation with degree of noise. We present
two methods for automatic correction and
extension of morphological annotations,
and demonstrate their success on three di-
vergent Egyptian Arabic corpora.
