An algorithm based on the Generalized
Hebbian Algorithm is described that
allows the singular value decomposition
of a dataset to be learned based on
single observation pairs presented seri-
ally. The algorithm has minimal mem-
ory requirements, and is therefore in-
teresting in the natural language do-
main, where very large datasets are of-
ten used, and datasets quickly become
intractable. The technique is demon-
strated on the task of learning word
and letter bigram pairs from text.
