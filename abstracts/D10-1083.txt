Part-of-speech (POS) tag distributions are
known to exhibit sparsity ? a word is likely
to take a single predominant tag in a corpus.
Recent research has demonstrated that incor-
porating this sparsity constraint improves tag-
ging accuracy. However, in existing systems,
this expansion come with a steep increase in
model complexity. This paper proposes a sim-
ple and effective tagging method that directly
models tag sparsity and other distributional
properties of valid POS tag assignments. In
addition, this formulation results in a dramatic
reduction in the number of model parame-
ters thereby, enabling unusually rapid training.
Our experiments consistently demonstrate that
this model architecture yields substantial per-
formance gains over more complex tagging
counterparts. On several languages, we report
performance exceeding that of more complex
state-of-the art systems.1
