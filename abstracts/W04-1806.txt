 
The emergence of vast quantities of on-line 
information has raised the importance of methods 
for automatic cataloguing of information in a 
variety of domains, including electronic commerce 
and bioinformatics. Ontologies can play a critical 
role in such cataloguing. In this paper, we describe 
a system that automatically induces an ontology 
from any large on-line text collection in a specific 
domain. The ontology that is induced consists of 
domain concepts, related by kind-of and part-of 
links. To achieve domain-independence, we use a 
combination of relatively shallow methods along 
with any available repositories of applicable 
background knowledge. We describe our 
evaluation experiences using these methods, and 
provide examples of induced structures.
