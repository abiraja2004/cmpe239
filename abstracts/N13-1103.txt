We consider the problem of translating natu-
ral language text queries into regular expres-
sions which represent their meaning. The mis-
match in the level of abstraction between the
natural language representation and the regu-
lar expression representation make this a novel
and challenging problem. However, a given
regular expression can be written in many se-
mantically equivalent forms, and we exploit
this flexibility to facilitate translation by find-
ing a form which more directly corresponds to
the natural language. We evaluate our tech-
nique on a set of natural language queries
and their associated regular expressions which
we gathered from Amazon Mechanical Turk.
Our model substantially outperforms a state-
of-the-art semantic parsing baseline, yielding
a 29% absolute improvement in accuracy.1
