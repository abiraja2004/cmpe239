Opinion question answering is a challenging task
for natural language processing. In this paper, we
discuss a necessary component for an opinion ques-
tion answering system: separating opinions from
fact, at both the document and sentence level. We
present a Bayesian classifier for discriminating be-
tween documents with a preponderance of opinions
such as editorials from regular news stories, and
describe three unsupervised, statistical techniques
for the significantly harder task of detecting opin-
ions at the sentence level. We also present a first
model for classifying opinion sentences as positive
or negative in terms of the main perspective be-
ing expressed in the opinion. Results from a large
collection of news stories and a human evaluation
of 400 sentences are reported, indicating that we
achieve very high performance in document classi-
fication (upwards of 97% precision and recall), and
respectable performance in detecting opinions and
classifying them at the sentence level as positive,
negative, or neutral (up to 91% accuracy).
