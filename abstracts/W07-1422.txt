We present a new framework for textual en-
tailment, which provides a modular integra-
tion between knowledge-based exact infer-
ence and cost-based approximate matching.
Diverse types of knowledge are uniformly
represented as entailment rules, which were
acquired both manually and automatically.
Our proof system operates directly on parse
trees, and infers new trees by applying en-
tailment rules, aiming to strictly generate the
target hypothesis from the source text. In or-
der to cope with inevitable knowledge gaps,
a cost function is used to measure the re-
maining ?distance? from the hypothesis.
