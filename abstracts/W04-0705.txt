 
We present a novel method of applying the 
results of coreference resolution to improve 
Name Recognition for Chinese.  We consider 
first some methods for gauging the confidence 
of individual tags assigned by a statistical 
name tagger.  For names with low confidence, 
we show how these names can be filtered 
using coreference features to improve 
accuracy.  In addition, we present rules which 
use coreference information to correct some 
name tagging errors.  Finally, we show how 
these gains can be magnified by clustering 
documents and using cross-document 
coreference in these clusters.  These combined 
methods yield an absolute improvement of 
about 3.1% in tagger F score.
