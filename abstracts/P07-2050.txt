We propose a novel method to expand a
small existing translation dictionary to a
large translation dictionary using a pivot lan-
guage. Our method depends on the assump-
tion that it is possible to find a pivot lan-
guage for a given language pair on con-
dition that there are both a large transla-
tion dictionary from the source language
to the pivot language, and a large transla-
tion dictionary from the pivot language to
the destination language. Experiments that
expands the Indonesian-Japanese dictionary
using the English language as a pivot lan-
guage shows that the proposed method can
improve performance of a real CLIR system.
