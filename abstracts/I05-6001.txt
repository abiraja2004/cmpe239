We present a treebank conversion
method by which we construct an
RMRS bank for HPSG parser evalu-
ation from the TIGER Dependency
Bank. Our method effectively per-
forms automatic RMRS semantics
construction from functional depen-
dencies, following the semantic alge-
bra of Copestake et al (2001). We
present the semantics construction
mechanism, and focus on some spe-
cial phenomena. Automatic conver-
sion is followed by manual valida-
tion. First evaluation results yield
high precision of the automatic se-
mantics construction rules.
