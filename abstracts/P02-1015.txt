We consider the problem of parsing
non-recursive context-free grammars, i.e.,
context-free grammars that generate finite
languages. In natural language process-
ing, this problem arises in several areas
of application, including natural language
generation, speech recognition and ma-
chine translation. We present two tabu-
lar algorithms for parsing of non-recursive
context-free grammars, and show that they
perform well in practical settings, despite
the fact that this problem is PSPACE-
complete.
