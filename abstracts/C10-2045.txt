In the field of multi-document summa-
rization, the Pyramid method has be-
come an important approach for evaluat-
ing machine-generated summaries. The
method is based on the manual annotation
of text spans with the same meaning in a
set of human model summaries. In this
paper, we present an unsupervised, prob-
abilistic topic modeling approach for au-
tomatically identifying such semantically
similar text spans. Our approach reveals
some of the structure of model summaries
and identifies topics that are good approx-
imations of the Summary Content Units
(SCU) used in the Pyramid method. Our
results show that the topic model identi-
fies topic-sentence associations that corre-
spond to the contributors of SCUs, sug-
gesting that the topic modeling approach
can generate a viable set of candidate
SCUs for facilitating the creation of Pyra-
mids.
