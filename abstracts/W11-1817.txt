The Bacteria Gene Renaming (RENAME)
task is a supporting task in the BioNLP Shared
Task 2011 (BioNLP-ST?11). The task con-
sists in extracting gene renaming acts and gene
synonymy reminders in scientific texts about
bacteria. In this paper, we present in details
our method in three main steps: 1) the doc-
ument segmentation into sentences, 2) the re-
moval of the sentences exempt of renaming act
(false positives) using both a gene nomencla-
ture and supervised machine learning (feature
selection and SVM), 3) the linking of gene
names by the target renaming relation in each
sentence. Our system ranked third at the of-
ficial test with 64.4% of F-measure. We also
present here an effective post-competition im-
provement: the representation as SVM fea-
tures of regular expressions that detect com-
binations of trigger words. This increases the
F-measure to 73.1%.
