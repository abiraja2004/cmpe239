We introduce a simple opinion mining
system for analyzing Japanese Weblog re-
views called OMS-J. OMS-J is designed
to provide an intuitive visual GUI of opin-
ion mining graphs for a comparison of
different products of the same type to
help a user make a quick purchase de-
cision. We first use an opinion mining
method using a combination of supervised
(a Naive Bayes Classifier) and unsuper-
vised (an improved SO-PMI: Semantic
Orientation Using Pointwise Mutual In-
formation) learning.
