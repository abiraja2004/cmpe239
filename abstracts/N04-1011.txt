This paper investigates the usefulness of
sentence-internal prosodic cues in syntac-
tic parsing of transcribed speech. Intu-
itively, prosodic cues would seem to pro-
vide much the same information in speech
as punctuation does in text, so we tried to
incorporate them into our parser in much
the same way as punctuation is. We com-
pared the accuracy of a statistical parser
on the LDC Switchboard treebank corpus
of transcribed sentence-segmented speech
using various combinations of punctua-
tion and sentence-internal prosodic infor-
mation (duration, pausing, and f0 cues).
With no prosodic or punctuation informa-
tion the parser?s accuracy (as measured by
F-score) is 86.9%, and adding punctuation
increases its F-score to 88.2%. However,
all of the ways we have tried of adding
prosodic information decrease the parser?s
F-score to between 84.8% to 86.8%, de-
pending on exactly which prosodic infor-
mation is added. This suggests that for
sentence-internal prosodic information to
improve speech transcript parsing, either
different prosodic cues will have to used
or they will have be exploited in the parser
in a way different to that used currently.
