Paraphrases are useful for statistical machine
translation (SMT) and natural language pro-
cessing tasks. Distributional paraphrase gen-
eration is independent of parallel texts and
syntactic parses, and hence is suitable also
for resource-poor languages, but tends to erro-
neously rank antonyms, trend-contrasting, and
polarity-dissimilar candidates as good para-
phrases. We present here a novel method
for improving distributional paraphrasing by
filtering out such candidates. We evalu-
ate it in simulated low and mid-resourced
SMT tasks, translating from English to two
quite different languages. We show statisti-
cally significant gains in English-to-Chinese
translation quality, up to 1 BLEU from non-
filtered paraphrase-augmented models (1.6
BLEU from baseline). We also show that
yielding gains in translation to Arabic, a mor-
phologically rich language, is not straightfor-
ward.
