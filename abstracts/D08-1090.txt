Traditionally, statistical machine translation
systems have relied on parallel bi-lingual data
to train a translation model. While bi-lingual
parallel data are expensive to generate, mono-
lingual data are relatively common. Yet mono-
lingual data have been under-utilized, having
been used primarily for training a language
model in the target language. This paper de-
scribes a novel method for utilizing monolin-
gual target data to improve the performance
of a statistical machine translation system on
news stories. The method exploits the exis-
tence of comparable text?multiple texts in
the target language that discuss the same or
similar stories as found in the source language
document. For every source document that is
to be translated, a large monolingual data set
in the target language is searched for docu-
ments that might be comparable to the source
documents. These documents are then used
to adapt the MT system to increase the prob-
ability of generating texts that resemble the
comparable document. Experimental results
obtained by adapting both the language and
translation models show substantial gains over
the baseline system.
