This paper summarizes FBK-irst participa-
tion at the lexical substitution task of the
SEMEVAL competition. We submitted two
different systems, both exploiting synonym
lists extracted from dictionaries. For each
word to be substituted, the systems rank the
associated synonym list according to a simi-
larity metric based on Latent Semantic Anal-
ysis and to the occurrences in the Web 1T
5-gram corpus, respectively. In particular,
the latter system achieves the state-of-the-art
performance, largely surpassing the baseline
proposed by the organizers.
