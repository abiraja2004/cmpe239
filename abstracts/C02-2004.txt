We describe a discovery program, called
UNIVAUTO (UNIVersals AUthoringTOol),
whose domain of application is the study of
language universals, a classic trend in
contemporary linguistics. Accepting as input
information about languages, presented in
terms of feature-values, the discoveries of
another human agent arising from the same
data, as well as some additional data, the
program discovers the universals in the data,
compares them with the discoveries of the
human agent and, if appropriate, generates a
report in English on its discoveries. Running
UNIVAUTO on the data from the seminal
paper of Greenberg (1966) on word order
universals, the system has produced several
linguistically valuable texts, two of which
are published in a refereed linguistic journal.
