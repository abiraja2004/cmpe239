In this paper, we propose a novel method of
reducing the size of translation model for hier-
archical phrase-based machine translation sys-
tems. Previous approaches try to prune in-
frequent entries or unreliable entries based on
statistics, but cause a problem of reducing the
translation coverage. On the contrary, the pro-
posed method try to prune only ineffective
entries based on the estimation of the infor-
mation redundancy encoded in phrase pairs
and hierarchical rules, and thus preserve the
search space of SMT decoders as much as
possible. Experimental results on Chinese-to-
English machine translation tasks show that
our method is able to reduce almost the half
size of the translation model with very tiny
degradation of translation performance.
