Statistical machine translation is often faced
with the problem of combining training data
from many diverse sources into a single trans-
lation model which then has to translate sen-
tences in a new domain. We propose a novel
approach, ensemble decoding, which com-
bines a number of translation systems dynam-
ically at the decoding step. In this paper,
we evaluate performance on a domain adap-
tation setting where we translate sentences
from the medical domain. Our experimental
results show that ensemble decoding outper-
forms various strong baselines including mix-
ture models, the current state-of-the-art for do-
main adaptation in machine translation.
