Existing algorithms for the Generation
of Referring Expressions tend to gen-
erate distinguishing descriptions at the
semantic level, disregarding the ways
in which surface issues can affect their
quality. This paper considers how these
algorithms should deal with surface am-
biguity, focussing on structural ambi-
guity. We propose that not all ambigu-
ity is worth avoiding, and suggest some
ways forward that attempt to avoid un-
wanted interpretations. We sketch the
design of an algorithm motivated by our
experimental findings.
