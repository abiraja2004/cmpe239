Text simplification is the process of changing
vocabulary and grammatical structure to cre-
ate a more accessible version of the text while
maintaining the underlying information and
content. Automated tools for text simplifica-
tion are a practical way to make large corpora
of text accessible to a wider audience lacking
high levels of fluency in the corpus language.
In this work, we investigate the potential of
Simple Wikipedia to assist automatic text sim-
plification by building a statistical classifica-
tion system that discriminates simple English
from ordinary English. Most text simplifica-
tion systems are based on hand-written rules
(e.g., PEST (Carroll et al, 1999) and its mod-
ule SYSTAR (Canning et al, 2000)), and
therefore face limitations scaling and trans-
ferring across domains. The potential for us-
ing Simple Wikipedia for text simplification
is significant; it contains nearly 60,000 ar-
ticles with revision histories and aligned ar-
ticles to ordinary English Wikipedia. Us-
ing articles from Simple Wikipedia and ordi-
nary Wikipedia, we evaluated different classi-
fiers and feature sets to identify the most dis-
criminative features of simple English for use
across domains. These findings help further
understanding of what makes text simple and
can be applied as a tool to help writers craft
simple text.
