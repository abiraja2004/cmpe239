We describe a system which enhances the
experience of museum visits by providing
users with language-technology-based in-
formation retrieval capabilities. The sys-
tem consists of a cross-lingual search en-
gine, augmented by state of the art semantic
expansion technology, specifically designed
for the domain of the museum (history and
archaeology of Israel). We discuss the tech-
nology incorporated in the system, its adap-
tation to the specific domain and its contri-
bution to cultural heritage appreciation.
