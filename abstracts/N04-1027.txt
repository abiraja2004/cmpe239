End-to-end evaluations of conversational dia-
logue systems with naive users are currently
uncovering severe usability problems that re-
sult in low task completion rates. Preliminary
analyses suggest that these problems are related
to the system?s dialogue management and turn-
taking behavior. We present the results of ex-
periments designed to take a detailed look at
the effects of that behavior. Based on the result-
ing findings, we spell out a set of criteria which
lie orthogonal to dialogue quality, but neverthe-
less constitute an integral part of a more com-
prehensive view on dialogue felicity as a func-
tion of dialogue quality and efficiency.
