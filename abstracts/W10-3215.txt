 
This study presents a novel computational 
approach to the analysis of unaccusa-
tive/unergative distinction in Turkish by 
employing feed-forward artificial neural 
networks with a backpropagation algo-
rithm. The findings of the study reveal cor-
respondences between semantic notions 
and syntactic manifestations of unaccusa-
tive/unergative distinction in this language, 
thus presenting a computational analysis of 
the distinction at the syntax/semantics in-
terface. The approach is applicable to other 
languages, particularly the ones which lack 
an explicit diagnostic such as auxiliary se-
lection but has a number of diagnostics in-
stead.
