This paper describes an on-going project
concerning with an ontological lexical re-
source based on the abundant conceptual
information grounded on Chinese charac-
ters. The ultimate goal of this project is set
to construct a cognitively sound and com-
putationally effective character-grounded
machine-understandable resource.
Philosophically, Chinese ideogram has its
ontological status, but its applicability to
the NLP task has not been expressed ex-
plicitly in terms of language resource. We
thus propose the first attempt to locate Chi-
nese characters within the context of on-
tology. Having the primary success in ap-
plying it to some NLP tasks, we believe
that the construction of this knowledge re-
source will shed new light on theoretical
setting as well as the construction of Chi-
nese lexical semantic resources.
