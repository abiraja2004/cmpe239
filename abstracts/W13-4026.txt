The Parlance system for interactive
search processes dialogue at a micro-
turn level, displaying dialogue phe-
nomena that play a vital role in hu-
man spoken conversation. These di-
alogue phenomena include more nat-
ural turn-taking through rapid sys-
tem responses, generation of backchan-
nels, and user barge-ins. The Par-
lance demonstration system differen-
tiates from other incremental systems
in that it is data-driven with an infras-
tructure that scales well.
