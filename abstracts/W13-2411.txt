In this paper we present a corpus-based ap-
proach to automatic identification of false
friends for Slovene and Croatian, a pair
of closely related languages. By taking
advantage of the lexical overlap between
the two languages, we focus on measuring
the difference in meaning between iden-
tically spelled words by using frequency
and distributional information. We ana-
lyze the impact of corpora of different ori-
gin and size together with different associ-
ation and similarity measures and compare
them to a simple frequency-based base-
line. With the best performing setting
we obtain very good average precision of
0.973 and 0.883 on different gold stan-
dards. The presented approach works on
non-parallel datasets, is knowledge-lean
and language-independent, which makes it
attractive for natural language processing
tasks that often lack the lexical resources
and cannot afford to build them by hand.
