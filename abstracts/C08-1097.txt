This paper presents a probabilistic model
for Japanese zero anaphora resolution.
First, this model recognizes discourse en-
tities and links all mentions to them. Zero
pronouns are then detected by case struc-
ture analysis based on automatically con-
structed case frames. Their appropriate
antecedents are selected from the entities
with high salience scores, based on the
case frames and several preferences on
the relation between a zero pronoun and
an antecedent. Case structure and zero
anaphora relation are simultaneously de-
termined based on probabilistic evaluation
metrics.
