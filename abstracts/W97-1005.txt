 
Statistical classification methods usually 
rely on a single best model to make ac- 
curate predictions. Such a model aims to 
maximize accuracy by balancing precision 
and recall. The Model Switching method 
as presented in this paper performs with 
higher predictive accuracy and 100% recall 
by using a set of decomposable models in- 
stead of a single one. 
The implemented system, MS1, is tested 
on a case study, predicting Prepositional 
Phrase Attachment (PPA). The results 
show that iV is more accurate than other 
statistical techniques that select single 
models for classification and competitive 
with other successful NLP approaches in 
PPA disambiguation. The Model Switch- 
ing method may be preferable to other 
methods because of its generality (i.e., wide 
range of applicability), and its competitive 
accuracy in prediction. It may also be used 
as an analytical tool to investigate the na- 
ture of the domain and the characteristics 
of the data with the help of generated mod- 
els.
