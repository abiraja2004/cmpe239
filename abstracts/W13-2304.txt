When creating a new resource, prepro-
cessing the source texts before annotation
is both ubiquitous and obvious. How the
preprocessing affects the annotation effort
for various tasks is for the most part an
open question, however. In this paper,
we study the effects of preprocessing on
the annotation of dependency corpora and
how annotation speed varies as a function
of the quality of three different parsers and
compare with the speed obtained when
starting from a least-processed baseline.
We also present preliminary results con-
cerning the effects on agreement based on
a small subset of sentences that have been
doubly-annotated.1
