In a conventional telephone conversation be-
tween two speakers of the same language, the
interaction is real-time and the speakers pro-
cess the information stream incrementally. In
this work, we address the problem of incre-
mental speech-to-speech translation (S2S) that
enables cross-lingual communication between
two remote participants over a telephone. We
investigate the problem in a novel real-time
Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) based S2S
framework. The speech translation is per-
formed incrementally based on generation of
partial hypotheses from speech recognition.
We describe the statistical models comprising
the S2S system and the SIP architecture for
enabling real-time two-way cross-lingual dia-
log. We present dialog experiments performed
in this framework and study the tradeoff in ac-
curacy versus latency in incremental speech
translation. Experimental results demonstrate
that high quality translations can be generated
with the incremental approach with approxi-
mately half the latency associated with non-
incremental approach.
