In this paper we describe the MELB-MKB
system, as entered in the SemEval-2007 lex-
ical substitution task. The core of our sys-
tem was the ?Relatives in Context? unsuper-
vised approach, which ranked the candidate
substitutes by web-lookup of the word se-
quences built combining the target context
and each substitute. Our system ranked third
in the final evaluation, performing close to
the top-ranked system.
