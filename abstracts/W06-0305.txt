An emerging task in text understanding
and generation is to categorize information
as fact or opinion and to further attribute
it to the appropriate source. Corpus an-
notation schemes aim to encode such dis-
tinctions for NLP applications concerned
with such tasks, such as information ex-
traction, question answering, summariza-
tion, and generation. We describe an anno-
tation scheme for marking the attribution
of abstract objects such as propositions,
facts and eventualities associated with dis-
course relations and their arguments an-
notated in the Penn Discourse TreeBank.
The scheme aims to capture the source and
degrees of factuality of the abstract ob-
jects. Key aspects of the scheme are anno-
tation of the text spans signalling the attri-
bution, and annotation of features record-
ing the source, type, scopal polarity, and
determinacy of attribution.
