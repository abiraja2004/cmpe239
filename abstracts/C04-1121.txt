 
We demonstrate that it is possible to perform 
automatic sentiment classification in the very noisy 
domain of customer feedback data. We show that 
by using large feature vectors in combination with 
feature reduction, we can train linear support 
vector machines that achieve high classification 
accuracy on data that present classification 
challenges even for a human annotator. We also 
show that, surprisingly, the addition of deep 
linguistic analysis features to a set of surface level 
word n-gram features contributes consistently to 
classification accuracy in this domain.
