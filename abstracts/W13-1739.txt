We present a method for automatically de-
tecting missing hyphens in English text. Our
method goes beyond a purely dictionary-based
approach and also takes context into account.
We evaluate our model on artificially gener-
ated data as well as naturally occurring learner
text. Our best-performing model achieves
high precision and reasonable recall, making
it suitable for inclusion in a system that gives
feedback to language learners.
