:  This paper presents an approach to 
computational morphology which can be considered as 
being derived l?om the two-level model but differs from 
this substantially. Lexemes rather than formatives are 
the most important entities distinguished in this 
approach. The consequence is that a new formalism for 
the specification of morphological knowledge is 
required. A short description of a system called Word 
Manager will outline the characteristics of such a 
formalistn, the most prominent of which is that 
different subformalisms for inflectional rules and word- 
formation rules are distinguished. These rules are 
applied separately though not independently and support 
the concept of lexicalization. The primary advantage of 
this is that the system can build up a network of 
knowledge on how formatives, lexemes, and rules 
depend on each other while individual lexemes are 
lexicalized. Thus, the system will know the inflectional 
forms of a lexeme, the destructuring of these forms into 
formatives, how the lexeme has been derived or 
composed if it is a word-fommtion, etc. This requires 
much memory, yet, the phik)sophy behind the approach 
is that lhe system runs as a server on a local area 
network, so that an entire machine can be dedicated to 
the task, if necessary.
