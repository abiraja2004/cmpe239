Semantic role classification accuracy for most
languages other than English is constrained by
the small amount of annotated data. In this pa-
per, we demonstrate how the frame-to-frame
relations described in the FrameNet ontology
can be used to improve the performance of
a FrameNet-based semantic role classifier for
Swedish, a low-resource language. In order
to make use of the FrameNet relations, we
cast the semantic role classification task as
a non-atomic label prediction task. The ex-
periments show that the cross-frame general-
ization methods lead to a 27% reduction in
the number of errors made by the classifier.
For previously unseen frames, the reduction is
even more significant: 50%.
