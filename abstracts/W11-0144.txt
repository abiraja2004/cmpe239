This paper describes recent work on the DynDial project? towards incremental semantic inter-
pretation in dialogue. We outline our domain-general grammar-based approach, using a variant of
Dynamic Syntax integrated with Type Theory with Records and a Davidsonian event-based seman-
tics. We describe a Java-based implementation of the parser, used within the Jindigo framework to
produce an incremental dialogue system capable of handling inherently incremental phenomena such
as split utterances, adjuncts, and mid-sentence clarification requests or backchannels.
