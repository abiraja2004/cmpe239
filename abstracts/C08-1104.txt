We determine the subjectivity of word
senses. To avoid costly annotation, we
evaluate how useful existing resources es-
tablished in opinion mining are for this
task. We show that results achieved with
existing resources that are not tailored to-
wards word sense subjectivity classifica-
tion can rival results achieved with super-
vision on a manually annotated training
set. However, results with different re-
sources vary substantially and are depen-
dent on the different definitions of subjec-
tivity used in the establishment of the re-
sources.
