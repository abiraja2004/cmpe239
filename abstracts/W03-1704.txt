 
Word extraction is one of the important 
tasks in text information processing. 
There are mainly two kinds of statistic-
based measures for word extraction: the 
internal measure and the contextual 
measure. This paper discusses these two 
kinds of measures for Chinese word 
extraction. First, nine widely adopted 
internal measures are tested and 
compared on individual basis. Then 
various schemes of combining these 
measures are tried so as to improve the 
performance. Finally, the left/right 
entropy is integrated to see the effect of 
contextual measures. Genetic algorithm is 
explored to automatically adjust the 
weights of combination and thresholds. 
Experiments focusing on two-character 
Chinese word extraction show a 
promising result: the F-measure of 
mutual information, the most powerful 
internal measure, is 57.82%, whereas the 
best combination scheme of internal 
measures achieves the F-measure of 
59.87%. With the integration of the 
contextual measure, the word extraction 
achieves the F-measure of 68.48% at last.
