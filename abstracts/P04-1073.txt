 
QA-by-Dossier-with-Constraints is a new ap-
proach to Question Answering whereby candi-
date answers? confidences are adjusted by 
asking auxiliary questions whose answers con-
strain the original answers.  These constraints 
emerge naturally from the domain of interest, 
and enable application of real-world knowledge 
to QA.  We show that our approach signifi-
cantly improves system performance (75% rela-
tive improvement in F-measure on select 
question types) and can create a ?dossier? of in-
formation about the subject matter in the origi-
nal question.
