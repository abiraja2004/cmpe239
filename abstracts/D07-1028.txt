We present a simple history-based model for
sentence generation from LFG f-structures,
which improves on the accuracy of previous
models by breaking down PCFG indepen-
dence assumptions so that more f-structure
conditioning context is used in the predic-
tion of grammar rule expansions. In addi-
tion, we present work on experiments with
named entities and other multi-word units,
showing a statistically significant improve-
ment of generation accuracy. Tested on sec-
tion 23 of the Penn Wall Street Journal Tree-
bank, the techniques described in this paper
improve BLEU scores from 66.52 to 68.82,
and coverage from 98.18% to 99.96%.
