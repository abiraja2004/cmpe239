The Penn Discourse TreeBank (PDTB) is a new re-
source built on top of the Penn Wall Street Journal
corpus, in which discourse connectives are anno-
tated along with their arguments. Its use of stand-
off annotation allows integration with a stand-off
version of the Penn TreeBank (syntactic structure)
and PropBank (verbs and their arguments), which
adds value for both linguistic discovery and dis-
course modeling. Here we describe the PDTB and
some experiments in linguistic discovery based on
the PDTB alone, as well as on the linked PTB and
PDTB corpora.
