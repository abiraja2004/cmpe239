 
Previous work concerned with the identi-fication of word translations from text collections has been either based on par-allel or on comparable corpora of the re-spective languages. In the case of compa-rable corpora basic dictionaries have been necessary to form a bridge between the languages under consideration. We present here a novel approach to identify word translations from a single mono-lingual corpus without necessarily requir-ing dictionaries, although, as will be shown, a dictionary can still be useful for improving the results. Our approach is based on the observation that for various reasons monolingual corpora typically contain many foreign words (for example citations). Relying on standard news-ticker texts, we will show that their co-occurrence-based associations can be successfully used to identify word trans-lations.
