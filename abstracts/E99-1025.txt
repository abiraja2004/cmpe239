 
In previous work, supertag disambigua- 
tion has been presented as a robust, par- 
tial parsing technique. In this paper 
we present wo approaches: contextual 
models, which exploit a variety of fea- 
tures in order to improve supertag per- 
formance, and class-based models, which 
assign sets of supertags to words in order 
to substantially improve accuracy with 
only a slight increase in ambiguity.
