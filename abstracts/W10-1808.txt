The common accepted wisdom is that
blind double annotation followed by adju-
dication of disagreements is necessary to
create training and test corpora that result
in the best possible performance. We pro-
vide evidence that this is unlikely to be the
case. Rather, the greatest value for your
annotation dollar lies in single annotating
more data.
