 
We propose a feature type classification 
thought to be used in a therapeutic context. 
Such a scenario lays behind our need for a 
easily usable and cognitively plausible classi-
fication. Nevertheless, our proposal has both 
a practical and a theoretical outcome, and its 
applications range from computational lin-
guistics to psycholinguistics. An evaluation 
through inter-coder agreement has been per-
formed to highlight the strength of our pro-
posal and to conceive some improvements for 
the future.
