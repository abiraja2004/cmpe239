Most tools and resources developed for nat-
ural language processing of Arabic are de-
signed for Modern Standard Arabic (MSA)
and perform terribly on Arabic dialects, such
as Egyptian Arabic. Egyptian Arabic differs
from MSA phonologically, morphologically
and lexically and has no standardized orthog-
raphy. We present a linguistically accurate,
large-scale morphological analyzer for Egyp-
tian Arabic. The analyzer extends an existing
resource, the Egyptian Colloquial Arabic Lex-
icon, and follows the part-of-speech guide-
lines used by the Linguistic Data Consortium
for Egyptian Arabic. It accepts multiple or-
thographic variants and normalizes them to a
conventional orthography.
