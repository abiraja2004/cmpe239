fieldwork conducted in the autumn of 
2008 in eleven rural communities of South 
Africa. The goal of the fieldwork was to 
evaluate the potential role of automated 
telephony services in improving access to 
important government information and 
services. Our interviews, focus group 
discussions and surveys revealed that 
Lwazi, a telephone-based spoken dialog 
system, could greatly support current 
South African government efforts to 
effectively connect citizens to available 
services, provided such services be toll 
free, in local languages, and with content 
relevant to each community.
