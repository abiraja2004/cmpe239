Responding to the need for semantic lexical
resources in natural language processing ap-
plications, we examine methods to acquire
noun compounds (NCs), e.g., orange juice, to-
gether with suitable fine-grained semantic in-
terpretations, e.g., squeezed from, which are
directly usable as paraphrases. We employ
bootstrapping and web statistics, and utilize
the relationship between NCs and paraphras-
ing patterns to jointly extract NCs and such
patterns in multiple alternating iterations. In
evaluation, we found that having one com-
pound noun fixed yields both a higher number
of semantically interpreted NCs and improved
accuracy due to stronger semantic restrictions.
