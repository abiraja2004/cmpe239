This paper describes an affinity graph 
based approach to multi-document sum-
marization. We incorporate a diffusion 
process to acquire semantic relationships 
between sentences, and then compute in-
formation richness of sentences by a 
graph rank algorithm on differentiated in-
tra-document links and inter-document 
links between sentences. A greedy algo-
rithm is employed to impose diversity 
penalty on sentences and the sentences 
with both high information richness and 
high information novelty are chosen into 
the summary. Experimental results on 
task 2 of DUC 2002 and task 2 of DUC 
2004 demonstrate that the proposed ap-
proach outperforms existing state-of-the-
art systems.
