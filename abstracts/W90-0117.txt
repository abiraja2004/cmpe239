Some Evidence for the Hierarchy 
Structure 
Some nonconclusive vidence supports  parts  of the 
hierarchy, though further s tudy must  be done to 
examine all the relat ions. This  evidence is based 
132 
on sensitivity to generalization evinced by many 
cue words and phrases. For example, the cue word 
"then" is associated with SEQUENCE, and can be 
used appropriately to indicate its subordinates SE- 
QTEMPORAL and SEQSPATIAL, as in: 
SEQTEMPORAL: First you play the long 
note, then the short ones 
SEQSPATIAL: On the wall I have a red 
picture, then a blue one 
In contrast, the cue words for the two subrelations 
are specific and cannot be interchanged without in- 
troducing the associated connotation: 
SEQTEMPORAL: After the 10ng note you 
play the short ones 
SEQSPATIAL: Beside the red picture is the 
blue one 
Thus the relation associated with "then" subsumes 
the relations associated with "after" and "beside". 
Similar observations hold for a number of the rela- 
tions (e.g., SOLUTIONHOOD and RESTATEMENT). 
Preliminary investigation indicates possible ad- 
ditional evidence in the syntactic realization of 
some relations: When a relation typically gives rise 
to a dependent clause, then its subrelations tend to 
do so as well. More study must be done by a trained 
linguist. 
Role of Intent ional  Relat ions 
What then of the two relations DOMINATES and 
SATISFACTIONPRECEDES? They do not appear 
anywhere in the hierarchy in Figure 2. 
The answer is that these two relations express 
information that is independent of the rhetori- 
cal/semantic meanings of the relations in the tax- 
onomy and only apply in discourses with inten- 
tional, plan-like nature. They derive from early 
work on a highly plan-oriented domain \[Grosz 81\], 
in which plan steps' preconditions led to underly- 
ing precedence orderings of plan steps and satis- 
faction of subgoals which were dominated by su- 
pergoals. However, not all discourse is plan-like; 
a large proportion of everyday close discourse be- 
tween people achieves goals for which, it can be 
argued, no plans can be formulated (for some such 
goals see \[Hovy 88b\]): the banter between friends 
which serves to strengthen i terpersonal bonds, the 
discussions in supermarket lines, the language and 
presentation styles employed in order to be friendly 
or attractive, etc. Such communications also ex- 
hibit internal structure, and also employ the rhetor- 
ical/semantic nterclausal relations. 
However, it is not clear how to generalize DOMI- 
NATES and SATISFACTIONPRECEDES to cover such 
cases as well. One possible generalization is to use 
the general relations HYPOTAXIS and PARATAXIS 
(that is, asymmetrical and symmetrical relation- 
ships: 
HYPO: Joe left because Sue worked (5 
Sue worked because Joe left) 
PARA: He shouted when the horse 
jumped (= the horse jumped when he 
shouted) 
respectively). But this does not work because both 
DOMINATES and SATISFACTIONPRECEDES are by 
their natures asymmetrical. Another possible gen- 
eralization is to use the two syntactic relations 
MULTIVARIATE and UNIVARIATE (that is, contain- 
ing an embedded syntactic type recursion (a gram- 
matical rank shift) ornot ,  as in: 
MULTI: Sue's working caused \[Joe to 
leave\] (S embedded in S) 
UNI: Joe left because Sue worked (two 
coequal Ss) 
respectively). This does not work either because 
some DOMINATES relations hold between syntacti- 
cally independent complete sentences, so no syn- 
tactic embedding occurs. 
Does this mean that the two intentional relations 
should simply be added into the hierarchy? No, 
because they can be realized in the discourse by 
various rhetorical/semantic relations; for example, 
SATISFACTIONPREcEDEs can be expressed by SE- 
QUENCE, as in: 
First boil the water, then add the rice, and 
then stir 
or by CAUSE, as in: 
The sun heats the desert, which causes the 
air to rise, which causes a breeze 
Thus, in the absence of other candidate gener- 
alizations, one can conclude that the relations 
DOMINATES and SATISFACTIONPRECEDES are in- 
dependent of the rhetorical/semantic axonomiza- 
tion and provide an additional dimension of infor- 
mation, used for those discourses that exhibit an 
appropriately intentional plan-like nature. 
Some Object ions Answered 
A number of objections may be raised to the tax- 
onomization presented here. I attempt o respond 
to some of the more serious ones: 
133 
Object ion  1. Does it make sense at all to or- 
ganize into a single taxonomy such disparate n- 
tities? After all, RESTATEMENT and CONCESSION 
are primarily rhetorical while, say, PURPOSE and 
PROCESSSTEP are  primarily semantic. 
Why not? As a result of this study and previ- 
ous work, I believe that "rhetorical" relations are 
simply the crudest or most generalized "semantic" 
ones; in other words, that no purely rhetorical or 
purely semantic relations exist. Some relations, 
typically those higher in the hierarchy, certainly 
fulfill a more rhetorical function (i.e., provide more 
information about the argumentational structure of 
the discourse) than a semantic function. But not 
even the topmost relations are entirely devoid of se- 
mantic meaning. Since all the relations have some 
semantic import (regardless of their structural im- 
port), this objection to their being arranged into a 
single taxonomy for the purposes of discourse struc- 
ture description is groundless 1.
Ob jec t ion  2. What guarantee xists that the 
relations given in the taxonomy are indeed the 
"right" ones? Or the only ones? It is not diffi- 
cult to come up with relations that differ in some 
way from those in the taxonomy and that do not 
neatly fall under a single item in it. 
This is a standard objection to any set of terms 
proposed to fulfill some function. The standard re- 
sponse holds here too: there is no guarantee that 
these are the "right" relations, whatever "right" 
may mean. Similarly, there is no guarantee that 
the terms \[VERB NOUN ADJECTIVE ADVERB . . .  \] 
are the "right" and "only" terms for types of words; 
they have simply been canonized by long use and 
much experience. There is enough evidence from 
actual attempts at constructing working systems 
(text planners and discourse analyzers) that rela- 
tions at this level of interclausal representation are 
required to guide inference and planning processes. 
Without such relations we simply cannot construct 
an adequate account of the structure of a discourse 
1This position is in contradistinction with that of Sys- 
temic Linguistics, which holds that semantic relations are of 
the type Ideational while rhetorical relations are of the type 
Textual. Since both kinds of relations erve the same func- 
tion, namely to bind together different pieces of knowledge, 
and certain relations operate both interclausally and intra- 
clausally, there  seems to me no reason to differentiate hem 
into two dif ferent types. I categorize discourse structure re- 
lations with  those  called Ideational, and group separately 
all those phenomena that reflect the characteristics of the 
communicative s tting: referentially available artifacts and 
concepts, the nature of the medium (telephone, paper, con- 
versation, etc.), and the physical and social context (back- 
ground noise, available time, etc.). 
nor plan an adequate multisentence paragraph by 
computer. 
The particular relations proposed here are cer- 
tainly open to question, and their strongest support 
is that they are the amalgamation and synthesis of 
the efforts and proposed terms of over 25 different 
investigators from different fields, as noted previ- 
ously. In addition, there is always the possibility 
that new interclausal relations will be needed that 
cannot in fact be subsumed under existing nodes 
in the taxonomy. While not impossible, I believe 
this is unlikely, based on my experience in compil- 
ing the hierarchy: After the top three levels had 
more or less been established halfway through this 
study, only one new second-level relation - -  IDEN- 
TIFICATION - -  had to be added. I expect hat when 
new domains are investigated, the hierarchy will 
grow primarily at the bottom, and that the ratio 
of the number of relations added at one level to the 
number of relations added at the next lower level, 
averaged across all levels, will be well below 0.2. 
Ob jec t ion  3. The taxonomy is unbounded to- 
ward the bottom: it places one on the slippery 
slope toward having to deal with the full complex- 
ity of semantic meaning. Simply working on the 
structure of discourse is difficult enough without 
bringing in the complexity of semantic knowledge. 
This is the the Parsimonious Position objection. 
There is no reason to fear the complexity of an 
unbounded set of terms, whether semantic or not, 
as long as the terms are well-behaved and sub- 
ject to a pattern of organization which makes them 
manageable. A hierarchicalization of the terms in 
which all the pertinent information about discour- 
sal behavior is captured at the top (which is maxi- 
mally general, bounded, and well-understood) and 
not at the bottom (which permits unboundedness 
and redundancy) presents no threat to computa- 
tional processing. Each discourse relation simply 
inherits from its ancestors all necessary process- 
ing information, such as cue words and realization 
constraints, adding its unique peculiarities, to be 
used for inferring its discoursal role (in parsing) or 
for planning out a discourse (in generation). In- 
creasing differentiation of relations, continued un- 
til the very finest nuances of meaning are sepa- 
rately represented, need be pursued only to the 
extent required for any given application. Thus 
"unbounded" growth of semantic relations is not a 
problem, as long as they can be subsumed under 
existing nodes in the taxonomy. 
Ob jec t ion  4. The hierarchy contains no explic- 
itly structural relations, yet explicit signals of dis- 
134 
course structure are very common. Why are they 
not included? 
In fact, the relations people use to signal dis- 
course structure (such as parallelism, say) are in- 
cluded in the taxonomy. The most popular elation 
(one that appeared as a separate relation in a num- 
ber of the studies cited) is PARALLEL, which is in- 
variably signalled using some set of SEQUENCE rela- 
tions, often after having been explicitly introduced 
by a separate clause. The fact that SEQUENCE 
relations can be used to signal both semantic se- 
quentiality and rhetorical structure is no reason for 
alarm; if conditions hould arise in which the two 
functions require different behavior, a more specific 
relation subordinated to SEQUENCE, dedicated to 
expressing purely rhetorical sequentiality (such as, 
say, SEQSTRUCTURAL), can be created, though it 
is likely that in the actual presentation, the rhetor- 
ical sequence will usually follow some temporal or 
spatial sequence in any case. 
Conclusion 
A rather gratifying result of the synthesis presented 
here is that only 16 core relations, organized into 
3 principal types, suffice to cover essentially all the 
interclausal relations proposed by the sources. This 
suggests that other relations not yet in the hierar- 
chy are likely to be subtypes of relations already 
in it, preserving the boundedness of the number of 
relation types. The relations are rhetorical in na- 
ture, becoming increasingly semantic as they be- 
come more specific; the claim is that the rhetorical 
relations are simply least delicate (i.e., most gen- 
eral) semantic relations. 
While some evidence is provided for the struc- 
ture of the hierarchy, as well as for the claim that 
the relations are independent of the goal-oriented 
plan-based iscourse structure relations proposed 
by \[Grosz & Sidner 86\], there is no claim that this 
hierarchy is complete or correct in all details. It 
is certainly open to elaboration, enhancement, and 
extension! The hope is that it will serve the com- 
munity by proving to be a common starting point 
and straw man for future work on discourse struc- 
ture.
