In this paper, we present a novel way of tack-
ling the monolingual alignment problem on
pairs of sentential paraphrases by means of
edit rate computation. In order to inform the
edit rate, information in the form of subsenten-
tial paraphrases is provided by a range of tech-
niques built for different purposes. We show
that the tunable TER-PLUS metric from Ma-
chine Translation evaluation can achieve good
performance on this task and that it can effec-
tively exploit information coming from com-
plementary sources.
