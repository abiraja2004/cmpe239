We present an approach to automatically re-
cover hidden attributes of scientific articles,
such as whether the author is a native English
speaker, whether the author is a male or a fe-
male, and whether the paper was published in
a conference or workshop proceedings. We
train classifiers to predict these attributes in
computational linguistics papers. The classi-
fiers perform well in this challenging domain,
identifying non-native writing with 95% accu-
racy (over a baseline of 67%). We show the
benefits of using syntactic features in stylom-
etry; syntax leads to significant improvements
over bag-of-words models on all three tasks,
achieving 10% to 25% relative error reduction.
We give a detailed analysis of which words
and syntax most predict a particular attribute,
and we show a strong correlation between our
predictions and a paper?s number of citations.
