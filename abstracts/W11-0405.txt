 
For the implementation of the prosody predic-
tion model, large scale annotated speech corpo-
ra have been widely applied. Reliability among 
transcribers, however, was too low for success-
ful learning of an automatic prosodic prediction. 
This paper reveals our observations on perfor-
mance deterioration of the learning model due 
to inconsistent tagging of prosodic breaks in the 
established corpora. Then, we suggest a method 
for consistent prosodic labeling among multiple 
transcribers. As a result, we obtain a corpus 
with consistent annotation of prosodic breaks. 
The estimated pairwise agreement of annotation 
of the main corpus is between 0.7477 and 
0.7916, and the value of K is between 0.7057 
and 0.7569. Considering the estimated K, anno-
tation of the main corpus has reliable consisten-
cy among multiple transcribers.
