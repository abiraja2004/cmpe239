With increasing amounts of elec-
tronic information available, and the
increase in the variety of languages
used to produce documents of the
same type, the problem of how to
manage similar documents in dif-
ferent languages arises. This pa-
per proposes an approach to process-
ing/structuring text so that Multi-
lingual Authoring (creating hyper-
text links) can be effectively car-
ried out. This work, funded by
the European Union, is applied to
the Multilingual Authoring of news
agency text. We have applied meth-
ods from Natural Language Process-
ing, especially Information Extrac-
tion technology, to both monolingual
and Multilingual Authoring.
