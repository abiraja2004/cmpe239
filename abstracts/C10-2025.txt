In this paper, we present hybrid decod-
ing ? a novel statistical machine transla-
tion (SMT) decoding paradigm using mul-
tiple SMT systems. In our work, in ad-
dition to component SMT systems, sys-
tem combination method is also employed
in generating partial translation hypothe-
ses throughout the decoding process, in
which smaller hypotheses generated by
each component decoder and hypotheses
combination are used in the following de-
coding steps to generate larger hypothe-
ses. Experimental results on NIST evalu-
ation data sets for Chinese-to-English ma-
chine translation (MT) task show that our
method can not only achieve significant
improvements over individual decoders,
but also bring substantial gains compared
with a state-of-the-art word-level system
combination method.
