The paper presents a system for the CoNLL-
2011 share task of coreference resolution. The
system composes of two components: one for
mentions detection and another one for their
coreference resolution. For mentions detec-
tion, we adopted a number of heuristic rules
from syntactic parse tree perspective. For
coreference resolution, we apply SVM by ex-
ploiting multiple syntactic and semantic fea-
tures. The experiments on the CoNLL-2011
corpus show that our rule-based mention iden-
tification system obtains a recall of 87.69%,
and the best result of the SVM-based corefer-
ence resolution system is an average F-score
50.92% of the MUC, B-CUBED and CEAFE
metrics.
