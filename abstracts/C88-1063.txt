  
We descrlbe a general parsing method for systemic gram- 
mars. Systemic grammars contain a paradigmatic analysis of 
language in addition to structural information, so a parser 
must assign a set of  grammatical features and functions to 
each constituent in addition to producing a constituent s ruc- 
ture. Our method constructs a parser by compiling systemic 
grammars into the notation of Functional Unification Gram- 
mar. The existing methods for parsing with unification gram- 
mars hace been extended to  handle a fuller range of paradig- 
matic descriptions. In particular, the PATR-II system has been 
extended by using disjunctive and conditional information in 
functional descriptions that are attached to phrase structure 
rules. The method has been tested with a large grammar of En- 
glish w:hich was originally developed for text generation. This 
testing is the basis for some observations about the bidirec- 
tional m~e of  a grammar.
