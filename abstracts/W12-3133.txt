This paper describes the UPC participation in
the WMT 12 evaluation campaign. All sys-
tems presented are based on standard phrase-
based Moses systems. Variations adopted sev-
eral improvement techniques such as mor-
phology simplification and generation and do-
main adaptation. The morphology simpli-
fication overcomes the data sparsity prob-
lem when translating into morphologically-
rich languages such as Spanish by translat-
ing first to a morphology-simplified language
and secondly leave the morphology gener-
ation to an independent classification task.
The domain adaptation approach improves the
SMT system by adding new translation units
learned from MT-output and reference align-
ment. Results depict an improvement on TER,
METEOR, NIST and BLEU scores compared
to our baseline system, obtaining on the of-
ficial test set more benefits from the domain
adaptation approach than from the morpho-
logical generalization method.1
