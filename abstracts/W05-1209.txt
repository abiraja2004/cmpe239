 We describe our efforts to generate a large (100,000 instance) corpus of textual entailment pairs from the lead paragraph and headline of news articles.  We manu-ally inspected a small set of news stories in order to locate the most productive source of entailments, then built an anno-tation interface for rapid manual evalua-tion of further exemplars. With this training data we built an SVM-based document classifier, which we used for corpus refinement purposes?we believe that roughly three-quarters of the resulting corpus are genuine entailment pairs.  We also discuss the difficulties inherent in manual entailment judgment, and suggest ways to ameliorate some of these. 1
