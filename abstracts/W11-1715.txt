The research described in this work focuses
on identifying key components for the task of
irony detection. By means of analyzing a set
of customer reviews, which are considered as
ironic both in social and mass media, we try
to find hints about how to deal with this task
from a computational point of view. Our ob-
jective is to gather a set of discriminating el-
ements to represent irony. In particular, the
kind of irony expressed in such reviews. To
this end, we built a freely available data set
with ironic reviews collected from Amazon.
Such reviews were posted on the basis of an
online viral effect; i.e. contents whose ef-
fect triggers a chain reaction on people. The
findings were assessed employing three clas-
sifiers. The results show interesting hints re-
garding the patterns and, especially, regarding
the implications for sentiment analysis.
