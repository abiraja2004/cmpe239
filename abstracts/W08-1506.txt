MedSLT is a grammar-based medical
speech translation system intended for
use in doctor-patient diagnosis dialogues,
which provides coverage of several dif-
ferent subdomains and multiple language
pairs. Vocabulary ranges from about 350 to
1000 surface words, depending on the lan-
guage and subdomain. We will demo three
different versions of the system: an any-
to-any multilingual version involving the
languages Japanese, English, French and
Arabic, a bidirectional English ? Span-
ish version, and a mobile version run-
ning on a hand-held PDA. We will also
demo the Regulus development environ-
ment, focussing on features which sup-
port rapid prototyping of grammar-based
speech translation systems.
