We compare three recent proposals adding
a topology to OT: McCarthy?s Persistent
OT, Smolensky?s ICS and B??ro??s SA-OT. To
test their learnability, constraint rankings are
learnt from SA-OT?s output. The errors in
the output, being more than mere noise, fol-
low from the topology. Thus, the learner has
to reconstructs her competence having ac-
cess only to the teacher?s performance.
