 
Imbalanced training sets, where one class is 
heavily underrepresented compared to the oth-
ers, have a bad effect on the classification of 
rare class instances. We apply One-sided Sam-
pling for the first time to a lexical acquisition 
task (learning verb complements from Modern 
Greek corpora) to remove redundant and mis-
leading training examples of verb non-
dependents and thereby balance our training 
set. We experiment with well-known learning 
algorithms to classify new examples. Perform-
ance improves up to 22% in recall and 15% in 
precision after balancing the dataset1.
