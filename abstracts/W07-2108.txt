This paper reports on the participation
of University of Wolverhampton and
University of Alicante at the SemEval-2007
TempEval evaluation exercise. TempEval
consisted of three tasks involving the
identification of event-time and event-event
temporal relations. We participated in
all three tasks with TICTAC (Syntactico-
Semantic Temporal Annotation Cluster), a
system comprising both knowledge based
and statistical techniques. Our system
achieved the highest strict and relaxed
scores for tasks A and B, and the highest
relaxed score for task C.
