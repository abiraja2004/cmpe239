. This paper presents a lightweight method for unsupervised
extraction of paraphrases from arbitrary textual Web documents. The
method differs from previous approaches to paraphrase acquisition in
that 1) it removes the assumptions on the quality of the input data,
by using inherently noisy, unreliable Web documents rather than clean,
trustworthy, properly formatted documents; and 2) it does not require
any explicit clue indicating which documents are likely to encode parallel
paraphrases, as they report on the same events or describe the same sto-
ries. Large sets of paraphrases are collected through exhaustive pairwise
alignment of small needles, i.e., sentence fragments, across a haystack
of Web document sentences. The paper describes experiments on a set
of about one billion Web documents, and evaluates the extracted para-
phrases in a natural-language Web search application.
