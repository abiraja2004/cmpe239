In this paper we address the problem
of extracting key pieces of information
from voicemail messages, such as the
identity and phone number of the caller.
This task differs from the named entity
task in that the information we are inter-
ested in is a subset of the named entities
in the message, and consequently, the
need to pick the correct subset makes
the problem more difficult. Also, the
caller?s identity may include informa-
tion that is not typically associated with
a named entity. In this work, we present
three information extraction methods,
one based on hand-crafted rules, one
based on maximum entropy tagging,
and one based on probabilistic trans-
ducer induction. We evaluate their per-
formance on both manually transcribed
messages and on the output of a speech
recognition system.
