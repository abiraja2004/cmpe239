 
This paper proposes an English adverb 
ordering method based on adverb gram- 
matical functions (subjuncts, adjuncts, dis- 
juncts and conjuncts) and meanings (pro- 
cess, space, time etc.), preferred positions 
in sentences (initial, medial, end, pre, 
post), and priorities between adverbs with 
the same preferred position.
