This paper studies the role of base-NP in-
formation in dependency parsing for Thai.
The baseline performance reveals that the
base-NP chunking task for Thai is much
more difficult than those of some lan-
guages (like English). The results show
that the parsing performance can be im-
proved (from 60.30% to 63.74%) with the
use of base-NP chunk information, al-
though the best chunker is still far from
perfect (F?=1 = 83.06%).
