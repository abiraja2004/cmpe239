Describing the main event of an image in-
volves identifying the objects depicted and
predicting the relationships between them.
Previous approaches have represented images
as unstructured bags of regions, which makes
it difficult to accurately predict meaningful
relationships between regions. In this pa-
per, we introduce visual dependency represen-
tations to capture the relationships between
the objects in an image, and hypothesize that
this representation can improve image de-
scription. We test this hypothesis using a
new data set of region-annotated images, as-
sociated with visual dependency representa-
tions and gold-standard descriptions. We de-
scribe two template-based description gener-
ation models that operate over visual depen-
dency representations. In an image descrip-
tion task, we find that these models outper-
form approaches that rely on object proxim-
ity or corpus information to generate descrip-
tions on both automatic measures and on hu-
man judgements.
