In this paper we describe the extraction of
thesaurus information from parsed dictio-
nary definition sentences. The main data
for our experiments comes from Lexeed,
a Japanese semantic dictionary, and the
Hinoki treebank built on it. The dictio-
nary is parsed using a head-driven phrase
structure grammar of Japanese. Knowledge
is extracted from the semantic representa-
tion (Minimal Recursion Semantics). This
makes the extraction process language inde-
pendent.
