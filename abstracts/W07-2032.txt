We present a corpus-based supervised lear-
ning system for coarse-grained sense disam-
biguation. In addition to usual features for
training in word sense disambiguation, our
system also uses Base Level Concepts au-
tomatically obtained from WordNet. Base
Level Concepts are some synsets that gene-
ralize a hyponymy sub?hierarchy, and pro-
vides an extra level of abstraction as well as
relevant information about the context of a
word to be disambiguated. Our experiments
proved that using this type of features re-
sults on a significant improvement of preci-
sion. Our system has achieved almost 0.8 F1
(fifth place) in the coarse?grained English
all-words task using a very simple set of fea-
tures plus Base Level Concepts annotation.
