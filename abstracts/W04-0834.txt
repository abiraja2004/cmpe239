We participated in the SENSEVAL-3 English lexi-
cal sample task and multilingual lexical sample task.
We adopted a supervised learning approach with
Support Vector Machines, using only the official
training data provided. No other external resources
were used. The knowledge sources used were part-
of-speech of neighboring words, single words in the
surrounding context, local collocations, and syntac-
tic relations. For the translation and sense subtask
of the multilingual lexical sample task, the English
sense given for the target word was also used as
an additional knowledge source. For the English
lexical sample task, we obtained fine-grained and
coarse-grained score (for both recall and precision)
of 0.724 and 0.788 respectively. For the multilin-
gual lexical sample task, we obtained recall (and
precision) of 0.634 for the translation subtask, and
0.673 for the translation and sense subtask.
