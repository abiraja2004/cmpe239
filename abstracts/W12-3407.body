 
This paper presents the results of a set of 
preliminary experiments combining two 
knowledge-based partial dependency 
analyzers with two statistical parsers, 
applied to the Basque Dependency 
Treebank. The general idea will be to apply 
a stacked scheme where the output of the 
rule-based partial parsers will be given as 
input to MaltParser and MST, two state of 
the art statistical parsers. The results show 
a modest improvement over the baseline, 
although they also present interesting lines 
for further research.
