text is challenging due to different reasons. 
One of them is that the same word (in particu-
lar, adjectives) can have different polarities 
depending on the context. This paper presents 
the experiments carried out by the OpAL team 
for the participation in the SemEval 2010 Task 
18 ? Disambiguation of Sentiment Ambiguous 
Adjectives. Our approach is based on three dif-
ferent strategies: a) the evaluation of the polar-
ity of the whole context using an opinion min-
ing system; b) the assessment of the polarity of 
the local context, given by the combinations 
between the closest nouns and the adjective to 
be classified; c) rules aiming at refining the lo-
cal semantics through the spotting of modifi-
ers. The final decision for classification is tak-
en according to the output of the majority of 
these three approaches.  The method used 
yielded good results, the OpAL system run 
ranking fifth among 16 in micro accuracy and 
sixth in macro accuracy.
