Dependency parsers are critical components
within many NLP systems. However, cur-
rently available dependency parsers each ex-
hibit at least one of several weaknesses, in-
cluding high running time, limited accuracy,
vague dependency labels, and lack of non-
projectivity support. Furthermore, no com-
monly used parser provides additional shal-
low semantic interpretation, such as prepo-
sition sense disambiguation and noun com-
pound interpretation. In this paper, we present
a new dependency-tree conversion of the Penn
Treebank along with its associated fine-grain
dependency labels and a fast, accurate parser
trained on it. We explain how a non-projective
extension to shift-reduce parsing can be in-
corporated into non-directional easy-first pars-
ing. The parser performs well when evalu-
ated on the standard test section of the Penn
Treebank, outperforming several popular open
source dependency parsers; it is, to the best
of our knowledge, the first dependency parser
capable of parsing more than 75 sentences per
second at over 93% accuracy.
