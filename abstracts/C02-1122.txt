This paper proposes a method of fertilizing a
Japanese case frame dictionary to handle com-
plicated expressions: double nominative sen-
tences, non-gapping relation of relative clauses,
and case change. Our method is divided into
two stages. In the first stage, we parse a large
corpus and construct a Japanese case frame dic-
tionary automatically from the parse results. In
the second stage, we apply case analysis to the
large corpus utilizing the constructed case frame
dictionary, and upgrade the case frame dictio-
nary by incorporating newly acquired informa-
tion.
