Many problems in natural language process-
ing can be viewed as variations of the task of
measuring the semantic textual similarity be-
tween short texts. However, many systems
that address these tasks focus on a single task
and may or may not generalize well. In this
work, we extend an existing machine transla-
tion metric, TERp (Snover et al, 2009a), by
adding support for more detailed feature types
and by implementing a discriminative learning
algorithm. These additions facilitate applica-
tions of our system, called PERP, to similar-
ity tasks other than machine translation eval-
uation, such as paraphrase recognition. In
the SemEval 2012 Semantic Textual Similar-
ity task, PERP performed competitively, par-
ticularly at the two surprise subtasks revealed
shortly before the submission deadline.
