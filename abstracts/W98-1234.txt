 
This paper describes differents methods and tricks in 
connection with our program which has been entered in 
the Loebner Prize competition that will happen on 
Sunday 11 January 1998, at the PowerHouse Museum 
in Sydney. Of course, this isn't exhaustive, there are 
other possible techniques but we aim to give the main 
ideas. We'll speak about the main modules of our 
program : Spelling correction, Different uses of 
WordNet, and Generation of comments. Our module 
used for spelling correction was developed on the basis 
of works by Brill \[1\], Brill and Marcus \[2\], Golding 
\[3\], Golding and Schabes \[4\], and Powers \[5\].
