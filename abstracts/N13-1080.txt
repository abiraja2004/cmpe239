Multi-Domain learning assumes that a sin-
gle metadata attribute is used in order to di-
vide the data into so-called domains. How-
ever, real-world datasets often have multi-
ple metadata attributes that can divide the
data into domains. It is not always apparent
which single attribute will lead to the best do-
mains, and more than one attribute might im-
pact classification. We propose extensions to
two multi-domain learning techniques for our
multi-attribute setting, enabling them to si-
multaneously learn from several metadata at-
tributes. Experimentally, they outperform the
multi-domain learning baseline, even when it
selects the single ?best? attribute.
