We propose a computational framework
for identifying linguistic aspects of polite-
ness. Our starting point is a new corpus
of requests annotated for politeness, which
we use to evaluate aspects of politeness
theory and to uncover new interactions
between politeness markers and context.
These findings guide our construction of
a classifier with domain-independent lexi-
cal and syntactic features operationalizing
key components of politeness theory, such
as indirection, deference, impersonaliza-
tion and modality. Our classifier achieves
close to human performance and is effec-
tive across domains. We use our frame-
work to study the relationship between po-
liteness and social power, showing that po-
lite Wikipedia editors are more likely to
achieve high status through elections, but,
once elevated, they become less polite. We
see a similar negative correlation between
politeness and power on Stack Exchange,
where users at the top of the reputation
scale are less polite than those at the bot-
tom. Finally, we apply our classifier to
a preliminary analysis of politeness vari-
ation by gender and community.
