This paper proposes a multi-dimensional
framework for classifying text documents.
In this framework, the concept of multi-
dimensional category model is introduced
for representing classes. In contrast with
traditional flat and hierarchical category
models, the multi-dimensional category
model classifies each text document in a
collection using multiple predefined sets of
categories, where each set corresponds to a
dimension. Since a multi-dimensional model
can be converted to flat and hierarchical
models, three classification strategies are
possible, i.e., classifying directly based on
the multi-dimensional model and classifying
with the equivalent flat or hierarchical
models. The efficiency of these three
classifications is investigated on two data
sets. Using k-NN, na?ve Bayes and centroid-
based classifiers, the experimental results
show that the multi-dimensional-based and
hierarchical-based classification performs
better than the flat-based classifications.
