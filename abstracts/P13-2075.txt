This paper presents two minimum Bayes
risk (MBR) based Answer Re-ranking
(MBRAR) approaches for the question
answering (QA) task. The first approach
re-ranks single QA system?s outputs by
using a traditional MBR model, by mea-
suring correlations between answer can-
didates; while the second approach re-
ranks the combined outputs of multiple
QA systems with heterogenous answer ex-
traction components by using a mixture
model-based MBR model. Evaluation-
s are performed on factoid questions se-
lected from two different domains: Jeop-
ardy! and Web, and significant improve-
ments are achieved on all data sets.
