 
This paper presents a comparative study 
on two key problems existing in extrac-
tive summarization: the ranking problem 
and the selection problem. To this end, 
we presented a systematic study of 
comparing different learning-to-rank al-
gorithms and comparing different selec-
tion strategies. This is the first work of 
providing systematic analysis on these 
problems. Experimental results on two 
benchmark datasets demonstrate three 
findings: (1) pairwise and listwise learn-
ing-to-rank algorithms outperform the 
baselines significantly; (2) there is no 
significant difference among the learn-
ing-to-rank algorithms; and (3) the in-
teger linear programming selection 
strategy generally outperformed Maxi-
mum Marginal Relevance and Diversity 
Penalty strategies.
