This paper presents a speech understand-
ing component for enabling robust situated
human-robot communication. The aim is
to gain semantic interpretations of utter-
ances that serve as a basis for multi-modal
dialog management also in cases where
the recognized word-stream is not gram-
matically correct. For the understand-
ing process, we designed semantic pro-
cessable units, which are adapted to the
domain of situated communication. Our
framework supports the specific character-
istics of spontaneous speech used in com-
bination with gestures in a real world sce-
nario. It also provides information about
the dialog acts. Finally, we present a pro-
cessing mechanism using these concept
structures to generate the most likely se-
mantic interpretation of the utterances and
to evaluate the interpretation with respect
to semantic coherence.
