When digitizing a print bilingual dictionary,
whether via optical character recognition or
manual entry, it is inevitable that errors are
introduced into the electronic version that is
created. We investigate automating the pro-
cess of detecting errors in an XML repre-
sentation of a digitized print dictionary us-
ing a hybrid approach that combines rule-
based, feature-based, and language model-
based methods. We investigate combin-
ing methods and show that using random
forests is a promising approach. We find
that in isolation, unsupervised methods ri-
val the performance of supervised methods.
Random forests typically require training
data so we investigate how we can apply
random forests to combine individual base
methods that are themselves unsupervised
without requiring large amounts of training
data. Experiments reveal empirically that
a relatively small amount of data is suffi-
cient and can potentially be further reduced
through specific selection criteria.
