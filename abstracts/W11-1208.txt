We present a novel paraphrase fragment pair
extraction method that uses a monolingual
comparable corpus containing different arti-
cles about the same topics or events. The pro-
cedure consists of document pair extraction,
sentence pair extraction, and fragment pair ex-
traction. At each stage, we evaluate the in-
termediate results manually, and tune the later
stages accordingly. With this minimally su-
pervised approach, we achieve 62% of accu-
racy on the paraphrase fragment pairs we col-
lected and 67% extracted from the MSR cor-
pus. The results look promising, given the
minimal supervision of the approach, which
can be further scaled up.
