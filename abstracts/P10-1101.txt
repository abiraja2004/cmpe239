A fundamental step in sentence compre-
hension involves assigning semantic roles
to sentence constituents. To accomplish
this, the listener must parse the sentence,
find constituents that are candidate argu-
ments, and assign semantic roles to those
constituents. Each step depends on prior
lexical and syntactic knowledge. Where
do children learning their first languages
begin in solving this problem? In this pa-
per we focus on the parsing and argument-
identification steps that precede Seman-
tic Role Labeling (SRL) training. We
combine a simplified SRL with an un-
supervised HMM part of speech tagger,
and experiment with psycholinguistically-
motivated ways to label clusters resulting
from the HMM so that they can be used
to parse input for the SRL system. The
results show that proposed shallow rep-
resentations of sentence structure are ro-
bust to reductions in parsing accuracy, and
that the contribution of alternative repre-
sentations of sentence structure to suc-
cessful semantic role labeling varies with
the integrity of the parsing and argument-
identification stages.
