Opinion holder extraction is one of the impor-
tant subtasks in sentiment analysis. The ef-
fective detection of an opinion holder depends
on the consideration of various cues on vari-
ous levels of representation, though they are
hard to formulate explicitly as features. In this
work, we propose to use convolution kernels
for that task which identify meaningful frag-
ments of sequences or trees by themselves.
We not only investigate how different levels
of information can be effectively combined
in different kernels but also examine how the
scope of these kernels should be chosen. In
general relation extraction, the two candidate
entities thought to be involved in a relation are
commonly chosen to be the boundaries of se-
quences and trees. The definition of bound-
aries in opinion holder extraction, however, is
less straightforward since there might be sev-
eral expressions beside the candidate opinion
holder to be eligible for being a boundary.
