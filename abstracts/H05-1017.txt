We propose a generalized bootstrapping
algorithm in which categories are de-
scribed by relevant seed features. Our
method introduces two unsupervised steps
that improve the initial categorization step
of the bootstrapping scheme: (i) using La-
tent Semantic space to obtain a general-
ized similarity measure between instances
and features, and (ii) the Gaussian Mixture
algorithm, to obtain uniform classification
probabilities for unlabeled examples. The
algorithm was evaluated on two Text Cate-
gorization tasks and obtained state-of-the-
art performance using only the category
names as initial seeds.
