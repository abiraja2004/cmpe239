Japanese double-subject constniction having an 
adjective predicate based on the valency 
structure. A simple sentence usually has only 
one subjective case in most languages. 
However, lnmly Japancse adjeclivcs (and some 
verbs) can dominate two surface subjective 
cases within a simple sentence. Such sentence 
structure is called lhe double-subject 
construction. This paper classifies lhe Japtulese 
double-subject constntction i lo four types mid 
describes problems arising when analyzing 
fllcse lypes using orditmry Japmlese construction 
approaches. This paper proposes a method tbr 
analyzing a Japanese double-subject 
construction having an adjective predicate in 
order to overcome lhe problems described. By 
applying tiffs melhod to Jap~mese senlence 
,'malysis in Japanese-to-English machine 
~,mslalion systems, tl'm~slalion accuracy can be 
improved because tiffs melhod eml analyze 
correclly the double-subject construction.
