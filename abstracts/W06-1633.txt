In this paper we describe a coreference
resolution method that employs a classi-
fication and a clusterization phase. In a
novel way, the clusterization is produced
as a graph cutting algorithm, in which
nodes of the graph correspond to the men-
tions of the text, whereas the edges of the
graph constitute the confidences derived
from the coreference classification. In ex-
periments, the graph cutting algorithm for
coreference resolution, called BESTCUT,
achieves state-of-the-art performance.
