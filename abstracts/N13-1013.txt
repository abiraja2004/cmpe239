We consider the problem of training a sta-
tistical parser in the situation when there are
multiple treebanks available, and these tree-
banks are annotated according to different lin-
guistic conventions. To address this problem,
we present two simple adaptation methods:
the first method is based on the idea of using
a shared feature representation when parsing
multiple treebanks, and the second method on
guided parsing where the output of one parser
provides features for a second one.
To evaluate and analyze the adaptation meth-
ods, we train parsers on treebank pairs in four
languages: German, Swedish, Italian, and En-
glish. We see significant improvements for
all eight treebanks when training on the full
training sets. However, the clearest benefits
are seen when we consider smaller training
sets. Our experiments were carried out with
unlabeled dependency parsers, but the meth-
ods can easily be generalized to other feature-
based parsers.
