In this paper we investigate the problem of
identifying the perspective from which a
document was written. By perspective we
mean a point of view, for example, from
the perspective of Democrats or Repub-
licans. Can computers learn to identify
the perspective of a document? Further-
more, can computers identify which sen-
tences in a document strongly convey a
particular perspective? We develop sta-
tistical models to capture how perspec-
tives are expressed at the document and
sentence levels, and evaluate the proposed
models on a collection of articles on the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The results
show that the statistical models can suc-
cessfully learn how perspectives are re-
flected in word usage and identify the per-
spective of a document with very high ac-
curacy.
