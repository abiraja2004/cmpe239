 
In this paper, the usage and function of 
Chinese punctuations are studied in 
syntactic parsing and a new 
hierarchical approach is proposed for 
parsing long Chinese sentences. It 
differentiates from most of the previous 
approaches mainly in two aspects. 
Firstly, Chinese punctuations are 
classified as ?divide? punctuations and 
?ordinary? ones. Long sentences which 
include ?divide? punctuations are 
broken into suitable units, so the 
parsing will be carried out in two stages. 
This ?divide-and-rule? strategy greatly 
reduces the difficulty of acquiring the 
boundaries of sub-sentences and 
syntactic structures of sub-sentences or 
phrases simultaneously in once-level 
parsing strategy of previous approaches. 
Secondly, a grammar rules system 
including all punctuations and 
probability distribution is built to be 
used in parsing and disambiguating. 
Experiments show that our approach 
can significantly reduce the time 
consumption and numbers of 
ambiguous edges of traditional 
methods, and also improve the 
accuracy and recall when parsing long 
Chinese sentences.
