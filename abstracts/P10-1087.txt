Wikipedia articles in different languages
are connected by interwiki links that are
increasingly being recognized as a valu-
able source of cross-lingual information.
Unfortunately, large numbers of links are
imprecise or simply wrong. In this pa-
per, techniques to detect such problems are
identified. We formalize their removal as
an optimization task based on graph re-
pair operations. We then present an al-
gorithm with provable properties that uses
linear programming and a region growing
technique to tackle this challenge. This
allows us to transform Wikipedia into a
much more consistent multilingual regis-
ter of the world?s entities and concepts.
