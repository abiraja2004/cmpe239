We present a semantic role labeling sys-
tem submitted to the closed track of the
CoNLL-2005 shared task. The system, in-
troduced in (Toutanova et al, 2005), im-
plements a joint model that captures de-
pendencies among arguments of a predi-
cate using log-linear models in a discrimi-
native re-ranking framework. We also de-
scribe experiments aimed at increasing the
robustness of the system in the presence
of syntactic parse errors. Our final system
achieves F1-Measures of 76.68 and 78.45
on the development and the WSJ portion
of the test set, respectively.
