Much NLP research on Multi-Word Ex-
pressions (MWEs) focuses on the discov-
ery of new expressions, as opposed to the
identification in texts of known expres-
sions. However, MWE identification is
not trivial because many expressions al-
low variation in form and differ in the
range of variations they allow. We show
that simple rule-based baselines do not
perform identification satisfactorily, and
present a supervised learning method for
identification that uses sentence surface
features based on expressions? canonical
form. To evaluate the method, we have
annotated 3350 sentences from the British
National Corpus, containing potential uses
of 24 verbal MWEs. The method achieves
an F-score of 94.86%, compared with
80.70% for the leading rule-based base-
line. Our method is easily applicable to
any expression type. Experiments in pre-
vious research have been limited to the
compositional/non-compositional distinc-
tion, while we also test on sentences in
which the words comprising the MWE ap-
pear but not as an expression.
