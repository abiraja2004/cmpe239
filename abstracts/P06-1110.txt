The present work advances the accu-
racy and training speed of discrimina-
tive parsing. Our discriminative parsing
method has no generative component, yet
surpasses a generative baseline on con-
stituent parsing, and does so with mini-
mal linguistic cleverness. Our model can
incorporate arbitrary features of the in-
put and parse state, and performs fea-
ture selection incrementally over an ex-
ponential feature space during training.
We demonstrate the flexibility of our ap-
proach by testing it with several pars-
ing strategies and various feature sets.
