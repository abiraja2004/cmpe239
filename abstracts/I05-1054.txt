. This paper proposes a variation of synchronous grammar based on 
the formalism of context-free grammar by generalizing the first component of 
productions that models the source text, named Constraint-based Synchronous 
Grammar (CSG). Unlike other synchronous grammars, CSG allows multiple 
target productions to be associated to a single source production rule, which can 
be used to guide a parser to infer different possible translational equivalences 
for a recognized input string according to the feature constraints of symbols in 
the pattern. Furthermore, CSG is augmented with independent rewriting that al-
lows expressing discontinuous constituents in the inference rules. It turns out 
that such grammar is more expressive to model the translational equivalences of 
parallel texts for machine translation, and in this paper, we propose the use of 
CSG as a basis for building a machine translation (MT) system for Portuguese 
to Chinese translation.
