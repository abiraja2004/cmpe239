This paper demonstrates two annotation
tools related to Propbank: Cornerstone
and Jubilee. Propbank is a corpus in
which the arguments of each verb pred-
icate are annotated with their semantic
roles. Propbank annotation also requires
the choice of a sense id for each predicate,
defined in the corresponding frameset file.
Jubilee expedites the annotation process
by displaying several resources of syntactic
and semantic information simultaneously;
easy access to each of these resources al-
lows the annotator to quickly absorb and
apply the necessary syntactic and semantic
information pertinent to each predicate for
consistent and efficient annotation. Cor-
nerstone is a user-friendly xml editor, cus-
tomized to allow frame authors to create
and edit frameset files. Both tools have
been successfully adapted to many Prop-
bank projects; they run platform indepen-
dently, are light enough to run as X11 ap-
plications and support multiple languages
such as Arabic, Chinese, English, Hindi
and Korean.
