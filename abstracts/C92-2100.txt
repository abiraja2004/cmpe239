 
This paper proposes a three-level revision model for 
improving badly-styled Japanese xpressions, especially 
in the field of technical communication. The model is a 
mixture of the regeneration-based model and tile 
rewriting-based model. The first level divides tong 
sentences, while the second level improves several 
badly-styled expressions with iterative partial rewriting 
operations. The last level performs regeneration, in
which word ordering and punctuation to reduce tile 
reading ambiguity are currently involvod. Expelimental 
results show that our model is effective in realizing 
practical revision support systems.
