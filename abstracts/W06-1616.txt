Integer Linear Programming has recently
been used for decoding in a number of
probabilistic models in order to enforce
global constraints. However, in certain ap-
plications, such as non-projective depen-
dency parsing and machine translation,
the complete formulation of the decod-
ing problem as an integer linear program
renders solving intractable. We present an
approach which solves the problem in-
crementally, thus we avoid creating in-
tractable integer linear programs. This ap-
proach is applied to Dutch dependency
parsing and we show how the addition
of linguistically motivated constraints can
yield a significant improvement over state-
of-the-art.
