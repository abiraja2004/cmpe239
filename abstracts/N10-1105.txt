In this paper, we compare two novel methods
for part of speech tagging of Arabic without
the use of gold standard word segmentation
but with the full POS tagset of the Penn Ara-
bic Treebank. The first approach uses com-
plex tags without any word segmentation, the
second approach is segmention-based, using
a machine learning segmenter. Surprisingly,
word-based POS tagging yields the best re-
sults, with a word accuracy of 94.74%.
