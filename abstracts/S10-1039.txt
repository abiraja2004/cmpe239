We describe the SEERLAB system
that participated in the SemEval 2010?s
Keyphrase Extraction Task. SEERLAB
utilizes the DBLP corpus for generating
a set of candidate keyphrases from a
document. Random Forest, a supervised
ensemble classifier, is then used to select
the top keyphrases from the candidate set.
SEERLAB achieved a 0.24 F-score in
generating the top 15 keyphrases, which
places it sixth among 19 participating sys-
tems. Additionally, SEERLAB performed
particularly well in generating the top 5
keyphrases with an F-score that ranked
third.
