We present some lessons we have learned
from using software infrastructure to
support coursework in natural language
dialogue and embodied conversational
agents. We have a new appreciation
for the differences between coursework
and research infrastructure?supporting
teaching may be harder, because students
require a broader spectrum of implemen-
tation, a faster learning curve and the abil-
ity to explore mistaken ideas as well as
promising ones. We outline the collabo-
rative discussion and effort we think is re-
quired to create better teaching infrastruc-
ture in the future.
