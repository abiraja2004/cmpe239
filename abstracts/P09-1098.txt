tences and terms1) from the Web can benefit 
many NLP applications, such as machine 
translation and cross language information re-
trieval. In this paper, based on the observation 
that bilingual data in many web pages appear 
collectively following similar patterns, an 
adaptive pattern-based bilingual data mining 
method is proposed. Specifically, given a web 
page, the method contains four steps: 1) pre-
processing: parse the web page into a DOM 
tree and segment the inner text of each node 
into snippets; 2) seed mining: identify poten-
tial translation pairs (seeds) using a word 
based alignment model which takes both trans-
lation and transliteration into consideration; 3) 
pattern learning: learn generalized patterns 
with the identified seeds; 4) pattern based min-
ing: extract all bilingual data in the page using 
the learned patterns. Our experiments on Chi-
nese web pages produced more than 7.5 mil-
lion pairs of bilingual sentences and more than 
5 million pairs of bilingual terms, both with 
over 80% accuracy.
