 
We present an XML annotation format 
(MEANING Annotation Format, MAF) 
specifically designed to represent and in-
tegrate different levels of linguistic anno-
tations and a tool that provides flexible 
access to them (MEANING Browser). 
We describe our experience in integrating 
linguistic annotations coming from dif-
ferent sources, and the solutions we 
adopted to implement efficient access to 
corpora annotated with the Meaning 
Format.
