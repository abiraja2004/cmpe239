This paper describes a study on the contribu-
tion of linguistically-informed features to the
task of quality estimation for machine trans-
lation at sentence level. A standard regression
algorithm is used to build models using a com-
bination of linguistic and non-linguistic fea-
tures extracted from the input text and its ma-
chine translation. Experiments with English-
Spanish translations show that linguistic fea-
tures, although informative on their own, are
not yet able to outperform shallower features
based on statistics from the input text, its
translation and additional corpora. However,
further analysis suggests that linguistic infor-
mation is actually useful but needs to be care-
fully combined with other features in order to
produce better results.
