 
In this paper, we propose a multi-criteria -
based active learning approach and effec-
tively apply it to named entity recognition. 
Active learning targets to minimize the 
human annotation efforts by selecting ex-
amples for labeling.  To maximize the con-
tribution of the selected examples, we 
consider the multiple criteria: informative-
ness, representativeness and diversity  and 
propose measures to quantify them.  More 
comprehensively, we incorporate all the 
criteria using two selection strategies, both 
of which result in less labeling cost than 
single-criterion-based method.  The results 
of the named entity recognition in both 
MUC-6 and GENIA show that the labeling 
cost can be reduced by at least 80% with-
out degrading the performance.
