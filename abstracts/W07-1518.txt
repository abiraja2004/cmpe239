XARA is a rule-based PropBank labeler for
Alpino XML files, written in Java. I used
XARA in my research on semantic role la-
beling in a Dutch corpus to bootstrap a
dependency treebank with semantic roles.
Rules in XARA are based on XPath expres-
sions, which makes it a versatile tool that is
applicable to other treebanks as well.
In addition to automatic role annotation,
XARA is able to extract training instances
(sets of features) from an XML based tree-
bank. Such an instance base can be used to
train machine learning algorithms for auto-
matic semantic role labeling (SRL). In my
semantic role labeling research, I used the
Tilburg Memory Learner (TiMBL) for this
purpose.
