We present a small set of attachment
heuristics for postnominal PPs occurring
in full-text articles related to enzymes.
A detailed analysis of the results sug-
gests their utility for extraction of rela-
tions expressed by nominalizations (often
with several attached PPs). The system
achieves 82% accuracy on a manually an-
notated test corpus of over 3000 PPs from
varied biomedical texts.
