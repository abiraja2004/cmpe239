 
We will demonstrate SconeEdit, a new tool 
for exploring and editing knowledge bases 
(KBs) that leverages interaction with do-
main texts.  The tool provides an annotated 
view of user-selected text, allowing a user 
to see which concepts from the text are in 
the KB and to edit the KB directly from 
this Text View.  Alongside the Text View, 
SconeEdit provides a navigable KB View 
of the knowledge base, centered on con-
cepts that appear in the text.  This unified 
tool gives the user a text-driven way to ex-
plore a KB and add new knowledge.
