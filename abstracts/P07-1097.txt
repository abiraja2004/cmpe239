The idea of ?nugget pyramids? has re-
cently been introduced as a refinement to the
nugget-based methodology used to evaluate
answers to complex questions in the TREC
QA tracks. This paper examines data from
the 2006 evaluation, the first large-scale de-
ployment of the nugget pyramids scheme.
We show that this method of combining
judgments of nugget importance from multi-
ple assessors increases the stability and dis-
criminative power of the evaluation while in-
troducing only a small additional burden in
terms of manual assessment. We also con-
sider an alternative method for combining
assessor opinions, which yields a distinction
similar to micro- and macro-averaging in the
context of classification tasks. While the
two approaches differ in terms of underly-
ing assumptions, their results are neverthe-
less highly correlated.
