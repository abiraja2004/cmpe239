This paper proposes a new method based
on coreference-chains for extracting cita-
tions from research papers. To evaluate
our method we created a corpus of cita-
tions comprised of citing papers for 4 cited
papers. We analyze some phenomena of
citations that are present in our corpus,
and then evaluate our method against a
cue-phrase-based technique. Our method
demonstrates higher precision by 7?10%.
