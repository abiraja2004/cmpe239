Both entity and relation extraction can
benefit from being performed jointly, al-
lowing each task to correct the errors of
the other. We present a new method for
joint entity and relation extraction using
a graph we call a ?card-pyramid.? This
graph compactly encodes all possible en-
tities and relations in a sentence, reducing
the task of their joint extraction to jointly
labeling its nodes. We give an efficient la-
beling algorithm that is analogous to pars-
ing using dynamic programming. Exper-
imental results show improved results for
our joint extraction method compared to a
pipelined approach.
