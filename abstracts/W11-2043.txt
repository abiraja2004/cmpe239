 
This demonstration will illustrate an inter-
active immersive computer game, POMY, 
designed to help Korean speakers learn 
English. This system allows learners to ex-
ercise their visual and aural senses, receiv-
ing a full immersion experience to increase 
their memory and concentration abilities to 
a greatest extent. In POMY, learners can 
have free conversations with game charac-
ters and receive corrective feedback to their 
errors. Game characters show various emo-
tional expressions based on learners? input 
to keep learners motivated. Through this 
system, learners can repeatedly practice 
conversations in everyday life setting in a 
foreign language with no embarrassment.
