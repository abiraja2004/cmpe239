 
Unknown word recognition is an important 
problem in Chinese word segmentation systems. 
In this paper, we propose an integrated method 
for Chinese unknown word extraction for off-
line corpus processing, in which both context-
entropy (on each side) and frequency ratio 
against background corpus are introduced to 
evaluate the candidate words. Both of the meas-
ures are computed efficiently on Suffix array 
with much less space overhead. Our method can 
also be reinforced when combined with a basic 
Segmentor by boundary-verification and arbi-
trary n-gram words can be extracted by our 
method. We test our method on Chinese novel 
Xiao Ao Jiang Hu, and obtain satisfactory 
achievements compared to traditional criteria 
such as Likelihood Ratio.
