 
We introduce a method for learning to 
predict the following grammar and text 
of the ongoing translation given a source 
text. In our approach, predictions are 
offered aimed at reducing users? burden 
on lexical and grammar choices, and 
improving productivity. The method 
involves learning syntactic phraseology 
and translation equivalents. At run-time, 
the source and its translation prefix are 
sliced into ngrams to generate subsequent 
grammar and translation predictions. We 
present a prototype writing assistant, 
TransAhead1, that applies the method to 
where computer-assisted translation and 
language learning meet. The preliminary 
results show that the method has great 
potentials in CAT and CALL (significant 
boost in translation quality is observed).
