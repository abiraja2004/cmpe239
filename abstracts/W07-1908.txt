For embodied agents to engage in realis-
tic multiparty conversation, they must stand
in appropriate places with respect to other
agents and the environment. When these
factors change, for example when an agent
joins a conversation, the agents must dynam-
ically move to a new location and/or orien-
tation to accommodate. This paper presents
an algorithm for simulating the movement
of agents based on observed human behav-
ior using techniques developed for pedes-
trian movement in crowd simulations. We
extend a previous group conversation simu-
lation to include an agent motion algorithm.
We examine several test cases and show how
the simulation generates results that mirror
real-life conversation settings.
