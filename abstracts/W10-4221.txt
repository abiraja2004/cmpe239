In this paper we describe a cross-linguistic
experiment in attribute selection for refer-
ring expression generation. We used a
graph-based attribute selection algorithm
that was trained and cross-evaluated on
English and Dutch data. The results indi-
cate that attribute selection can be done in
a largely language independent way.
