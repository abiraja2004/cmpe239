In this paper, we evaluate five distinct sys-
tems of labelled grammatical dependency
against the kind of input we require for se-
mantic interpretation, in particular for the
deep semantic interpreter underlying a tu-
torial dialogue system. We focus on the
following linguistic phenomena: passive,
control and raising, noun modifiers, and
meaningful vs. non-meaningful preposi-
tions. We conclude that no one system
provides all the features that we require,
although each such feature is contained
within at least one of the competing sys-
tems.
