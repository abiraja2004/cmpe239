In spoken dialog systems, statistical state
tracking aims to improve robustness to
speech recognition errors by tracking a
posterior distribution over hidden dialog
states. Current approaches based on gener-
ative or discriminative models have differ-
ent but important shortcomings that limit
their accuracy. In this paper we discuss
these limitations and introduce a new ap-
proach for discriminative state tracking
that overcomes them by leveraging the
problem structure. An offline evaluation
with dialog data collected from real users
shows improvements in both state track-
ing accuracy and the quality of the pos-
terior probabilities. Features that encode
speech recognition error patterns are par-
ticularly helpful, and training requires rel-
atively few dialogs.
