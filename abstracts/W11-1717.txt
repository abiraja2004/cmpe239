The new trend in sentiment classification is
to use semantic features for representation
of documents. We propose a semantic space
based on WordNet senses for a supervised
document-level sentiment classifier. Not only
does this show a better performance for sen-
timent classification, it also opens opportuni-
ties for building a robust sentiment classifier.
We examine the possibility of using similar-
ity metrics defined on WordNet to address the
problem of not finding a sense in the training
corpus. Using three popular similarity met-
rics, we replace unknown synsets in the test
set with a similar synset from the training set.
An improvement of 6.2% is seen with respect
to baseline using this approach.
