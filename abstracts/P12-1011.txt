Temporal reasoners for document understand-
ing typically assume that a document?s cre-
ation date is known. Algorithms to ground
relative time expressions and order events of-
ten rely on this timestamp to assist the learner.
Unfortunately, the timestamp is not always
known, particularly on the Web. This pa-
per addresses the task of automatic document
timestamping, presenting two new models that
incorporate rich linguistic features about time.
The first is a discriminative classifier with
new features extracted from the text?s time
expressions (e.g., ?since 1999?). This model
alone improves on previous generative mod-
els by 77%. The second model learns prob-
abilistic constraints between time expressions
and the unknown document time. Imposing
these learned constraints on the discriminative
model further improves its accuracy. Finally,
we present a new experiment design that facil-
itates easier comparison by future work.
