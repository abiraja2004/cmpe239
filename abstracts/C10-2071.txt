 
Statistical word alignment often suffers 
from data sparseness. Part-of-speeches 
are often incorporated in NLP tasks to 
reduce data sparseness. In this paper, 
we attempt to mitigate such problem by 
reflecting alignment tendency between 
part-of-speeches to statistical word 
alignment. Because our approach does 
not rely on any language-dependent 
knowledge, it is very simple and purely 
statistic to be applied to any language 
pairs. End-to-end evaluation shows that 
the proposed method can improve not 
only the quality of statistical word 
alignment but the performance of sta-
tistical machine translation.
