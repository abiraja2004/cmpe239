This paper presents a general-purpose
open source package for recognizing Tex-
tual Entailment. The system implements a
collection of algorithms, providing a con-
figurable framework to quickly set up a
working environment to experiment with
the RTE task. Fast prototyping of new
solutions is also allowed by the possibil-
ity to extend its modular architecture. We
present the tool as a useful resource to ap-
proach the Textual Entailment problem, as
an instrument for didactic purposes, and as
an opportunity to create a collaborative en-
vironment to promote research in the field.
