tion (WSD) system developed for English 
lexical sample task (Task 11) of Semeval 
2007 by Information Retrieval Lab, Harbin 
Institute of Technology. The system is 
based on a supervised method using an 
SVM classifier. Multi-resources including 
words in the surrounding context, the part-
of-speech of neighboring words, colloca-
tions and syntactic relations are used. The 
final micro-avg raw score achieves 81.9% 
on the test set, the best one among partici-
pating runs.
