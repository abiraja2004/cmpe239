Automatic tools for analyzing student online 
discussions are highly desirable for providing 
better assistance and promoting discussion 
participation. This paper presents an approach 
for identifying student discussions with unre-
solved issues or unanswered questions. In or-
der to handle highly incoherent data, we 
perform several data processing steps. We 
then apply a two-phase classification algo-
rithm. First, we classify ?speech acts? of indi-
vidual messages to identify the roles that the 
messages play, such as question, issue raising, 
and answers. We then use the resulting speech 
acts as features for classifying discussion 
threads with unanswered questions or unre-
solved issues. We performed a preliminary 
analysis of the classifiers and the system 
shows an average F score of 0.76 in discus-
sion thread classification.
