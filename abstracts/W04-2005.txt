GREVAL, the test suite of 500 English sentences
taken from SUSANNE Corpus and made
available by John Carroll and Ted Briscoe at their
website, has been used to test the performance of
a symbolic linguistically-based parser called
GETARUNS presented in (Delmonte, 2002).
GETARUNS is a symbolic linguistically-based
parser written in Prolog Horn clauses which uses
a strong deterministic policy by means of a
lookahead mechanism and a WFST. The grammar
allows the specification of linguistic rules in a
highly declarative mode: it works topdown and by
making a heavy use of linguistic knowledge may
achieve an almost complete deterministic policy:
in this sense it is equivalent to an LR parser. The
results obtained fare higher that the ones reported
in (Preis, 2003) and this we argue is due basically
to the symbolic rule-based approach: we reach
96% precision (coverage) and 84% recall
(accuracy). We assume that from a
psycholinguistic point of view, parsing requires
setting up a number of disambiguating strategies,
to tell arguments apart from adjuncts and reduce
the effects of backtracking. To do that the system
is based on LFG theoretical framework and uses
Grammatical Functions information to help the
parser cope with syntactic ambiguity. In the paper
we shall comment on some shortcomings of the
Greval corpus annotation and more in general we
shall criticize some aspects of the Dependency
Structure representation.
