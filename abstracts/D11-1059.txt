In this paper we present a fully unsupervised
syntactic class induction system formulated as
a Bayesian multinomial mixture model, where
each word type is constrained to belong to a
single class. By using a mixture model rather
than a sequence model (e.g., HMM), we are
able to easily add multiple kinds of features,
including those at both the type level (mor-
phology features) and token level (context and
alignment features, the latter from parallel cor-
pora). Using only context features, our sys-
tem yields results comparable to state-of-the
art, far better than a similar model without the
one-class-per-type constraint. Using the addi-
tional features provides added benefit, and our
final system outperforms the best published
results on most of the 25 corpora tested.
