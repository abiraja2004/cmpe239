Spoken queries are a natural medium for searching
the Web in settings where typing on a keyboard is
not practical. This paper describes a speech inter-
face to the Google search engine. We present ex-
periments with various statistical language models,
concluding that a unigram model with collocations
provides the best combination of broad coverage,
predictive power, and real-time performance. We
also report accuracy results of the prototype sys-
tem.
