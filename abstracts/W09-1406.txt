In this paper we describe our entry to the
BioNLP 2009 Shared Task regarding bio-
molecular event extraction. Our work can
be described by three design decisions: (1)
instead of building a pipeline using local
classifier technology, we design and learn
a joint probabilistic model over events in
a sentence; (2) instead of developing spe-
cific inference and learning algorithms for
our joint model, we apply Markov Logic, a
general purpose Statistical Relation Learn-
ing language, for this task; (3) we represent
events as relational structures over the to-
kens of a sentence, as opposed to structures
that explicitly mention abstract event en-
tities. Our results are competitive: we
achieve the 4th best scores for task 1 (in
close range to the 3rd place) and the best
results for task 2 with a 13 percent point
margin.
