This paper presents an application of PageR-
ank, a random-walk model originally de-
vised for ranking Web search results, to
ranking WordNet synsets in terms of how
strongly they possess a given semantic prop-
erty. The semantic properties we use for ex-
emplifying the approach are positivity and
negativity, two properties of central impor-
tance in sentiment analysis. The idea derives
from the observation that WordNet may be
seen as a graph in which synsets are con-
nected through the binary relation ?a term
belonging to synset sk occurs in the gloss
of synset si?, and on the hypothesis that
this relation may be viewed as a transmit-
ter of such semantic properties. The data
for this relation can be obtained from eX-
tended WordNet, a publicly available sense-
disambiguated version of WordNet. We ar-
gue that this relation is structurally akin to
the relation between hyperlinked Web pages,
and thus lends itself to PageRank analysis.
We report experimental results supporting
our intuitions.
