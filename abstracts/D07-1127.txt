In the paper we describe a dependency
parser that uses exact search and global
learning (Crammer et al, 2006) to produce
labelled dependency trees. Our system inte-
grates the task of learning tree structure and
learning labels in one step, using the same
set of features for both tasks. During la-
bel prediction, the system automatically se-
lects for each feature an appropriate level
of smoothing. We report on several exper-
iments that we conducted with our system.
In the shared task evaluation, it scored better
than average.
