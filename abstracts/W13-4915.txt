This paper presents our preliminary conclu-
sions as part of an ongoing effort to construct a
new dependency representation framework for
Turkish. We aim for this new framework to ac-
commodate the highly agglutinative morphol-
ogy of Turkish as well as to allow the annota-
tion of unedited web data, and shape our deci-
sions around these considerations. In this pa-
per, we firstly describe a novel syntactic repre-
sentation for morphosyntactic sub-word units
(namely inflectional groups (IGs) in Turkish)
which allows inter-IG relations to be discerned
with perfect accuracy without having to hide
lexical information. Secondly, we investigate
alternative annotation schemes for coordina-
tion structures and present a better scheme
(nearly 11% increase in recall scores) than the
one in Turkish Treebank (Oflazer et al, 2003)
for both parsing accuracies and compatibility
for colloquial language.
