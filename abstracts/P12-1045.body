Learning a semantic lexicon is often an impor-
tant first step in building a system that learns
to interpret the meaning of natural language.
It is especially important in language ground-
ing where the training data usually consist of
language paired with an ambiguous perceptual
context. Recent work by Chen and Mooney
(2011) introduced a lexicon learning method
that deals with ambiguous relational data by
taking intersections of graphs. While the al-
gorithm produced good lexicons for the task of
learning to interpret navigation instructions, it
only works in batch settings and does not scale
well to large datasets. In this paper we intro-
duce a new online algorithm that is an order
of magnitude faster and surpasses the state-
of-the-art results. We show that by changing
the grammar of the formal meaning represen-
tation language and training on additional data
collected from Amazon?s Mechanical Turk we
can further improve the results. We also in-
clude experimental results on a Chinese trans-
lation of the training data to demonstrate the
generality of our approach.
