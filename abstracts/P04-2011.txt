The Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for
part-of-speech (POS) tagging is typi-
cally based on tag trigrams. As such
it models local context but not global
context, leaving long-distance syntactic
relations unrepresented. Using n-gram
models for n > 3 in order to incorporate
global context is problematic as the tag
sequences corresponding to higher order
models will become increasingly rare in
training data, leading to incorrect esti-
mations of their probabilities.
The trigram HMM can be extended with
global contextual information, without
making the model infeasible, by incor-
porating the context separately from the
POS tags. The new information incor-
porated in the model is acquired through
the use of a wide-coverage parser. The
model is trained and tested on Dutch text
from two different sources, showing an
increase in tagging accuracy compared
to tagging using the standard model.
