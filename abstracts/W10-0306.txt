body of commonsense knowledge about the 
basic relationships between concepts we find 
everyday in our world in order to produce in-
teresting narratives that describe human ac-
tions and world events. This paper presents an 
ongoing work that investigates the use of 
Suggested Upper Merged Ontology (SUMO) 
to represent storytelling knowledge and its in-
ference engine Sigma to query actions and 
events that may take place in the story to be 
generated. The resulting story plan (fabula) is 
also represented in SUMO, allowing for a sin-
gle story representation to be realized in vari-
ous human languages.
