 
The aim of the paper is to present an Open Source 
Learning Management System for creating courses 
in translation theory and practice. Some of its most 
important characteristics are: 
? Choice of course formats such as by week, 
by topic or social format 
? Flexible array of course activities - 
Forums, Journals, Quizzes, Resources, 
Choices, Surveys, Assignments 
? Full user logging and tracking - activity 
reports for each student are available 
? Mail integration - copies of forum posts 
and teacher feedback can be mailed 
? Assignment Module with due date and 
grade requirements  
The training includes the use of corpora (mono- 
and bilingual) and TM tools, with tasks ranging 
from alignment of texts and creating a translation 
memory, to terminology extraction from 
specialized comparable language corpora and other 
translation projects.
