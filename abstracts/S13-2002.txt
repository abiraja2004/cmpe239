The ClearTK-TimeML submission to Temp-
Eval 2013 competed in all English tasks: identi-
fying events, identifying times, and identifying
temporal relations. The system is a pipeline of
machine-learning models, each with a small set
of features from a simple morpho-syntactic an-
notation pipeline, and where temporal relations
are only predicted for a small set of syntac-
tic constructions and relation types. ClearTK-
TimeML ranked 1st for temporal relation F1,
time extent strict F1 and event tense accuracy.
