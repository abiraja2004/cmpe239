This paper studies issues on compiling
a bilingual lexicon for technical terms.
In the task of estimating bilingual term
correspondences of technical terms, it
is usually quite difficult to find an exist-
ing corpus for the domain of such tech-
nical terms. In this paper, we take an
approach of collecting a corpus for the
domain of such technical terms from
the Web. As a method of translation
estimation for technical terms, we pro-
pose a compositional translation esti-
mation technique. Through experimen-
tal evaluation, we show that the do-
main/topic specific corpus contributes
to improving the performance of the
compositional translation estimation.
