We evaluate the performance of an morpho-
logical analyser for Inuktitut across a medium-
sized corpus, where it produces a useful anal-
ysis for two out of every three types. We
then compare its segmentation to that of sim-
pler approaches to morphology, and use these
as a pre-processing step to a word alignment
task. Our observations show that the richer ap-
proaches provide little as compared to simply
finding the head, which is more in line with
the particularities of the task.
