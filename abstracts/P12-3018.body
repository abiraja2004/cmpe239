We present a component for incremental
speech synthesis (iSS) and a set of applications
that demonstrate its capabilities. This compo-
nent can be used to increase the responsivity
and naturalness of spoken interactive systems.
While iSS can show its full strength in systems
that generate output incrementally, we also dis-
cuss how even otherwise unchanged systems
may profit from its capabilities.
