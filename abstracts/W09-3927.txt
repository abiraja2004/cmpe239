 
This paper is part of our broader investi-
gation into the utility of discourse struc-
ture for performance analysis. In our pre-
vious work, we showed that several in-
teraction parameters that use discourse 
structure predict our performance metric. 
Here, we take a step forward and show 
that these correlations are not only a sur-
face relationship. We show that redesign-
ing the system in light of an interpreta-
tion of a correlation has a positive impact.
