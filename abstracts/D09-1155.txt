Argumentative Zoning (AZ) is an anal-
ysis of the argumentative and rhetorical
structure of a scientific paper. It has been
shown to be reliably used by independent
human coders, and has proven useful for
various information access tasks. Annota-
tion experiments have however so far been
restricted to one discipline, computational
linguistics (CL). Here, we present a more
informative AZ scheme with 15 categories
in place of the original 7, and show that
it can be applied to the life sciences as
well as to CL. We use a domain expert
to encode basic knowledge about the sub-
ject (such as terminology and domain spe-
cific rules for individual categories) as part
of the annotation guidelines. Our results
show that non-expert human coders can
then use these guidelines to reliably an-
notate this scheme in two domains, chem-
istry and computational linguistics.
