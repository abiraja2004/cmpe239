  Mbochi: oral corpus, automatic processing & phonological mining  This contribution describes ongoing research on Mbochi, a Bantu C language spoken by more than 100000 native speakers in Congo-Brazzaville. A first oral corpus has been collected as read speech corresponding to 3 folktales. It has been transcribed by one of the co-authors and it will be extended to radio broadcasts. The corpus is aligned automatically into words and phonemic segments, allowing acoustic-phonetic and phonological studies on a large scale. It is providing the first step towards an automatic transcription system for this under-resourced language. Currently, these resources allow us to improve the description of the language and to improve our knowledge of the nature and conditions of phonological processes such as vowel elision with or without compensatory lengthening at word junctions. The corpus which will contribute to the documentation of Mbochi and its visibility on the web, will be made available to other researchers. MOTS-CLES : mbochi, alignement automatique, ?lision vocalique, dissimilation consonantique.  KEYWORDS : Mbochi, automatic alignment, vowel elision, consonantal dissimilation
