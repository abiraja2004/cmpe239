In this paper we propose a framework
of verb semantic description in order to
organize different granularity of similar-
ity between verbs. Since verb mean-
ings highly depend on their arguments
we propose a verb thesaurus on the ba-
sis of possible shared meanings with
predicate-argument structure. Motiva-
tions of this work are to (1) construct a
practical lexicon for dealing with alter-
nations, paraphrases and entailment re-
lations between predicates, and (2) pro-
vide a basic database for statistical learn-
ing system as well as a theoretical lex-
icon study such as Generative Lexicon
and Lexical Conceptual Structure. One
of the characteristics of our description
is that we assume several granularities
of semantic classes to characterize verb
meanings. The thesaurus form allows us
to provide several granularities of shared
meanings; thus, this gives us a further re-
vision for applying more detailed analy-
ses of verb meanings.
