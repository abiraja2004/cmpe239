Beam search incremental parsers are ac-
curate, but not as fast as they could be.
We demonstrate that, contrary to popu-
lar belief, most current implementations
of beam parsers in fact run in O(n2),
rather than linear time, because each state-
transition is actually implemented as an
O(n) operation. We present an improved
implementation, based on Tree Structured
Stack (TSS), in which a transition is per-
formed in O(1), resulting in a real linear-
time algorithm, which is verified empiri-
cally. We further improve parsing speed
by sharing feature-extraction and dot-
product across beam items. Practically,
our methods combined offer a speedup of
?2x over strong baselines on Penn Tree-
bank sentences, and are orders of magni-
tude faster on much longer sentences.
