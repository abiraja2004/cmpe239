In this paper we look at the problem of
cleansing noisy text using a statistical ma-
chine translation model. Noisy text is pro-
duced in informal communications such
as Short Message Service (SMS), Twit-
ter and chat. A typical Statistical Ma-
chine Translation system is trained on par-
allel text comprising noisy and clean sen-
tences. In this paper we propose an un-
supervised method for the translation of
noisy text to clean text. Our method has
two steps. For a given noisy sentence, a
weighted list of possible clean tokens for
each noisy token are obtained. The clean
sentence is then obtained by maximizing
the product of the weighted lists and the
language model scores.
