 
In this paper, we present EXEMPLARS, an object-oriented, rule-based framework designed to support 
practical, dynamic text generation, emphasizing its novel features compared to .existing hybrid systems 
that mix template-style and more sophisticated techniques. These features-.include an extensible 
classification-based text planning mechanism, a definition language that is a superset of the Java 
language, and advanced support for HTMIdSGML templates.
