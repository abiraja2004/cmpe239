In this work we present an approach
to the development of the BA-
SURDE
1
dialogue system, which an-
swers telephone queries about rail-
way timetables in Spanish. We will
focus on the understanding and di-
alogue components which are mod-
eled under a stochastic framework.
The preliminary results from seman-
tic and dialogue interpretations of
user dialogue turns are also included
in this work.
