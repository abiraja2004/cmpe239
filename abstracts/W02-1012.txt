This paper describes improved HMM-based word
level alignment models for statistical machine
translation. We present a method for using part of
speech tag information to improve alignment accu-
racy, and an approach to modeling fertility and cor-
respondence to the empty word in an HMM align-
ment model. We present accuracy results from eval-
uating Viterbi alignments against human-judged
alignments on the Canadian Hansards corpus, as
compared to a bigram HMM, and IBM model 4.
The results show up to 16% alignment error reduc-
tion.
