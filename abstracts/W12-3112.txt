This paper describes Uppsala University?s
submissions to the Quality Estimation (QE)
shared task at WMT 2012. We present a QE
system based on Support Vector Machine re-
gression, using a number of explicitly defined
features extracted from the Machine Transla-
tion input, output and models in combination
with tree kernels over constituency and de-
pendency parse trees for the input and output
sentences. We confirm earlier results suggest-
ing that tree kernels can be a useful tool for
QE system construction especially in the early
stages of system design.
