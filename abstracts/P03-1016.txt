 
Automatically acquiring synonymous col-
location pairs such as <turn on, OBJ, light> 
and <switch on, OBJ, light> from corpora 
is a challenging task. For this task, we can, 
in general, have a large monolingual corpus 
and/or a very limited bilingual corpus. 
Methods that use monolingual corpora 
alone or use bilingual corpora alone are 
apparently inadequate because of low pre-
cision or low coverage. In this paper, we 
propose a method that uses both these re-
sources to get an optimal compromise of 
precision and coverage. This method first 
gets candidates of synonymous collocation 
pairs based on a monolingual corpus and a 
word thesaurus, and then selects the ap-
propriate pairs from the candidates using 
their translations in a second language. The 
translations of the candidates are obtained 
with a statistical translation model which is 
trained with a small bilingual corpus and a 
large monolingual corpus. The translation 
information is proved as effective to select 
synonymous collocation pairs. Experi-
mental results indicate that the average 
precision and recall of our approach are 
74% and 64% respectively, which outper-
form those methods that only use mono-
lingual corpora and those that only use bi-
lingual corpora.
