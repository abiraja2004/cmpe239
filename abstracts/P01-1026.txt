We propose a method to generate large-scale
encyclopedic knowledge, which is valuable
for much NLP research, based on the Web.
We first search the Web for pages contain-
ing a term in question. Then we use lin-
guistic patterns and HTML structures to ex-
tract text fragments describing the term. Fi-
nally, we organize extracted term descrip-
tions based on word senses and domains. In
addition, we apply an automatically gener-
ated encyclopedia to a question answering
system targeting the Japanese Information-
Technology Engineers Examination.
