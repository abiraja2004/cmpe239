In this paper, we propose a bilingual lexi-
cal cohesion trigger model to capture lex-
ical cohesion for document-level machine
translation. We integrate the model into
hierarchical phrase-based machine trans-
lation and achieve an absolute improve-
ment of 0.85 BLEU points on average over
the baseline on NIST Chinese-English test
sets.
