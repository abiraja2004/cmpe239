 
The formal architecture of Lexical Func- 
tional Grammar offers a particular formal 
device, the structural correspondence, for 
modularizing the mapping between the sur- 
face forms of a language and representa- 
tions of their underlying meanings. This 
approach works well when the structural 
discrepancies between form and meaning 
representations are finitely bounded, but 
there are some phenomena in natural an- 
guage, e.g. adverbs in English, where this 
restriction does not hold. In this paper, we 
describe rule-based type-driven interpreta- 
tion algorithms which cover cases of such 
a structural misalignment by exploiting a 
new descriptive device, the "restriction op- 
erator". The algorithms are set up in such 
a way that recursive rules can be derived 
for the interpretation f adjunct sets within 
a codescripiion approach (see \[Kaplan and 
Wedekind, 1993\] for details).
