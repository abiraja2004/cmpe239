In Japanese, particularly, spoken Japanese,
subjective, objective and possessive cases are
very often omitted. Such Japanese sentences
are often translated by Japanese-English sta-
tistical machine translation to the English sen-
tence whose subjective, objective and posses-
sive cases are omitted, and it causes to de-
crease the quality of translation. We per-
formed experiments of J-E phrase based trans-
lation using Japanese sentence, whose omitted
pronouns are complemented by human. We
introduced ?antecedent F-measure? as a score
for measuring quality of the translated En-
glish. As a result, we found that it improves
the scores of antecedent F-measure while the
BLEU scores were almost unchanged. Every
effectiveness of the zero pronoun resolution
differs depending on the type and case of each
zero pronoun.
