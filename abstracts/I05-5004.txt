Towards deep analysis of composi-
tional classes of paraphrases, we have
examined a class-oriented framework
for collecting paraphrase examples, in
which sentential paraphrases are col-
lected for each paraphrase class sep-
arately by means of automatic can-
didate generation and manual judge-
ment. Our preliminary experiments on
building a paraphrase corpus have so
far been producing promising results,
which we have evaluated according to
cost-efficiency, exhaustiveness, and re-
liability.
