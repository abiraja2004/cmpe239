In this paper, we provide descriptive and
empirical approaches to effectively ex-
tracting underlying dependencies among
parsing errors. In the descriptive ap-
proach, we define some combinations of
error patterns and extract them from given
errors. In the empirical approach, on the
other hand, we re-parse a sentence with
a target error corrected and observe er-
rors corrected together. Experiments on
an HPSG parser show that each of these
approaches can clarify the dependencies
among individual errors from each point
of view. Moreover, the comparison be-
tween the results of the two approaches
shows that combining these approaches
can achieve a more detailed error analysis.
