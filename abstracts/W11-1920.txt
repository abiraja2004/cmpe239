This paper describes our entry to the 2011 CoNLL
closed task (Pradhan et al, 2011) on modeling un-
restricted coreference in OntoNotes. Our system is
based on the Reconcile coreference resolution re-
search platform. Reconcile is a general software in-
frastructure for the development of learning-based
noun phrase (NP) coreference resolution systems.
Our entry for the CoNLL closed task is a configura-
tion of Reconcile intended to do well on OntoNotes
data. This paper describes our configuration of Rec-
oncile as well as the changes that we had to imple-
ment to integrate with the OntoNotes task definition
and data formats. We also present and discuss the
performance of our system under different testing
conditions on a withheld validation set.
