Question terminology is a set of terms which ap
pear in keywords idioms and xed expressions
commonly observed in questions This paper
investigates ways to automatically extract ques
tion terminology from a corpus of questions and
represent them for the purpose of classifying by
question type Our key interest is to see whether
or not semantic features can enhance the repre
sentation of strongly lexical nature of question
sentences We compare two feature sets one
with lexical features only and another with a
mixture of lexical and semantic features For
evaluation we measure the classication accu
racy made by two machine learning algorithms
C and PEBLS by using a procedure called
domain crossvalidation which eectively mea
sures the domain transferability of features
