Hierarchical Hidden Markov Model
(HHMM) parsers have been proposed as
psycholinguistic models due to their broad
coverage within human-like working
memory limits (Schuler et al, 2008) and
ability to model human reading time
behavior according to various complexity
metrics (Wu et al, 2010). But HHMMs
have been evaluated previously only with
very wide beams of several thousand
parallel hypotheses, weakening claims to
the model?s efficiency and psychological
relevance. This paper examines the effects
of varying beam width on parsing accu-
racy and speed in this model, showing that
parsing accuracy degrades gracefully as
beam width decreases dramatically (to 2%
of the width used to achieve previous top
results), without sacrificing gains over a
baseline CKY parser.
