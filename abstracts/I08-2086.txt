To transliterate foreign words, in Japanese
and Korean, phonograms, such as Katakana
and Hangul, are used. In Chinese, the
pronunciation of a source word is spelled
out using Kanji characters. Because Kanji
is ideogrammatic representation, different
Kanji characters are associated with the
same pronunciation, but can potentially con-
vey different meanings and impressions. To
select appropriate Kanji characters, an ex-
isting method requests the user to provide
one or more related terms for a source word,
which is time-consuming and expensive. In
this paper, to reduce this human effort, we
use the World Wide Web to extract related
terms for source words. We show the effec-
tiveness of our method experimentally.
