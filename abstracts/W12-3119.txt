We in this paper describe the regression sys-
tem for our participation in the quality estima-
tion task of WMT12. This paper focuses on
exploiting special phrases, or word sequences,
to estimate translation quality. Several feature
templates on this topic are put forward sub-
sequently. We train a SVM regression model
for predicting the scores and numerical results
show the effectiveness of our phrase indicators
and method in both ranking and scoring tasks.
