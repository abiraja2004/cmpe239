In this work we propose a transla-
tion model for monolingual sentence
retrieval. We propose four methods
for constructing a parallel corpus. Of
the four methods proposed, a lexi-
con learned from a bilingual Arabic-
English corpus aligned at the sentence
level performs best, significantly im-
proving results over the query likeli-
hood baseline. Further, we demon-
strate that smoothing from the local
context of the sentence improves re-
trieval over the query likelihood base-
line.
