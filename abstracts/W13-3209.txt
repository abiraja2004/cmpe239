With the increasing empirical success of
distributional models of compositional se-
mantics, it is timely to consider the types
of textual logic that such models are ca-
pable of capturing. In this paper, we ad-
dress shortcomings in the ability of cur-
rent models to capture logical operations
such as negation. As a solution we pro-
pose a tripartite formulation for a continu-
ous vector space representation of seman-
tics and subsequently use this representa-
tion to develop a formal compositional no-
tion of negation within such models.
