In this paper, we propose two methods for
analyzing errors in parsing. One is to clas-
sify errors into categories which grammar
developers can easily associate with de-
fects in grammar or a parsing model and
thus its improvement. The other is to
discover inter-dependencies among errors,
and thus grammar developers can focus on
errors which are crucial for improving the
performance of a parsing model.
The first method uses patterns of er-
rors to associate them with categories of
causes for those errors, such as errors in
scope determination of coordination, PP-
attachment, identification of antecedent of
relative clauses, etc. On the other hand,
the second method, which is based on re-
parsing with one of observed errors cor-
rected, assesses inter-dependencies among
errors by examining which other errors
were to be corrected as a result if a spe-
cific error was corrected.
Experiments show that these two meth-
ods are complementary and by being com-
bined, they can provide useful clues as to
how to improve a given grammar.
