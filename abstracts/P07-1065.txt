A Bloom filter (BF) is a randomised data
structure for set membership queries. Its
space requirements are significantly below
lossless information-theoretic lower bounds
but it produces false positives with some
quantifiable probability. Here we explore the
use of BFs for language modelling in statis-
tical machine translation.
We show how a BF containing n-grams can
enable us to use much larger corpora and
higher-order models complementing a con-
ventional n-gram LM within an SMT sys-
tem. We also consider (i) how to include ap-
proximate frequency information efficiently
within a BF and (ii) how to reduce the er-
ror rate of these models by first checking for
lower-order sub-sequences in candidate n-
grams. Our solutions in both cases retain the
one-sided error guarantees of the BF while
taking advantage of the Zipf-like distribution
of word frequencies to reduce the space re-
quirements.
