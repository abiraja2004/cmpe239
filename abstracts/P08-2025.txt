Question answering communities such as Ya-
hoo! Answers have emerged as a popular al-
ternative to general-purpose web search. By
directly interacting with other participants, in-
formation seekers can obtain specific answers
to their questions. However, user success in
obtaining satisfactory answers varies greatly.
We hypothesize that satisfaction with the con-
tributed answers is largely determined by the
asker?s prior experience, expectations, and
personal preferences. Hence, we begin to de-
velop personalized models of asker satisfac-
tion to predict whether a particular question
author will be satisfied with the answers con-
tributed by the community participants. We
formalize this problem, and explore a variety
of content, structure, and interaction features
for this task using standard machine learning
techniques. Our experimental evaluation over
thousands of real questions indicates that in-
deed it is beneficial to personalize satisfaction
predictions when sufficient prior user history
exists, significantly improving accuracy over
a ?one-size-fits-all? prediction model.
