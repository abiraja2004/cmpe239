Abstract 
Syntactic realization grammars have tradi- 
tionally attempted to accept inputs with the 
highest possible level of abstraction, in or- 
der to facilitate the work of the compo- 
nents (sentence planner) preparing the in- 
put. Recently, the search for higher ab- 
straction has been, however, challenged (E1- 
hadad and Robin, 1996)(Lavoie and Ram- 
bow, 1997)(Busemann a d Horacek, 1998). 
In this paper, we contribute to the issue of 
selecting the "ideal" abstraction level in the 
input to syntactic realization grammar by 
considering the case of partitives and pos- 
sessives in a bilingual Hebrew-English gen- 
eration grammar. In the case of bilingual 
generation, the ultimate goal is to provide a 
single input structure, where only the open- 
class lexical entries are specific to the lan- 
guage. In that case, the minimal abstraction 
required must cover the different syntactic 
constraints of the two languages. 
We present a contrastive analysis of the 
syntactic realizations of possessives and par- 
titives in Hebrew and English and conclude 
by presenting an input specification for com- 
plex NPs which is slightly more abstract 
than the one used in SURGE. We define two 
main features -possessor and rejLset, and 
? discuss how the grammar handles complex 
syntactic o-occurrence phenomena based on 
this input. We conclude by evaluating how 
the resulting input specification language is 
appropriate for both languages.
