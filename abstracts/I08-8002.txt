 
A speech-to-speech translation project 
(S2S) has been conducted since 2006 by 
the Human Language Technology labora-
tory at the National Electronics and Com-
puter Technology Center (NECTEC) in 
Thailand. During the past one year, there 
happened a lot of activities regarding tech-
nologies constituted for S2S, including 
automatic speech recognition (ASR), ma-
chine translation (MT), text-to-speech syn-
thesis (TTS), as well as technology for lan-
guage resource and fundamental tool de-
velopment. A developed prototype of Eng-
lish-to-Thai S2S has opened several re-
search issues, which has been taken into 
consideration. This article intensively re-
ports all major research and development 
activities and points out remaining issues 
for the rest two years of the project.
