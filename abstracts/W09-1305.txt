We explore a rule system and a machine learn-
ing (ML) approach to automatically harvest
information on gene regulation events (GREs)
from biological documents in two different
evaluation scenarios ? one uses self-supplied
corpora in a clean lab setting, while the other
incorporates a standard reference database of
curated GREs from REGULONDB, real-life
data generated independently from our work.
In the lab condition, we test how feasible
the automatic extraction of GREs really is
and achieve F-scores, under different, not di-
rectly comparable test conditions though, for
the rule and the ML systems which amount
to 34% and 44%, respectively. In the REGU-
LONDB condition, we investigate how robust
both methodologies are by comparing them
with this routinely used database. Here, the
best F-scores for the rule and the ML systems
amount to 34% and 19%, respectively.
