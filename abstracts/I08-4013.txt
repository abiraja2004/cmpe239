 
Chinese word segmentation (CWS), named 
entity recognition (NER) and part-of-
speech tagging is the lexical processing in 
Chinese language. This paper describes the 
work on these tasks done by France Tele-
com Team (Beijing) at the fourth Interna-
tional Chinese Language Processing Bake-
off. In particular, we employ Conditional 
Random Fields with different features for 
these tasks. In order to improve NER rela-
tively low recall; we exploit non-local fea-
tures and alleviate class imbalanced distri-
bution on NER dataset to enhance the re-
call and keep its relatively high precision. 
Some other post-processing measures such 
as consistency checking and transforma-
tion-based error-driven learning are used to 
improve word segmentation performance. 
Our systems participated in most CWS and 
POS tagging evaluations and all the NER 
tracks. As a result, our NER system 
achieves the first ranks on MSRA open 
track and MSRA/CityU closed track. Our 
CWS system achieves the first rank on 
CityU open track, which means that our 
systems achieve state-of-the-art perform-
ance on Chinese lexical processing.
