Anticipating the availability of large question-
answer datasets, we propose a principled, data-
driven Instance-Based approach to Question An-
swering. Most question answering systems incor-
porate three major steps: classify questions accord-
ing to answer types, formulate queries for document
retrieval, and extract actual answers. Under our ap-
proach, strategies for answering new questions are
directly learned from training data. We learn mod-
els of answer type, query content, and answer ex-
traction from clusters of similar questions. We view
the answer type as a distribution, rather than a class
in an ontology. In addition to query expansion, we
learn general content features from training data and
use them to enhance the queries. Finally, we treat
answer extraction as a binary classification problem
in which text snippets are labeled as correct or in-
correct answers. We present a basic implementation
of these concepts that achieves a good performance
on TREC test data.
