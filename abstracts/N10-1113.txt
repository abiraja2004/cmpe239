We present a method for disambiguating syn-
tactic subjects from syntactic objects (a fre-
quent ambiguity) in German sentences taken
from an English-German bitext. We exploit
the fact that subject and object are usually eas-
ily determined in English. We show that a
simple method disambiguates some subject-
object ambiguities in German, while making
few errors. We view this procedure as the first
step in automatically acquiring (mostly) cor-
rect labeled data. We also evaluate using it to
improve a state of the art statistical parser.
