 
This paper is a contribution to the issue ? 
which has, in  the course of the last decade, 
become critical ? of the basic requirements 
and validation criteria for lexical language 
resources in Standard Arabic. The work is 
based on a critical analysis of the architecture 
of the DIINAR.1 lexical database, the entries 
of which are associated with grammar-lexis 
relations operating at word-form level (i.e. in 
morphological analysis). Investigation shows a 
crucial difference, in the concept of ?lexical 
database?, between source program and 
generated lexica. The source program un-
derlying DIINAR.1 is analysed, and some fig-
ures and ratios are presented. The original 
categorisations are, in the course of scrutiny, 
partly revisited. Results and ratios given here 
for basic entries on the one hand, and for 
generated lexica of inflected word-forms on 
the other. They aim at giving a first answer to 
the question of the ratios between the number 
of lemma-entries and inflected word-forms 
that can be expected to be included in, or 
generated by, a Standard Arabic lexical dB. 
These ratios can be considered as one overall 
language-specific criterion for the analysis, 
evaluation and validation of lexical dB-s in 
Arabic. 
 
Keywords: Arabic lexical databases ? Arabic 
script ? word-formatives grammar ? lemma-
entries ? morphosyntactic specifiers.
