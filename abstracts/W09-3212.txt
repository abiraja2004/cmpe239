The first task of statistical computational
linguistics, or any other type of data-
driven processing of language, is the ex-
traction of counts and distributions of phe-
nomena. This is much more difficult for
the type of complex structured data found
in treebanks and in corpora with sophisti-
cated annotation than for tokenized texts.
Recent developments in data mining, par-
ticularly in the extraction of frequent sub-
trees from treebanks, offer some solutions.
We have applied a modified version of the
TreeMiner algorithm to a small treebank
and present some promising results.
