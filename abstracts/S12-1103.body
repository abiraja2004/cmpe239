ried out at Jadavpur University as part of 
the participation in Cross-lingual Textual 
Entailment for Content Synchronization 
(CLTE) of task 8 @ Semantic Evaluation 
Exercises (SemEval-2012). The work ex-
plores cross-lingual textual entailment as a 
relation between two texts in different lan-
guages and proposes different measures 
for entailment decision in a four way clas-
sification tasks (forward, backward, bidi-
rectional and no-entailment). We set up 
different heuristics and measures for eva-
luating the entailment between two texts 
based on lexical relations. Experiments 
have been carried out with both the text 
and hypothesis converted to the same lan-
guage using the Microsoft Bing translation 
system. The entailment system considers 
Named Entity, Noun Chunks, Part of 
speech, N-Gram and some text similarity 
measures of the text pair to decide the en-
tailment judgments. Rules have been de-
veloped to encounter the multi way 
entailment issue. Our system decides on 
the entailment judgment after comparing 
the entailment scores for the text pairs. 
Four different rules have been developed 
for the four different classes of entailment.
