 
Languages with complex morphologies present difficulties for dictionaries users. One solution to this 
problem is to use a morphological parser for lookup of morphologically complex words, including fully 
inflected words, without the user needing to explicitly know the morphology. We discuss the sorts of 
morphologies which cause the greatest need for such an interface.
