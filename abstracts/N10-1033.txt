We describe a synchronous parsing algorithm
that is based on two successive monolingual
parses of an input sentence pair. Although
the worst-case complexity of this algorithm
is and must be O(n
6
) for binary SCFGs,
its average-case run-time is far better. We
demonstrate that for a number of common
synchronous parsing problems, the two-parse
algorithm substantially outperforms alterna-
tive synchronous parsing strategies, making it
efficient enough to be utilized without resort-
ing to a pruned search.
