Color affects every aspect of our lives.
There has been a considerable interest
in the psycholinguistic research area ad-
dressing the impact of color on emotions.
In the experiments conducted by these
studies, subjects have usually been asked
to indicate their emotional responses to
different colors. On the other side, sensing
emotions in text by using NLP techniques
has recently become a popular topic in
computational linguistics. In this paper,
we introduce a semantic similarity mecha-
nism acquired from a large corpus of texts
in order to check the similarity of col-
ors and emotions. Then we investigate
the correlation of our results with the out-
comes of some psycholinguistic experi-
ments. The conclusions are quite inter-
esting. The correlation varies among dif-
ferent colors and globally we achieve very
good results.
