 
Text mining of massive Social Media 
postings presents interesting challenges for 
NLP applications due to sparse 
interpretation contexts, grammatical and 
orthographical variability as well as its very 
fragmentary nature. No single 
methodological approach can be expected to 
work across such diverse typologies as 
twitter micro-blogging, customer reviews, 
carefully edited blogs, etc. In this paper we 
present a modular and scalable framework 
to Social Media Opinion Mining that 
combines stochastic and symbolic 
techniques to structure a semantic space to 
exploit and interpret efficiently. We 
describe the use of this framework for the 
discovery and clustering of opinion targets 
and topics in user-generated comments for 
the Telecom and Automotive domains.
