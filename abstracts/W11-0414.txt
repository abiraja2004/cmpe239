 
We describe our efforts to apply the Penn 
Discourse Treebank guidelines on a Tamil 
corpus to create an annotated corpus of dis-
course relations in Tamil. After conducting 
a preliminary exploratory study on Tamil 
discourse connectives, we show our obser-
vations and results of a pilot experiment 
that we conducted by annotating a small 
portion of our corpus. Our ultimate goal is 
to develop a Tamil Discourse Relation 
Bank that will be useful as a resource for 
further research in Tamil discourse. Fur-
thermore, a study of the behavior of dis-
course connectives in Tamil will also help 
in furthering the cross-linguistic under-
standing of discourse connectives.
