Like text in other domains, biomedical doc-
uments contain a range of terms with more
than one possible meaning. These ambigu-
ities form a significant obstacle to the auto-
matic processing of biomedical texts. Previ-
ous approaches to resolving this problem have
made use of a variety of knowledge sources in-
cluding linguistic information (from the con-
text in which the ambiguous term is used) and
domain-specific resources (such as UMLS). In
this paper we compare a range of knowledge
sources which have been previously used and
introduce a novel one: MeSH terms. The best
performance is obtained using linguistic fea-
tures in combination with MeSH terms. Re-
sults from our system outperform published
results for previously reported systems on a
standard test set (the NLM-WSD corpus).
