  
This paper introduces an efficient analyser for 
the Chinese language, which efficiently and 
effectively integrates  word segmentation, 
part-of-speech tagging, partial parsing and full 
parsing. The Chinese efficient analyser is based 
on a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and an 
HMM-based tagger. That is, all the 
components are based on the same 
HMM-based tagging engine. One advantage of 
using the same single engine is that it largely 
decreases the code size and makes the 
maintenance easy. Another advantage is that it 
is easy to optimise the code and thus improve 
the speed while speed plays a critical important 
role in many applications. Finally, the 
performances of all the components can benefit 
from the optimisation of existing algorithms 
and/or adoption of better algorithms to a single 
engine. Experiments show that all the 
components can achieve state-of-art 
performances with high efficiency for the 
Chinese language.  
The layout of this paper is as follows. Section 2 
describes the Chinese efficient analyser. Section 3 
presents the HMM and the HMM-based tagger. 
Sections 4 and 5 describe the applications of the 
HMM-based tagger in integrated word 
segmentation and part-of-speech tagging, partial 
parsing, and full parsing respectively. Section 6 
gives the experimental results. Finally, some 
conclusions are drawn with possible extensions of 
future work in section 7. 
2 Chinese Efficient Analyser 
The Chinese efficient analyser can be described by 
the example as shown in Figure 1. Here, "." in 
Figure 1 means that the current node has not been 
chunked till now. For convenience, it is regarded as 
a "special chunk" in this paper and others as 
"normal chunks". Therefore, every node in Figure 1 
can be represented as a 3tuple , where  
is the i -th chunk in the input chunk sequence and
