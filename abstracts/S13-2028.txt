 
This paper presents a system for automatically 
generating a set of plausible paraphrases for a 
given noun compound and rank them in de-
creasing order of their usage represented by 
the confidence value provided by the human 
annotators. Our system implements a corpus-
driven probabilistic co-occurrence based 
model for predicting the paraphrases, that uses 
a seed list of paraphrases extracted from cor-
pus to predict other paraphrases based on their 
co-occurrences. The corpus study reveals that 
the prepositional paraphrases for the noun 
compounds are quite frequent and well cov-
ered but the verb paraphrases, on the other 
hand, are scarce, revealing the unsuitability of 
the model for standalone corpus-driven ap-
proach. Therefore, to predict other paraphras-
es, we adopt a two-fold approach: (i) 
Prediction based on Verb-Verb co-
occurrences, in case the seed paraphrases are 
greater than threshold; and (ii) Prediction 
based on Semantic Relation of NC, otherwise. 
The system achieves a comparabale score of 
0.23 for the isomorphic system while main-
taining a score of 0.26 for the non-isomorphic 
system.
