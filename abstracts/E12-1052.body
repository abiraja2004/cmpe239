We present a model of semantic processing
of spoken language that (a) is robust against
ill-formed input, such as can be expected
from automatic speech recognisers, (b) re-
spects both syntactic and pragmatic con-
straints in the computation of most likely
interpretations, (c) uses a principled, ex-
pressive semantic representation formalism
(RMRS) with a well-defined model the-
ory, and (d) works continuously (produc-
ing meaning representations on a word-
by-word basis, rather than only for full
utterances) and incrementally (computing
only the additional contribution by the new
word, rather than re-computing for the
whole utterance-so-far).
We show that the joint satisfaction of syn-
tactic and pragmatic constraints improves
the performance of the NLU component
(around 10% absolute, over a syntax-only
baseline).
