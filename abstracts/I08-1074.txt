In this paper we provide benchmark results
for two classes of methods used in inter-
preting noun compounds (NCs): semantic
similarity-based methods and their hybrids.
We evaluate the methods using 7-way and
binary class data from the nominal pair in-
terpretation task of SEMEVAL-2007.1 We
summarize and analyse our results, with
the intention of providing a framework for
benchmarking future research in this area.
