There are several tasks where is preferable not
responding than responding incorrectly. This
idea is not new, but despite several previous at-
tempts there isn?t a commonly accepted mea-
sure to assess non-response. We study here an
extension of accuracy measure with this fea-
ture and a very easy to understand interpreta-
tion. The measure proposed (c@1) has a good
balance of discrimination power, stability and
sensitivity properties. We show also how this
measure is able to reward systems that main-
tain the same number of correct answers and
at the same time decrease the number of in-
correct ones, by leaving some questions unan-
swered. This measure is well suited for tasks
such as Reading Comprehension tests, where
multiple choices per question are given, but
only one is correct.
