In cases in which there is no standard or-
thography for a language or language vari-
ant, written texts will display a variety of or-
thographic choices. This is problematic for
natural language processing (NLP) because it
creates spurious data sparseness. We study
the transformation of spontaneously spelled
Egyptian Arabic into a conventionalized or-
thography which we have previously proposed
for NLP purposes. We show that a two-stage
process can reduce divergences from this stan-
dard by 69%, making subsequent processing
of Egyptian Arabic easier.
