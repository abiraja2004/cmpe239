Statistical user simulation is a promis-
ing methodology to train and evaluate the
performance of (spoken) dialog systems.
We work with a modular architecture for
data-driven simulation where the ?inten-
tional? component of user simulation in-
cludes a User Model representing user-
specific features. We train a dialog sim-
ulator that combines traits of human be-
havior such as cooperativeness and con-
text with domain-related aspects via the
Expectation-Maximization algorithm. We
show that cooperativeness provides a finer
representation of the dialog context which
directly affects task completion rate.
