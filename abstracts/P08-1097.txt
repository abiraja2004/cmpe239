This paper explores the relationship between
discourse segmentation and coverbal gesture.
Introducing the idea of gestural cohesion, we
show that coherent topic segments are char-
acterized by homogeneous gestural forms and
that changes in the distribution of gestural
features predict segment boundaries. Gestu-
ral features are extracted automatically from
video, and are combined with lexical features
in a Bayesian generative model. The resulting
multimodal system outperforms text-only seg-
mentation on both manual and automatically-
recognized speech transcripts.
