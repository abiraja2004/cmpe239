In this paper, we report a QA system
which can answer how type questions
based on the confirmed knowledge base
which was developed by using mails
posted to a mailing list. We first dis-
cuss a problem of developing a knowl-
edge base by using natural language doc-
uments: wrong information in natural
language documents. Then, we describe
a method of detecting wrong informa-
tion in mails posted to a mailing list and
developing a knowledge base by using
these mails. Finally, we show that ques-
tion and answer mails posted to a mailing
list can be used as a knowledge base for
a QA system.
