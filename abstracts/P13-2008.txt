Mismatch between queries and documents
is a key issue for the web search task. In
order to narrow down such mismatch, in
this paper, we present an in-depth inves-
tigation on adapting a paraphrasing tech-
nique to web search from three aspect-
s: a search-oriented paraphrasing mod-
el; an NDCG-based parameter optimiza-
tion algorithm; an enhanced ranking mod-
el leveraging augmented features comput-
ed on paraphrases of original queries. Ex-
periments performed on the large scale
query-document data set show that, the
search performance can be significantly
improved, with +3.28% and +1.14% ND-
CG gains on dev and test sets respectively.
