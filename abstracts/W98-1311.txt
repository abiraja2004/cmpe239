. In this article we present he realization of a generic finite-state system. 
The system has been used to create concrete lexical tools for word form analysis, word 
form generation, creation and derivation history, and spenchecking. It will also be used 
to create a finite-state transducer for the recognition of phrases. Producing a finite- 
state component with the generic system requires little e~ort. We will first emphasize 
its meaning and its architecture from a design point of view; then we will present some 
lexical finite-state ools created with it.
