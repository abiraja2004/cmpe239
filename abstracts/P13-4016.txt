In this paper we describe Travatar, a
forest-to-string machine translation (MT)
engine based on tree transducers. It pro-
vides an open-source C++ implementation
for the entire forest-to-string MT pipeline,
including rule extraction, tuning, decod-
ing, and evaluation. There are a number
of options for model training, and tuning
includes advanced options such as hyper-
graph MERT, and training of sparse fea-
tures through online learning. The train-
ing pipeline is modeled after that of the
popular Moses decoder, so users famil-
iar with Moses should be able to get
started quickly. We perform a valida-
tion experiment of the decoder on English-
Japanese machine translation, and find that
it is possible to achieve greater accuracy
than translation using phrase-based and
hierarchical-phrase-based translation. As
auxiliary results, we also compare differ-
ent syntactic parsers and alignment tech-
niques that we tested in the process of de-
veloping the decoder.
