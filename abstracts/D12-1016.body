Generating coherent discourse is an important
aspect in natural language generation. Our
aim is to learn factors that constitute coherent
discourse from data, with a focus on how to re-
alize predicate-argument structures in a model
that exceeds the sentence level. We present
an important subtask for this overall goal, in
which we align predicates across compara-
ble texts, admitting partial argument struc-
ture correspondence. The contribution of this
work is two-fold: We first construct a large
corpus resource of comparable texts, includ-
ing an evaluation set with manual predicate
alignments. Secondly, we present a novel ap-
proach for aligning predicates across compa-
rable texts using graph-based clustering with
Mincuts. Our method significantly outper-
forms other alignment techniques when ap-
plied to this novel alignment task, by a margin
of at least 6.5 percentage points in F1-score.
