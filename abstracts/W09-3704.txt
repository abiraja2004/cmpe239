Comparative constructions are common in dialogue, especially in
negotiative dialogue where a choice must be made between different
options, and options must be evaluated using multiple metrics. Com-
paratives explicitly assert a relationship between two elements along a
scale, but they may also implicate positions on the scale especially if
constraints on the possible values are present. Dialogue systems must
often understand more from a comparative than the explicit assertion
in order to understand why the comparative was uttered. In this paper
we examine the pragmatic meaning of comparative constructions from
a computational perspective.
