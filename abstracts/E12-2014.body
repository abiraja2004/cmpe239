This paper describes a system designed
to support event detection over Twitter.
The system operates by querying the data
stream with a user-specified set of key-
words, filtering out non-English messages,
and probabilistically geolocating each mes-
sage. The user can dynamically set a proba-
bility threshold over the geolocation predic-
tions, and also the time interval to present
data for.
