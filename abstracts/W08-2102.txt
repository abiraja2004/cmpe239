We describe a parsing approach that makes use
of the perceptron algorithm, in conjunction with
dynamic programming methods, to recover full
constituent-based parse trees. The formalism allows
a rich set of parse-tree features, including PCFG-
based features, bigram and trigram dependency fea-
tures, and surface features. A severe challenge in
applying such an approach to full syntactic pars-
ing is the efficiency of the parsing algorithms in-
volved. We show that efficient training is feasi-
ble, using a Tree Adjoining Grammar (TAG) based
parsing formalism. A lower-order dependency pars-
ing model is used to restrict the search space of the
full model, thereby making it efficient. Experiments
on the Penn WSJ treebank show that the model
achieves state-of-the-art performance, for both con-
stituent and dependency accuracy.
