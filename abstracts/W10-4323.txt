This paper presents an agenda-based user
simulator which has been extended to be
trainable on real data with the aim of more
closely modelling the complex rational be-
haviour exhibited by real users. The train-
able part is formed by a set of random de-
cision points that may be encountered dur-
ing the process of receiving a system act
and responding with a user act. A sample-
based method is presented for using real
user data to estimate the parameters that
control these decisions. Evaluation results
are given both in terms of statistics of gen-
erated user behaviour and the quality of
policies trained with different simulators.
Compared to a handcrafted simulator, the
trained system provides a much better fit
to corpus data and evaluations suggest that
this better fit should result in improved di-
alogue performance.
