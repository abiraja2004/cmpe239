 
We describe our initial efforts towards 
developing a large-scale corpus of Hindi 
texts annotated with discourse relations. 
Adopting the lexically grounded approach 
of the Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB), 
we present a preliminary analysis of 
discourse connectives in a small corpus. 
We describe how discourse connectives are 
represented in the sentence-level 
dependency annotation in Hindi, and 
discuss how the discourse annotation can 
enrich this level for research and 
applications. The ultimate goal of our work 
is to build a Hindi Discourse Relation Bank 
along the lines of the PDTB. Our work will 
also contribute to the cross-linguistic 
understanding of discourse connectives.
