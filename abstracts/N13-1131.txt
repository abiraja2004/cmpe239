In this paper we consider the problem of label-
ing the languages of words in mixed-language
documents. This problem is approached in a
weakly supervised fashion, as a sequence la-
beling problem with monolingual text sam-
ples for training data. Among the approaches
evaluated, a conditional random field model
trained with generalized expectation criteria
was the most accurate and performed consis-
tently as the amount of training data was var-
ied.
