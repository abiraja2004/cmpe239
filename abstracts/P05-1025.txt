To facilitate the use of syntactic infor-
mation in the study of child language
acquisition, a coding scheme for Gram-
matical Relations (GRs) in transcripts of
parent-child dialogs has been proposed by
Sagae, MacWhinney and Lavie (2004).
We discuss the use of current NLP tech-
niques to produce the GRs in this an-
notation scheme. By using a statisti-
cal parser (Charniak, 2000) and memory-
based learning tools for classification
(Daelemans et al, 2004), we obtain high
precision and recall of several GRs. We
demonstrate the usefulness of this ap-
proach by performing automatic measure-
ments of syntactic development with the
Index of Productive Syntax (Scarborough,
1990) at similar levels to what child lan-
guage researchers compute manually.
