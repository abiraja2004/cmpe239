We seek to develop an efficient algorithm
selecting attributes that approximates hu-
man selection. In contrast to previous work
we sought to combine the strengths of cog-
nitive theories and simple learning algo-
rithms. We then developed a new algo-
rithm for attribute selection based on ob-
servations from a corpus, which outper-
formed a simple base algorithm by a sig-
nificant margin. We then carried out a de-
tailed comparison between our algorithm
and Reiter & Dale?s ?Incremental Algo-
rithm?. In terms of achieving a human-like
attribute selection, the overall performance
of both algorithms is fundamentally equiv-
alent, while differing in the handling of re-
dundancy in selected attributes. We further
investigated this phenomenon and draw
some conclusions for further improvement
of attribute-selection algorithms.
