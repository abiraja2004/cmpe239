. This work belongs to a family of research efforts, called microtheories and 
aimed at describing the static meaning of all lexical categories in several languages in the 
framework of the MikroKosmos project on computational semantics. The latter also in- 
volves other static microtheories describing world knowledge and syntax-semantics map- 
ping as well as dynamic microtheories connected with the actual process of text analysis. 
This paper deals with the microtheory of adjectival semantics in one specific aspect, 
namely, the optimization and facilitation of the lexical entries for deverbal adjectives with 
the help:of lexical rules deriving such entries from those of the corresponding verbs. De- 
verbal adjectives turn out to be the largest single subclass in the adjective l xical category. 
Unlike scalar and relative adjectives, which are anchored in property and object concepts, 
respectively, in the underlying ontology, deverbal adjectives are based on process con- 
cepts. While acquisition with lexical rules is necessary, universal and efficient for the class 
of deverbal adjectives, our research shows that, often in spite of the strong appearance to
the contrary, such acquisition isneither fully automatic nor cost-free. The work was based 
on the set of over 6,000 English and about 1,500 Spanish adjectives obtained from task- 
oriented corpora. The findings are largely language-independent, and only English exam- 
ples are Used throughout the paper.
