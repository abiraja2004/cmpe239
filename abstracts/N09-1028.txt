We introduce a novel precedence reordering
approach based on a dependency parser to sta-
tistical machine translation systems. Similar
to other preprocessing reordering approaches,
our method can efficiently incorporate linguis-
tic knowledge into SMT systems without in-
creasing the complexity of decoding. For a set
of five subject-object-verb (SOV) order lan-
guages, we show significant improvements in
BLEU scores when translating from English,
compared to other reordering approaches, in
state-of-the-art phrase-based SMT systems.
