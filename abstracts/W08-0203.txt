In the course of the European Bologna ac-
cord on higher education, German universities
have been reorganizing their traditional ?Mag-
ister? and ?Diplom? studies into modularized
bachelor?s and master?s programs. This re-
vision provides a chance to update the pro-
grams. In this paper we introduce the curricu-
lum of a first semester B.A. program in Com-
putational Linguistics which was taught for
the first time last semester. In addition, we an-
alyze the syllabi of four mandatory courses of
the first semester to identify overlapping con-
tent which led to redundancies. We suggest for
future semesters to reorganize the schedules in
a way that students encounter recurring topics
iteratively in a constructive way.
