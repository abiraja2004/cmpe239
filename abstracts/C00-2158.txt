 
Our principle objective was to reduce the 
error rate of speech recognition systems 
used by professional translators. Our work 
concentrated on Spanish-to-English trans- 
lation. In a baseline study we estimated the 
error rate o1' an off-the-shelf recognizer to 
he 9.98%. in this paper we describe two 
independent methods ot' improving speech 
recognizers: a machine translation (MT) 
method and a topic-based one. An 
evaluation of the MT method suggests that 
the vocabulary used for recognition cannot 
be completely restricted to the set of 
translations produced by the MT system and 
a more sophisticated constraint system must 
be used. An ewduation of the topic-based 
method showed significanl error rate 
reduction, to 5.07%.
