We describe the system developed by the
team of the National University of Singa-
pore for English to Spanish machine trans-
lation of News Commentary text for the
WMT09 Shared Translation Task. Our
approach is based on domain adaptation,
combining a small in-domain News Com-
mentary bi-text and a large out-of-domain
one from the Europarl corpus, from which
we built and combined two separate phrase
tables. We further combined two language
models (in-domain and out-of-domain),
and we experimented with cognates, im-
proved tokenization and recasing, achiev-
ing the highest lowercased NIST score of
6.963 and the second best lowercased Bleu
score of 24.91% for training without us-
ing additional external data for English-to-
Spanish translation at the shared task.
