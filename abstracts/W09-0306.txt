 
We present a valency lexicon for Latin verbs 
extracted from the Index Thomisticus Tree-
bank, a syntactically annotated corpus of Me-
dieval Latin texts by Thomas Aquinas. 
In our corpus-based approach, the lexicon re-
flects the empirical evidence of the source 
data. Verbal arguments are induced directly 
from annotated data. 
The lexicon contains 432 Latin verbs with 270 
valency frames. The lexicon is useful for NLP 
applications and is able to support annotation.
