Few attempts have been made to inves-
tigate the utility of temporal reasoning
within machine learning frameworks for
temporal relation classification between
events in news articles. This paper presents
three settings where temporal reasoning
aids machine learned classifiers of tempo-
ral relations: (1) expansion of the dataset
used for learning; (2) detection of inconsis-
tencies among the automatically identified
relations; and (3) selection among multiple
temporal relations. Feature engineering is
another effort in our work to improve clas-
sification accuracy.
