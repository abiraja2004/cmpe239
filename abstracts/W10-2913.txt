Prior work on training the IBM-3 transla-
tion model is based on suboptimal meth-
ods for computing Viterbi alignments. In
this paper, we present the first method
guaranteed to produce globally optimal
alignments. This not only results in im-
proved alignments, it also gives us the op-
portunity to evaluate the quality of stan-
dard hillclimbing methods. Indeed, hill-
climbing works reasonably well in prac-
tice but still fails to find the global opti-
mum for between 2% and 12% of all sen-
tence pairs and the probabilities can be
several tens of orders of magnitude away
from the Viterbi alignment.
By reformulating the alignment problem
as an Integer Linear Program, we can
use standard machinery from global opti-
mization theory to compute the solutions.
We use the well-known branch-and-cut
method, but also show how it can be cus-
tomized to the specific problem discussed
in this paper. In fact, a large number of
alignments can be excluded from the start
without losing global optimality.
