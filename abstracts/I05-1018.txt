. This paper describes a method of adapting a domain-inde-
pendent HPSG parser to a biomedical domain. Without modifying the
grammar and the probabilistic model of the original HPSG parser, we
develop a log-linear model with additional features on a treebank of the
biomedical domain. Since the treebank of the target domain is limited, we
need to exploit an original disambiguation model that was trained on a
larger treebank. Our model incorporates the original model as a reference
probabilistic distribution. The experimental results for our model trained
with a small amount of a treebank demonstrated an improvement in
parsing accuracy.
