of a Chinese sense annotated corpus. A set 
of software tools is designed to help hu-
man annotator to accelerate the annotation 
speed and keep the consistency. The soft-
ware tools include 1) a tagger for word 
segmentation and POS tagging, 2) an an-
notating interface responsible for the sense 
describing in the lexicon and sense anno-
tating in the corpus, 3) a checker for con-
sistency keeping, 4) a transformer respon-
sible for the transforming from text file to 
XML format, and 5) a counter for sense 
frequency distribution calculating.
