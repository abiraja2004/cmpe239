Theories of human language acquisition as-
sume that learning to understand sentences is
a partially-supervised task (at best). Instead
of using ?gold-standard? feedback, we train
a simplified ?Baby? Semantic Role Labeling
system by combining world knowledge and
simple grammatical constraints to form a po-
tentially noisy training signal. This combina-
tion of knowledge sources is vital for learn-
ing; a training signal derived from a single
component leads the learner astray. When this
largely unsupervised training approach is ap-
plied to a corpus of child directed speech, the
BabySRL learns shallow structural cues that
allow it to mimic striking behaviors found in
experiments with children and begin to cor-
rectly identify agents in a sentence.
