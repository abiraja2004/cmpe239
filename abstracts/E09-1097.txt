Abstract-like text summarisation requires
a means of producing novel summary sen-
tences. In order to improve the grammati-
cality of the generated sentence, we model
a global (sentence) level syntactic struc-
ture. We couch statistical sentence genera-
tion as a spanning tree problem in order to
search for the best dependency tree span-
ning a set of chosen words. We also intro-
duce a new search algorithm for this task
that models argument satisfaction to im-
prove the linguistic validity of the gener-
ated tree. We treat the allocation of modi-
fiers to heads as a weighted bipartite graph
matching (or assignment) problem, a well
studied problem in graph theory. Using
BLEU to measure performance on a string
regeneration task, we found an improve-
ment, illustrating the benefit of the span-
ning tree approach armed with an argu-
ment satisfaction model.
