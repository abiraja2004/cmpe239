In this paper we present an approach to
dialogue management that supports the
generation of multifunctional utterances.
It is based on the multidimensional dia-
logue act taxonomy and associated con-
text model as developed in Dynamic Inter-
pretation Theory (DIT). The multidimen-
sional organisation of the taxonomy re-
flects that there are various aspects that di-
alogue participants have to deal with si-
multaneously during a dialogue. Besides
performing some underlying task, a par-
ticipant also has to pay attention to vari-
ous aspects of the communication process
itself, including social conventions.
Therefore, a multi-agent approach is pro-
posed, in which for each of the dimensions
in the taxonomy a specialised dialogue act
agent is designed, dedicated to the gener-
ation of dialogue acts from that particular
dimension. These dialogue act agents op-
erate in parallel on the information state of
the system. For a simplified version of the
taxonomy, a dialogue manager has been
implemented and integrated into an inter-
active QA system.
