Defining the reordering search space is a cru-
cial issue in phrase-based SMT between dis-
tant languages. In fact, the optimal trade-
off between accuracy and complexity of de-
coding is nowadays reached by harshly lim-
iting the input permutation space. We pro-
pose a method to dynamically shape such
space and, thus, capture long-range word
movements without hurting translation qual-
ity nor decoding time. The space defined
by loose reordering constraints is dynamically
pruned through a binary classifier that predicts
whether a given input word should be trans-
lated right after another. The integration of
this model into a phrase-based decoder im-
proves a strong Arabic-English baseline al-
ready including state-of-the-art early distor-
tion cost (Moore and Quirk, 2007) and hierar-
chical phrase orientation models (Galley and
Manning, 2008). Significant improvements in
the reordering of verbs are achieved by a sys-
tem that is notably faster than the baseline,
while BLEU and METEOR remain stable, or
even increase, at a very high distortion limit.
