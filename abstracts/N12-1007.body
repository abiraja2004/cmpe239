Standard entity clustering systems commonly
rely on mention (string) matching, syntactic
features, and linguistic resources like English
WordNet. When co-referent text mentions ap-
pear in different languages, these techniques
cannot be easily applied. Consequently, we
develop new methods for clustering text men-
tions across documents and languages simulta-
neously, producing cross-lingual entity clusters.
Our approach extends standard clustering algo-
rithms with cross-lingual mention and context
similarity measures. Crucially, we do not as-
sume a pre-existing entity list (knowledge base),
so entity characteristics are unknown. On an
Arabic-English corpus that contains seven dif-
ferent text genres, our best model yields a 24.3%
F1 gain over the baseline.
