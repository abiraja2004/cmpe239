 
This paper examines the extent to which verb 
diathesis alternations are empirically attested in 
corpus data. We automatically acquire alternating 
verbs from large balanced corpora by using partial- 
parsing methods and taxonomic information, and 
discuss how corpus data can be used to quantify lin- 
guistic generalizations. We estimate the productiv- 
ity of an alternation and the typicality of its mem- 
bers using type and token frequencies.
