 
This paper presents an unsupervised ap-
proach to learning translation span align-
ments from parallel data that improves 
syntactic rule extraction by deleting spuri-
ous word alignment links and adding new 
valuable links based on bilingual transla-
tion span correspondences. Experiments on 
Chinese-English translation demonstrate 
improvements over standard methods for 
tree-to-string and tree-to-tree translation.
