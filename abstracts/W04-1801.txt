 
This paper discusses a number of implications 
of using either a conceptual approach or a 
lexico-semantic approach to terminology 
structuring, especially for interpreting data 
supplied by corpora for the purpose of 
building specialized dictionaries. A simple 
example, i.e., program, will serve as a basis 
for showing how relationships between terms 
are captured in both approaches. My aim is to 
demonstrate that truly conceptual approaches 
do not allow a flexible integration of terms 
and relationships between terms and that 
lexico-semantic approaches are more 
compatible with data gathered from corpora. I 
will also discuss some of the implications 
these approaches have for computational 
terminology and other corpus-based 
terminological endeavours.
