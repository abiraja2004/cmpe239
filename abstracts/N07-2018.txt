This paper presents an alternative algo-
rithm based on the singular value decom-
position (SVD) that creates vector rep-
resentation for linguistic units with re-
duced dimensionality. The work was mo-
tivated by an application aimed to repre-
sent text segments for further processing
in a multi-document summarization sys-
tem. The algorithm tries to compensate
for SVD?s bias towards dominant-topic
documents. Our experiments on measur-
ing document similarities have shown that
the algorithm achieves higher average pre-
cision with lower number of dimensions
than the baseline algorithms - the SVD
and the vector space model.
