How can the development of ideas in a sci-
entific field be studied over time? We ap-
ply unsupervised topic modeling to the ACL
Anthology to analyze historical trends in the
field of Computational Linguistics from 1978
to 2006. We induce topic clusters using Latent
Dirichlet Allocation, and examine the strength
of each topic over time. Our methods find
trends in the field including the rise of prob-
abilistic methods starting in 1988, a steady in-
crease in applications, and a sharp decline of
research in semantics and understanding be-
tween 1978 and 2001, possibly rising again
after 2001. We also introduce a model of the
diversity of ideas, topic entropy, using it to
show that COLING is a more diverse confer-
ence than ACL, but that both conferences as
well as EMNLP are becoming broader over
time. Finally, we apply Jensen-Shannon di-
vergence of topic distributions to show that all
three conferences are converging in the topics
they cover.
