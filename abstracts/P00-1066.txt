In this paper we revisit Puste-
jovsky's proposal to treat ontologi-
cally complex word meaning by so-
called dotted pairs. We use a higher-
order feature logic based on Ohori's
record -calculus to model the se-
mantics of words like book and li-
brary, in particular their behavior
in the context of quantication and
cardinality statements.
