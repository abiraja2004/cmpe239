The research below explores schemes for
evaluating automatic summaries of busi-
ness meetings, using the ICSI Meeting
Corpus (Janin et al, 2003). Both au-
tomatic and subjective evaluations were
carried out, with a central interest be-
ing whether or not the two types of eval-
uations correlate with each other. The
evaluation metrics were used to compare
and contrast differing approaches to au-
tomatic summarization, the deterioration
of summary quality on ASR output ver-
sus manual transcripts, and to determine
whether manual extracts are rated signifi-
cantly higher than automatic extracts.
