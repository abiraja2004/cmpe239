Automatic evaluation metrics for Ma-
chine Translation (MT) systems, such
as BLEU or NIST, are now well estab-
lished. Yet, they are scarcely used for
the assessment of language pairs like
English-Chinese or English-Japanese,
because of the word segmentation prob-
lem. This study establishes the equiv-
alence between the standard use of
BLEU in word n-grams and its appli-
cation at the character level. The use
of BLEU at the character level elimi-
nates the word segmentation problem:
it makes it possible to directly compare
commercial systems outputting unseg-
mented texts with, for instance, statisti-
cal MT systems which usually segment
their outputs.
