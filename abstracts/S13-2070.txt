This paper is an overview of the SwatCS
system submitted to SemEval-2013 Task 2A:
Contextual Polarity Disambiguation. The sen-
timent of individual phrases within a tweet
are labeled using a combination of classifiers
trained on a range of lexical features. The
classifiers are combined by estimating the ac-
curacy of the classifiers on each tweet. Perfor-
mance is measured when using only the pro-
vided training data, and separately when in-
cluding external data.
