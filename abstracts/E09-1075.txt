In this paper we introduce the notion
of ?frame relatedness?, i.e. relatedness
among prototypical situations as repre-
sented in the FrameNet database. We first
demonstrate the cognitive plausibility of
that notion through an annotation experi-
ment, and then propose different types of
computational measures to automatically
assess relatedness. Results show that our
measures provide good performance on
the task of ranking pairs of frames.
