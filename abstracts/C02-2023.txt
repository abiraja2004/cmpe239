 
This paper discusses an innovative approach to 
the computer assisted scoring of student 
responses in WebLAS (web-based language 
assessment system)- a language assessment 
system delivered entirely over the web.  Expected 
student responses are limited production free 
response questions. 
The portions of WebLAS with which we are 
concerned are the task creation and scoring 
modules.  Within the task creation module, 
instructors and language experts do not only 
provide the task input and prompt. More 
importantly, they interactively inform the system 
how and how much to score student responses.  
This interaction consists of WebLAS? natural 
language processing (NLP) modules searching 
for alternatives of the provided ?gold standard? 
(Hirschman et al 2000) answer and asking for 
confirmation of score assignment.  WebLAS 
processes and stores all this information within 
its database, to be used in the task delivery and 
scoring phases.
