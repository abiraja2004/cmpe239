Procedural dialog systems can help users
achieve a wide range of goals. However,
such systems are challenging to build,
currently requiring manual engineering of
substantial domain-specific task knowl-
edge and dialog management strategies. In
this paper, we demonstrate that it is pos-
sible to learn procedural dialog systems
given only light supervision, of the type
that can be provided by non-experts. We
consider domains where the required task
knowledge exists in textual form (e.g., in-
structional web pages) and where system
builders have access to statements of user
intent (e.g., search query logs or dialog
interactions). To learn from such tex-
tual resources, we describe a novel ap-
proach that first automatically extracts task
knowledge from instructions, then learns a
dialog manager over this task knowledge
to provide assistance. Evaluation in a Mi-
crosoft Office domain shows that the indi-
vidual components are highly accurate and
can be integrated into a dialog system that
provides effective help to users.
