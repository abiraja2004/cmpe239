We suggest a generation task that inte-
grates discourse-level referring expression
generation and sentence-level surface re-
alization. We present a data set of Ger-
man articles annotated with deep syntax
and referents, including some types of im-
plicit referents. Our experiments compare
several architectures varying the order of a
set of trainable modules. The results sug-
gest that a revision-based pipeline, with in-
termediate linearization, significantly out-
performs standard pipelines or a parallel
architecture.
