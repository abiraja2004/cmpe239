This paper examines what kind of similar-
ity between words can be represented by
what kind of word vectors in the vector
space model. Through two experiments,
three methods for constructing word vec-
tors, i.e., LSA-based, cooccurrence-based
and dictionary-based methods, were com-
pared in terms of the ability to represent
two kinds of similarity, i.e., taxonomic
similarity and associative similarity. The
result of the comparison was that the
dictionary-based word vectors better re-
flect taxonomic similarity, while the LSA-
based and the cooccurrence-based word
vectors better reflect associative similarity.
