 
We report on a project which we believe to 
have the potential to become home to, among 
others, bilingual dictionaries for African lan-
guages. Kept in a well-structured XML for-
mat with several possible degrees of confor-
mance, the dictionaries will be able to get us-
able even in their early versions, which will 
be then subject to supervised improvement as 
user feedback accumulates. The project is 
FreeDict, part of SourceForge, a well-known 
Internet repository of open source content.  
We demonstrate a possible process of dic-
tionary development on the example of one 
of FreeDict dictionaries, a Swahili-English 
dictionary that we maintain and have been 
developing through subsequent stages of in-
creasing complexity and machine-
processability. The aim of the paper is to 
show that even a small bilingual lexical re-
source can be submitted to this project and 
gradually developed into a machine-
processable form that can then interact with 
other FreeDict resources. We also present the 
immediate benefits of locating bilingual Afri-
can dictionaries in this project. 
We have found FreeDict to be a very promis-
ing project with a lot of potential, and the 
present paper is meant to spread the news 
about it, in the hope to create an active com-
munity of linguists and lexicographers of 
various backgrounds, where common re-
search subprojects can be fruitfully carried 
out.
