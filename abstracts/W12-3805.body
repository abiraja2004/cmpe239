In this paper we present an iterative method-
ology to improve classifier performance by in-
corporating linguistic knowledge, and propose
a way to incorporate domain rules into the
learning process. We applied the methodol-
ogy to the tasks of hedge cue recognition and
scope detection and obtained competitive re-
sults on a publicly available corpus.
