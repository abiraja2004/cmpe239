We derive and implement an algorithm
similar to (Huang and Chiang, 2005) for
finding the n best derivations in a weighted
hypergraph. We prove the correctness and
termination of the algorithm and we show
experimental results concerning its run-
time. Our work is different from the afore-
mentioned one in the following respects:
we consider labeled hypergraphs, allowing
for tree-based language models (Maletti
and Satta, 2009); we specifically handle
the case of cyclic hypergraphs; we admit
structured weight domains, allowing for
multiple features to be processed; we use
the paradigm of functional programming
together with lazy evaluation, achieving
concise algorithmic descriptions.
