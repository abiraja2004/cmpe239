In this paper we describe a method of automati-
cally learning domain theories from parsed cor-
pora of sentences from the relevant domain and
use FSA techniques for the graphical represen-
tation of such a theory. By a ?domain theory? we
mean a collection of facts and generalisations
or rules which capture what commonly happens
(or does not happen) in some domain of interest.
As language users, we implicitly draw on such
theories in various disambiguation tasks, such
as anaphora resolution and prepositional phrase
attachment, and formal encodings of domain
theories can be used for this purpose in natural
language processing. They may also be objects
of interest in their own right, that is, as the out-
put of a knowledge discovery process. The ap-
proach is generizable to different domains pro-
vided it is possible to get logical forms for the
text in the domain.
