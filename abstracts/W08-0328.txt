Based on an architecture that allows to com-
bine statistical machine translation (SMT)
with rule-based machine translation (RBMT)
in a multi-engine setup, we present new results
that show that this type of system combination
can actually increase the lexical coverage of
the resulting hybrid system, at least as far as
this can be measured via BLEU score.
