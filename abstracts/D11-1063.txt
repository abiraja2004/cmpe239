Abstract
Metaphor is ubiquitous in text, even in highly
technical text. Correct inference about tex-
tual entailment requires computers to distin-
guish the literal and metaphorical senses of
a word. Past work has treated this problem
as a classical word sense disambiguation task.
In this paper, we take a new approach, based
on research in cognitive linguistics that views
metaphor as a method for transferring knowl-
edge from a familiar, well-understood, or con-
crete domain to an unfamiliar, less understood,
or more abstract domain. This view leads to
the hypothesis that metaphorical word usage
is correlated with the degree of abstractness of
the word?s context. We introduce an algorithm
that uses this hypothesis to classify a word
sense in a given context as either literal (de-
notative) or metaphorical (connotative). We
evaluate this algorithm with a set of adjective-
noun phrases (e.g., in dark comedy, the adjec-
tive dark is used metaphorically; in dark hair,
it is used literally) and with the TroFi (Trope
Finder) Example Base of literal and nonliteral
usage for fifty verbs. We achieve state-of-the-
art performance on both datasets.
