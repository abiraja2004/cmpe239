 
This paper reports on the techniques used 
to successfully translate with the help of 
a computer a Mathematics textbook from 
Portuguese to English. Even if these 
techniques are simple and this case has 
some peculiarities, it seems that the same 
method will be useful in other cases as well, 
and, more importantly, that this experi- 
ence is a good motivation for some research 
to be done on the possible refinements of 
the method.
