We present our end-to-end coreference res-
olution system, COPA, which implements a
global decision via hypergraph partitioning.
In constrast to almost all previous approaches,
we do not rely on separate classification and
clustering steps, but perform coreference res-
olution globally in one step. COPA represents
each document as a hypergraph and partitions
it with a spectral clustering algorithm. Various
types of relational features can be easily incor-
porated in this framwork. COPA has partici-
pated in the open setting of the CoNLL shared
task on modeling unrestricted coreference.
