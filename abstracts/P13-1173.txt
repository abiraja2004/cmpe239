This paper proposes a novel two-stage
method for mining opinion words and
opinion targets. In the first stage, we
propose a Sentiment Graph Walking algo-
rithm, which naturally incorporates syn-
tactic patterns in a Sentiment Graph to ex-
tract opinion word/target candidates. Then
random walking is employed to estimate
confidence of candidates, which improves
extraction accuracy by considering confi-
dence of patterns. In the second stage, we
adopt a self-learning strategy to refine the
results from the first stage, especially for
filtering out high-frequency noise terms
and capturing the long-tail terms, which
are not investigated by previous meth-
ods. The experimental results on three real
world datasets demonstrate the effective-
ness of our approach compared with state-
of-the-art unsupervised methods.
