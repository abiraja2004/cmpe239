In this paper, we extend an existing parser
to produce richer output annotated with
function labels. We obtain state-of-the-art
results both in function labelling and in
parsing, by automatically relabelling the
Penn Treebank trees. In particular, we ob-
tain the best published results on seman-
tic function labels. This suggests that cur-
rent statistical parsing methods are suffi-
ciently general to produce accurate shal-
low semantic annotation.
