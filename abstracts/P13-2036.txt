This paper studies named entity trans-
lation and proposes ?selective temporal-
ity? as a new feature, as using temporal
features may be harmful for translating
?atemporal? entities. Our key contribution
is building an automatic classifier to dis-
tinguish temporal and atemporal entities
then align them in separate procedures to
boost translation accuracy by 6.1%.
