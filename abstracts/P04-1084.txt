Generalized Multitext Grammar (GMTG) is a syn-
chronous grammar formalism that is weakly equiv-
alent to Linear Context-Free Rewriting Systems
(LCFRS), but retains much of the notational and in-
tuitive simplicity of Context-Free Grammar (CFG).
GMTG allows both synchronous and independent
rewriting. Such flexibility facilitates more perspic-
uous modeling of parallel text than what is possible
with other synchronous formalisms. This paper in-
vestigates the generative capacity of GMTG, proves
that each component grammar of a GMTG retains
its generative power, and proposes a generalization
of Chomsky Normal Form, which is necessary for
synchronous CKY-style parsing.
