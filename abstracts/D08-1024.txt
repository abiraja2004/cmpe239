Minimum-error-rate training (MERT) is a bot-
tleneck for current development in statistical
machine translation because it is limited in
the number of weights it can reliably opti-
mize. Building on the work of Watanabe et
al., we explore the use of the MIRA algorithm
of Crammer et al as an alternative to MERT.
We first show that by parallel processing and
exploiting more of the parse forest, we can
obtain results using MIRA that match or sur-
pass MERT in terms of both translation qual-
ity and computational cost. We then test the
method on two classes of features that address
deficiencies in the Hiero hierarchical phrase-
based model: first, we simultaneously train a
large number of Marton and Resnik?s soft syn-
tactic constraints, and, second, we introduce
a novel structural distortion model. In both
cases we obtain significant improvements in
translation performance. Optimizing them in
combination, for a total of 56 feature weights,
we improve performance by 2.6 B??? on a
subset of the NIST 2006 Arabic-English eval-
uation data.
