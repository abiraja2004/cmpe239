Topic Detection and Tracking refers to au-
tomatic techniques for locating topically re-
lated materials in streams of data. As the
core technology of it, story link detection is
to determine whether two stories are about
the same topic. To overcome the limitation
of the story length and the topic dynamic
evolution problem in data streams, this pa-
per presents a method of applying dynamic
information extending to improve the per-
formance of link detection. The proposed
method uses previous latest related story to
extend current processing story, generates
new dynamic models for computing the sim-
ilarity between the current two stories. The
work is evaluated on the TDT4 Chinese cor-
pus, and the experimental results indicate
that story link detection using this method
can make much better performance on all
evaluation metrics.
