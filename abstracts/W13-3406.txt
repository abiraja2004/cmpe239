What is it that we want to achieve with
our Linguistic Olympiads and how do the
contests vary in different countries? The
Swedish Olympiad has been running for 7
years now and is primarily focused on pub-
lic outreach - spreading linguistics to sec-
ondary school students. The contest in-
volves not only a test but also lectures,
school visits and teaching material. The
effort is put on promoting the interest of
linguistics to students through fun ma-
terial and good contact with teachers of
languages. This presentation contains an
overview of the Swedish version of Olympi-
ads in Linguistics as well as some con-
crete examples of workshop material on lin-
guistic problems for secondary school stu-
dents.
