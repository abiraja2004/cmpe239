Scientific authors urgently need help in man-
aging the fast increasing number of publica-
tions. We describe and demonstrate a tool
that supports authors in browsing graphically
through electronically available publications,
thus allowing them to quickly adapt to new
domains and publish faster. Navigation is as-
sisted by means of typed citation graphs, i.e.
we use methods and resources from compu-
tational linguistics to compute the kind of ci-
tation that is made from one paper to another
(refutation, use, confirmation etc.). To verify
the computed citation type, the user can in-
spect the highlighted citation sentence in the
original PDF document. While our classi-
fication methods used to generate a realistic
test data set are relatively simple and could
be combined with other proposed approaches,
we put a strong focus on usability and quick
navigation in the potentially huge graphs. In
the outlook, we argue that our tool could be
made part of a community approach to over-
come the sparseness and correctness dilemma
in citation classification.
