RWTH participated in the System Combi-
nation task of the Sixth Workshop on Sta-
tistical Machine Translation (WMT 2011).
For three language pairs, we combined
6 to 14 systems into a single consen-
sus translation. A three-level meta-
combination scheme combining six dif-
ferent system combination setups with
three different engines was applied on the
French?English language pair. Depend-
ing on the language pair, improvements
versus the best single system are in the
range of +1.9% and +2.5% abs. on
BLEU, and between ?1.8% and ?2.4%
abs. on TER. Novel techniques compared
with RWTH?s submission to WMT 2010
include two additional system combina-
tion engines, an additional word alignment
technique, meta combination, and addi-
tional optimization techniques.
