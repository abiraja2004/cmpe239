The development of compositional distribu-
tional models of semantics reconciling the em-
pirical aspects of distributional semantics with
the compositional aspects of formal seman-
tics is a popular topic in the contemporary lit-
erature. This paper seeks to bring this rec-
onciliation one step further by showing how
the mathematical constructs commonly used
in compositional distributional models, such
as tensors and matrices, can be used to sim-
ulate different aspects of predicate logic.
This paper discusses how the canonical iso-
morphism between tensors and multilinear
maps can be exploited to simulate a full-blown
quantifier-free predicate calculus using ten-
sors. It provides tensor interpretations of the
set of logical connectives required to model
propositional calculi. It suggests a variant
of these tensor calculi capable of modelling
quantifiers, using few non-linear operations.
It finally discusses the relation between these
variants, and how this relation should consti-
tute the subject of future work.
