In this presentation, I will look back at
10 years of CoNLL conferences and the
state of the art of machine learning of lan-
guage that is evident from this decade of
research. My conclusion, intended to pro-
voke discussion, will be that we currently
lack a clear motivation or ?mission? to
survive as a discipline. I will suggest that
a new mission for the field could be found
in a renewed interest for theoretical work
(which learning algorithms have a bias
that matches the properties of language?,
what is the psycholinguistic relevance of
learner design issues?), in more sophis-
ticated comparative methodology, and in
solving the problem of transfer, reusabil-
ity, and adaptation of learned knowledge.
