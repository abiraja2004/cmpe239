One problem with phrase-based statistical ma-
chine translation is the problem of long-
distance reordering when translating between
languages with different word orders, such as
Japanese-English. In this paper, we propose a
method of imposing reordering constraints us-
ing document-level context. As the document-
level context, we use noun phrases which sig-
nificantly occur in context documents contain-
ing source sentences. Given a source sen-
tence, zones which cover the noun phrases are
used as reordering constraints. Then, in de-
coding, reorderings which violate the zones
are restricted. Experiment results for patent
translation tasks show a significant improve-
ment of 1.20% BLEU points in Japanese-
English translation and 1.41% BLEU points in
English-Japanese translation.
