Automatic word segmentation is a basic re-
quirement for unsupervised learning in morpho-
logical analysis. In this paper, we formulate a
novel recursive method for minimum descrip-
tion length (MDL) word segmentation, whose
basic operation is resegmenting the corpus on
a prefix (equivalently, a suffix). We derive a
local expression for the change in description
length under resegmentation, i.e., one which de-
pends only on properties of the specific prefix
(not on the rest of the corpus). Such a formula-
tion permits use of a new and efficient algorithm
for greedy morphological segmentation of the
corpus in a recursive manner. In particular, our
method does not restrict words to be segmented
only once, into a stem+affix form, as do many
extant techniques. Early results for English and
Turkish corpora are promising.
