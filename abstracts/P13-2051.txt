Automatic acquisition of inference rules
for predicates is widely addressed by com-
puting distributional similarity scores be-
tween vectors of argument words. In
this scheme, prior work typically refrained
from learning rules for low frequency
predicates associated with very sparse ar-
gument vectors due to expected low reli-
ability. To improve the learning of such
rules in an unsupervised way, we propose
to lexically expand sparse argument word
vectors with semantically similar words.
Our evaluation shows that lexical expan-
sion significantly improves performance
in comparison to state-of-the-art baselines.
