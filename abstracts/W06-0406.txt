In spite of its potential for bidirectionality,
Extensible Dependency Grammar (XDG)
has so far been used almost exclusively
for parsing. This paper represents one of
the first steps towards an XDG-based inte-
grated generation architecture by tackling
what is arguably the most basic among
generation tasks: lexicalization. Herein
we present a constraint-based account of
disjunction in lexicalization, i.e. a way
to enable an XDG grammar to generate
all paraphrases ? along the lexicalization
axis, of course ? realizing a given in-
put semantics. Our model is (i) efficient,
yielding strong propagation, (ii) modu-
lar and (iii) favourable to synergy inas-
much as it allows collaboration between
modules, notably semantics and syntax.
We focus on constraints ensuring well-
formedness and completeness and avoid-
ing over-redundancy.
