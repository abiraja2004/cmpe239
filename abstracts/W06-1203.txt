Making use of latent semantic analy-
sis, we explore the hypothesis that lo-
cal linguistic context can serve to iden-
tify multi-word expressions that have non-
compositional meanings. We propose that
vector-similarity between distribution vec-
tors associated with an MWE as a whole
and those associated with its constitutent
parts can serve as a good measure of the
degree to which the MWE is composi-
tional. We present experiments that show
that low (cosine) similarity does, in fact,
correlate with non-compositionality.
