 
Classifying research papers into patent classi-
fication systems enables an exhaustive and ef-
fective invalidity search, prior art search, and 
technical trend analysis. However, it is very 
costly to classify research papers manually. 
Therefore, we have studied automatic classifi-
cation of research papers into a patent classifi-
cation system. To classify research papers into 
patent classification systems, the differences in 
terms used in research papers and patents 
should be taken into account. This is because 
the terms used in patents are often more ab-
stract or creative than those used in research 
papers in order to widen the scope of the 
claims. It is also necessary to do exhaustive 
searches and analyses that focus on classifica-
tion of research papers written in various lan-
guages. To solve these problems, we propose 
some classification methods using two ma-
chine translation models. When translating 
English research papers into Japanese, the per-
formance of a translation model for patents is 
inferior to that for research papers due to the 
differences in terms used in research papers 
and patents. However, the model for patents is 
thought to be useful for our task because trans-
lation results by patent translation models tend 
to contain more patent terms than those for re-
search papers. To confirm the effectiveness of 
our methods, we conducted some experiments 
using the data of the Patent Mining Task in the 
NTCIR-7 Workshop. From the experimental 
results, we found that our method using trans-
lation models for both research papers and pa-
tents was more effective than using a single 
translation model.
