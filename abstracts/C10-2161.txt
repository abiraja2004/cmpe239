We present the first known empirical results
on sequence labeling based on maximum mar-
gin Markov networks (M3N ), which incorpo-
rate both kernel methods to efficiently deal with
high-dimensional feature spaces, and probabilistic
graphical models to capture correlations in struc-
tured data. We provide an efficient algorithm, the
stochastic gradient descent (SGD), to speedup the
training procedure of M3N . Using official dataset
for noun phrase (NP) chunking as a case study,
the resulting optimizer converges to the same qual-
ity of solution over an order of magnitude faster
than the structured sequential minimal optimization
(structured SMO). Our model compares favorably
with current state-of-the-art sequence labeling ap-
proaches. More importantly, our model can be eas-
ily applied to other sequence labeling tasks.
