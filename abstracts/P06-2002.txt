In this paper, we describe a rote extrac-
tor that learns patterns for finding seman-
tic relationships in unrestricted text, with
new procedures for pattern generalization
and scoring. These include the use of part-
of-speech tags to guide the generalization,
Named Entity categories inside the pat-
terns, an edit-distance-based pattern gen-
eralization algorithm, and a pattern accu-
racy calculation procedure based on eval-
uating the patterns on several test corpora.
In an evaluation with 14 entities, the sys-
tem attains a precision higher than 50% for
half of the relationships considered.
