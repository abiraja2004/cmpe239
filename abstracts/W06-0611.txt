As the interest in annotated corpora is
spreading, there is increasing concern with
using existing language technology for
corpus processing. In this paper we ex-
plore the idea of using natural language
generation systems for corpus annotation.
Resources for generation systems often fo-
cus on areas of linguistic variability that
are under-represented in analysis-directed
approaches. Therefore, making use of
generation resources promises some sig-
nificant extensions in the kinds of anno-
tation information that can be captured.
We focus here on exploring the use of
the KPML (Komet-Penman MultiLingual)
generation system for corpus annotation.
We describe the kinds of linguistic infor-
mation covered in KPML and show the
steps involved in creating a standard XML
corpus representation from KPML?s gener-
ation output.
