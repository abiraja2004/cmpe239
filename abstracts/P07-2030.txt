This paper proposes the idea of ranking def-
initions of a person (a set of biographi-
cal facts) to automatically generate ?Who
is this?? quizzes. The definitions are or-
dered according to how difficult they make
it to name the person. Such ranking would
enable users to interactively learn about a
person through dialogue with a system with
improved understanding and lasting motiva-
tion, which is useful for educational sys-
tems. In our approach, we train a ranker
that learns from data the appropriate ranking
of definitions based on features that encode
the importance of keywords in a definition
as well as its content. Experimental results
show that our approach is significantly better
in ranking definitions than baselines that use
conventional information retrieval measures
such as tf*idf and pointwisemutual informa-
tion (PMI).
