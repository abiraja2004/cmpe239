Karamel is a system for finite-state mor-
phology which is multi-tape and uses a
typed Cartesian product to relate tapes in
a structured way. It implements stati-
cally compiled feature structures. Its lan-
guage allows the use of regular expres-
sions and Generalized Restriction rules to
define multi-tape transducers. Both simul-
taneous and successive application of local
constraints are possible. This system is in-
teresting for describing rich and structured
morphologies such as the morphology of
Semitic languages.
