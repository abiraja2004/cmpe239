Despite many methods that effectively
solve sentiment classification task for such
widely used languages as English, there
is no clear answer which methods are
the most suitable for the languages that
are substantially different. In this paper
we attempt to solve Internet comments
sentiment classification task for Lithua-
nian, using two classification approaches ?
knowledge-based and supervised machine
learning. We explore an influence of senti-
ment word dictionaries based on the differ-
ent parts-of-speech (adjectives, adverbs,
nouns, and verbs) for knowledge-based
method; different feature types (bag-of-
words, lemmas, word n-grams, character
n-grams) for machine learning methods;
and pre-processing techniques (emoticons
replacement with sentiment words, dia-
critics replacement, etc.) for both ap-
proaches. Despite that supervised ma-
chine learning methods (Support Vec-
tor Machine and Na??ve Bayes Multino-
mial) significantly outperform proposed
knowledge-based method all obtained re-
sults are above baseline. The best accu-
racy 0.679 was achieved with Na??ve Bayes
Multinomial and token unigrams plus bi-
grams, when pre-processing involved dia-
critics replacement.
