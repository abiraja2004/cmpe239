 
The paper presents an Expectation Maximiza-
tion (EM) algorithm for automatic generation 
of parallel and quasi-parallel data from any 
degree of comparable corpora ranging from 
parallel to weakly comparable. Specifically, 
we address the problem of extracting related 
textual units (documents, paragraphs or sen-
tences) relying on the hypothesis that, in a 
given corpus, certain pairs of translation 
equivalents are better indicators of a correct 
textual unit correspondence than other pairs of 
translation equivalents. We evaluate our 
method on mixed types of bilingual compara-
ble corpora in six language pairs, obtaining 
state of the art accuracy figures.
