This paper argues for teaching computer sci-
ence to linguists through a general course at
the introductory graduate level whose goal is
to prepare students of all backgrounds for col-
laborative computational research, especially
in the sciences. We describe our work over
the past three years in creating a model course
in the area, called Computational Thinking.
What makes this course distinctive is its com-
bined emphasis on the formulation and solu-
tion of computational problems, strategies for
interdisciplinary communication, and critical
thinking about computational explanations.
