 
This paper describes the development of 
a rule-based computational model that 
describes how a feature-based representa-
tion of shared visual information com-
bines with linguistic cues to enable effec-
tive reference resolution. This work ex-
plores a language-only model, a visual-
only model, and an integrated model of 
reference resolution and applies them to a 
corpus of transcribed task-oriented spo-
ken dialogues. Preliminary results from a 
corpus-based analysis suggest that inte-
grating information from a shared visual 
environment can improve the perform-
ance and quality of existing discourse-
based models of reference resolution.
