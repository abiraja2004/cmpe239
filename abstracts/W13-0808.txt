We propose synchronous linear context-free
rewriting systems as an extension to syn-
chronous context-free grammars in which syn-
chronized non-terminals span k ? 1 continu-
ous blocks on each side of the bitext. Such
discontinuous constituents are required for in-
ducing certain alignment configurations that
occur relatively frequently in manually an-
notated parallel corpora and that cannot be
generated with less expressive grammar for-
malisms. As part of our investigations con-
cerning the minimal k that is required for in-
ducing manual alignments, we present a hier-
archical aligner in form of a deduction system.
We find that by restricting k to 2 on both sides,
100% of the data can be covered.
