In Sayeed and Szpakowicz (2004), we
proposed a parser inspired by some as-
pects of the Minimalist Program. This
incremental parser was designed specifi-
cally to handle discontinuous constituency
phenomena for NPs in Latin. We take a
look at the application of this parser to a
specific kind of apparent island violation
in Latin involving the extraction of con-
stituents, including subjects, from tensed
embedded clauses. We make use of ideas
about the left periphery from Rizzi (1997)
to modify our parser in order to handle ap-
parently violated subject islands and simi-
lar phenomena.
