 
In this paper we propose a probabilistic graph-
ical model as an innovative framework for 
studying typological universals. We view lan-
guage as a system and linguistic features as its 
components whose relationships are encoded 
in a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). Taking 
discovery of the word order universals as a 
knowledge discovery task we learn the graph-
ical representation of a word order sub-system 
which reveals a finer structure such as direct 
and indirect dependencies among word order 
features. Then probabilistic inference enables 
us to see the strength of such relationships: 
given the observed value of one feature (or 
combination of features), the probabilities of 
values of other features can be calculated.  Our 
model is not restricted to using only two val-
ues of a feature. Using imputation technique 
and EM algorithm it can handle missing val-
ues well. Model averaging technique solves 
the problem of limited data. In addition the in-
cremental and divide-and-conquer method ad-
dresses the areal and genetic effects simulta-
neously instead of separately as in Daum? III 
and Campbell (2007).
