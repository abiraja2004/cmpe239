We propose a Named Entities translitera-
tion mining system using Finite State Au-
tomata (FSA). We compare the proposed
approach with a baseline system that uti-
lizes the Editex technique to measure the
length-normalized phonetic based edit dis-
tance between the two words. We sub-
mitted three standard runs in NEWS2010
shared task and ranked first for English
to Arabic (WM-EnAr) and obtained an F-
measure of 0.915, 0.903, and 0.874 re-
spectively.
