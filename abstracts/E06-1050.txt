All questions are implicitly associated
with an expected answer type. Unlike
previous approaches that require a prede-
fined set of question types, we present
a method for dynamically constructing
a probability-based answer type model
for each different question. Our model
evaluates the appropriateness of a poten-
tial answer by the probability that it fits
into the question contexts. Evaluation
is performed against manual and semi-
automatic methods using a fixed set of an-
swer labels. Results show our approach to
be superior for those questions classified
as having a miscellaneous answer type.
