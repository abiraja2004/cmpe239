We use L1 regularized transductive regres-
sion to learn mappings between source
and target features of the training sets
derived for each test sentence and use
these mappings to rerank translation out-
puts. We compare the effectiveness of L1
regularization techniques for regression to
learn mappings between features given in
a sparse feature matrix. The results show
the effectiveness of using L1 regulariza-
tion versus L2 used in ridge regression.
We show that regression mapping is ef-
fective in reranking translation outputs and
in selecting the best system combinations
with encouraging results on different lan-
guage pairs.
