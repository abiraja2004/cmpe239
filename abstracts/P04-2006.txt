 
Paraphrase recognition is used in a num-
ber of applications such as tutoring sys-
tems, question answering systems, and 
information retrieval systems. The con-
text of our research is the iSTART read-
ing strategy trainer for science texts, 
which needs to understand and recognize 
the trainee?s input and respond appropri-
ately. This paper describes the motivation 
for paraphrase recognition and develops a 
definition of the strategy as well as a rec-
ognition model for paraphrasing. Lastly, 
we discuss our preliminary implementa-
tion and research plan.
