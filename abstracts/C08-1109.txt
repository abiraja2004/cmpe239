In this paper we describe a methodology
for detecting preposition errors in the writ-
ing of non-native English speakers. Our
system performs at 84% precision and
close to 19% recall on a large set of stu-
dent essays. In addition, we address the
problem of annotation and evaluation in
this domain by showing how current ap-
proaches of using only one rater can skew
system evaluation. We present a sampling
approach to circumvent some of the issues
that complicate evaluation of error detec-
tion systems.
