Automatic post-editing (APE) systems aim at
correcting the output of machine translation
systems to produce better quality translations,
i.e. produce translations can be manually post-
edited with an increase in productivity. In this
work, we present an APE system that uses sta-
tistical models to enhance a commercial rule-
based machine translation (RBMT) system. In
addition, a procedure for effortless human eva-
luation has been established. We have tested
the APE system with two corpora of differ-
ent complexity. For the Parliament corpus, we
show that the APE system significantly com-
plements and improves the RBMT system. Re-
sults for the Protocols corpus, although less
conclusive, are promising as well. Finally,
several possible sources of errors have been
identified which will help develop future sys-
tem enhancements.
