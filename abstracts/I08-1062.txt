 
We present the results of research with the 
goal of automatically creating a multilin-
gual thesaurus based on the freely available 
resources of Wikipedia and WordNet. Our 
goal is to increase resources for natural 
language processing tasks such as machine 
translation targeting the Japanese-Spanish 
language pair. Given the scarcity of re-
sources, we use existing English resources 
as a pivot for creating a trilingual Japanese-
Spanish-English thesaurus. Our approach 
consists of extracting the translation tuples 
from Wikipedia, disambiguating them by 
mapping them to WordNet word senses. 
We present results comparing two methods 
of disambiguation, the first using VSM on 
Wikipedia article texts and WordNet defi-
nitions, and the second using categorical 
information extracted from Wikipedia, We 
find that mixing the two methods produces 
favorable results. Using the proposed 
method, we have constructed a multilingual 
Spanish-Japanese-English thesaurus con-
sisting of 25,375 entries. The same method 
can be applied to any pair of languages that 
are linked to English in Wikipedia.
