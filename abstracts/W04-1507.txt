In this paper we present work in progress on the
annotation of an Italian Corpus (CORIS) devel-
oped at CILTA (University of Bologna). We in-
duce categorial type assignments from a depen-
dency treebank (Torino University treebank,
TUT) and use the obtained categories with an-
notated dependency relations to study the dis-
tributional behavior of Italian words and reach
an empirically founded part-of-speech classifica-
tion.
