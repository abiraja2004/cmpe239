In this paper, a novel system for the automatic
identification and conjugation of Spanish verb
neologisms is presented. The paper describes
a rule-based algorithm consisting of six steps
which are taken to determine whether a new
verb is regular or not, and to establish the rules
that the verb should follow in its conjugation.
The method was evaluated on 4,307 new verbs
and its performance found to be satisfactory
both for irregular and regular neologisms. The
algorithm also contains extra rules to cater for
verb neologisms in Spanish that do not exist as
yet, but are inferred to be possible in light of
existing cases of new verb creation in Spanish.
