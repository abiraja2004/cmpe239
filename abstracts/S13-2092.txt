In this paper we introduce our contribution
to the SemEval-2013 Task 2 on ?Sentiment
Analysis in Twitter?. We participated in ?task
B?, where the objective was to build mod-
els which classify tweets into three classes
(positive, negative or neutral) by their con-
tents. To solve this problem we basically fol-
lowed the supervised learning approach and
proposed several domain (i.e. microblog) spe-
cific improvements including text preprocess-
ing and feature engineering. Beyond the su-
pervised setting we also introduce some early
results employing a huge, automatically anno-
tated tweet dataset.
