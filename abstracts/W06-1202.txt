 
This paper reports on an experiment in 
which we explore a new approach to the 
automatic measurement of multi-word 
expression (MWE) compositionality. We 
propose an algorithm which ranks MWEs 
by their compositionality relative to a 
semantic field taxonomy based on the 
Lancaster English semantic lexicon (Piao 
et al, 2005a). The semantic information 
provided by the lexicon is used for meas-
uring the semantic distance between a 
MWE and its constituent words. The al-
gorithm is evaluated both on 89 manually 
ranked MWEs and on McCarthy et als 
(2003) manually ranked phrasal verbs. 
We compared the output of our tool with 
human judgments using Spearman?s 
rank-order correlation coefficient. Our 
evaluation shows that the automatic rank-
ing of the majority of our test data 
(86.52%) has strong to moderate correla-
tion with the manual ranking while wide 
discrepancy is found for a small number 
of MWEs. Our algorithm also obtained a 
correlation of 0.3544 with manual rank-
ing on McCarthy et als test data, which 
is comparable or better than most of the 
measures they tested. This experiment 
demonstrates that a semantic lexicon can 
assist in MWE compositionality meas-
urement in addition to statistical algo-
rithms.
