 
In this paper we propose a new technique to 
enhance emotion recognition by combining 
in different ways what we call emotion pre-
dictions. The technique is called F2 as the 
combination is based on a double fusion 
process. The input to the first fusion phase is 
the output of a number of classifiers which 
deal with different types of information re-
garding each sentence uttered by the user. 
The output of this process is the input to the 
second fusion stage, which provides as out-
put the most likely emotional category. Ex-
periments have been carried out using a pre-
viously-developed spoken dialogue system 
designed for the fast food domain. Results 
obtained considering three and two emo-
tional categories show that our technique 
outperforms the standard single fusion tech-
nique by 2.25% and 3.35% absolute, respec-
tively.
