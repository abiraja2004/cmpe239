 
American Sign Language (ASL) generation software can improve the accessibility of in-formation and services for deaf individuals with low English literacy.  The understand-ability of current ASL systems is limited; they have been constructed without the benefit of annotated ASL corpora that encode detailed human movement.  We discuss how linguistic challenges in ASL generation can be ad-dressed in a data-driven manner, and we de-scribe our current work on collecting a motion-capture corpus. To evaluate the qual-ity of our motion-capture configuration, cali-bration, and recording protocol, we conducted an evaluation study with native ASL signers. 1
