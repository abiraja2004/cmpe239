Large amount of parallel corpora is re-
quired for building Statistical Machine
Translation (SMT) systems. We describe
the TransDoop system for gathering trans-
lations to create parallel corpora from on-
line crowd workforce who have familiar-
ity with multiple languages but are not
expert translators. Our system uses a
Map-Reduce-like approach to translation
crowdsourcing where sentence translation
is decomposed into the following smaller
tasks: (a) translation of constituent phrases
of the sentence; (b) validation of qual-
ity of the phrase translations; and (c)
composition of complete sentence trans-
lations from phrase translations. Trans-
Doop incorporates quality control mech-
anisms and easy-to-use worker user in-
terfaces designed to address issues with
translation crowdsourcing. We have eval-
uated the crowd?s output using the ME-
TEOR metric. For a complex domain like
judicial proceedings, the higher scores ob-
tained by the map-reduce based approach
compared to complete sentence translation
establishes the efficacy of our work.
