 
Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA)  is a statistical 
Natural Language Processing (NLP) technique for 
inferring meaning from a text. Existing LSA-based 
applications focus on formative assessment in 
general domains. The suitability of LSA for 
summative assessment in the domain of computer 
science is not well known.  The results from the 
pilot study reported in this paper encourage us to 
pursue further research in the use of LSA in the 
narrow, technical domain of computer science. 
This paper explains the theory behind LSA, 
describes some existing LSA applications, and 
presents some results using LSA for automatic 
marking of short essays for a graduate class in 
architectures of computing systems.
