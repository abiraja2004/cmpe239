We propose an approach for extracting re-
lations between entities from biomedical
literature based solely on shallow linguis-
tic information. We use a combination of
kernel functions to integrate two different
information sources: (i) the whole sen-
tence where the relation appears, and (ii)
the local contexts around the interacting
entities. We performed experiments on ex-
tracting gene and protein interactions from
two different data sets. The results show
that our approach outperforms most of the
previous methods based on syntactic and
semantic information.
