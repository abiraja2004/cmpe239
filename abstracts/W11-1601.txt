In this paper we examine the sentence sim-
plification problem as an English-to-English
translation problem, utilizing a corpus of
137K aligned sentence pairs extracted by
aligning English Wikipedia and Simple En-
glish Wikipedia. This data set contains the
full range of transformation operations includ-
ing rewording, reordering, insertion and dele-
tion. We introduce a new translation model
for text simplification that extends a phrase-
based machine translation approach to include
phrasal deletion. Evaluated based on three
metrics that compare against a human refer-
ence (BLEU, word-F1 and SSA) our new ap-
proach performs significantly better than two
text compression techniques (including T3)
and the phrase-based translation system with-
out deletion.
