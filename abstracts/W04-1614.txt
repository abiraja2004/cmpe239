 
Pakistan has a population of 140 million 
speaking more than 56 different languages.  
Urdu is the lingua franca of these people, as 
many speak Urdu as a second language, also 
the national language of Pakistan.  Being a 
developing population, Pakistani people need 
access to information.  Most of the 
information over the ICT infrastructure is only 
available in English and only 5-10% of these 
people are familiar with English.  Therefore, 
Government of Pakistan has embarked on a 
project which will generate software to 
automatically translate the information 
available in English to Urdu.  The project will 
also be able to convert Urdu text to speech to 
extend this information to the illiterate 
population as well.  This paper overviews the 
overall architecture of the project and provides 
briefs on the three components of this project, 
namely Urdu Lexicon, English to Urdu 
Machine Translation System and Urdu Text to 
Speech System.
