A major obstacle to part-of-speech
(=POS) tagging of Northern Sotho
(Bantu, S 32) are ambiguous function
words. Many are highly polysemous and
very frequent in texts, and their local
context is not always distinctive.
With certain taggers, this issue leads to
comparatively poor results (between 88
and 92 % accuracy), especially when
sizeable tagsets (over 100 tags) are used.
We use the RF-tagger (Schmid and Laws,
2008), which is particularly designed for
the annotation of fine-grained tagsets (e.g.
including agreement information), and
we restructure the 141 tags of the tagset
proposed by Taljard et al (2008) in a way
to fit the RF tagger. This leads to over
94 % accuracy. Error analysis in addition
shows which types of phenomena cause
trouble in the POS-tagging of Northern
Sotho.
