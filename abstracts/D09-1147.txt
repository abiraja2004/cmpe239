We propose a novel objective function for dis-
criminatively tuning log-linear machine trans-
lation models. Our objective explicitly op-
timizes the BLEU score of expected n-gram
counts, the same quantities that arise in forest-
based consensus and minimum Bayes risk de-
coding methods. Our continuous objective
can be optimized using simple gradient as-
cent. However, computing critical quantities
in the gradient necessitates a novel dynamic
program, which we also present here. As-
suming BLEU as an evaluation measure, our
objective function has two principle advan-
tages over standard max BLEU tuning. First,
it specifically optimizes model weights for
downstream consensus decoding procedures.
An unexpected second benefit is that it reduces
overfitting, which can improve test set BLEU
scores when using standard Viterbi decoding.
