We establish a novel task in the spirit of news sum-
marization and topic detection and tracking (TDT):
daily determination of the topics newly popular with
Wikipedia readers. Central to this effort is a new
public dataset consisting of the hourly page view
statistics of all Wikipedia articles over the last three
years. We give baseline results for the tasks of:
discovering individual pages of interest, clustering
these pages into coherent topics, and extracting the
most relevant summarizing sentence for the reader.
When compared to human judgements, our system
shows the viability of this task, and opens the door
to a range of exciting future work.
