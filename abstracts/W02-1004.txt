This paper demonstrates the substantial empirical
success of classifier combination for the word sense
disambiguation task. It investigates more than 10
classifier combination methods, including second
order classifier stacking, over 6 major structurally
different base classifiers (enhanced Na?ve Bayes,
cosine, Bayes Ratio, decision lists, transformation-
based learning and maximum variance boosted mix-
ture models). The paper also includes in-depth per-
formance analysis sensitive to properties of the fea-
ture space and component classifiers. When eval-
uated on the standard SENSEVAL1 and 2 data sets
on 4 languages (English, Spanish, Basque, and
Swedish), classifier combination performance ex-
ceeds the best published results on these data sets.
