This paper explores the task of building an ac-
curate prepositional phrase attachment corpus
for new genres while avoiding a large invest-
ment in terms of time and money by crowd-
sourcing judgments. We develop and present
a system to extract prepositional phrases and
their potential attachments from ungrammati-
cal and informal sentences and pose the subse-
quent disambiguation tasks as multiple choice
questions to workers from Amazon?s Mechan-
ical Turk service. Our analysis shows that
this two-step approach is capable of producing
reliable annotations on informal and poten-
tially noisy blog text, and this semi-automated
strategy holds promise for similar annotation
projects in new genres.
