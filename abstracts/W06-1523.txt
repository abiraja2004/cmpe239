syntactic dependencies that fall into
the primary empirical domain of
TAG-Adjoining, namely, long-distance
movement/filler-gap dependencies across
a tensed clause boundary. A theory that
incorporates Adjoining as a recursive
structure building device provides a novel
and straightforward account of this gap,
whereas existing theories of syntactic
locality, e.g. of the standard Minimalist
kind, face difficulties explaining the phe-
nomenon. These languages thus supply
direct linguistic evidence for Adjoining.
