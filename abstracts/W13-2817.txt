 
Resource limitation is challenging for cross-
domain adaption. This paper employs patterns 
identified from a monolingual in-domain cor-
pus and patterns learned from the post-edited 
translation results, and translation model as 
well as language model learned from pseudo 
bilingual corpora produced by a baseline MT 
system. The adaptation from a government 
document domain to a medical record 
domain shows the rules mined from the 
monolingual in-domain corpus are useful, 
and the effect of using the selected pseudo 
bilingual corpus is significant.
