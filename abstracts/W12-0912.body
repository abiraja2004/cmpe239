 
This paper presents Brazilian Portuguese 
phoneme patterns of distribution, 
according to an automatic grammar rules-
based grapheme to phoneme converter. 
The software Nhenh?m (Vasil?vski, 
2008) was used for treating data: written 
texts which were decoded into 
phonologic symbols, forming a corpus, 
and subjected to a statistical analysis. 
Results support the high level of 
predictability of Brazilian Portuguese 
phonemes distribution, the consonant-
vowel syllabic pattern as the most 
common, as well as the stress pattern 
distribution 'CV.CV#. The efficiency of a 
phoneme-grapheme converter based 
entirely on rules is also proven. These 
results are displayed and discussed, as 
well as some aspects of Nhe-nh?m 
building.
