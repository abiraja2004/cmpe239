We present two modules for the recogni-
tion and annotation of temporal expres-
sions and events in French texts accord-
ing to the TimeML specification language.
The Temporal Expression Tagger we have
developed is based on a large coverage
cascade of finite state transducers and our
Event Tagger on a set of simple heuris-
tics applied over local context in a chunked
text. We present results of a preliminary
evaluation and compare them with those
obtained by a similar system.
