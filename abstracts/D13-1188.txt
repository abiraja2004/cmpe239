A very valuable piece of information in news-
paper articles is the tonality of extracted state-
ments. For the analysis of tonality of newspa-
per articles either a big human effort is needed,
when it is carried out by media analysts, or an
automated approach which has to be as accu-
rate as possible for a Media Response Anal-
ysis (MRA). To this end, we will compare
several state-of-the-art approaches for Opin-
ion Mining in newspaper articles in this pa-
per. Furthermore, we will introduce a new
technique to extract entropy-based word con-
nections which identifies the word combina-
tions which create a tonality. In the evalua-
tion, we use two different corpora consisting
of news articles, by which we show that the
new approach achieves better results than the
four state-of-the-art methods.
