 
Nocuous ambiguity occurs when a lin-
guistic expression is interpreted differ-
ently by different readers in a given con-
text. We present an approach to auto-
matically identify nocuous ambiguity 
that is likely to lead to misunderstand-
ings among readers. Our model is built 
on a machine learning architecture. It 
learns from a set of heuristics each of 
which predicts a factor that may lead a 
reader to favor a particular interpretation. 
An ambiguity threshold indicates the ex-
tent to which ambiguity can be tolerated 
in the application domain. Collections of 
human judgments are used to train heu-
ristics and set ambiguity thresholds, and 
for evaluation. We report results from 
applying the methodology to coordina-
tion and anaphora ambiguity. Results 
show that the method can identify nocu-
ous ambiguity in text, and may be wid-
ened to cover further types of ambiguity. 
We discuss approaches to evaluation.
