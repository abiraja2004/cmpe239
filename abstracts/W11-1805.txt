Abstract
In this paper we describe our approach to
the BioNLP 2011 shared task on biomedical
event extraction from abstracts and full pa-
pers. We employ a joint inference system de-
veloped using the search-based structured pre-
diction framework and show that it improves
on a pipeline using the same features and it is
better able to handle the domain shift from ab-
stracts to full papers. In addition, we report on
experiments using a simple domain adaptation
method.
