The constraint-oriented approaches to lan-
guage processing step back from the gen-
erative theory and make it possible, in the-
ory, to deal with all types of linguistic re-
lationships (e.g. dependency, linear prece-
dence or immediate dominance) with the
same importance when parsing an input
utterance. Yet in practice, all implemented
constraint-oriented parsing strategies still
need to discriminate between ?important?
and ?not-so-important? types of relations
during the parsing process.
In this paper we introduce a new
constraint-oriented parsing strategy based
on Property Grammars, which overcomes
this drawback and grants the same impor-
tance to all types of relations.
