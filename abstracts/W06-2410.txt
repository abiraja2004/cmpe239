 
Multiword units significantly contribute 
to the robustness of MT systems as they 
reduce the inevitable ambiguity inherent 
in word to word matching. The paper fo-
cuses on a relatively little studied kind of 
MW units which are partially fixed and 
partially productive. In fact, MW units 
will be shown to form a continuum be-
tween completely frozen expression 
where the lexical elements are specified 
at the level of particular word forms and 
those which are produced by syntactic 
rules defined in terms of general part of 
speech categories. The paper will argue 
for the use of local grammars proposed 
by Maurice Gross to capture the produc-
tive regularity of MW units and will il-
lustrate a uniform implementation of 
them in the NooJ grammar development 
framework.
