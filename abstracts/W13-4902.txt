We present the first statistical dependency
parsing results for Lithuanian, a morpholog-
ically rich language in the Baltic branch of
the Indo-European family. Using a greedy
transition-based parser, we obtain a labeled at-
tachment score of 74.7 with gold morphology
and 68.1 with predicted morphology (77.8 and
72.8 unlabeled). We investigate the usefulness
of different features and find that rich morpho-
logical features improve parsing accuracy sig-
nificantly, by 7.5 percentage points with gold
features and 5.6 points with predicted features.
As expected, CASE is the single most impor-
tant morphological feature, but virtually all
available features bring some improvement,
especially under the gold condition.
