 
Reordering is pre-processing stage for Statisti-
cal Machine Translation (SMT) system where 
the words of the source sentence are re-
ordered as per the syntax of the target lan-
guage. We are proposing a rich set of rules for 
better reordering. The idea is to facilitate the 
training process by better alignments and par-
allel phrase extraction for a phrase based SMT 
system.  Reordering also helps the decoding 
process and hence improving the machine 
translation quality. We have observed signifi-
cant improvements in the translation quality 
by using our approach over the baseline SMT. 
We have used BLEU, NIST, multi-reference 
word error rate, multi-reference position inde-
pendent error rate for judging the improve-
ments. We have exploited open source SMT 
toolkit MOSES to develop the system.
