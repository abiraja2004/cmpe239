 
In this paper we describe a neural networks 
approach to generation. The task is to generate 
sentences with hotel-information from a 
structured atabase. The system is inspired by 
Karen Kukich's ANA, but expands on it by 
adding generality in the form of language 
independence in representations and lexical 
look-up.
