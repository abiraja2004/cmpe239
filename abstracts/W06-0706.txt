We present a comparative study of corpus-
based methods for the automatic synthe-
sis of email responses to help-desk re-
quests. Our methods were developed by
considering two operational dimensions:
(1) information-gathering technique, and
(2) granularity of the information. In par-
ticular, we investigate two techniques ? re-
trieval and prediction ? applied to infor-
mation represented at two levels of granu-
larity ? sentence-level and document level.
We also developed a hybrid method that
combines prediction with retrieval. Our
results show that the different approaches
are applicable in different situations, ad-
dressing a combined 72% of the requests
with either complete or partial responses.
