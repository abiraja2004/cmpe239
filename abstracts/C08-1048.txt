 
Part of the unique cultural heritage of 
China is the game of Chinese couplets 
(du?li?n). One person challenges the oth-
er person with a sentence (first sentence). 
The other person then replies with a sen-
tence (second sentence) equal in length 
and word segmentation, in a way that 
corresponding words in the two sentences 
match each other by obeying certain con-
straints on semantic, syntactic, and lexi-
cal relatedness. This task is viewed as a 
difficult problem in AI and has not been 
explored in the research community. 
In this paper, we regard this task as a 
kind of machine translation process. We 
present a phrase-based SMT approach to 
generate the second sentence. First, the 
system takes as input the first sentence, 
and generates as output an N-best list of 
proposed second sentences, using a 
phrase-based SMT decoder. Then, a set 
of filters is used to remove candidates vi-
olating linguistic constraints. Finally, a 
Ranking SVM is applied to rerank the 
candidates. A comprehensive evaluation, 
using both human judgments and BLEU 
scores, has been conducted, and the re-
sults demonstrate that this approach is 
very successful.
