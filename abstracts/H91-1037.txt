 
This paper eports a handful of experiments designed to test the 
feasibility of applying well-known partial parsing techniques to the 
problem of automatic data base update from an open-ended source 
of messages, and the feasiblity of automatically learning semantic 
knowledge from annotated examples. The challenges arise from 
the incompleteness of any lexicon, sentences that average over 20 
words in length, and the lack of a complete semantics.
