We present cdec, an open source frame-
work for decoding, aligning with, and
training a number of statistical machine
translation models, including word-based
models, phrase-based models, and models
based on synchronous context-free gram-
mars. Using a single unified internal
representation for translation forests, the
decoder strictly separates model-specific
translation logic from general rescoring,
pruning, and inference algorithms. From
this unified representation, the decoder can
extract not only the 1- or k-best transla-
tions, but also alignments to a reference,
or the quantities necessary to drive dis-
criminative training using gradient-based
or gradient-free optimization techniques.
Its efficient C++ implementation means
that memory use and runtime performance
are significantly better than comparable
decoders.
