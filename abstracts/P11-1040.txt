We present a novel method for record extrac-
tion from social streams such as Twitter. Un-
like typical extraction setups, these environ-
ments are characterized by short, one sentence
messages with heavily colloquial speech. To
further complicate matters, individual mes-
sages may not express the full relation to be
uncovered, as is often assumed in extraction
tasks. We develop a graphical model that ad-
dresses these problems by learning a latent set
of records and a record-message alignment si-
multaneously; the output of our model is a
set of canonical records, the values of which
are consistent with aligned messages. We
demonstrate that our approach is able to accu-
rately induce event records from Twitter mes-
sages, evaluated against events from a local
city guide. Our method achieves significant
error reduction over baseline methods.1
