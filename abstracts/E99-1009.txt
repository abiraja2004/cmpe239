 
Interaction of lexical and derivational 
semantics---for example substitution 
and lambda conversion--- is typically 
a part of the on-line interpretation 
process. Proof-nets are to categorial 
grammar what phrase markers are to 
phrase structure grammar: unique 
graphical structures underlying 
equivalence classes of sequential 
syntactic derivations; but the role of 
proof-nets is deeper since they 
integrate also semantics. In this paper 
we show how interaction of lexical 
and derivational semantics at the 
lexico-syntactic interface can be 
precomputed as a process of off-line 
lexical compilation comprising Cut 
elimination in partial proof-nets.
