This paper presents a syntactic description of a fragment of 
German that has been worked out within the machine 
translation project Eurotra. It represents he syntactic part of the 
German module of this multilingual translation system. The 
linguistic tool for the following analyses is the so-called CAT- 
framework. 
In the first two sections of this paper an introduction of the 
formalism and a linguistic characterization f tile framework is 
given. The CAT formalism as a whole is a theory of machine 
translation, the syntactic analysis part which is the subject of 
this paper is an LFG-like mapping of a constituent structure 
onto a functional structure. 
A third section develops principles for a phrase structure and a 
functional structure for German and the mapping of phrase 
structure onto functional structure. 
In a fourth section a treatment of unbounded movement 
phenomena is sketched. As the CAT-framework does not 
provide any global mechanisms I try to give a local treatment of 
this problem.
