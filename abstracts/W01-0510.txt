The paper presents a data-driven approach to infor-
mation extraction (viewed as template lling) using
the structured language model (SLM) as a statistical
parser. The task of template lling is cast as con-
strained parsing using the SLM. The model is auto-
matically trained from a set of sentences annotated
with frame/slot labels and spans. Training pro-
ceeds in stages: rst a constrained syntactic parser
is trained such that the parses on training data meet
the specied semantic spans, then the non-terminal
labels are enriched to contain semantic information
and nally a constrained syntactic+semantic parser
is trained on the parse trees resulting from the pre-
vious stage. Despite the small amount of training
data used, the model is shown to outperform the
slot level accuracy of a simple semantic grammar
authored manually for the MiPad | personal infor-
mation management | task.
