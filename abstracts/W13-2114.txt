When instructors prepare learning materi-
als for students, they frequently develop
accompanying questions to guide learn-
ing. Natural language processing technol-
ogy can be used to automatically generate
such questions but techniques used have
not fully leveraged semantic information
contained in the learning materials or the
full context in which the question genera-
tion task occurs. We introduce a sophisti-
cated template-based approach that incor-
porates semantic role labels into a system
that automatically generates natural lan-
guage questions to support online learn-
ing. While we have not yet incorporated
the full learning context into our approach,
our preliminary evaluation and evaluation
methodology indicate our approach is a
promising one for supporting learning.
