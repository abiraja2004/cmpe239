Resonance Imaging (fMRI) offer a significant 
new approach to studying semantic represen-
tations in humans by making it possible to di-
rectly observe brain activity while people 
comprehend words and sentences. In this 
study, we investigate how humans compre-
hend adjective-noun phrases (e.g. strong dog) 
while their neural activity is recorded. Classi-
fication analysis shows that the distributed 
pattern of neural activity contains sufficient 
signal to decode differences among phrases. 
Furthermore, vector-based semantic models 
can explain a significant portion of system-
atic variance in the observed neural activity. 
Multiplicative composition models of the 
two-word phrase outperform additive models, 
consistent with the assumption that people 
use adjectives to modify the meaning of the 
noun, rather than conjoining the meaning of 
the adjective and noun.
