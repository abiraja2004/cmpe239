 
In leading morpho-phonological theories and 
state-of-the-art text-to-speech systems it is 
assumed that word pronunciation cannot be 
learned or performed without in-between anal- 
yses at several abstraction levels (e.g., mor- 
phological, graphemic, phonemic, syllabic, and 
stress levels). We challenge this assump- 
tion for the case of English word pronunci- 
ation. Using IGTR~B, an inductive-learning 
decision-tree algorithms, we train and test 
three word-pronunciation systems in which the 
number of abstraction levels (implemented as 
sequenced modules) is reduced from five, via 
three, to one. The latter system, classifying 
letter strings directly as mapping to phonemes 
with stress markers, yields signitlcemtly better 
generali~tion accuracies than the two multi- 
module systems. Analyses of empirical results 
indicate that positive utility etfects of sequenc- 
ing modules are outweighed by cascading er- 
rors passed on between modules.
