The growing amount of textual information
available electronically has increased the need
for high performance retrieval. The use of
phrases was long seen as a natural way to im-
prove retrieval performance over the common
document models that ignore the sequential as-
pect of word occurrences in documents, consid-
ering them as ?bags of words?. However, both
statistical and syntactical phrases showed disap-
pointing results for large document collections.
In this paper we present a recent type of
multi-word expressions in the form of Maxi-
mal Frequent Sequences (Ahonen-Myka, 1999).
Mined phrases rather than statistical or syntac-
tical phrases, their main strengths are to form
a very compact index and to account for the
sequentiality and adjacency of meaningful word
co-occurrences, by allowing for a gap between
words.
We introduce a method for using these
phrases in information retrieval and present our
experiments. They show a clear improvement
over the well-known technique of extracting fre-
quent word pairs.
