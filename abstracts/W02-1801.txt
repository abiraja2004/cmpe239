  
More and more researchers have recognized 
the potential value of the parallel corpus in the 
research on Machine Translation and Machine 
Aided Translation. This paper examines how 
Chinese English translation units could be 
extracted from parallel corpus. An iterative 
algorithm based on degree of word association is 
proposed to identify the multiword units for 
Chinese and English. Then the Chinese-English 
Translation Equivalent Pairs.are extracted from 
the parallel corpus. We also made comparison 
between different statistical association 
measurement in this paper.
