 
Accessibility of candidate r ferents i a crucial 
factor in successful reference assignment and 
this intuition has been adequately 
accommodated and developed in centering 
theory. By contrast, another equally important 
factor involved in reference assignment, 
namely, accessibility of contextual 
assumptions, seems to have not been 
addressed fully as a part of a computational 
theory of reference. In the field of pragmatics, 
however, the role of context has always been 
one of the central issues and the recent 
approach to context selection based on the 
notion of relevance (Sperber & Wilson 
1986/1995) seems to be currently the most 
promising. In this paper, I will review and 
assess the recent centering approach to the 
interpretation of Japanese zero pronouns 
(Walker et al 1994) as a case study, and 
suggest that relevance theory can provide one 
way of complementing it. In order ?to 
incorporate a needed mechanism of contextual 
selection i to a model of reference assignment, 
model builders must take into account he 
heater's ability to anticipate certain cognitive 
effects that may be achieved by upcoming 
utterances. It is my hope that this paper will 
lead to a fruitful discussion of finding possible 
ways of using Sperber & Wilson-'s notion of 
relevance inpractical applications.
