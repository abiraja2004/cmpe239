In this paper we investigate the rela-
tion between positive and negative pairs
in Textual Entailment (TE), in order to
highlight the role of contradiction in TE
datasets. We base our analysis on the de-
composition of Text-Hypothesis pairs into
monothematic pairs, i.e. pairs where only
one linguistic phenomenon at a time is re-
sponsible for entailment judgment and we
argue that such a deeper inspection of the
linguistic phenomena behind textual en-
tailment is necessary in order to highlight
the role of contradiction. We support our
analysis with a number of empirical ex-
periments, which use current available TE
systems.
