We describe a method for augmenting
unification-based deep parsing with statis-
tical methods. We extend and adapt the
Bikel parser, which uses head-driven lex-
ical statistics, to dialogue. We show that
our augmented parser produces signifi-
cantly fewer constituents than the baseline
system and achieves comparable brack-
eting accuracy, even yielding slight im-
provements for longer sentences.
