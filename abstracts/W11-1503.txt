The goal of this study is to evaluate an ?off-
the-shelf? POS-tagger for modern German on
historical data from the Early Modern period
(1650-1800). With no specialised tagger avail-
able for this particular stage of the language,
our findings will be of particular interest to
smaller, humanities-based projects wishing to
add POS annotations to their historical data
but which lack the means or resources to train
a POS tagger themselves. Our study assesses
the effects of spelling variation on the perfor-
mance of the tagger, and investigates to what
extent tagger performance can be improved by
using ?normalised? input, where spelling vari-
ants in the corpus are standardised to a mod-
ern form. Our findings show that adding such
a normalisation layer improves tagger perfor-
mance considerably.
