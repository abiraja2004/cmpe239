This paper presents our approach (referred to
as BioEvent) for protein-level complex event
extraction, developed for the GENIA task
(Kim et al, 2011b) of the BioNLP Shared
Task 2011 (Kim et al, 2011a). We devel-
oped a double layered machine learning ap-
proach which utilizes a state-of-the-art mini-
mized feature set for each of the event types.
We improved the best performing system
of BioNLP 2009 overall, and ranked first
amongst 15 teams in finding ?Localization?
events in 201112. BioEvent is available at
