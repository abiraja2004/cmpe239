We explore a linguistically motivated ap-
proach to the problem of recognizing
speculative language (?hedging?) in bio-
medical research articles. We describe a
method, which draws on prior linguistic
work as well as existing lexical resources
and extends them by introducing syntactic
patterns and a simple weighting scheme to
estimate the speculation level of the sen-
tences. We show that speculative language
can be recognized successfully with such
an approach, discuss some shortcomings of
the method and point out future research
possibilities.
