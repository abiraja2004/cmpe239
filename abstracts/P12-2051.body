In this paper we introduce the novel task of
?word epoch disambiguation,? defined as the
problem of identifying changes in word us-
age over time. Through experiments run us-
ing word usage examples collected from three
major periods of time (1800, 1900, 2000), we
show that the task is feasible, and significant
differences can be observed between occur-
rences of words in different periods of time.
