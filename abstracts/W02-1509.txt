We report in this paper on an experiment on auto-
matic extraction of a Tree Adjoining Grammar from
the WSJ corpus of the Penn Treebank. We use an
automatic tool developed by (Xia, 2001) properly
adapted to our particular need. Rather than address-
ing general aspects of the automatic extraction we
focus on the problems we have found to extract a
linguistically (and computationally) sound grammar
and approaches to handle them.
