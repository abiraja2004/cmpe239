 
This paper describes the latest version of the 
ATEC metric for automatic MT evaluation, 
with parameters optimized for word choice 
and word order, the two fundamental features 
of language that the metric relies on. The 
former is assessed by matching at various 
linguistic levels and weighting the informa-
tiveness of both matched and unmatched 
words. The latter is quantified in term of 
word position and information flow. We also 
discuss those aspects of language not yet 
covered by other existing evaluation metrics 
but carefully considered in the formulation of 
our metric.
