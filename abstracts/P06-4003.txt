 
This demo presents LeXFlow, a work-
flow management system for cross-
fertilization of computational lexicons. 
Borrowing from techniques used in the 
domain of document workflows, we 
model the activity of lexicon manage-
ment as a set of workflow types, where 
lexical entries move across agents in the 
process of being dynamically updated. A 
prototype of LeXFlow has been imple-
mented with extensive use of XML tech-
nologies (XSLT, XPath, XForms, SVG) 
and open-source tools (Cocoon, Tomcat, 
MySQL). LeXFlow is a web-based ap-
plication that enables the cooperative and 
distributed management of computational 
lexicons.
