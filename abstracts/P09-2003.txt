We present a CYK and an Earley-style
algorithm for parsing Range Concatena-
tion Grammar (RCG), using the deduc-
tive parsing framework. The characteris-
tic property of the Earley parser is that we
use a technique of range boundary con-
straint propagation to compute the yields
of non-terminals as late as possible. Ex-
periments show that, compared to previ-
ous approaches, the constraint propagation
helps to considerably decrease the number
of items in the chart.
