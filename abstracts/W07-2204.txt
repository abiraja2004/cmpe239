We introduce a set of 1,000 gold standard
parse trees for the British National Corpus
(BNC) and perform a series of self-training
experiments with Charniak and Johnson?s
reranking parser and BNC sentences. We
show that retraining this parser with a com-
bination of one million BNC parse trees
(produced by the same parser) and the orig-
inal WSJ training data yields improvements
of 0.4% on WSJ Section 23 and 1.7% on the
new BNC gold standard set.
