We present the context-theoretic frame-
work, which provides a set of rules for the
nature of composition of meaning based
on the philosophy of meaning as context.
Principally, in the framework the composi-
tion of the meaning of words can be repre-
sented as multiplication of their represen-
tative vectors, where multiplication is dis-
tributive with respect to the vector space.
We discuss the applicability of the frame-
work to a range of techniques in natu-
ral language processing, including subse-
quence matching, the lexical entailment
model of Dagan et al (2005), vector-based
representations of taxonomies, statistical
parsing and the representation of uncer-
tainty in logical semantics.
