Corry is a system for coreference resolution
in English. It supports both local (Soon et
al. (2001)-style) and global (Integer Linear
Programming, Denis and Baldridge (2007)-
style) models of coreference. Corry relies on a
rich linguistically motivated feature set, which
has, however, been manually reduced to 64
features for efficiency reasons. Three runs
have been submitted for the SemEval task 1
on Coreference Resolution (Recasens et al,
2010), optimizing Corry?s performance for
BLANC (Recasens and Hovy, in prep), MUC
(Vilain et al, 1995) and CEAF (Luo, 2005).
Corry runs have shown the best performance
level among all the systems in their track for
the corresponding metric.
