: This paper ~ describes the 
construction of syntactic structures within an 
incremental multi-level and parallel generation 
system. Incremental and parallel generation 
imposes special requirements upon syntactic 
description and processing. A head-driven 
grammar epresented in a unification-based 
formalism is introduced which satisfies these 
demands. Furthermore the basic mechanisms 
for the parallel processing of syntactic segments 
are presented.
