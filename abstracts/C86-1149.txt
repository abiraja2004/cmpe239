  
Building on the well-established premise that reliable machine 
translation requires a significant degree of. text comprehension, 
this paper presents a recent advance in multi-lingual knowledge- 
based machine translation (KBMT). Unlike previous approaches, 
the current method provides for separate syntactic and semantic 
knowledge sources that are integrated dynamically for parsing 
and generation. Such a separation enables the system to have 
syntactic grammars, language specific but domain general, and 
semantic knowledge bases, domain specific but language general. 
Subsequently, grammars and domain knowledge are precompiled 
automatically in any desired combination to produce very efficient 
and very thorough real-time parsers. A pilot implementation of our 
KBMT architecture using functional grammars and entity-oriented 
semantics demonstrates the feasibility of the new approach?
