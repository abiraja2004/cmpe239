We present a unified view of many trans-
lation algorithms that synthesizes work on
deductive parsing, semiring parsing, and
efficient approximate search algorithms.
This gives rise to clean analyses and com-
pact descriptions that can serve as the ba-
sis for modular implementations. We illus-
trate this with several examples, showing
how to build search spaces for several dis-
parate phrase-based search strategies, inte-
grate non-local features, and devise novel
models. Although the framework is drawn
from parsing and applied to translation, it
is applicable to many dynamic program-
ming problems arising in natural language
processing and other areas.
