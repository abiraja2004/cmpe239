This study is devoted to the problem of
question analysis for a Polish question an-
swering system. The goal of the question
analysis is to determine its general struc-
ture, type of an expected answer and cre-
ate a search query for finding relevant doc-
uments in a textual knowledge base. The
paper contains an overview of available
solutions of these problems, description of
their implementation and presents an eval-
uation based on a set of 1137 questions
from a Polish quiz TV show. The results
help to understand how an environment
of a Slavonic language affects the perfor-
mance of methods created for English.
