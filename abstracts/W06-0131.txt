 
In this paper, a language tagging tem-
plate named POC-NLW (position of a 
character within an n-length word) is pre-
sented. Based on this template, a two-
stage statistical model for Chinese word 
segmentation is constructed. In this 
method, the basic word segmentation is 
based on n-gram language model, and a 
Hidden Markov tagger based on the 
POC-NLW template is used to imple-
ment the out-of-vocabulary (OOV) word 
identification. The system participated in 
the MSRA_Close and UPUC_Close 
word segmentation tracks at SIGHAN 
Bakeoff 2006. Results returned by this 
bakeoff are reported here.
