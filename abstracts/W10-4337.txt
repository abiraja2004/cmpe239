We investigate the clarification strategies
exhibited by a hybrid POMDP dialog
manager based on data obtained from a
phone-based user study. The dialog man-
ager combines task structures with a num-
ber of POMDP policies each optimized for
obtaining an individual concept. We in-
vestigate the relationship between dialog
length and task completion. In order to
measure the effectiveness of the clarifica-
tion strategies, we compute concept pre-
cisions for two different mentions of the
concept in the dialog: first mentions and
final values after clarifications and simi-
lar strategies, and compare this to a rule-
based system on the same task. We ob-
serve an improvement in concept precision
of 12.1% for the hybrid POMDP com-
pared to 5.2% for the rule-based system.
