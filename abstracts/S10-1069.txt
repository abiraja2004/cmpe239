This paper describes the SCHWA system
entered by the University of Sydney in Se-
mEval 2010 Task 12 ? Parser Evaluation
using Textual Entailments (Yuret et al,
2010). Our system achieved an overall ac-
curacy of 70% in the task evaluation.
We used the C&C parser to build CCG de-
pendency parses of the truth and hypothe-
sis sentences. We then used partial match
heuristics to determine whether the sys-
tem should predict entailment. Heuristics
were used because the dependencies gen-
erated by the parser are construction spe-
cific, making full compatibility unlikely.
We also manually annotated the develop-
ment set with CCG analyses, establishing
an upper bound for our entailment system
of 87%.
