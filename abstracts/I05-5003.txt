The task of machine translation (MT)
evaluation is closely related to the
task of sentence-level semantic equiv-
alence classification. This paper in-
vestigates the utility of applying stan-
dard MT evaluation methods (BLEU,
NIST, WER and PER) to building clas-
sifiers to predict semantic equivalence
and entailment. We also introduce a
novel classification method based on
PER which leverages part of speech
information of the words contributing
to the word matches and non-matches
in the sentence. Our results show
that MT evaluation techniques are able
to produce useful features for para-
phrase classification and to a lesser ex-
tent entailment. Our technique gives a
substantial improvement in paraphrase
classification accuracy over all of the
other models used in the experiments.
