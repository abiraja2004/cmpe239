In this paper we present a novel approach
to entity linking based on a statistical lan-
guage model-based information retrieval with
query expansion. We use both local con-
texts and global world knowledge to expand
query language models. We place a strong
emphasis on named entities in the local con-
texts and explore a positional language model
to weigh them differently based on their dis-
tances to the query. Our experiments on
the TAC-KBP 2010 data show that incor-
porating such contextual information indeed
aids in disambiguating the named entities and
consistently improves the entity linking per-
formance. Compared with the official re-
sults from KBP 2010 participants, our system
shows competitive performance.
