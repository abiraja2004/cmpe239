In opinion mining of product reviews, one of-
ten wants to produce a summary of opinions 
based on product features/attributes. Howev-
er, for the same feature, people can express it 
with different words and phrases. To produce 
a meaningful summary, these words and 
phrases, which are domain synonyms, need to 
be grouped under the same feature group. 
This paper proposes a constrained semi-
supervised learning method to solve the prob-
lem. Experimental results using reviews from 
five different domains show that the proposed 
method is competent for the task. It outper-
forms the original EM and the state-of-the-art 
existing methods by a large margin.
