 
This paper presents an approach to trans-
lating Chinese organization names into 
English based on correlative expansion. 
Firstly, some candidate translations are 
generated by using statistical translation 
method. And several correlative named 
entities for the input are retrieved from a 
correlative named entity list. Secondly, 
three kinds of expansion methods are 
used to generate some expanded queries. 
Finally, these queries are submitted to a 
search engine, and the refined translation 
results are mined and re-ranked by using 
the returned web pages. Experimental re-
sults show that this approach outperforms 
the compared system in overall transla-
tion accuracy.
