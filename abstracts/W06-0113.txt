 
Functional chunks are defined as a series 
of non-overlapping, non-nested segments 
of text in a sentence, representing the im-
plicit grammatical relations between the 
sentence-level predicates and their argu-
ments. Its top-down scheme and com-
plexity of internal constitutions bring in a 
new challenge for automatic parser. In 
this paper, a new parsing model is pro-
posed to formulate the complete chunk-
ing problem as a series of boundary de-
tection sub tasks. Each of these sub tasks 
is only in charge of detecting one type of 
the chunk boundaries. As each sub task 
could be modeled as a binary classifica-
tion problem, a lot of machine learning 
techniques could be applied.  
In our experiments, we only focus on 
the subject-predicate (SP) and predicate-
object (PO) boundary detection sub tasks. 
By applying SVM algorithm to these sub 
tasks, we have achieved the best F-Score 
of 76.56% and 82.26% respectively.
