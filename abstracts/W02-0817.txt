Open Mind Word Expert is an imple-
mented active learning system for col-
lecting word sense tagging from the
general public over the Web. It is avail-
able at http://teach-computers.org. We
expect the system to yield a large vol-
ume of high-quality training data at a
much lower cost than the traditional
method of hiring lexicographers. We
thus propose a Senseval-3 lexical sam-
ple activity where the training data is
collected via Open Mind Word Expert.
If successful, the collection process can
be extended to create the definitive cor-
pus of word sense information.
