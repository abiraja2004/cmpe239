Consistency of corpus annotation is an
essential property for the many uses of
annotated corpora in computational and
theoretical linguistics. While some re-
search addresses the detection of inconsis-
tencies in positional annotation (e.g., part-
of-speech) and continuous structural an-
notation (e.g., syntactic constituency), no
approach has yet been developed for au-
tomatically detecting annotation errors in
discontinuous structural annotation. This
is significant since the annotation of po-
tentially discontinuous stretches of ma-
terial is increasingly relevant, from tree-
banks for free-word order languages to se-
mantic and discourse annotation.
In this paper we discuss how the variation
n-gram error detection approach (Dickin-
son and Meurers, 2003a) can be extended
to discontinuous structural annotation. We
exemplify the approach by showing how it
successfully detects errors in the syntactic
annotation of the German TIGER corpus
(Brants et al, 2002).
