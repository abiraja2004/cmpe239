In this work, we explore the use of SVMs
and CRFs in the problem of predicting cer-
tainty in sentences. We consider this as a
task of tagging uncertainty cues in context,
for which we used lexical, wordlist-based
and deep-syntactic features. Results show
that the syntactic context of the tokens in
conjunction with the wordlist-based fea-
tures turned out to be useful in predicting
uncertainty cues.
