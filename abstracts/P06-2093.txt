Statistical machine translation systems are
based on one or more translation mod-
els and a language model of the target
language. While many different trans-
lation models and phrase extraction al-
gorithms have been proposed, a standard
word n-gram back-off language model is
used in most systems.
In this work, we propose to use a new sta-
tistical language model that is based on a
continuous representation of the words in
the vocabulary. A neural network is used
to perform the projection and the proba-
bility estimation. We consider the trans-
lation of European Parliament Speeches.
This task is part of an international evalua-
tion organized by the TC-STAR project in
2006. The proposed method achieves con-
sistent improvements in the BLEU score
on the development and test data.
We also present algorithms to improve the
estimation of the language model proba-
bilities when splitting long sentences into
shorter chunks.
