 
In this paper we illustrate and evaluate an approach 
to the creation of high quality linguistically 
annotated resources based on the exploitation of 
aligned parallel corpora. This approach is based on 
the assumption that if a text in one language has 
been annotated and its translation has not, 
annotations can be transferred from the source text 
to the target using word alignment as a bridge. The 
transfer approach has been tested in the creation of 
the MultiSemCor corpus, an English/Italian 
parallel corpus created on the basis of the English 
SemCor corpus. In MultiSemCor texts are aligned 
at the word level and semantically annotated with a 
shared inventory of senses. We present some 
experiments carried out to evaluate the different 
steps involved in the methodology. The results of 
the evaluation suggest that the cross-language 
annotation transfer methodology is a promising 
solution allowing for the exploitation of existing 
(mostly English) annotated resources to bootstrap 
the creation of annotated corpora in new (resource-
poor) languages with greatly reduced human effort.
