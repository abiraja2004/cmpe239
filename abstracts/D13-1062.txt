Chinese word segmentation and part-of-
speech tagging (S&T) are fundamental
steps for more advanced Chinese language
processing tasks. Recently, it has at-
tracted more and more research interests
to exploit heterogeneous annotation cor-
pora for Chinese S&T. In this paper, we
propose a unified model for Chinese S&T
with heterogeneous annotation corpora.
We first automatically construct a loose
and uncertain mapping between two rep-
resentative heterogeneous corpora, Penn
Chinese Treebank (CTB) and PKU?s Peo-
ple?s Daily (PPD). Then we regard the
Chinese S&T with heterogeneous corpora
as two ?related? tasks and train our model
on two heterogeneous corpora simultane-
ously. Experiments show that our method
can boost the performances of both of the
heterogeneous corpora by using the shared
information, and achieves significant im-
provements over the state-of-the-art meth-
ods.
