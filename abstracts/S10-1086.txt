We participated in the SemEval-2010
Japanese Word Sense Disambiguation
(WSD) task (Task 16) and focused on
the following: (1) investigating domain
differences, (2) incorporating topic fea-
tures, and (3) predicting new unknown
senses. We experimented with Support
Vector Machines (SVM) and Maximum
Entropy (MEM) classifiers. We achieved
80.1% accuracy in our experiments.
