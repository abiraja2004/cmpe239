Humor identification is a hard natural lan-
guage understanding problem. We identify
a subproblem ? the ?that?s what she said?
problem ? with two distinguishing character-
istics: (1) use of nouns that are euphemisms
for sexually explicit nouns and (2) structure
common in the erotic domain. We address
this problem in a classification approach that
includes features that model those two char-
acteristics. Experiments on web data demon-
strate that our approach improves precision by
12% over baseline techniques that use only
word-based features.
