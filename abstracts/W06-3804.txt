 
In many information retrieval and selec-
tion tasks it is valuable to score how much 
a text is about a certain entity and to com-
pute how much the text discusses the en-
tity with respect to a certain viewpoint. In 
this paper we are interested in giving an 
aboutness score to a text, when the input 
query is a person name and we want to 
measure the aboutness with respect to the 
biographical data of that person. We pre-
sent a graph-based algorithm and compare 
its results with other approaches.
