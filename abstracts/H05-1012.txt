This paper presents a maximum entropy
word alignment algorithm for Arabic-
English based on supervised training data.
We demonstrate that it is feasible to cre-
ate training material for problems in ma-
chine translation and that a mixture of su-
pervised and unsupervised methods yields
superior performance. The probabilistic
model used in the alignment directly mod-
els the link decisions. Significant improve-
ment over traditional word alignment tech-
niques is shown as well as improvement on
several machine translation tests. Perfor-
mance of the algorithm is contrasted with
human annotation performance.
