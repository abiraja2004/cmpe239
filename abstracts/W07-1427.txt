We describe an approach to textual infer-
ence that improves alignments at both the
typed dependency level and at a deeper se-
mantic level. We present a machine learning
approach to alignment scoring, a stochas-
tic search procedure, and a new tool that
finds deeper semantic alignments, allowing
rapid development of semantic features over
the aligned graphs. Further, we describe a
complementary semantic component based
on natural logic, which shows an added gain
of 3.13% accuracy on the RTE3 test set.
