Recently, many researches in natural lan-
guage learning have considered the repre-
sentation of complex linguistic phenom-
ena by means of structural kernels. In
particular, tree kernels have been used to
represent verbal subcategorization frame
(SCF) information for predicate argument
classification. As the SCF is a relevant
clue to learn the relation between syn-
tax and semantic, the classification algo-
rithm accuracy was remarkable enhanced.
In this article, we extend such work by
studying the impact of the SCF tree kernel
on both PropBank and FrameNet seman-
tic roles. The experiments with Support
Vector Machines (SVMs) confirm a strong
link between the SCF and the semantics of
the verbal predicates as well as the bene-
fit of using kernels in diverse and complex
test conditions, e.g. classification of un-
seen verbs.
