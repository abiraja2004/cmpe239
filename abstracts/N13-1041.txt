Advances in sentiment analysis have enabled
extraction of user relations implied in online
textual exchanges such as forum posts. How-
ever, recent studies in this direction only con-
sider direct relation extraction from text. As
user interactions can be sparse in online dis-
cussions, we propose to apply collaborative
filtering through probabilistic matrix factor-
ization to generalize and improve the opinion
matrices extracted from forum posts. Exper-
iments with two tasks show that the learned
latent factor representation can give good per-
formance on a relation polarity prediction task
and improve the performance of a subgroup
detection task.
