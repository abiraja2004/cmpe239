This paper advocates a new architecture for tex-
tual inference in which finding a good alignment is
separated from evaluating entailment. Current ap-
proaches to semantic inference in question answer-
ing and textual entailment have approximated the
entailment problem as that of computing the best
alignment of the hypothesis to the text, using a lo-
cally decomposable matching score. We argue that
there are significant weaknesses in this approach,
including flawed assumptions of monotonicity and
locality. Instead we propose a pipelined approach
where alignment is followed by a classification
step, in which we extract features representing
high-level characteristics of the entailment prob-
lem, and pass the resulting feature vector to a statis-
tical classifier trained on development data. We re-
port results on data from the 2005 Pascal RTE Chal-
lenge which surpass previously reported results for
alignment-based systems.
