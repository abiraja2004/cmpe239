Hierarchical phrase-based machine trans-
lation can capture global reordering with
synchronous context-free grammar, but
has little ability to evaluate the correctness
of word orderings during decoding. We
propose a method to integrate word-based
reordering model into hierarchical phrase-
based machine translation to overcome
this weakness. Our approach extends the
synchronous context-free grammar rules
of hierarchical phrase-based model to in-
clude reordered source strings, allowing
efficient calculation of reordering model
scores during decoding. Our experimen-
tal results on Japanese-to-English basic
travel expression corpus showed that the
BLEU scores obtained by our proposed
system were better than those obtained by
a standard hierarchical phrase-based ma-
chine translation system.
