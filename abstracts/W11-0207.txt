Medical Entity Recognition is a crucial step
towards efficient medical texts analysis. In
this paper we present and compare three
methods based on domain-knowledge and
machine-learning techniques. We study two
research directions through these approaches:
(i) a first direction where noun phrases are
extracted in a first step with a chunker be-
fore the final classification step and (ii) a sec-
ond direction where machine learning tech-
niques are used to identify simultaneously en-
tities boundaries and categories. Each of the
presented approaches is tested on a standard
corpus of clinical texts. The obtained results
show that the hybrid approach based on both
machine learning and domain knowledge ob-
tains the best performance.
