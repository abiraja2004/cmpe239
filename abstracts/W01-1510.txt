This paper describes the RenTAL sys-
tem, which enables sharing resources
in LTAG and HPSG formalisms by a
method of grammar conversion from
an FB-LTAG grammar to a strongly
equivalent HPSG-style grammar. The
system is applied to the latest version
of the XTAG English grammar. Ex-
perimental results show that the ob-
tained HPSG-style grammar success-
fully worked with an HPSG parser, and
achieved a drastic speed-up against an
LTAG parser. This system enables to
share not only grammars and lexicons
but also parsing techniques.
