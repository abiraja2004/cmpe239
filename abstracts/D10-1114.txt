We introduce tiered clustering, a mixture
model capable of accounting for varying de-
grees of shared (context-independent) fea-
ture structure, and demonstrate its applicabil-
ity to inferring distributed representations of
word meaning. Common tasks in lexical se-
mantics such as word relatedness or selec-
tional preference can benefit from modeling
such structure: Polysemous word usage is of-
ten governed by some common background
metaphoric usage (e.g. the senses of line or
run), and likewise modeling the selectional
preference of verbs relies on identifying com-
monalities shared by their typical arguments.
Tiered clustering can also be viewed as a form
of soft feature selection, where features that do
not contribute meaningfully to the clustering
can be excluded. We demonstrate the applica-
bility of tiered clustering, highlighting partic-
ular cases where modeling shared structure is
beneficial and where it can be detrimental.
