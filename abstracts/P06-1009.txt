In this paper we present a novel approach
for inducing word alignments from sen-
tence aligned data. We use a Condi-
tional Random Field (CRF), a discrimina-
tive model, which is estimated on a small
supervised training set. The CRF is condi-
tioned on both the source and target texts,
and thus allows for the use of arbitrary
and overlapping features over these data.
Moreover, the CRF has efficient training
and decoding processes which both find
globally optimal solutions.
We apply this alignment model to both
French-English and Romanian-English
language pairs. We show how a large
number of highly predictive features can
be easily incorporated into the CRF, and
demonstrate that even with only a few hun-
dred word-aligned training sentences, our
model improves over the current state-of-
the-art with alignment error rates of 5.29
and 25.8 for the two tasks respectively.
