Abstract
Existing work in the extraction of com-
monsense knowledge from text has been
primarily restricted to factoids that serve
as statements about what may possibly ob-
tain in the world. We present an ap-
proach to deriving stronger, more general
claims by abstracting over large sets of
factoids. Our goal is to coalesce the ob-
served nominals for a given predicate ar-
gument into a few predominant types, ob-
tained as WordNet synsets. The results can
be construed as generically quantified sen-
tences restricting the semantic type of an
argument position of a predicate.
