The aim of the Tag2Blog system is to
bring satellite tagged wild animals ?to
life? through narratives that place their
movements in an ecological context. Our
motivation is to use such automatically
generated texts to enhance public engage-
ment with a specific species reintroduction
programme, although the protocols devel-
oped here can be applied to any animal or
other movement study that involves signal
data from tags. We are working with one
of the largest nature conservation chari-
ties in Europe in this regard, focusing on
a single species, the red kite. We de-
scribe a system that interprets a sequence
of locational fixes obtained from a satellite
tagged individual, and constructs a story
around its use of the landscape.
