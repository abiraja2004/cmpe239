Recent syntactic extensions of statisti-
cal translation models work with a syn-
chronous context-free or tree-substitution
grammar extracted from an automatically
parsed parallel corpus. The decoders ac-
companying these extensions typically ex-
ceed quadratic time complexity.
This paper extends the Direct Transla-
tion Model 2 (DTM2) with syntax while
maintaining linear-time decoding. We
employ a linear-time parsing algorithm
based on an eager, incremental interpre-
tation of Combinatory Categorial Gram-
mar (CCG). As every input word is pro-
cessed, the local parsing decisions resolve
ambiguity eagerly, by selecting a single
supertag?operator pair for extending the
dependency parse incrementally. Along-
side translation features extracted from
the derived parse tree, we explore syn-
tactic features extracted from the incre-
mental derivation process. Our empiri-
cal experiments show that our model sig-
nificantly outperforms the state-of-the art
DTM2 system.
