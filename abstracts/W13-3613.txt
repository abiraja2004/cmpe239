We describe the system developed for the
CoNLL-2013 shared task?automatic En-
glish L2 grammar error correction. The
system is based on the rule-based ap-
proach. It uses very few additional re-
sources: a morphological analyzer and a
list of 250 common uncountable nouns,
along with the training data provided by
the organizers. The system uses the syn-
tactic information available in the train-
ing data: this information is represented
as syntactic n-grams, i.e. n-grams ex-
tracted by following the paths in depen-
dency trees. The system is simple and
was developed in a short period of time
(1 month). Since it does not employ
any additional resources or any sophisti-
cated machine learning methods, it does
not achieve high scores (specifically, it has
low recall) but could be considered as a
baseline system for the task. On the other
hand, it shows what can be obtained using
a simple rule-based approach and presents
a few situations where the rule-based ap-
proach can perform better than ML ap-
proach.
