A parsing system returning analyses in the form of
sets of grammatical relations can obtain high pre-
cision if it hypothesises a particular relation only
when it is certain that the relation is correct. We
operationalise this technique?in a statistical parser
using a manually-developed wide-coverage gram-
mar of English?by only returning relations that
form part of all analyses licensed by the grammar.
We observe an increase in precision from 75% to
over 90% (at the cost of a reduction in recall) on a
test corpus of naturally-occurring text.
