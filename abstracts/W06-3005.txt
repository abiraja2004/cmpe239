Contextual question answering (QA), in
which users? information needs are satis-
fied through an interactive QA dialogue,
has recently attracted more research atten-
tion. One challenge of engaging dialogue
into QA systems is to determine whether
a question is relevant to the previous inter-
action context. We refer to this task as rel-
evancy recognition. In this paper we pro-
pose a data driven approach for the task
of relevancy recognition and evaluate it
on two data sets: the TREC data and the
HandQA data. The results show that we
achieve better performance than a previ-
ous rule-based algorithm. A detailed eval-
uation analysis is presented.
