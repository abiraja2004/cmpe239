The MultiLing 2013 Workshop of ACL
2013 posed a multi-lingual, multi-
document summarization task to the
summarization community, aiming to
quantify and measure the performance of
multi-lingual, multi-document summa-
rization systems across languages. The
task was to create a 240?250 word sum-
mary from 10 news articles, describing
a given topic. The texts of each topic
were provided in 10 languages (Arabic,
Chinese, Czech, English, French, Greek,
Hebrew, Hindi, Romanian, Spanish) and
each participant generated summaries
for at least 2 languages. The evaluation
of the summaries was performed using
automatic and manual processes. The
participating systems submitted over 15
runs, some providing summaries across
all languages. An automatic evaluation
task was also added to this year?s set
of tasks. The evaluation task meant to
determine whether automatic measures
of evaluation can function well in the
multi-lingual domain. This paper provides
a brief description related to the data of
both tasks, the evaluation methodology, as
well as an overview of participation and
corresponding results.
