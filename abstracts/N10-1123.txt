Knowledge extraction from online reposito-
ries such as PubMed holds the promise of
dramatically speeding up biomedical research
and drug design. After initially focusing on
recognizing proteins and binary interactions,
the community has recently shifted their at-
tention to the more ambitious task of recogniz-
ing complex, nested event structures. State-of-
the-art systems use a pipeline architecture in
which the candidate events are identified first,
and subsequently the arguments. This fails
to leverage joint inference among events and
arguments for mutual disambiguation. Some
joint approaches have been proposed, but they
still lag much behind in accuracy. In this pa-
per, we present the first joint approach for bio-
event extraction that obtains state-of-the-art
results. Our system is based on Markov logic
and adopts a novel formulation by jointly pre-
dicting events and arguments, as well as indi-
vidual dependency edges that compose the ar-
gument paths. On the BioNLP?09 Shared Task
dataset, it reduced F1 errors by more than 10%
compared to the previous best joint approach.
