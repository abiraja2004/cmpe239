We report on the first structured dis-
tributional semantic model for Croatian,
DM.HR. It is constructed after the model
of the English Distributional Memory (Ba-
roni and Lenci, 2010), from a dependency-
parsed Croatian web corpus, and covers
about 2M lemmas. We give details on the
linguistic processing and the design prin-
ciples. An evaluation shows state-of-the-
art performance on a semantic similarity
task with particularly good performance on
nouns. The resource is freely available.
