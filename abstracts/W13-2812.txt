 
This paper presents the methods which are 
based on the part-of-speech (POS) and auto 
alignment information to improve the quality 
of machine translation result and the word 
alignment. We utilize different types of POS 
tag to restructure source sentences and use an 
alignment-based reordering method to im-
prove the alignment. After applying the reor-
dering method, we use two phrase tables in the 
decoding part to keep the translation perfor-
mance. Our experiments on Korean-Chinese 
show that our methods can improve the align-
ment and translation results. Since the pro-
posed approach reduces the size of the phrase 
table, multi-tables are considered. The combi-
nation of all these methods together would get 
the best translation result.
