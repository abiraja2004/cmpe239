Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG)
is generally construed as a fully lexicalized
formalism, where all grammars use one and
the same universal set of rules, and cross-
linguistic variation is isolated in the lexicon.
In this paper, we show that the weak gener-
ative capacity of this ?pure? form of CCG is
strictly smaller than that of CCG with gram-
mar-specific rules, and of other mildly con-
text-sensitive grammar formalisms, includ-
ing Tree Adjoining Grammar (TAG). Our
result also carries over to a multi-modal
extension of CCG.
