This paper proposes a knowledge repre-
sentation model and a logic proving set-
ting with axioms on demand success-
fully used for recognizing textual entail-
ments. It also details a lexical inference
system which boosts the performance of
the deep semantic oriented approach on
the RTE data. The linear combination of
two slightly different logical systems with
the third lexical inference system achieves
73.75% accuracy on the RTE 2006 data.
