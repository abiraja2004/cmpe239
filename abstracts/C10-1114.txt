Thanks to its simplicity, social tagging
system has accumulated huge amount of
user contributed tags. However, user
contributed tags lack explicit hierarchi-
cal structure, while many tag-based ap-
plications would benefit if such a struc-
ture presents. In this work, we explore
the structure of tags with a directed and
easy-to-evaluate relation, named as the
subsumption relation. We propose three
methods to discover the subsumption rela-
tion between tags. Specifically, the tagged
document?s content is used to find the re-
lations, which leads to better result. Be-
sides relation discovery, we also propose
a greedy algorithm to eliminate the re-
dundant relations by constructing a Lay-
ered Directed Acyclic Graph (Layered-
DAG) of tags. We perform quantita-
tive evaluations on two real world data
sets. The results show that our methods
outperform hierarchical clustering-based
approach. Empirical study of the con-
structed Layered-DAG and error analysis
are also provided.
