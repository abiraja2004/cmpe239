We present and discuss experiments in sta-
tistical parsing of French, where terminal
forms used during training and parsing are
replaced by more general symbols, particu-
larly clusters of words obtained through un-
supervised linear clustering. We build on the
work of Candito and Crabb? (2009) who pro-
posed to use clusters built over slightly coars-
ened French inflected forms. We investigate
the alternative method of building clusters
over lemma/part-of-speech pairs, using a raw
corpus automatically tagged and lemmatized.
We find that both methods lead to compara-
ble improvement over the baseline (we ob-
tain F1=86.20% and F1=86.21% respectively,
compared to a baseline of F1=84.10%). Yet,
when we replace gold lemma/POS pairs with
their corresponding cluster, we obtain an up-
per bound (F1=87.80) that suggests room for
improvement for this technique, should tag-
ging/lemmatisation performance increase for
French.
We also analyze the improvement in perfor-
mance for both techniques with respect to
word frequency. We find that replacing word
forms with clusters improves attachment per-
formance for words that are originally either
unknown or low-frequency, since these words
are replaced by cluster symbols that tend to
have higher frequencies. Furthermore, clus-
tering also helps significantly for medium to
high frequency words, suggesting that training
on word clusters leads to better probability es-
timates for these words.
