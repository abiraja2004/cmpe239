The lack of a large annotated systemic func-
tional grammar (SFG) corpus has posed a
significant challenge for the development of
the theory. Automating SFG annotation is
challenging because the theory uses a mini-
mal constituency model, allocating as much
of the work as possible to a set of hierarchi-
cally organised features.
In this paper we show that despite the un-
orthodox organisation of SFG, adapting ex-
isting resources remains the most practical
way to create an annotated corpus. We
present and analyse SFGBank, an automated
conversion of the Penn Treebank into sys-
temic functional grammar. The corpus is
comparable to those available for other lin-
guistic theories, offering many opportunities
for new research.
