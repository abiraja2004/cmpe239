This paper introduces a two-way Urdu?
Roman transliterator based solely on a non-
probabilistic finite state transducer that solves
the encountered scriptural issues via a partic-
ular architectural design in combination with
a set of restrictions. In order to deal with the
enormous amount of overgenerations caused
by inherent properties of the Urdu script, the
transliterator depends on a set of phonologi-
cal and orthographic restrictions and a word
list; additionally, a default component is im-
plemented to allow for unknown entities to be
transliterated, thus ensuring a large degree of
flexibility in addition to robustness.
