Metaphor is an important way of convey-
ing the affect of people, hence understand-
ing how people use metaphors to convey
affect is important for the communication
between individuals and increases cohe-
sion if the perceived affect of the con-
crete example is the same for the two in-
dividuals. Therefore, building computa-
tional models that can automatically iden-
tify the affect in metaphor-rich texts like
?The team captain is a rock.?, ?Time is
money.?, ?My lawyer is a shark.? is an
important challenging problem, which has
been of great interest to the research com-
munity.
To solve this task, we have collected
and manually annotated the affect of
metaphor-rich texts for four languages.
We present novel algorithms that integrate
triggers for cognitive, affective, perceptual
and social processes with stylistic and lex-
ical information. By running evaluations
on datasets in English, Spanish, Russian
and Farsi, we show that the developed af-
fect polarity and valence prediction tech-
nology of metaphor-rich texts is portable
and works equally well for different lan-
guages.
