This work describes the Haitian-Cre?ole to En-
glish statistical machine translation system
built by Barcelona Media Innovation Center
(BM) and Institute for Infocomm Research
(I2R) for the 6th Workshop on Statistical Ma-
chine Translation (WMT 2011). Our sys-
tem carefully processes the available data and
uses it in a standard phrase-based system en-
hanced with a source context semantic feature
that helps conducting a better lexical selection
and a feature orthogonalization procedure that
helps making MERT optimization more reli-
able and stable. Our system was ranked first
(among a total of 9 participant systems) by the
conducted human evaluation.
