We consider a new subproblem of unsuper-
vised parsing from raw text, unsupervised par-
tial parsing?the unsupervised version of text
chunking. We show that addressing this task
directly, using probabilistic finite-state meth-
ods, produces better results than relying on
the local predictions of a current best unsu-
pervised parser, Seginer?s (2007) CCL. These
finite-state models are combined in a cascade
to produce more general (full-sentence) con-
stituent structures; doing so outperforms CCL
by a wide margin in unlabeled PARSEVAL
scores for English, German and Chinese. Fi-
nally, we address the use of phrasal punctua-
tion as a heuristic indicator of phrasal bound-
aries, both in our system and in CCL.
