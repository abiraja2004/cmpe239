This paper introduces GAF, a grounded an-
notation framework to represent events in a
formal context that can represent information
from both textual and extra-textual sources.
GAF makes a clear distinction between men-
tions of events in text and their formal rep-
resentation as instances in a semantic layer.
Instances are represented by RDF compliant
URIs that are shared across different research
disciplines. This allows us to complete textual
information with external sources and facili-
tates reasoning. The semantic layer can inte-
grate any linguistic information and is com-
patible with previous event representations in
NLP. Through a use case on earthquakes in
Southeast Asia, we demonstrate GAF flexibil-
ity and ability to reason over events with the
aid of extra-linguistic resources.
