 
Various knowledge sources are used for spo-
ken dialog systems such as task model, do-
main model, and agenda. An agenda graph is 
one of the knowledge sources for a dialog 
management to reflect a discourse structure. 
This paper proposes a clustering and linking 
method to automatically construct an agenda 
graph from human-human dialogs. Prelimi-
nary evaluation shows our approach would be 
helpful to reduce human efforts in designing 
prior knowledge.
