Automatically-derived grammars, such as the
split-and-merge model, have proven helpful
in parsing (Petrov et al, 2006). As such
grammars are refined, latent information is
recovered which may be usable for linguis-
tic tasks besides parsing. In this paper, we
present and examine a new method of seman-
tic relation classification: using automatically-
derived grammar rule clusters as a robust
knowledge source for semantic relation clas-
sification. We examine performance of this
feature group on the SemEval 2010 Relation
Classification corpus, and find that it improves
performance over both more coarse-grained
and more fine-grained syntactic and colloca-
tional features in semantic relation classifica-
tion.
