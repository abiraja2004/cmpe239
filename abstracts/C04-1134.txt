 
We present a novel automatic approach to 
constructing a bilingual semantic network?the 
BiFrameNet, to enhance statistical and 
transfer-based machine translation systems. 
BiFrameNet is a frame semantic representation, 
and contains semantic structure transfers 
between English and Chinese. The English 
FrameNet and the Chinese HowNet provide us 
with two different views of the semantic 
distribution of lexicon by linguists. We propose 
to induce the mapping between the English 
lexical entries in FrameNet to Chinese word 
senses in HowNet, furnishing a bilingual 
semantic lexicon which simulates the ?concept 
lexicon? supposedly used by human translators, 
and which can thus be beneficial to machine 
translation systems.  BiFrameNet alo contains 
bilingual example sentences that have the same 
semantic roles. We automatically induce 
Chinese example sentences and their semantic 
roles, based on semantic structure alignment 
from the first stage of our work, as well as 
shallow syntactic structure. In addition to its 
utility for machine-aided and machine 
translations, our work is also related to the 
spatial models proposed by cognitive scientists 
in the framework of artifactual simulations of 
the translation process.
