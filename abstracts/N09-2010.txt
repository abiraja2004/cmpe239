In this paper we present a novel approach to
categorizing comments in online reviews as
either a qualified claim or a bald claim. We ar-
gue that this distinction is important based on
a study of customer behavior in making pur-
chasing decisions using online reviews. We
present results of a supervised algorithm for
learning this distinction. The two types of
claims are expressed differently in language
and we show that syntactic features capture
this difference, yielding improvement over a
bag-of-words baseline.
