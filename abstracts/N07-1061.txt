We compare two pivot strategies for
phrase-based statistical machine transla-
tion (SMT), namely phrase translation
and sentence translation. The phrase
translation strategy means that we di-
rectly construct a phrase translation ta-
ble (phrase-table) of the source and tar-
get language pair from two phrase-tables;
one constructed from the source language
and English and one constructed from En-
glish and the target language. We then use
that phrase-table in a phrase-based SMT
system. The sentence translation strat-
egy means that we first translate a source
language sentence into n English sen-
tences and then translate these n sentences
into target language sentences separately.
Then, we select the highest scoring sen-
tence from these target sentences. We con-
ducted controlled experiments using the
Europarl corpus to evaluate the perfor-
mance of these pivot strategies as com-
pared to directly trained SMT systems.
The phrase translation strategy signifi-
cantly outperformed the sentence transla-
tion strategy. Its relative performance was
0.92 to 0.97 compared to directly trained
SMT systems.
