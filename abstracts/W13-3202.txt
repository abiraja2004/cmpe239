In this paper, we address the problem of
how to use semantics to improve syntac-
tic parsing, by using a hybrid reranking
method: a k-best list generated by a sym-
bolic parser is reranked based on parse-
correctness scores given by a composi-
tional, connectionist classifier. This classi-
fier uses a recursive neural network to con-
struct vector representations for phrases in
a candidate parse tree in order to classify
it as syntactically correct or not. Tested on
the WSJ23, our method achieved a statisti-
cally significant improvement of 0.20% on
F-score (2% error reduction) and 0.95% on
exact match, compared with the state-of-
the-art Berkeley parser. This result shows
that vector-based compositional semantics
can be usefully applied in syntactic pars-
ing, and demonstrates the benefits of com-
bining the symbolic and connectionist ap-
proaches.
