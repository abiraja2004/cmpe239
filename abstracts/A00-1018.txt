 
Over the past decade or so, a lot of work 
in computational linguistics has been 
directed at finding ways to exploit the 
ever increasing volume of electronic 
bilingual corpora. These efforts have 
allowed for substantial expansion of the 
computational toolbox. We describe a 
system, TransCheck, which makes 
intensive use of these new tools in order 
to detect potential translation errors in 
preliminary or non-revised translations.
