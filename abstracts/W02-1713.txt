In this paper we present XtraGen, a XML- and Java-
based software system for the flexible, real-time
generation of natural language that is easily inte-
grated and used in real-world applications. We de-
scribe its grammar formalism and implementation
in detail, depict the context of how the system was
evaluated and finally provide an outlook on future
work with the system.
