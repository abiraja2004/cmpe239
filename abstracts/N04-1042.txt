With the increasing use of research paper
search engines, such as CiteSeer, for both lit-
erature search and hiring decisions, the accu-
racy of such systems is of paramount impor-
tance. This paper employs Conditional Ran-
dom Fields (CRFs) for the task of extracting
various common fields from the headers and
citation of research papers. The basic the-
ory of CRFs is becoming well-understood, but
best-practices for applying them to real-world
data requires additional exploration. This paper
makes an empirical exploration of several fac-
tors, including variations on Gaussian, expo-
nential and hyperbolic-L1 priors for improved
regularization, and several classes of features
and Markov order. On a standard benchmark
data set, we achieve new state-of-the-art perfor-
mance, reducing error in average F1 by 36%,
and word error rate by 78% in comparison with
the previous best SVM results. Accuracy com-
pares even more favorably against HMMs.
