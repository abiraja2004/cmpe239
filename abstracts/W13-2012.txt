This paper describes NaCTeM entries for
the Cancer Genetics (CG) and Pathway
Curation (PC) tasks in the BioNLP Shared
Task 2013. We have applied a state-of-
the-art event extraction system EventMine
to the tasks in two different settings: a
single-corpus setting for the CG task and
a stacking setting for the PC task. Event-
Mine was applicable to the two tasks with
simple task specific configuration, and it
produced a reasonably high performance,
positioning second in the CG task and first
in the PC task.
