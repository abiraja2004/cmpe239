This paper presents a new bottom-up chart
parsing algorithm for Prolog along with
a compilation procedure that reduces the
amount of copying at run-time to a con-
stant number (2) per edge. It has ap-
plications to unification-based grammars
with very large partially ordered cate-
gories, in which copying is expensive,
and can facilitate the use of more so-
phisticated indexing strategies for retriev-
ing such categories that may otherwise be
overwhelmed by the cost of such copy-
ing. It also provides a new perspective
on ?quick-checking? and related heuris-
tics, which seems to confirm that forcing
an early failure (as opposed to seeking
an early guarantee of success) is in fact
the best approach to use. A preliminary
empirical evaluation of its performance is
also provided.
