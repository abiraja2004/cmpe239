Machine Translation (MT) is a science fic-
tion that was converted into reality with
the enormous contributions from the MT
research community. We cannot expect
any text without Named Entities (NE).
Such NEs are crucial in deciding the qua-
lity of MT. NEs are to be recognized from
the text and transliterated accordingly into
the target language in order to ensure the
quality of MT. In the present paper we
present various technical issues encounte-
red during handling the shared task of NE
transliteration for Tamil.
