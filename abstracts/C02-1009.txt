Most current sentence alignment approaches adopt
sentence length and cognate as the alignment features;
and they are mostly trained and tested in the docu-
ments with the same style. Since the length distribu-
tion, alignment-type distribution (used by length-based
approaches) and cognate frequency vary significantly
across texts with different styles, the length-based ap-
proaches fail to achieve similar performance when tested
in corpora of different styles. The experiments show that
the performance in F -measure could drop from 98.2%
to 85.6% when a length-based approach is trained by a
technical manual and then tested on a general magazine.
Since a large percentage of content words in the source
text would be translated into the corresponding trans-
lation duals to preserve the meaning in the target text,
transfer lexicons are usually regarded as more reliable
cues for aligning sentences when the alignment task is
performed by human. To enhance the robustness, a
robust statistical model based on both transfer lexicons
and sentence lengths are proposed in this paper. Af-
ter integrating the transfer lexicons into the model, a
60% F -measure error reduction (from 14.4% to 5.8%) is
observed.
