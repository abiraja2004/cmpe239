This paper attempts to analyze and bound the utility
of various structured and unstructured resources in
Question Answering, independent of a specific sys-
tem or component. We quantify the degree to which
gazetteers, web resources, encyclopedia, web doc-
uments and web-based query expansion can help
Question Answering in general and specific ques-
tion types in particular. Depending on which re-
sources are used, the QA task may shift from com-
plex answer-finding mechanisms to simpler data ex-
traction methods followed by answer re-mapping in
local documents.
