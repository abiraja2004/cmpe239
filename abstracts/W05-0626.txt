 
This paper describes a system for semantic 
role labeling for the CoNLL2005 Shared 
task.  We divide the task into two sub-tasks: 
boundary recognition by a general tree-
based predicate-argument recognition algo-
rithm to convert a parse tree into a flat rep-
resentation of all predicates and their 
related boundaries, and role labeling by a 
consensus model using a pattern-matching 
framework to find suitable roles for core 
constituents and adjuncts.  We describe the 
system architecture and report results for 
the CoNLL2005 development dataset.
