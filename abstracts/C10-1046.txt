We describe a new unsupervised approach
for synonymy discovery by aligning para-
phrases in monolingual domain corpora.
For that purpose, we identify phrasal
terms that convey most of the concepts
within domains and adapt a methodol-
ogy for the automatic extraction and align-
ment of paraphrases to identify para-
phrase casts from which valid synonyms
are discovered. Results performed on two
different domain corpora show that gen-
eral synonyms as well as synonymic ex-
pressions can be identified with a 67.27%
precision.
