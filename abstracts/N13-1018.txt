We propose a novel framework for topic la-
beling that assigns the most representative
phrases for a given set of sentences cover-
ing the same topic. We build an entailment
graph over phrases that are extracted from the
sentences, and use the entailment relations to
identify and select the most relevant phrases.
We then aggregate those selected phrases by
means of phrase generalization and merging.
We motivate our approach by applying over
conversational data, and show that our frame-
work improves performance significantly over
baseline algorithms.
