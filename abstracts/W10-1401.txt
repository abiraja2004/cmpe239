The term Morphologically Rich Languages
(MRLs) refers to languages in which signif-
icant information concerning syntactic units
and relations is expressed at word-level. There
is ample evidence that the application of read-
ily available statistical parsing models to such
languages is susceptible to serious perfor-
mance degradation. The first workshop on sta-
tistical parsing of MRLs hosts a variety of con-
tributions which show that despite language-
specific idiosyncrasies, the problems associ-
ated with parsing MRLs cut across languages
and parsing frameworks. In this paper we re-
view the current state-of-affairs with respect
to parsing MRLs and point out central chal-
lenges. We synthesize the contributions of re-
searchers working on parsing Arabic, Basque,
French, German, Hebrew, Hindi and Korean
to point out shared solutions across languages.
The overarching analysis suggests itself as a
source of directions for future investigations.
