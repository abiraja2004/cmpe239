 
This paper proposes a parser based ful ly upon the 
conneet:i.oni.st modeL(ca\]led "CM parser" hereafter). In 
order to realize L~ile CM purser, we use Sigma-Pi- 
Units to implement ~ constraint of grammatical 
category order or word order, and a copy mechanism of 
suh~parse trees. Further more, we suppose there exist 
weak suppressive connection lisks between every pair 
of CM units. By these suppressive links, our CM 
parser explains why garden path sentences and/or 
deeply nested sentences are hard to recognize. Our CM 
parser also explains the preference principles for 
syntact:\[cally ambJ guotls sentences.
