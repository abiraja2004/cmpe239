The automatic compilation of bilingual dic-
tionaries from comparable corpora has been
successful for single-word terms (SWTs),
but remains disappointing for multi-word
terms (MWTs). One of the main problems is
the insufficient coverage of the bilingual dic-
tionary. Using the compositional translation
method improved the results, but still shows
some limits for MWTs of different syntac-
tic structures. In this paper, we propose to
bridge the gap between syntactic structures
through morphological links. The results
show a significant improvement in the com-
positional translation of MWTs that demon-
strate the efficiency of the morphologically
based-method for lexical alignment.
