Abstract :  
Feature graphs appearing in unification--based grammar formalisms and 
algebraic specif icat ions of abstract data types (ADTs) are both used 
for def in ing a col lect ion of objects together with functions between 
these object sets. Start ing from this observat ion we define an 
algebraic semantics for feature graphs by assigning an algebraic 
speci f icat ion to each feature graph. This opens the rich world of 
semantical foundations for abstract data types to the area of 
feature graphs and thus to uni f icat ion grammar formalisms. Using 
results from ADT theory we define a sim~le and fast syntactic 
decis ion procedure test ing the usual consistency condit ions on 
feature graphs like constant consistency, constant/complex 
consistency and acycl ic i ty on the algebraic speci f icat ion assigned 
to a feature graph. With this machinery at hand feature graph 
uni f icat ion becomes union of feature graph specif icat ions fol lowed 
by the consistency test.
