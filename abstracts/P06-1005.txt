We present an approach to pronoun reso-
lution based on syntactic paths. Through a
simple bootstrapping procedure, we learn
the likelihood of coreference between a
pronoun and a candidate noun based on the
path in the parse tree between the two en-
tities. This path information enables us to
handle previously challenging resolution
instances, and also robustly addresses tra-
ditional syntactic coreference constraints.
Highly coreferent paths also allow mining
of precise probabilistic gender/number in-
formation. We combine statistical knowl-
edge with well known features in a Sup-
port Vector Machine pronoun resolution
classifier. Significant gains in performance
are observed on several datasets.
