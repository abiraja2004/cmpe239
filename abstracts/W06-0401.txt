 
One of the central assumptions of Opti-
mality Theory is the hypothesis of strict 
domination among constraints. A few 
studies have suggested that this hypothe-
sis is too strong and should be abandoned 
in favor of a weaker cumulativity hy-
pothesis. If this suggestion is correct, we 
should be able to find evidence for cumu-
lativity in the comprehension of Gapping 
sentences, which lack explicit syntactic 
clues in the form of the presence of a fi-
nite verb. On the basis of a comparison 
between several computational models of 
constraint evaluation, we conclude that 
the comprehension of Gapping sentences 
does not yield compelling evidence 
against the strict domination hypothesis.
