We present a new language pair agnostic ap-
proach to inducing bilingual vector spaces
from non-parallel data without any other re-
source in a bootstrapping fashion. The pa-
per systematically introduces and describes all
key elements of the bootstrapping procedure:
(1) starting point or seed lexicon, (2) the confi-
dence estimation and selection of new dimen-
sions of the space, and (3) convergence. We
test the quality of the induced bilingual vec-
tor spaces, and analyze the influence of the
different components of the bootstrapping ap-
proach in the task of bilingual lexicon extrac-
tion (BLE) for two language pairs. Results re-
veal that, contrary to conclusions from prior
work, the seeding of the bootstrapping pro-
cess has a heavy impact on the quality of the
learned lexicons. We also show that our ap-
proach outperforms the best performing fully
corpus-based BLE methods on these test sets.
