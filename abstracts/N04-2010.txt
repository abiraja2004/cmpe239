When estimating a mixture of Gaussians there
are usually two choices for the covariance type
of each Gaussian component. Either diag-
onal or full covariance. Imposing a struc-
ture though may be restrictive and lead to de-
graded performance and/or increased compu-
tations. In this work, several criteria to esti-
mate the structure of regression matrices of a
mixture of Gaussians are introduced and eval-
uated. Most of the criteria attempt to estimate
a discriminative structure, which is suited for
classification tasks. Results are reported on
the 1996 NIST speaker recognition task and
performance is compared with structural EM,
a well-known, non-discriminative, structure-
finding algorithm.
