We introduce a novel discriminative model for
phrase-based monolingual alignment using a
semi-Markov CRF. Our model achieves state-
of-the-art alignment accuracy on two phrase-
based alignment datasets (RTE and para-
phrase), while doing significantly better than
other strong baselines in both non-identical
alignment and phrase-only alignment. Addi-
tional experiments highlight the potential ben-
efit of our alignment model to RTE, para-
phrase identification and question answering,
where even a naive application of our model?s
alignment score approaches the state of the art.
