The Arabic language is a collection of
spoken dialects with important phonolog-
ical, morphological, lexical, and syntac-
tic differences, along with a standard writ-
ten language, Modern Standard Arabic
(MSA). Since the spoken dialects are not
officially written, it is very costly to obtain
adequate corpora to use for training dialect
NLP tools such as parsers. In this paper,
we address the problem of parsing tran-
scribed spoken Levantine Arabic (LA).We
do not assume the existence of any anno-
tated LA corpus (except for development
and testing), nor of a parallel corpus LA-
MSA. Instead, we use explicit knowledge
about the relation between LA and MSA.
