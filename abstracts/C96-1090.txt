 
As interaction between autonomous 
agents, communication can be analyzed 
in game-theoretic terms. Meaning game 
is proposed to formalize the core of 
intended communication in which the 
sender sends a message and the re- 
ceiver attempts to infer its meaning in- 
tended by the sender. Basic issues in- 
volved in the game of natural language 
communication are discussed, such as 
salience, grammaticality, common sense, 
and common belief, together with some 
demonstration of the feasibility of game~ 
theoretic account of language.
