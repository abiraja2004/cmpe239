The ability to measure the quality of word
order in translations is an important goal
for research in machine translation. Cur-
rent machine translation metrics do not
adequately measure the reordering perfor-
mance of translation systems. We present
a novel metric, the LRscore, which di-
rectly measures reordering success. The
reordering component is balanced by a
lexical metric. Capturing the two most im-
portant elements of translation success in
a simple combined metric with only one
parameter results in an intuitive, shallow,
language independent metric.
