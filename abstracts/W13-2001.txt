 The BioNLP Shared Task 2013 is the third edition of the BioNLP Shared Task series that is a community-wide effort to address fine-grained, structural information extraction from biomedical literature. The BioNLP Shared Task 2013 was held from January to April 2013. Six main tasks were proposed. 38 final submissions were received, from 22 teams. The results show advances in the state of the art and demonstrate that extraction methods can be successfully generalized in various aspects. 1
