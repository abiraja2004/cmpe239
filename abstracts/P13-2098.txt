Optical Character Recognition (OCR) sys-
tems for Arabic rely on information con-
tained in the scanned images to recognize
sequences of characters and on language
models to emphasize fluency. In this paper
we incorporate linguistically and seman-
tically motivated features to an existing
OCR system. To do so we follow an n-best
list reranking approach that exploits recent
advances in learning to rank techniques.
We achieve 10.1% and 11.4% reduction in
recognition word error rate (WER) relative
to a standard baseline system on typewrit-
ten and handwritten Arabic respectively.
