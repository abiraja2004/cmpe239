We propose a simple solution to the se-
quence labeling problem based on an ex-
tension of weighted decomposition ker-
nels. We additionally introduce a multi-
instance kernel approach for representing
lexical word sense information. These
new ideas have been preliminarily tested
on named entity recognition and PP at-
tachment disambiguation. We finally sug-
gest how these techniques could be poten-
tially merged using a declarative formal-
ism that may provide a basis for the inte-
gration of multiple sources of information
when using kernel-based learning in NLP.
