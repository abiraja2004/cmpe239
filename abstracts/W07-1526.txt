Whilst the degree to which a treebank sub-
scribes to a specific linguistic theory limits
the usefulness of the resource, the availabil-
ity of more formats for the same resource
plays a crucial role both in NLP and linguis-
tics. Conversion tools and multi-format tree-
banks are useful for investigating portability
of NLP systems and validity of annotation.
Unfortunately, conversion is a quite complex
task since it involves grammatical rules and
linguistic knowledge to be incorporated into
the converter program.
The paper focusses on a methodology for
treebank conversion which consists in split-
ting the process in steps corresponding to
the kinds of information that have to be con-
verted, i.e. morphological, structural or re-
lational syntactic. The advantage is the gen-
eration of a set of parallel treebanks fea-
turing progressively differentiated formats.
An application to the case of an Italian
dependency-based treebank in a Penn like
format is described.
