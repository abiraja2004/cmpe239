 
Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) as a 
Shallow Semantic Parsing causes more 
and more attention recently. The shortage 
of manually tagged data is one of main 
obstacles to supervised learning, which is 
even serious in SRL. Transductive SVM 
(TSVM) is a novel semi-supervised learn-
ing method special to small mount of 
tagged data. In this paper, we introduce an 
application of TSVM in Chinese SRL. To 
improve the performance of TSVM, some 
heuristics have been designed from the 
semantic perspective. The experiment re-
sults on Chinese Propbank showed that 
TSVM outperforms SVM in small tagged 
data, and after using heuristics, it performs 
further better.
