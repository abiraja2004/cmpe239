The use of similarities has been one of the
main approaches to resolve the ambigui-
ties of coordinate structures. In this pa-
per, we present an alternative method for
coordination disambiguation, which does
not use similarities. Our hypothesis is
that coordinate structures are supported
by surrounding dependency relations, and
that such dependency relations rather yield
similarity between conjuncts, which hu-
mans feel. Based on this hypothesis, we
built a Japanese fully-lexicalized genera-
tive parser that includes coordination dis-
ambiguation. Experimental results on web
sentences indicated the effectiveness of our
approach, and endorsed our hypothesis.
