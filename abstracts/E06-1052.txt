Unsupervised paraphrase acquisition has
been an active research field in recent
years, but its effective coverage and per-
formance have rarely been evaluated. We
propose a generic paraphrase-based ap-
proach for Relation Extraction (RE), aim-
ing at a dual goal: obtaining an applicative
evaluation scheme for paraphrase acquisi-
tion and obtaining a generic and largely
unsupervised configuration for RE.We an-
alyze the potential of our approach and
evaluate an implemented prototype of it
using an RE dataset. Our findings reveal a
high potential for unsupervised paraphrase
acquisition. We also identify the need for
novel robust models for matching para-
phrases in texts, which should address syn-
tactic complexity and variability.
