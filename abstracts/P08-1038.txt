The standard set of rules defined in Combina-
tory Categorial Grammar (CCG) fails to pro-
vide satisfactory analyses for a number of syn-
tactic structures found in natural languages.
These structures can be analyzed elegantly by
augmenting CCG with a class of rules based
on the combinator D (Curry and Feys, 1958).
We show two ways to derive the D rules:
one based on unary composition and the other
based on a logical characterization of CCG?s
rule base (Baldridge, 2002). We also show
how Eisner?s (1996) normal form constraints
follow from this logic, ensuring that the D
rules do not lead to spurious ambiguities.
