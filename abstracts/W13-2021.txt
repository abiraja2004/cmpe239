In the perspective of annotating a text with
respect to an ontology, we have partici-
pated in the subtask 1 of the BB BioNLP-
ST whose aim is to detect, in the text,
Bacteria Habitats and associate to them
one or several categories from the Onto-
Biotope ontology provided for the task.
We have used a rule-based machine learn-
ing algorithm (WHISK) combined with a
rule-based automatic ontology projection
method and a rote learning technique. The
combination of these three sources of rules
leads to good results with a SER measure
close to the winner and a best F-measure.
