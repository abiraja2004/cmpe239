Entity sense disambiguation becomes dif-
ficult with few or even zero training in-
stances available, which is known as im-
balanced learning problem in machine
learning. To overcome the problem, we
create a new set of reliable training in-
stances from dictionary, called dictionary-
based prototypes. A hierarchical classifi-
cation system with a tree-like structure is
designed to learn from both the prototypes
and training instances, and three different
types of classifiers are employed. In addi-
tion, supervised dimensionality reduction
is conducted in a similarity-based space.
Experimental results show our system out-
performs three baseline systems by at least
8.3% as measured by macro F1 score.
