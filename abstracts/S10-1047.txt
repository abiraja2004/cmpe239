We present an approach for semantic re-
lation extraction between nominals that
combines semantic information with shal-
low syntactic processing. We propose to
use the ResearchCyc knowledge base as
a source of semantic information about
nominals. Each source of information
is represented by a specific kernel func-
tion. The experiments were carried out
using support vector machines as a clas-
sifier. The system achieves an overall F
1
of 77.62% on the ?Multi-Way Classifica-
tion of Semantic Relations Between Pairs
of Nominals? task at SemEval-2010.
