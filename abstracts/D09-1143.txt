This paper explores the use of innovative
kernels based on syntactic and semantic
structures for a target relation extraction
task. Syntax is derived from constituent
and dependency parse trees whereas se-
mantics concerns to entity types and lex-
ical sequences. We investigate the effec-
tiveness of such representations in the au-
tomated relation extraction from texts. We
process the above data by means of Sup-
port Vector Machines along with the syn-
tactic tree, the partial tree and the word
sequence kernels. Our study on the ACE
2004 corpus illustrates that the combina-
tion of the above kernels achieves high ef-
fectiveness and significantly improves the
current state-of-the-art.
