We provide an overview of the metonymy
resolution shared task organised within
SemEval-2007. We describe the problem,
the data provided to participants, and the
evaluation measures we used to assess per-
formance. We also give an overview of the
systems that have taken part in the task, and
discuss possible directions for future work.
