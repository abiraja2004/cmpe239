 
 Proficiency testing is an important ingredient 
in successful language teaching. However, re-
peated testing for course placement, over the 
course of instruction or for certification can be 
time-consuming and costly. We present the 
design and validation of the Versant Arabic 
Test, a fully automated test of spoken Modern 
Standard Arabic, that evaluates test-takers' fa-
cility in listening and speaking. Experimental 
data shows the test to be highly reliable (test-
retest r=0.97) and to strongly predict perform-
ance on the ILR OPI (r=0.87), a standard in-
terview test that assesses oral proficiency.
