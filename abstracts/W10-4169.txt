 
Sense induction seeks to automatically identify word senses of polysemous words 
encountered in a corpus. Unsupervised word sense induction can be viewed as a clustering 
problem. In this paper, we used the Hierarchical Clustering Algorithm as the classifier for 
word sense induction. Experiments show the system can achieve 72% F-score about 
train-corpus and 65% F-score about test-corpus.
