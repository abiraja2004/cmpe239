Text mining for biomedicine requires a sig-
nificant amount of domain knowledge. Much
of this information is contained in biomedical
ontologies. Developers of text mining appli-
cations often look for appropriate ontologies
that can be integrated into their systems, rather
than develop new ontologies from scratch.
However, there is often a lack of documen-
tation of the qualities of the ontologies. A
number of methodologies for evaluating on-
tologies have been developed, but it is diffi-
cult for users by using these methods to se-
lect an ontology. In this paper, we propose
a framework for selecting the most appropri-
ate ontology for a particular text mining appli-
cation. The framework comprises three com-
ponents, each of which considers different as-
pects of requirements of text mining applica-
tions on ontologies. We also present an ex-
periment based on the framework choosing an
ontology for a gene normalization system.
