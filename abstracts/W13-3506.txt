This paper proposes a boosting algorithm
that uses a semi-Markov perceptron. The
training algorithm repeats the training of a
semi-Markov model and the update of the
weights of training samples. In the boost-
ing, training samples that are incorrectly
segmented or labeled have large weights.
Such training samples are aggressively
learned in the training of the semi-Markov
perceptron because the weights are used
as the learning ratios. We evaluate our
training method with Noun Phrase Chunk-
ing, Text Chunking and Extended Named
Entity Recognition. The experimental re-
sults show that our method achieves better
accuracy than a semi-Markov perceptron
and a semi-Markov Conditional Random
Fields.
