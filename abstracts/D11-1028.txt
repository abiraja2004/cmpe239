This paper introduces a psycholinguistic
model of sentence processing which combines
a Hidden Markov Model noun phrase chun-
ker with a co-reference classifier. Both mod-
els are fully incremental and generative, giv-
ing probabilities of lexical elements condi-
tional upon linguistic structure. This allows
us to compute the information theoretic mea-
sure of surprisal, which is known to correlate
with human processing effort. We evaluate
our surprisal predictions on the Dundee corpus
of eye-movement data show that our model
achieve a better fit with human reading times
than a syntax-only model which does not have
access to co-reference information.
