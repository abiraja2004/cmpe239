This paper reports the results of experiments
using memory-based learning to guide a de-
terministic dependency parser for unrestricted
natural language text. Using data from a small
treebank of Swedish, memory-based classifiers
for predicting the next action of the parser are
constructed. The accuracy of a classifier as
such is evaluated on held-out data derived from
the treebank, and its performance as a parser
guide is evaluated by parsing the held-out por-
tion of the treebank. The evaluation shows that
memory-based learning gives a signficant im-
provement over a previous probabilistic model
based on maximum conditional likelihood esti-
mation and that the inclusion of lexical features
improves the accuracy even further.
