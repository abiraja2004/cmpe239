Toponym resolvers identify the specific lo-
cations referred to by ambiguous place-
names in text. Most resolvers are based on
heuristics using spatial relationships be-
tween multiple toponyms in a document,
or metadata such as population. This pa-
per shows that text-driven disambiguation
for toponyms is far more effective. We ex-
ploit document-level geotags to indirectly
generate training instances for text classi-
fiers for toponym resolution, and show that
textual cues can be straightforwardly in-
tegrated with other commonly used ones.
Results are given for both 19th century
texts pertaining to the American Civil War
and 20th century newswire articles.
