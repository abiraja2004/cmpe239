 
In this paper, we demonstrate how to 
mine large-scale parallel corpora with 
multilingual patents, which have not 
been thoroughly explored before. We 
show how a large-scale English-Chinese 
parallel corpus containing over 14 
million sentence pairs with only 1-5% 
wrong can be mined from a large amount 
of English-Chinese bilingual patents. To 
our knowledge, this is the largest single 
parallel corpus in terms of sentence pairs. 
Moreover, we estimate the potential for 
mining multilingual parallel corpora 
involving English, Chinese, Japanese, 
Korean, German, etc., which would to 
some extent reduce the parallel data 
acquisition bottleneck in multilingual 
information processing.
