This paper presents our work for participation
in the 2010 CIPS-ParsEval shared task on Chi-
nese syntactic constituent tree parsing. We
use dependency parsers for this constituent
parsing task based on a formal dependency-
constituent transformation method which con-
verts dependency to constituent structures us-
ing a machine learning approach. A condi-
tional random fields (CRF) tagger is adopted
for head information recognition. Our ex-
periments shows that acceptable parsing and
head tagging results are obtained on our ap-
proaches.
