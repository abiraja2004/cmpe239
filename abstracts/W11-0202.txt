Entailment detection systems are generally
designed to work either on single words, re-
lations or full sentences. We propose a new
task ? detecting entailment between depen-
dency graph fragments of any type ? which
relaxes these restrictions and leads to much
wider entailment discovery. An unsupervised
framework is described that uses intrinsic sim-
ilarity, multi-level extrinsic similarity and the
detection of negation and hedged language to
assign a confidence score to entailment rela-
tions between two fragments. The final system
achieves 84.1% average precision on a data set
of entailment examples from the biomedical
domain.
