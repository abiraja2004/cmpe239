. Although effective for antecedent determination, the tradi-
tional twin-candidate model can not prevent the invalid resolution of
non-anaphors without additional measures. In this paper we propose a
modified learning framework for the twin-candidate model. In the new
framework, we make use of non-anaphors to create a special class of
training instances, which leads to a classifier capable of identifying the
cases of non-anaphors during resolution. In this way, the twin-candidate
model itself could avoid the resolution of non-anaphors, and thus could
be directly deployed to coreference resolution. The evaluation done on
newswire domain shows that the twin-candidate based system with our
modified framework achieves better and more reliable performance than
those with other solutions.
