We present a simple and effective method
for extracting parallel sentences from
comparable corpora. We employ a sta-
tistical machine translation (SMT) system
built from small amounts of parallel texts
to translate the source side of the non-
parallel corpus. The target side texts are
used, along with other corpora, in the lan-
guage model of this SMT system. We
then use information retrieval techniques
and simple filters to create French/English
parallel data from a comparable news cor-
pora. We evaluate the quality of the ex-
tracted data by showing that it signifi-
cantly improves the performance of an
SMT systems.
