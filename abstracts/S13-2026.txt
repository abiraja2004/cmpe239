This paper describes the system submitted
by the MELODI team for the SemEval-2013
Task 4: Free Paraphrases of Noun Compounds
(Hendrickx et al, 2013). Our approach com-
bines the strength of an unsupervised distri-
butional word space model with a supervised
maximum-entropy classification model; the
distributional model yields a feature represen-
tation for a particular compound noun, which
is subsequently used by the classifier to induce
a number of appropriate paraphrases.
