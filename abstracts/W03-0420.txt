In this paper, we describe a system that applies
maximum entropy (ME) models to the task of
named entity recognition (NER). Starting with
an annotated corpus and a set of features which
are easily obtainable for almost any language,
we first build a baseline NE recognizer which
is then used to extract the named entities and
their context information from additional non-
annotated data. In turn, these lists are incor-
porated into the final recognizer to further im-
prove the recognition accuracy.
