 
Context sensitive rewrite rules have been 
widely used in several areas of natural 
language processing, including syntax, 
morphology, phonology and speech pro- 
cessing. Kaplan and Kay, Karttunen, 
and Mohri & Sproat have given vari- 
ous algorithms to compile such rewrite 
rules into finite-state transducers. The 
present paper extends this work by al- 
lowing a limited form of backreferencing 
in such rules. The explicit use of backref- 
erencing leads to more elegant and gen- 
eral solutions.
