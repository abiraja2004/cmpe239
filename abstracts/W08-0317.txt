We describe the LIU systems for German-
English and English-German translation sub-
mitted to the Shared Task of the Third Work-
shop of Statistical Machine Translation. The
main features of the systems, as compared
with the baseline, is the use of morphologi-
cal pre- and post-processing, and a sequence
model for German using morphologically rich
parts-of-speech. It is shown that these addi-
tions lead to improved translations.
