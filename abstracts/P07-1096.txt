In this paper, we propose guided learning,
a new learning framework for bidirectional
sequence classification. The tasks of learn-
ing the order of inference and training the
local classifier are dynamically incorporated
into a single Perceptron like learning algo-
rithm. We apply this novel learning algo-
rithm to POS tagging. It obtains an error rate
of 2.67% on the standard PTB test set, which
represents 3.3% relative error reduction over
the previous best result on the same data set,
while using fewer features.
