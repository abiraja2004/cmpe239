This paper provides a parsing algorithm
for the Lambek calculus which is polyno-
mial time for a more general fragment of
the Lambek calculus than any previously
known algorithm. The algorithm runs in
worst-case time O(n5) when restricted to
a certain fragment of the Lambek calcu-
lus which is motivated by empirical anal-
ysis. In addition, a set of parameterized
inputs are given, showing why the algo-
rithm has exponential worst-case running
time for the Lambek calculus in general.
