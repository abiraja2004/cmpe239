 
Word subject domains have been 
widely used to improve the perform-
ance of word sense disambiguation al-
gorithms. However, comparatively little 
effort has been devoted so far to the 
disambiguation of word subject do-
mains. The few existing approaches 
have focused on the development of al-
gorithms specific to word domain dis-
ambiguation. In this paper we explore 
an alternative approach where word 
domain disambiguation is achieved via 
word sense disambiguation. Our study 
shows that this approach yields very 
strong results, suggesting that word 
domain disambiguation can be ad-
dressed in terms of word sense disam-
biguation with no need for special 
purpose algorithms.
