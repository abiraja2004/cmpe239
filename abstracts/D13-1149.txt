This research describes efforts to use crowd-
sourcing to improve the validity of the seman-
tic predicates in VerbNet, a lexicon of about
6300 English verbs. The current semantic
predicates can be thought of semantic prim-
itives, into which the concepts denoted by a
verb can be decomposed. For example, the
verb spray (of the Spray class), involves the
predicates MOTION, NOT, and LOCATION,
where the event can be decomposed into an
AGENT causing a THEME that was originally
not in a particular location to now be in that
location. Although VerbNet?s predicates are
theoretically well-motivated, systematic em-
pirical data is scarce. This paper describes a
recently-launched attempt to address this issue
with a series of human judgment tasks, posed
to subjects in the form of games.
