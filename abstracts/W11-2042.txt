When a robot is situated in an environment
containing multiple possible interaction part-
ners, it has to make decisions about when to
engage specific users and how to detect and
react appropriately to actions of the users that
might signal the intention to interact.
In this demonstration we present the integra-
tion of an engagement model in an existing di-
alog system based on interaction patterns. As
a sample scenario, this enables the humanoid
robot Nao to play a quiz game with multiple
participants.
