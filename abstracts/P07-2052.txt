Dependency structures do not have the infor-
mation of phrase categories in phrase struc-
ture grammar. Thus, dependency parsing
relies heavily on the lexical information of
words. This paper discusses our investiga-
tion into the effectiveness of lexicalization
in dependency parsing. Specifically, by re-
stricting the degree of lexicalization in the
training phase of a parser, we examine the
change in the accuracy of dependency re-
lations. Experimental results indicate that
minimal or low lexicalization is sufficient
for parsing accuracy.
