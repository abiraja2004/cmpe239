In this paper, we focus on the task of gen-
erating elliptic sentences. We extract from
the data provided by the Surface Realisa-
tion (SR) Task (Belz et al, 2011) 2398 in-
put whose corresponding output sentence
contain an ellipsis. We show that 9% of the
data contains an ellipsis and that both cov-
erage and BLEU score markedly decrease
for elliptic input (from 82.3% coverage for
non-elliptic sentences to 65.3% for ellip-
tic sentences and from 0.60 BLEU score
to 0.47). We argue that elided material
should be represented using phonetically
empty nodes and we introduce a set of
rewrite rules which permits adding these
empty categories to the SR data. Finally,
we evaluate an existing surface realiser on
the resulting dataset. We show that, after
rewriting, the generator achieves a cover-
age of 76% and a BLEU score of 0.74 on
the elliptical data.
