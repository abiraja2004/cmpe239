 
Data preprocessing plays a crucial role in 
phrase-based statistical machine transla-
tion (PB-SMT). In this paper, we show 
how single-tokenization of two types of 
multi-word expressions (MWE), namely 
named entities (NE) and compound 
verbs, as well as their prior alignment 
can boost the performance of PB-SMT. 
Single-tokenization of compound verbs 
and named entities (NE) provides sig-
nificant gains over the baseline PB-SMT 
system. Automatic alignment of NEs 
substantially improves the overall MT 
performance, and thereby the word 
alignment quality indirectly. For estab-
lishing NE alignments, we transliterate 
source NEs into the target language and 
then compare them with the target NEs. 
Target language NEs are first converted 
into a canonical form before the com-
parison takes place. Our best system 
achieves statistically significant im-
provements (4.59 BLEU points absolute, 
52.5% relative improvement) on an Eng-
lish?Bangla translation task.
