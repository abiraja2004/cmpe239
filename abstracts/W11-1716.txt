In most tasks related to opinion mining and
sentiment analysis, it is necessary to compute
the semantic orientation (i.e., positive or neg-
ative evaluative implications) of certain opin-
ion expressions. Recent works suggest that se-
mantic orientation depends on application do-
mains. Moreover, we think that semantic ori-
entation depends on the specific targets (fea-
tures) that an opinion is applied to. In this pa-
per, we introduce a technique to build domain-
specific, feature-level opinion lexicons in a
semi-supervised manner: we first induce a lex-
icon starting from a small set of annotated
documents; then, we expand it automatically
from a larger set of unannotated documents,
using a new graph-based ranking algorithm.
Our method was evaluated in three different
domains (headphones, hotels and cars), using
a corpus of product reviews which opinions
were annotated at the feature level. We con-
clude that our method produces feature-level
opinion lexicons with better accuracy and re-
call that domain-independent opinion lexicons
using only a few annotated documents.
