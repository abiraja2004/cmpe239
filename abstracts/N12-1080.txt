In this paper, we investigate the use of tempo-
ral information for improving extractive sum-
marization of historical articles. Our method
clusters sentences based on their timestamps
and temporal similarity. Each resulting clus-
ter is assigned an importance score which
can then be used as a weight in traditional
sentence ranking techniques. Temporal im-
portance weighting offers consistent improve-
ments over baseline systems.
