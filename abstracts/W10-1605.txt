We present work in progress in the application
of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tech-
nology to the analysis of textual transcriptions
of psychotherapy sessions in the Spanish Lan-
guage. We are developing a set of NLP tools
as well as adapting an existing dictionary for
the analysis of interviews framed on a psycho-
analytic theory. We investigate the applica-
tion of NLP techniques, including dictionary-
based interpretation, and speech act identifica-
tion and classification for the (semi) automatic
identification in text of a set of psychoanalyt-
ical variables. The objective of the work is to
provide a set of tools and resources to assist
therapist during discourse analysis.
