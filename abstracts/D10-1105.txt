In this paper, we conducted a systematic com-
parative analysis of language in different con-
texts of bursty topics, including web search,
news media, blogging, and social bookmark-
ing. We analyze (1) the content similarity and
predictability between contexts, (2) the cov-
erage of search content by each context, and
(3) the intrinsic coherence of information in
each context. Our experiments show that so-
cial bookmarking is a better predictor to the
bursty search queries, but news media and so-
cial blogging media have a much more com-
pelling coverage. This comparison provides
insights on how the search behaviors and so-
cial information sharing behaviors of users are
correlated to the professional news media in
the context of bursty events.
