 
This paper describes the name entity transli-
teration system which we conducted for the 
?NEWS2009 Machine Transliteration Shared 
Task? (Li et al2009). We get the translitera-
tion in Chinese from an English name with 
three steps. We syllabify the English name 
into a sequence of syllables by some rules, 
and generate the most probable Pinyin se-
quence with the mapping model of English 
syllables to Pinyin (EP model), then we con-
vert the Pinyin sequence into a Chinese cha-
racter sequence with the mapping model of 
Pinyin to characters (PC model). And we get 
the final Chinese character sequence. Our 
system achieves an ACC of 0.498 and a 
Mean F-score of 0.786 in the official evalua-
tion result.
