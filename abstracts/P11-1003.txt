In the present paper, we propose the ef-
fective usage of function words to generate
generalized translation rules for forest-based
translation. Given aligned forest-string pairs,
we extract composed tree-to-string translation
rules that account for multiple interpretations
of both aligned and unaligned target func-
tion words. In order to constrain the ex-
haustive attachments of function words, we
limit to bind them to the nearby syntactic
chunks yielded by a target dependency parser.
Therefore, the proposed approach can not
only capture source-tree-to-target-chunk cor-
respondences but can also use forest structures
that compactly encode an exponential num-
ber of parse trees to properly generate target
function words during decoding. Extensive
experiments involving large-scale English-to-
Japanese translation revealed a significant im-
provement of 1.8 points in BLEU score, as
compared with a strong forest-to-string base-
line system.
