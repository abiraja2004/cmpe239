In natural-language discourse, related events
tend to appear near each other to describe a
larger scenario. Such structures can be formal-
ized by the notion of a frame (a.k.a. template),
which comprises a set of related events and
prototypical participants and event transitions.
Identifying frames is a prerequisite for infor-
mation extraction and natural language gen-
eration, and is usually done manually. Meth-
ods for inducing frames have been proposed
recently, but they typically use ad hoc proce-
dures and are difficult to diagnose or extend.
In this paper, we propose the first probabilistic
approach to frame induction, which incorpo-
rates frames, events, and participants as latent
topics and learns those frame and event transi-
tions that best explain the text. The number
of frame components is inferred by a novel
application of a split-merge method from syn-
tactic parsing. In end-to-end evaluations from
text to induced frames and extracted facts, our
method produces state-of-the-art results while
substantially reducing engineering effort.
