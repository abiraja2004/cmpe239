We discuss a cue-based grammar induc-
tion approach based on a parallel theory of
grammar. Our model is based on the hy-
potheses of interdependency between lin-
guistic levels (of representation) and in-
ductability of specific structural properties
at a particular level, with consequences
for the induction of structural properties at
other linguistic levels. We present the re-
sults of three different cue-learning exper-
iments and settings, covering the induc-
tion of phonological, morphological, and
syntactic properties, and discuss potential
consequences for our general grammar in-
duction model.1
