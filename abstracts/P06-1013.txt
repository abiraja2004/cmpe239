Combination methods are an effective way
of improving system performance. This
paper examines the benefits of system
combination for unsupervised WSD. We
investigate several voting- and arbiter-
based combination strategies over a di-
verse pool of unsupervised WSD systems.
Our combination methods rely on predom-
inant senses which are derived automati-
cally from raw text. Experiments using the
SemCor and Senseval-3 data sets demon-
strate that our ensembles yield signifi-
cantly better results when compared with
state-of-the-art.
