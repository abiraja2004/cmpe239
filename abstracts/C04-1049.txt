This paper shows how talking robots can be built
from off-the-shelf components, based on the Lego
MindStorms robotics platform. We present four
robots that students created as final projects in a
seminar we supervised. Because Lego robots are so
affordable, we argue that it is now feasible for any
dialogue researcher to tackle the interesting chal-
lenges at the robot-dialogue interface.
