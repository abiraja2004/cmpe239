 
An ontology can be seen as a representa-
tion of concepts in a specific domain. Ac-
cordingly, ontology construction can be re-
garded as the process of organizing these 
concepts. If the terms which are used to la-
bel the concepts are classified before build-
ing an ontology, the work of ontology con-
struction can proceed much more easily. 
Part-of-speech (PoS) tags usually carry 
some linguistic information of terms, so 
PoS tagging can be seen as a kind of pre-
liminary classification to help constructing 
concept nodes in ontology because features 
or attributes related to concepts of different 
PoS types may be different. This paper pre-
sents a simple approach to tag domain 
terms for the convenience of ontology con-
struction, referred to as Term PoS (TPoS) 
Tagging. The proposed approach makes 
use of segmentation and tagging results 
from a general PoS tagging software to pre-
dict tags for extracted domain specific 
terms. This approach needs no training and 
no context information. The experimental 
results show that the proposed approach 
achieves a precision of 95.41% for ex-
tracted terms and can be easily applied to 
different domains. Comparing with some 
existing approaches, our approach shows 
that for some specific tasks, simple method 
can obtain very good performance and is 
thus a better choice.
