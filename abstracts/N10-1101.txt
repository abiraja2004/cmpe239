This paper introduces a system designed for
automatically generating personalized annota-
tion tags to label Twitter user?s interests and
concerns. We applied TFIDF ranking and
TextRank to extract keywords from Twitter
messages to tag the user. The user tagging pre-
cision we obtained is comparable to the preci-
sion of keyword extraction fromweb pages for
content-targeted advertising.
