This paper discusses the supervised learn-
ing of morphology using stochastic trans-
ducers, trained using the Expectation-
Maximization (EM) algorithm. Two ap-
proaches are presented: first, using the
transducers directly to model the process,
and secondly using them to define a sim-
ilarity measure, related to the Fisher ker-
nel method (Jaakkola and Haussler, 1998),
and then using a Memory-Based Learn-
ing (MBL) technique. These are evaluated
and compared on data sets from English,
German, Slovene and Arabic.
