We explore the contribution of morphologi-
cal features ? both lexical and inflectional ?
to dependency parsing of Arabic, a morpho-
logically rich language. Using controlled ex-
periments, we find that definiteness, person,
number, gender, and the undiacritzed lemma
are most helpful for parsing on automatically
tagged input. We further contrast the contri-
bution of form-based and functional features,
and show that functional gender and number
(e.g., ?broken plurals?) and the related ratio-
nality feature improve over form-based fea-
tures. It is the first time functional morpho-
logical features are used for Arabic NLP.
