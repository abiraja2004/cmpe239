We present the result of an annotation task
on regular polysemy for a series of seman-
tic classes or dot types in English, Dan-
ish and Spanish. This article describes
the annotation process, the results in terms
of inter-encoder agreement, and the sense
distributions obtained with two methods:
majority voting with a theory-compliant
backoff strategy, and MACE, an unsuper-
vised system to choose the most likely
sense from all the annotations.
