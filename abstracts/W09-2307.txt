The prevalence in Chinese of grammatical
structures that translate into English in dif-
ferent word orders is an important cause of
translation difficulty. While previous work has
used phrase-structure parses to deal with such
ordering problems, we introduce a richer set of
Chinese grammatical relations that describes
more semantically abstract relations between
words. Using these Chinese grammatical re-
lations, we improve a phrase orientation clas-
sifier (introduced by Zens and Ney (2006))
that decides the ordering of two phrases when
translated into English by adding path fea-
tures designed over the Chinese typed depen-
dencies. We then apply the log probabil-
ity of the phrase orientation classifier as an
extra feature in a phrase-based MT system,
and get significant BLEU point gains on three
test sets: MT02 (+0.59), MT03 (+1.00) and
MT05 (+0.77). Our Chinese grammatical re-
lations are also likely to be useful for other
NLP tasks.
