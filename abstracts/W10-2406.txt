The system presented in this paper uses a 
combination of two techniques to directly 
transliterate from grapheme to grapheme. The 
technique makes no language specific as-
sumptions, uses no dictionaries or explicit 
phonetic information; the process transforms 
sequences of tokens in the source language 
directly into to sequences of tokens in the 
target.  All the language pairs in our experi-
ments were transliterated by applying this 
technique in a single unified manner. The 
approach we take is that of hypothesis re-
scoring to integrate the models of two state-
of-the-art techniques: phrase-based statistical 
machine translation (SMT), and a joint multi-
gram model. The joint multigram model was 
used to generate an n-best list of translitera-
tion hypotheses that were re-scored using the 
models of the phrase-based SMT system. The 
both of the models? scores for each hypothesis 
were linearly interpolated to produce a final 
hypothesis score that was used to re-rank the 
hypotheses. In our experiments on develop-
ment data,  the combined system was able to 
outperform both of its component systems 
substantially.
