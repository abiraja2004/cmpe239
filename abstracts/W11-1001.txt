We present a model for the inclusion of se-
mantic role annotations in the framework of
confidence estimation for machine translation.
The model has several interesting properties,
most notably: 1) it only requires a linguis-
tic processor on the (generally well-formed)
source side of the translation; 2) it does
not directly rely on properties of the transla-
tion model (hence, it can be applied beyond
phrase-based systems). These features make
it potentially appealing for system ranking,
translation re-ranking and user feedback eval-
uation. Preliminary experiments in pairwise
hypothesis ranking on five confidence estima-
tion benchmarks show that the model has the
potential to capture salient aspects of transla-
tion quality.
