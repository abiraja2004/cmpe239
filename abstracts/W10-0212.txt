Emotion analysis (EA) is a rapidly developing
area in computational linguistics. An EA
system can be extremely useful in fields such
as information retrieval and emotion-driven
computer animation. For most EA systems,
the number of emotion classes is very limited
and the text units the classes are assigned
to are discrete and predefined. The question
we address in this paper is whether the set
of emotion categories can be enriched and
whether the units to which the categories
are assigned can be more flexibly defined.
We present an experiment showing how an
annotation task can be set up so that untrained
participants can perform emotion analysis
with high agreement even when not restricted
to a predetermined annotation unit and using
a rich set of emotion categories. As such it
sets the stage for the development of more
complex EA systems which are closer to the
actual human emotional perception of text.
