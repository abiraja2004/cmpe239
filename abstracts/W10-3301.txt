This  document  describes  an  open 
text-mining  system  that  was  developed 
for the Asian-European project KYOTO. 
The  KYOTO system uses  an  open text 
representation format and a central onto-
logy to  enable  extraction  of  knowledge 
and facts  from large volumes of text  in 
many different languages. We implemen-
ted a semantic tagging approach that per-
forms off-line reasoning. Mining of facts 
and  knowledge  is  achieved  through  a 
flexible pattern matching module that can 
work in much the same way for different 
languages,  can  handle  efficiently  large 
volumes of documents and is not restric-
ted to a specific domain. We applied the 
system to an English database on estuar-
ies.
