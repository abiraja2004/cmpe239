An attractive property of attribute-value gram-
mars is their reversibility. Attribute-value
grammars are usually coupled with sepa-
rate statistical components for parse selection
and fluency ranking. We propose reversible
stochastic attribute-value grammars, in which
a single statistical model is employed both for
parse selection and fluency ranking.
