Language sample analysis is an important
technique used in measuring language devel-
opment. At present, measures of grammati-
cal complexity such as the Index of Productive
Syntax (Scarborough, 1990) are used to mea-
sure language development in early childhood.
Although these measures depict the overall
competence in the usage of language, they do
not provide for an analysis of the grammati-
cal mistakes made by the child. In this paper,
we explore the use of existing Natural Lan-
guage Processing (NLP) techniques to provide
an insight into the processing of child lan-
guage transcripts and challenges in automatic
grammar checking. We explore the automatic
detection of 6 types of verb related grammat-
ical errors. We compare rule based systems
to statistical systems and investigate the use
of different features. We found the statistical
systems performed better than the rule based
systems for most of the error categories.
