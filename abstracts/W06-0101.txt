 
Thesauruses are useful resources for NLP; 
however, manual construction of thesau-
rus is time consuming and suffers low 
coverage. Automatic thesaurus construc-
tion is developed to solve the problem. 
Conventional way to automatically con-
struct thesaurus is by finding similar 
words based on context vector models 
and then organizing similar words into 
thesaurus structure. But the context vec-
tor methods suffer from the problems of 
vast feature dimensions and data sparse-
ness. Latent Semantic Index (LSI) was 
commonly used to overcome the prob-
lems. In this paper, we propose a feature 
clustering method to overcome the same 
problems. The experimental results show 
that it performs better than the LSI mod-
els and do enhance contextual informa-
tion for infrequent words.
