 
With the rapid development of Internet 
and many related technology, Web has 
become the main source of information. 
For many search engines, there are 
many different identities in the returned 
results of character information query. 
Thus the Research of People disambig-
uation is important. In this paper we at-
tempt to solve this problem by combing 
different knowledge.  As people usually 
have different kind of careers, so we first 
utilize this knowledge to classify people 
roughly. Then we use social context of 
people to identify different person. The 
experimental results show that these 
knowledge are helpful for people disam-
biguation.
