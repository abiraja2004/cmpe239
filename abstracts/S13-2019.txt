The measurement of phrasal semantic relat-
edness is an important metric for many nat-
ural language processing applications. In this
paper, we present three approaches for mea-
suring phrasal semantics, one based on a se-
mantic network model, another on a distribu-
tional similarity model, and a hybrid between
the two. Our hybrid approach achieved an F-
measure of 77.4% on the task of evaluating
the semantic similarity of words and compo-
sitional phrases.
