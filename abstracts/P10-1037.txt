We investigate active learning methods for
Japanese dependency parsing. We propose
active learning methods of using partial
dependency relations in a given sentence
for parsing and evaluate their effective-
ness empirically. Furthermore, we utilize
syntactic constraints of Japanese to ob-
tain more labeled examples from precious
labeled ones that annotators give. Ex-
perimental results show that our proposed
methods improve considerably the learn-
ing curve of Japanese dependency parsing.
In order to achieve an accuracy of over
88.3%, one of our methods requires only
34.4% of labeled examples as compared to
passive learning.
