Wiktionary, a satellite of the Wikipedia
initiative, can be seen as a potential re-
source for Natural Language Processing.
It requires however to be processed be-
fore being used efficiently as an NLP re-
source. After describing the relevant as-
pects of Wiktionary for our purposes, we
focus on its structural properties. Then,
we describe how we extracted synonymy
networks from this resource. We pro-
vide an in-depth study of these synonymy
networks and compare them to those ex-
tracted from traditional resources. Fi-
nally, we describe two methods for semi-
automatically improving this network by
adding missing relations: (i) using a kind
of semantic proximity measure; (ii) using
translation relations of Wiktionary itself.
Note: The experiments of this paper are based on Wik-
tionary?s dumps downloaded in year 2008. Differences may
be observed with the current versions available online.
