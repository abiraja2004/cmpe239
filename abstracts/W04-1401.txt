 
This paper focuses on how language 
resources (LR) for translation (hence 
LR4Trans) feature, and should ideally 
feature, within a corporate workflow of 
multilingual content development. The 
envisaged scenario will be that of a content 
management system that acknowledges the 
value of LR4Trans in the organisation as a 
key component and corporate knowledge 
resource.
