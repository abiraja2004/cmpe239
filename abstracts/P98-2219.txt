 
This paper describes a novel method by which a dia- 
logue agent can learn to choose an optimal dialogue 
strategy. While it is widely agreed that dialogue 
strategies hould be formulated in terms of com- 
municative intentions, there has been little work on 
automatically optimizing an agent's choices when 
there are multiple ways to realize a communica- 
tive intention. Our method is based on a combina- 
tion of learning algorithms and empirical evaluation 
techniques. The learning component of our method 
is based on algorithms for reinforcement learning, 
such as dynamic programming and Q-learning. The 
empirical component uses the PARADISE evalua- 
tion framework (Walker et al, 1997) to identify the 
important performance factors and to provide the 
performance function needed by the learning algo- 
rithm. We illustrate our method with a dialogue 
agent named ELVIS (EmaiL Voice Interactive Sys- 
tem), that supports access to email over the phone. 
We show how ELVIS can learn to choose among 
alternate strategies for agent initiative, for reading 
messages, and for summarizing email folders.
