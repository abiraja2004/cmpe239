 
This paper describes a machine learning 
algorithm for Gujarati Part of Speech Tag-
ging. The machine learning part is per-
formed using a CRF model. The features 
given to CRF are properly chosen keeping 
the linguistic aspect of Gujarati in mind. As 
Gujarati is currently a less privileged lan-
guage in the sense of being resource poor, 
manually tagged data is only around 600 
sentences. The tagset contains 26 different 
tags which is the standard Indian Language 
(IL) tagset. Both tagged (600 sentences) 
and untagged (5000 sentences) are used for 
learning. The algorithm has achieved an 
accuracy of 92% for Gujarati texts where 
the training corpus is of 10,000 words and 
the test corpus is of 5,000 words.
