Kneser-Ney (1995) smoothing and its vari-
ants are generally recognized as having
the best perplexity of any known method
for estimating N-gram language models.
Kneser-Ney smoothing, however, requires
nonstandard N-gram counts for the lower-
order models used to smooth the highest-
order model. For some applications, this
makes Kneser-Ney smoothing inappropri-
ate or inconvenient. In this paper, we in-
troduce a new smoothing method based on
ordinary counts that outperforms all of the
previous ordinary-count methods we have
tested, with the new method eliminating
most of the gap between Kneser-Ney and
those methods.
