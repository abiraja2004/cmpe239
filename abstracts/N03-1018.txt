In this paper, we introduce a generative prob-
abilistic optical character recognition (OCR)
model that describes an end-to-end process in
the noisy channel framework, progressing from
generation of true text through its transforma-
tion into the noisy output of an OCR system.
The model is designed for use in error correc-
tion, with a focus on post-processing the output
of black-box OCR systems in order to make
it more useful for NLP tasks. We present an
implementation of the model based on finite-
state models, demonstrate the model?s ability
to significantly reduce character and word er-
ror rate, and provide evaluation results involv-
ing automatic extraction of translation lexicons
from printed text.
