We examine correlations between native
speaker judgements on automatically gen-
erated German text against automatic eval-
uation metrics. We look at a number of
metrics from the MT and Summarisation
communities and find that for a relative
ranking task, most automatic metrics per-
form equally well and have fairly strong
correlations to the human judgements.
In contrast, on a naturalness judgement
task, the General Text Matcher (GTM) tool
correlates best overall, although in gen-
eral, correlation between the human judge-
ments and the automatic metrics was quite
weak.
