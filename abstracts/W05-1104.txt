We present an extensible API for inte-
grating language modeling and realiza-
tion, describing its design and efficient
implementation in the OpenCCG sur-
face realizer. With OpenCCG, language
models may be used to select realiza-
tions with preferred word orders, pro-
mote alignment with a conversational
partner, avoid repetitive language use,
and increase the speed of the best-first
anytime search. The API enables a vari-
ety of n-gram models to be easily com-
bined and used in conjunction with ap-
propriate edge pruning strategies. The
n-gram models may be of any order,
operate in reverse (?right-to-left?), and
selectively replace certain words with
their semantic classes. Factored lan-
guage models with generalized backoff
may also be employed, over words rep-
resented as bundles of factors such as
form, pitch accent, stem, part of speech,
supertag, and semantic class.
