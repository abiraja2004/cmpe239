 
This paper is an attempt to show that an inter-
mediary level of analysis is an effective way 
for carrying out various NLP tasks for linguis-
tically similar languages. We describe a 
process for developing a simple parser for 
doing such tasks. This parser uses a grammar 
driven approach to annotate dependency rela-
tions (both inter and intra chunk) at an inter-
mediary level. Ease in identifying a particular 
dependency relation dictates the degree of 
analysis reached by the parser. To establish ef-
ficiency of the simple parser we show the im-
provement in its results over previous gram-
mar driven dependency parsing approaches for 
Indian languages like Hindi. We also propose 
the possibility of usefulness of the simple 
parser for Indian languages that are similar in 
nature.
