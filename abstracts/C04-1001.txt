This paper addresses the documentation of
large-scale grammars.1 We argue that grammar
implementation differs from ordinary software
programs: the concept of modules, as known
from software engineering, cannot be trans-
ferred directly to grammar implementations,
due to grammar-specific properties. These
properties also put special constraints on the
form of grammar documentation. To fulfill
these constraints, we propose an XML-based,
grammar-specific documentation technique.
