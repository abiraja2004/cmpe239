Recent work on semantic role labeling
(SRL) has focused almost exclusively on
the analysis of the predicate-argument
structure of verbs, largely due to the lack
of human-annotated resources for other
types of predicates that can serve as train-
ing and test data for the semantic role
labeling systems. However, it is well-
known that verbs are not the only type
of predicates that can take arguments.
Most notably, nouns that are nominalized
forms of verbs and relational nouns gen-
erally are also considered to have their
own predicate-argument structure. In this
paper we report results of SRL experi-
ments on nominalized predicates in Chi-
nese, using a newly completed corpus,
the Chinese Nombank. We also dis-
cuss the impact of using publicly avail-
able manually annotated verb data to im-
prove the SRL accuracy of nouns, exploit-
ing a widely-held assumption that verbs
and their nominalizations share the same
predicate-argument structure. Finally, we
discuss the results of applying reranking
techniques to improve SRL accuracy for
nominalized predicates, which showed in-
significant improvement.
