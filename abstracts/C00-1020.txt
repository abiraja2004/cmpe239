 
This paper presents a robust client/server implemen- 
tation of a word sense disambiguator for English. 
This system associates a word with its meaning in 
a given context using dictionaries as tagged corpora 
in order to extract semantic disambiguation rules. 
Semantic rules are used as input of a semantic appli- 
cation program which encodes a linguistic strategy 
in order to select he best disambiguation rule for 
the word to be disambiguated. The semantic dis- 
ambiguation rule application program is part of the 
client/server a chitecture enabling the processing of 
large corpora.
