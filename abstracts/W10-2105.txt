In the past decade several parsing systems
for natural language have emerged, which
use different methods and formalisms. For
instance, systems that employ a hand-
crafted grammar and a statistical disam-
biguation component versus purely sta-
tistical data-driven systems. What they
have in common is the lack of portabil-
ity to new domains: their performance
might decrease substantially as the dis-
tance between test and training domain in-
creases. Yet, to which degree do they suf-
fer from this problem, i.e. which kind of
parsing system is more affected by domain
shifts? Intuitively, grammar-driven sys-
tems should be less affected by domain
changes. To investigate this hypothesis,
an empirical investigation on Dutch is car-
ried out. The performance variation of
a grammar-driven versus two data-driven
systems across domains is evaluated, and a
simple measure to quantify domain sensi-
tivity proposed. This will give an estimate
of which parsing system is more affected
by domain shifts, and thus more in need
for adaptation techniques.
