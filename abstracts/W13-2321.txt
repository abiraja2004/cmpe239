Automatic pre-annotation is often used to
improve human annotation speed and ac-
curacy. We address here out-of-domain
named entity annotation, and examine
whether automatic pre-annotation is still
beneficial in this setting. Our study de-
sign includes two different corpora, three
pre-annotation schemes linked to two an-
notation levels, both expert and novice an-
notators, a questionnaire-based subjective
assessment and a corpus-based quantita-
tive assessment. We observe that pre-
annotation helps in all cases, both for
speed and for accuracy, and that the sub-
jective assessment of the annotators does
not always match the actual benefits mea-
sured in the annotation outcome.
