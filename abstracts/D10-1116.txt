Linguistic Steganography is concerned with
hiding information in natural language text.
One of the major transformations used in Lin-
guistic Steganography is synonym substitu-
tion. However, few existing studies have stud-
ied the practical application of this approach.
In this paper we propose two improvements
to the use of synonym substitution for encod-
ing hidden bits of information. First, we use
the Web 1T Google n-gram corpus for check-
ing the applicability of a synonym in context,
and we evaluate this method using data from
the SemEval lexical substitution task. Second,
we address the problem that arises from words
with more than one sense, which creates a po-
tential ambiguity in terms of which bits are
encoded by a particular word. We develop a
novel method in which words are the vertices
in a graph, synonyms are linked by edges, and
the bits assigned to a word are determined by
a vertex colouring algorithm. This method
ensures that each word encodes a unique se-
quence of bits, without cutting out large num-
ber of synonyms, and thus maintaining a rea-
sonable embedding capacity.
