This paper describes a new automatic method
for Japanese predicate argument structure
analysis. The method learns relevant features
to assign case roles to the argument of the tar-
get predicate using the features of the words
located closest to the target predicate under
various constraints such as dependency types,
words, semantic categories, parts of speech,
functional words and predicate voices. We
constructed decision lists in which these fea-
tures were sorted by their learned weights. Us-
ing our method, we integrated the tasks of se-
mantic role labeling and zero-pronoun iden-
tification, and achieved a 17% improvement
compared with a baseline method in a sen-
tence level performance analysis.
