In this paper, we address statistical ma-
chine translation of public conference talks.
Modeling the style of this genre can be very
challenging given the shortage of available
in-domain training data. We investigate the
use of a hybrid LM, where infrequent words
are mapped into classes. Hybrid LMs are
used to complement word-based LMs with
statistics about the language style of the
talks. Extensive experiments comparing
different settings of the hybrid LM are re-
ported on publicly available benchmarks
based on TED talks, from Arabic to English
and from English to French. The proposed
models show to better exploit in-domain
data than conventional word-based LMs for
the target language modeling component of
a phrase-based statistical machine transla-
tion system.
