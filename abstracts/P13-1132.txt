Semantic similarity is an essential com-
ponent of many Natural Language Pro-
cessing applications. However, prior meth-
ods for computing semantic similarity of-
ten operate at different levels, e.g., sin-
gle words or entire documents, which re-
quires adapting the method for each data
type. We present a unified approach to se-
mantic similarity that operates at multiple
levels, all the way from comparing word
senses to comparing text documents. Our
method leverages a common probabilistic
representation over word senses in order to
compare different types of linguistic data.
This unified representation shows state-of-
the-art performance on three tasks: seman-
tic textual similarity, word similarity, and
word sense coarsening.
