 
This paper reports on a study of semantic 
role tagging in Chinese in the absence of a 
parser.  We tackle the task by identifying 
the relevant headwords in a sentence as a 
first step to partially locate the corre-
sponding constituents to be labelled.  We 
also explore the effect of data homogene-
ity by experimenting with a textbook cor-
pus and a news corpus, representing 
simple data and complex data respectively.  
Results suggest that while the headword 
location method remains to be improved, 
the homogeneity between the training and 
testing data is important especially in 
view of the characteristic syntax-
semantics interface in Chinese.  We also 
plan to explore some class-based tech-
niques for the task with reference to exist-
ing semantic lexicons, and to modify the 
method and augment the feature set with 
more linguistic input.
