This paper describes our event extraction sys-
tem that participated in the bacteria biotopes
task in BioNLP Shared Task 2011. The sys-
tem performs semi-supervised named entity
recognition by leveraging additional informa-
tion derived from external resources including
a large amount of raw text. We also perform
coreference resolution to deal with events hav-
ing a large textual scope, which may span over
several sentences (or even paragraphs). To
create the training data for coreference resolu-
tion, we have manually annotated the corpus
with coreference links. The overall F-score of
event extraction was 33.2 at the official eval-
uation of the shared task, but it has been im-
proved to 33.8 thanks to the refinement made
after the submission deadline.
