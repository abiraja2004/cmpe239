 
This paper describes an algorithm for performing rapid 
match on continuous speech that makes it possible to rec- 
ognize sentences from an 842 word vocabulary on a desk- 
top 33 megahertz 80486 computer in near eal time. This 
algorithm relies on a combination of smoothing and linear 
segmentation together with the notion of word start groups. 
It appears that the total computation required grows more 
slowly than linearly with the vocabulary size, so that larger 
vocabularies appear feasible, with only moderately enhanced 
hardware. The rapid match algorithm described here is 
closely related to the one that is used in DragonDictate, 
Dragon's commercial 30,000 word discrete utterance recog- 
nizer. 
rapid match module to obtain a short list of plausible xten- 
sions. 
The key ideas that the algorithm relies on are linear 
segmentation, smoothing, acoustic lustering, and word start 
groupings. In subsequent sections we shall elaborate on 
these ideas and explain their role in rapid match. We shall 
then report on some empirical results, having to do with a 
particular task that Dragon has chosen to use for develop- 
ment purposes: the dictation of mammography reports, us- 
ing a vocabulary of 842 words. 
Other apid match algorithms that are quite different in 
character have also been described in the literature \[2\], \[3\], 
and \[4\].
