Taking an asynchronous perspective on the syntax-semantics interface, we propose to use modu-
lar graph rewriting systems as the model of computation. We formally define them and demonstrate
their use with a set of modules which produce underspecified semantic representations from a syn-
tactic dependency graph. We experimentally validate this approach on a set of sentences. The results
open the way for the production of underspecified semantic dependency structures from corpora an-
notated with syntactic dependencies and, more generally, for a broader use of modular rewriting
systems for computational linguistics.
