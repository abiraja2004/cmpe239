This paper presents an approach for web
page clustering. The different underlying
meanings of a name are discovered on the
basis of the title of the web page, the body
content, the common named entities across
the documents and the sub-links. This in-
formation is feeded into a K-Means cluster-
ing algorithm which groups together the web
pages that refer to the same individual.
