 
While language-independent selztence align- 
ment programs typically achieve a recall in the 
90 percent range, tile same cannot be said about 
word alignment systems, where normal recall 
figures tend to fall somewhere between 20 and 
40 percent, in tile language-indepeudent case. 
As words (and phrases) for wlrious reasons 
are more interesting to align than sentences, 
we need methods to increase word alignment 
recall, preferably without sacrificing precision. 
This paper reports on a series of experiments 
with pivot aligtunent, which is tile use of one or 
more additional hmguages to improve bilingual 
word aligment. Tile conclusion is that in a 
multilingual parallel corpus, pivot alignment is 
a safe way to iucrcase word alignment recall 
without lowering the precision.
