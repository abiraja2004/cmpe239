We propose a range of deep lexical acqui-
sition methods which make use of mor-
phological, syntactic and ontological lan-
guage resources to model word similarity
and bootstrap from a seed lexicon. The
different methods are deployed in learn-
ing lexical items for a precision gram-
mar, and shown to each have strengths and
weaknesses over different word classes. A
particular focus of this paper is the rela-
tive accessibility of different language re-
source types, and predicted ?bang for the
buck? associated with each in deep lexical
acquisition applications.
