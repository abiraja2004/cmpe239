Current alternatives for language mod-
eling are statistical techniques based
on large amounts of training data, and
hand-crafted context-free or finite-state
grammars that are difficult to build
and maintain. One way to address
the problems of the grammar-based ap-
proach is to compile recognition gram-
mars from grammars written in a more
expressive formalism. While theoreti-
cally straight-forward, the compilation
process can exceed memory and time
bounds, and might not always result in
accurate and efficient speech recogni-
tion. We will describe and evaluate two
approaches to this compilation prob-
lem. We will also describe and evalu-
ate additional techniques to reduce the
structural ambiguity of the language
model.
