Current parsing models are not immedi-
ately applicable for languages that exhibit
strong interaction between morphology
and syntax, e.g., Modern Hebrew (MH),
Arabic and other Semitic languages. This
work represents a first attempt at model-
ing morphological-syntactic interaction in
a generative probabilistic framework to al-
low for MH parsing. We show that mor-
phological information selected in tandem
with syntactic categories is instrumental
for parsing Semitic languages. We further
show that redundant morphological infor-
mation helps syntactic disambiguation.
