This paper describes an attempt to recy-
cle parts of the Czech-to-Russian ma-
chine translation system (MT) in the
new Czech-to-English MT system. The
paper describes the overall architecture
of the new system and the details of
the modules which have been added.
A special attention is paid to the prob-
lem of named entity recognition and
to the method of automatic acquisition
of lexico-syntactic information for the
bilingual dictionary of the system. The
paper concentrates on the problems en-
countered in the process of reusing ex-
isting modules and their solution.
