considered to be a reasonable   measure of 
perceptual quality of speech. However it 
only reflects the distortion in time 
dependent contour of the signal due to 
noise. Objective Measures such as Log 
Area Ratio (LAR), Itakura-Saitio 
Distortion (IS), Log-Likelihood Ratio 
(LLR) and Weighted Spectral Slope 
(WSS) are better   measures of perceptual 
speech quality as they represent deviation 
in the spectrum. Noise affects the speech 
time contour and the corresponding 
frequency content. Different languages 
have some peculiar characteristics due to 
variation in the phonetic content and their 
distribution. Distortion introduced by noise 
and application of enhancement algorithm 
varies for different phonemes. In this paper 
a novel idea of using noise and speech 
enhancement as means of identifying a 
language is presented, using objective 
measures of speech quality. Study is done     
on three spoken Indian regional languages 
namely Kashmiri, Bangla and Manipuri, 
when corrupted by white noise. It is found 
that the objective measures of noisy 
speech, when determined using 
corresponding clear and enhanced speech 
are different for different languages over a   
range of SNR, giving clue to the type of   
the language in use.
