The WordNet lexical ontology, which is
primarily composed of common nouns,
has been widely used in retrieval tasks.
Here, we explore the notion of a fine-
grained proper noun ontology and argue
for the utility of such an ontology in re-
trieval tasks. To support this claim, we
build a fine-grained proper noun ontol-
ogy from unrestricted news text and use
this ontology to improve performance on
a question answering task.
