A popular tradition of studying semantic rep-
resentation has been driven by the assump-
tion that word meaning can be learned from
the linguistic environment, despite ample ev-
idence suggesting that language is grounded
in perception and action. In this paper we
present a comparative study of models that
represent word meaning based on linguistic
and perceptual data. Linguistic information is
approximated by naturally occurring corpora
and sensorimotor experience by feature norms
(i.e., attributes native speakers consider impor-
tant in describing the meaning of a word). The
models differ in terms of the mechanisms by
which they integrate the two modalities. Ex-
perimental results show that a closer corre-
spondence to human data can be obtained by
uncovering latent information shared among
the textual and perceptual modalities rather
than arriving at semantic knowledge by con-
catenating the two.
