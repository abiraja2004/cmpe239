This paper describes a tool for aligning and
searching parallel treebanks. Such treebanks
are a new type of parallel corpora that come
with syntactic annotation on both languages
plus sub-sentential alignment. Our tool al-
lows the visualization of tree pairs and the
comfortable annotation of word and phrase
alignments. It also allows monolingual and
bilingual searches including the specifica-
tion of alignment constraints. We show that
the TIGER-Search query language can eas-
ily be combined with such alignment con-
straints to obtain a powerful cross-lingual
query language.
