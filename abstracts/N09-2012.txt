In this paper, we present The gEoSpatial
Language Annotator (TESLA)?a tool which
supports human annotation of geospatial lan-
guage corpora. TESLA interfaces with a GIS
database for annotating grounded geospatial
entities and uses Google Earth for visualiza-
tion of both entity search results and evolving
object and speaker position from GPS tracks.
We also discuss a current annotation effort us-
ing TESLA to annotate location descriptions
in a geospatial language corpus.
