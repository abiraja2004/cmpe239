In building practical two-way speech-to-speech
translation systems the end user will always wish
to use the system in an environment different from
the original training data. As with all speech sys-
tems, it is important to allow the system to adapt
to the actual usage situations. This paper investi-
gates how a speech-to-speech translation system can
adapt day-to-day from collected data on day one to
improve performance on day two. The platform is
the CMU Iraqi-English portable two-way speech-
to-speech system as developed under the DARPA
TransTac program. We show how machine transla-
tion, speech recognition and overall system perfor-
mance can be improved on day 2 after adapting from
day 1 in both a supervised and unsupervised way.
