Research in named entity recognition and
mention detection has typically involved a
fairly small number of semantic classes,
which may not be adequate if seman-
tic class information is intended to sup-
port natural language applications. Moti-
vated by this observation, we examine the
under-studied problem of semantic sub-
type induction, where the goal is to au-
tomatically determine which of a set of
92 fine-grained semantic classes a noun
phrase belongs to. We seek to improve the
standard supervised approach to this prob-
lem using two techniques: hierarchical
classification and collective classification.
Experimental results demonstrate the ef-
fectiveness of these techniques, whether
or not they are applied in isolation or in
combination with the standard approach.
