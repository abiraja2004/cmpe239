In this paper, we report experiments that
explore learning of syntactic and seman-
tic representations. First, we extend a
state-of-the-art statistical parser to pro-
duce a richly annotated tree that identi-
fies and labels nodes with semantic role la-
bels as well as syntactic labels. Secondly,
we explore rule-based and learning tech-
niques to extract predicate-argument struc-
tures from this enriched output. The learn-
ing method is competitive with previous
single-system proposals for semantic role
labelling, yields the best reported preci-
sion, and produces a rich output. In com-
bination with other high recall systems it
yields an F-measure of 81%.
