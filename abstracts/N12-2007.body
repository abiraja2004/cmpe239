Semantic relatedness, or its inverse, seman-
tic distance, measures the degree of close-
ness between two pieces of text determined by
their meaning. Related work typically mea-
sures semantics based on a sparse knowledge
base such as WordNet1 or CYC that requires
intensive manual efforts to build and main-
tain. Other work is based on the Brown cor-
pus, or more recently, Wikipedia. Wikipedia-
based measures, however, typically do not
take into account the rapid growth of that re-
source, which exponentially increases the time
to prepare and query the knowledge base. Fur-
thermore, the generalized knowledge domain
may be difficult to adapt to a specific domain.
To address these problems, this paper pro-
poses a domain-specific semantic relatedness
measure based on part of Wikipedia that ana-
lyzes course descriptions to suggest whether a
course can be transferred from one institution
to another. We show that our results perform
well when compared to previous work.
