We present a discriminative, large-
margin approach to feature-based
matching for word alignment. In this
framework, pairs of word tokens re-
ceive a matching score, which is based
on features of that pair, including mea-
sures of association between the words,
distortion between their positions, sim-
ilarity of the orthographic form, and so
on. Even with only 100 labeled train-
ing examples and simple features which
incorporate counts from a large unla-
beled corpus, we achieve AER perfor-
mance close to IBM Model 4, in much
less time. Including Model 4 predic-
tions as features, we achieve a relative
AER reduction of 22% in over inter-
sected Model 4 alignments.
