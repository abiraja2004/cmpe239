This paper deals with recognition of
named entities in Czech texts. We present
a recently released corpus of Czech sen-
tences with manually annotated named en-
tities, in which a rich two-level classifica-
tion scheme was used. There are around
6000 sentences in the corpus with roughly
33000 marked named entity instances. We
use the data for training and evaluating a
named entity recognizer based on Support
Vector Machine classification technique.
The presented recognizer outperforms the
results previously reported for NE recog-
nition in Czech.
