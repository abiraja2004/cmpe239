German has a productive morphology and
allows the creation of complex words
which are often highly ambiguous. This
paper reports on the development of a
head-lexicalized PCFG for the disam-
biguation of German morphological anal-
yses. The grammar is trained on unla-
beled data using the Inside-Outside algo-
rithm. The parser achieves a precision
of more than 68% on difficult test data,
which is 23% more than the baseline ob-
tained by randomly choosing one of the
simplest analyses. Remarkable is the fact
that precision drops to 52% without lexi-
calization.
