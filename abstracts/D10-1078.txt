 
We present a novel approach to distributional-
only, fully unsupervised, POS tagging, based on 
an adaptation of the EM algorithm for the esti-
mation of a Gaussian mixture. In this approach, 
which we call Latent-Descriptor Clustering 
(LDC), word types are clustered using a series 
of progressively more informative descriptor 
vectors. These descriptors, which are computed 
from the immediate left and right context of 
each word in the corpus, are updated based on 
the previous state of the cluster assignments. 
The LDC algorithm is simple and intuitive. Us-
ing standard evaluation criteria for unsupervised 
POS tagging, LDC shows a substantial im-
provement in performance over state-of-the-art 
methods, along with a several-fold reduction in 
computational cost.
