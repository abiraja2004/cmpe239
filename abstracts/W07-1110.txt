This paper discusses the semantic interpre-
tation of compound nominalizations in Chi-
nese. We propose four coarse-grained se-
mantic roles of the noun modifier and use a
Maximum Entropy Model to label such re-
lations in a compound nominalization. The
feature functions used for the model are
web-based statistics acquired via role related
paraphrase patterns, which are formed by a
set of word instances of prepositions, sup-
port verbs, feature nouns and aspect mark-
ers. By applying a sub-linear transformation
and discretization of the raw statistics, a rate
of approximately 77% is obtained for classi-
fication of the four semantic relations.
