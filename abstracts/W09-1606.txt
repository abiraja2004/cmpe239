In this paper we present a new statistical ap-
proach to opinion detection and its? evalua-
tion on the English,  Chinese and Japanese 
corpora.  Besides,  the  proposed  method  is 
compared  with  three  baselines,  namely 
Na?ve  Bayes  classifier,  a  language  model 
and an approach based on significant collo-
cations. These models being language inde-
pendent are improved with the use of lan-
guage-dependent technique on the example 
of  the  English  corpus.  We show that  our 
method almost  always  gives  better  perfor-
mance  compared  to  the  considered  base-
lines.
