This paper describes the characteristic features
of dependency structures of Japanese spoken
language by investigating a spoken dialogue cor-
pus, and proposes a stochastic approach to de-
pendency parsing. The method can robustly
cope with inversion phenomena and bunsetsus
which don?t have the head bunsetsu by relax-
ing the syntactic dependency constraints. The
method acquires in advance the probabilities
of dependencies from a spoken dialogue corpus
tagged with dependency structures, and pro-
vides the most plausible dependency structure
for each utterance on the basis of the probabili-
ties. An experiment on dependency parsing for
driver?s utterances in CIAIR in-car spoken dia-
logue corpus has been made. The experimental
result has shown our method to be effective for
robust parsing of spoken language.
