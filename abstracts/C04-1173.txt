This paper presents a disambiguation
method in which word senses are deter-
mined using a dictionary. We use a seman-
tic proximity measure between words in the
dictionary, taking into account the whole
topology of the dictionary, seen as a graph
on its entries. We have tested the method on
the problem of disambiguation of the dic-
tionary entries themselves, with promising
results considering we do not use any prior
annotated data.
