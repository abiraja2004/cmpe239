Linear models have enjoyed great success in
structured prediction in NLP. While a lot of
progress has been made on efficient train-
ing with several loss functions, the problem
of endowing learners with a mechanism for
feature selection is still unsolved. Common
approaches employ ad hoc filtering or L1-
regularization; both ignore the structure of the
feature space, preventing practicioners from
encoding structural prior knowledge. We fill
this gap by adopting regularizers that promote
structured sparsity, along with efficient algo-
rithms to handle them. Experiments on three
tasks (chunking, entity recognition, and de-
pendency parsing) show gains in performance,
compactness, and model interpretability.
