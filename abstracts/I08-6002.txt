 
This paper presents a methodology for 
finding similarity and co-reference of 
documents across languages. The similarity 
between the documents is identified ac-
cording to the content of the whole docu-
ment and co-referencing of documents is 
found by taking the named entities present 
in the document. Here we use Vector Space 
Model (VSM) for identifying both similar-
ity and co-reference. This can be applied in 
cross-lingual search engines where users 
get documents of very similar content from 
different language documents.
