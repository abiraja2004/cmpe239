Human-written, good quality extractive sum-
maries pay great attention to the text intermix-
ing the extracts. In this work, we focused on
the lexical choice for verbs introducing quoted
text. We analyzed 4000+ high quality sum-
maries for a high traffic mailing list and manu-
ally assembled 39 quotation-introducing verb
classes that cover the majority of the verb oc-
currences. A significant amount of the data is
covered by on-going work on e-mail ?speech
acts.? However, we found that one third of the
?tail? is composed by ?risky? verbs that most
likely will be beyond the state of the art for
longer time. We used this fact to highlight the
trade-offs of risk taking in NLG, where inter-
esting prose might come at the cost of unset-
tling some of the readers.
