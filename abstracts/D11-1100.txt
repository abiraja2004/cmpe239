Traditional approaches to sentiment classifica-
tion rely on lexical features, syntax-based fea-
tures or a combination of the two. We pro-
pose semantic features using word senses for
a supervised document-level sentiment classi-
fier. To highlight the benefit of sense-based
features, we compare word-based representa-
tion of documents with a sense-based repre-
sentation where WordNet senses of the words
are used as features. In addition, we highlight
the benefit of senses by presenting a part-of-
speech-wise effect on sentiment classification.
Finally, we show that even if a WSD engine
disambiguates between a limited set of words
in a document, a sentiment classifier still per-
forms better than what it does in absence of
sense annotation. Since word senses used as
features show promise, we also examine the
possibility of using similarity metrics defined
on WordNet to address the problem of not
finding a sense in the training corpus. We per-
form experiments using three popular similar-
ity metrics to mitigate the effect of unknown
synsets in a test corpus by replacing them with
similar synsets from the training corpus. The
results show promising improvement with re-
spect to the baseline.
