An important part of question answering
is ensuring a candidate answer is plausi-
ble as a response. We present a flexible
approach based on discriminative prefer-
ence ranking to determine which of a set
of candidate answers are appropriate. Dis-
criminative methods provide superior per-
formance while at the same time allow the
flexibility of adding new and diverse fea-
tures. Experimental results on a set of fo-
cused What ...? and Which ...? questions
show that our learned preference ranking
methods perform better than alternative
solutions to the task of answer typing. A
gain of almost 0.2 in MRR for both the
first appropriate and first correct answers
is observed along with an increase in pre-
cision over the entire range of recall.
