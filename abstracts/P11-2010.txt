Transliteration, a rich source of proper noun
spelling variations, is usually recognized by
phonetic- or spelling-based models. How-
ever, a single model cannot deal with dif-
ferent words from different language origins,
e.g., ?get? in ?piaget? and ?target.? Li et
al. (2007) propose a method which explicitly
models and classifies the source language ori-
gins and switches transliteration models ac-
cordingly. This model, however, requires an
explicitly tagged training set with language
origins. We propose a novel method which
models language origins as latent classes. The
parameters are learned from a set of translit-
erated word pairs via the EM algorithm. The
experimental results of the transliteration task
of Western names to Japanese show that the
proposed model can achieve higher accuracy
compared to the conventional models without
latent classes.
