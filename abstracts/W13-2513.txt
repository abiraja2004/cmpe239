Multilingual sentiment analysis attracts in-
creased attention as the massive growth
of multilingual web contents. This con-
ducts to study opinions across different
languages by comparing the underlying
messages written by different people hav-
ing different opinions. In this paper, we
propose Sentiment based Comparability
Measures (SCM) to compare opinions in
multilingual comparable articles without
translating source/target into the same lan-
guage. This will allow media trackers
(journalists) to automatically detect public
opinion split across huge multilingual web
contents. To develop SCM, we need either
to get or to build parallel sentiment cor-
pora. Because this kind of corpora are not
available, we decided to build them. For
that, we propose a new method to automat-
ically label parallel corpora with sentiment
classes. Then we use the extracted parallel
sentiment corpora to develop multilingual
sentiment analysis system. Experimental
results show that, the proposed measure
can capture differences in terms of opin-
ions. The results also show that compara-
ble articles variate in their objectivity and
positivity.
