Multi-document summarization involves
many aspects of content selection and sur-
face realization. The summaries must be
informative, succinct, grammatical, and obey
stylistic writing conventions. We present a
method where such individual aspects are
learned separately from data (without any
hand-engineering) but optimized jointly
using an integer linear programme. The
ILP framework allows us to combine the
decisions of the expert learners and to select
and rewrite source content through a mixture
of objective setting, soft and hard constraints.
Experimental results on the TAC-08 data set
show that our model achieves state-of-the-art
performance using ROUGE and signifi-
cantly improves the informativeness of the
summaries.
