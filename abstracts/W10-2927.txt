We propose the notion of a structural bias
inherent in a parsing system with respect
to the language it is aiming to parse. This
structural bias characterizes the behaviour
of a parsing system in terms of structures
it tends to under- and over- produce. We
propose a Boosting-based method for un-
covering some of the structural bias inher-
ent in parsing systems. We then apply
our method to four English dependency
parsers (an Arc-Eager and Arc-Standard
transition-based parsers, and first- and
second-order graph-based parsers). We
show that all four parsers are biased with
respect to the kind of annotation they are
trained to parse. We present a detailed
analysis of the biases that highlights spe-
cific differences and commonalities be-
tween the parsing systems, and improves
our understanding of their strengths and
weaknesses.
