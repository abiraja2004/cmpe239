Among syntax-based translation models, the
tree-based approach, which takes as input a
parse tree of the source sentence, is a promis-
ing direction being faster and simpler than
its string-based counterpart. However, current
tree-based systems suffer from a major draw-
back: they only use the 1-best parse to direct
the translation, which potentially introduces
translation mistakes due to parsing errors. We
propose a forest-based approach that trans-
lates a packed forest of exponentially many
parses, which encodes many more alternatives
than standard n-best lists. Large-scale exper-
iments show an absolute improvement of 1.7
BLEU points over the 1-best baseline. This
result is also 0.8 points higher than decoding
with 30-best parses, and takes even less time.
