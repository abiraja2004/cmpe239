 
Ira this paper I present a parser based on De- 
scription Logics (I)I.) for a German lll'SG-slyle 
fragment. The specilied parser relies mainly 
on the inferential capabilities of the nnderlying 
DL system. Given a preferential default ex- 
tension for DL disamhiguation is achieved by 
choosing the parse containing a qualitatively 
minimal number of exceptions.
