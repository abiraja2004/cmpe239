Unsupervised algorithms for the induction
of linguistic knowledge should at best re-
quire as few basic assumptions as pos-
sible and at the same time in principle
yield good results for any language. How-
ever, most of the time such algorithms are
only tested on a few (closely related) lan-
guages. In this paper, an approach is pre-
sented that takes into account typological
knowledge in order to induce syllabic di-
visions in a fully automatic manner based
on reasonably-sized written texts. Our ap-
proach is able to account for syllable struc-
tures of languages where other approaches
would fail, thereby raising the question
whether computational methods can really
be claimed to be language-universal when
they are not tested on the variety of struc-
tures that are found in the languages of the
world.
