. Traditional text categorization is usually a topic-based task, but a 
subtle demand on information retrieval is to distinguish between positive and 
negative view on text topic. In this paper, a new method is explored to solve 
this problem. Firstly, a batch of Concerned Concepts in the researched domain 
is predefined. Secondly, the special knowledge representing the positive or 
negative context of these concepts within sentences is built up. At last, an 
evaluating function based on the knowledge is defined for sentiment classifica-
tion of free text. We introduce some linguistic knowledge in these procedures to 
make our method effective. As a result, the new method proves better compared 
with SVM when experimenting on Chinese texts about a certain topic.
