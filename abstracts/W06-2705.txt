 
This paper presents the compilation of 
the CroCo Corpus, an English-German 
translation corpus. Corpus design, anno-
tation and alignment are described in de-
tail. In order to guarantee the searchabil-
ity and exchangeability of the corpus, 
XML stand-off mark-up is used as repre-
sentation format for the multi-layer anno-
tation. On this basis it is shown how the 
corpus can be queried using XQuery. 
Furthermore, the generalisation of results 
in terms of linguistic and translational re-
search questions is briefly discussed.
