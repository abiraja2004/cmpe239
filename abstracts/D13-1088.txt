We explore a model of stress prediction
in Russian using a combination of lo-
cal contextual features and linguistically-
motivated features associated with the
word?s stem and suffix. We frame this
as a ranking problem, where the objec-
tive is to rank the pronunciation with the
correct stress above those with incorrect
stress. We train our models using a simple
Maximum Entropy ranking framework al-
lowing for efficient prediction. An empir-
ical evaluation shows that a model com-
bining the local contextual features and
the linguistically-motivated non-local fea-
tures performs best in identifying both
primary and secondary stress.
