 
In this paper we describe the algorithms used in the 
BBN BYBLOS Continuous Speech Recognition system. 
The BYBLOS system uses context-dependent hidden 
Markov models of phonemes to provide a robust model of 
phonetic coarticulation. We provide an update of the 
ongoing research aimed at improving the recognition 
accuracy. In the first experiment we confirm the large 
improvement in accuracy that can be derived by using 
spectral derivative parameters in the recognition. In 
particular, the word error rate is reduced by a factor of two. 
Currently the system achieves a word error rate of 2.9% 
when tested on the speaker-dependent part of the standard 
1000-Word DARPA Resource Management Database 
using the Word-Pair grammar supplied with the database. 
When no grammar was used, the error rate is 15.3%. 
Finally, we present a method for smoothing the discrete 
densities on the states of the HMM, which is intended to 
alleviate the problem of insufficient raining for detailed 
phonetic models.
