 
 
Both Inflectional and derivational morphology lead 
to multiple surface forms of a word. Stemming 
reduces these forms back to its stem or root, and is 
a very useful tool for many applications.  There has 
not been any work reported on Urdu stemming.  
The current work develops an Urdu stemmer or 
Assas-Band and improves the performance using 
more precise affix based exception lists, instead of 
the conventional lexical lookup employed for 
developing stemmers in other languages.  Testing 
shows an accuracy of 91.2%.  Further 
enhancements are also suggested.
