Implicit feature detection, also known as im-
plicit feature identification, is an essential as-
pect of feature-specific opinion mining but
previous works have often ignored it. We
think, based on the explicit sentences, sever-
al Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier-
s can be established to do this task. Never-
theless, we believe it is possible to do bet-
ter by using a constrained topic model instead
of traditional attribute selection methods. Ex-
periments show that this method outperforms
the traditional attribute selection methods by
a large margin and the detection task can be
completed better.
