 
We describe two approaches to analyzing and 
tagging team discourse using Latent Semantic 
Analysis (LSA) to predict team performance. 
The first approach automatically categorizes 
the contents of each statement made by each 
of the three team members using an estab-
lished set of tags. Performance predicting the 
tags automatically was 15% below human 
agreement. These tagged statements are then 
used to predict team performance. The second 
approach measures the semantic content of the 
dialogue of the team as a whole and accu-
rately predicts the team?s performance on a 
simulated military mission.
