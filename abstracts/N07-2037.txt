We present a joint morphological-lexical language 
model (JMLLM) for use in statistical machine trans-
lation (SMT) of language pairs where one or both of 
the languages are morphologically rich. The pro-
posed JMLLM takes advantage of the rich morphol-
ogy to reduce the Out-Of-Vocabulary (OOV) rate, 
while keeping the predictive power of the whole 
words. It also allows incorporation of additional 
available semantic, syntactic and linguistic informa-
tion about the morphemes and words into the lan-
guage model. Preliminary experiments with an
English to Dialectal-Arabic SMT system demon-
strate improved translation performance over trigram 
based baseline language model.
