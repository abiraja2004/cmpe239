We present a novel framework that com-
bines strengths from surface syntactic pars-
ing and deep syntactic parsing to increase
deep parsing accuracy, specifically by com-
bining dependency and HPSG parsing. We
show that by using surface dependencies to
constrain the application of wide-coverage
HPSG rules, we can benefit from a num-
ber of parsing techniques designed for high-
accuracy dependency parsing, while actu-
ally performing deep syntactic analysis. Our
framework results in a 1.4% absolute im-
provement over a state-of-the-art approach
for wide coverage HPSG parsing.
