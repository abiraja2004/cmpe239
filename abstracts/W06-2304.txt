 
We present in this paper a parser relying 
on a constraint-based formalism called 
Property Grammar. We show how con-
straints constitute an efficient solution in 
parsing non canonical material such as 
spoken language transcription or e-mails. 
This technique, provided that it is imple-
mented with some control mechanisms, 
is very efficient. Some results are pre-
sented, from the French parsing evalua-
tion campaign EASy.
