Computational story telling has sparked
great interest in artificial intelligence,
partly because of its relevance to educa-
tional and gaming applications. Tradition-
ally, story generators rely on a large repos-
itory of background knowledge contain-
ing information about the story plot and
its characters. This information is detailed
and usually hand crafted. In this paper we
propose a data-driven approach for gen-
erating short children?s stories that does
not require extensive manual involvement.
We create an end-to-end system that real-
izes the various components of the gen-
eration pipeline stochastically. Our system
follows a generate-and-and-rank approach
where the space of multiple candidate sto-
ries is pruned by considering whether they
are plausible, interesting, and coherent.
