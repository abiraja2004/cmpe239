The notion of infix probability has been intro-
duced in the literature as a generalization of
the notion of prefix (or initial substring) prob-
ability, motivated by applications in speech
recognition and word error correction. For the
case where a probabilistic context-free gram-
mar is used as language model, methods for
the computation of infix probabilities have
been presented in the literature, based on vari-
ous simplifying assumptions. Here we present
a solution that applies to the problem in its full
generality.
