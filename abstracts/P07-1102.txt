Task-solving in dialogue depends on the lin-
guistic alignment of the interlocutors, which
Pickering & Garrod (2004) have suggested
to be based on mechanistic repetition ef-
fects. In this paper, we seek confirmation
of this hypothesis by looking at repetition
in corpora, and whether repetition is cor-
related with task success. We show that
the relevant repetition tendency is based on
slow adaptation rather than short-term prim-
ing and demonstrate that lexical and syntac-
tic repetition is a reliable predictor of task
success given the first five minutes of a task-
oriented dialogue.
