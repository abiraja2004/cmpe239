A survey of existing methods for stopping ac-
tive learning (AL) reveals the needs for meth-
ods that are: more widely applicable; more ag-
gressive in saving annotations; and more sta-
ble across changing datasets. A new method
for stopping AL based on stabilizing predic-
tions is presented that addresses these needs.
Furthermore, stopping methods are required
to handle a broad range of different annota-
tion/performance tradeoff valuations. Despite
this, the existing body of work is dominated
by conservative methods with little (if any) at-
tention paid to providing users with control
over the behavior of stopping methods. The
proposed method is shown to fill a gap in the
level of aggressiveness available for stopping
AL and supports providing users with control
over stopping behavior.
