. This paper analyzes the results of automatic concept align-
ment between two ontologies. We use an iterative algorithm to perform
concept alignment. The algorithm uses the similarity of shared terms in
order to find the most appropriate target concept for a particular source
concept. The results show that the proposed algorithm not only finds
the relation between the target concepts and the source concepts, but
the algorithm also shows some flaws in the ontologies. These results can
be used to improve the correctness of the ontologies.
