This paper describes our submission to
the WMT10 Shared Evaluation Task and
MetricsMATR10. We present a version
of the METEOR-NEXT metric with para-
phrase tables for five target languages. We
describe the creation of these paraphrase
tables and conduct a tuning experiment
that demonstrates consistent improvement
across all languages over baseline ver-
sions of the metric without paraphrase re-
sources.
