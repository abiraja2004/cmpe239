  
We describe a language-independent, flexi-
ble, and accurate method for the detection of 
abbreviations in text corpora. It is based on 
the idea that an abbreviation can be viewed 
as a collocation, and can be identified by us-
ing methods for collocation detection such 
as the log likelihood ratio. Although the log 
likelihood ratio is known to show a good re-
call, its precision is poor. We employ scal-
ing factors which lead to a strong improve-
ment of precision. Experiments with English 
and German corpora show that abbreviations 
can be detected with high accuracy.
