We address the problem of sentiment and
objectivity classification of product re-
views in Chinese. Our approach is distinct-
ive in that it treats both positive / negative
sentiment and subjectivity / objectivity not
as distinct classes but rather as a con-
tinuum; we argue that this is desirable from
the perspective of would-be customers who
read the reviews. We use novel unsuper-
vised techniques, including a one-word
'seed' vocabulary and iterative retraining
for sentiment processing, and a criterion of
'sentiment density' for determining the ex-
tent to which a document is opinionated.
The classifier achieves up to 87% F-meas-
ure for sentiment polarity detection.
