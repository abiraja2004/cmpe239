Many sequence labeling tasks in NLP require
solving a cascade of segmentation and tag-
ging subtasks, such as Chinese POS tagging,
named entity recognition, and so on. Tradi-
tional pipeline approaches usually suffer from
error propagation. Joint training/decoding in
the cross-product state space could cause too
many parameters and high inference complex-
ity. In this paper, we present a novel method
which integrates graph structures of two sub-
tasks into one using virtual nodes, and per-
forms joint training and decoding in the fac-
torized state space. Experimental evaluations
on CoNLL 2000 shallow parsing data set and
Fourth SIGHAN Bakeoff CTB POS tagging
data set demonstrate the superiority of our
method over cross-product, pipeline and can-
didate reranking approaches.
