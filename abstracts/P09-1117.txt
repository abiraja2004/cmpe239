While Active Learning (AL) has already
been shown to markedly reduce the anno-
tation efforts for many sequence labeling
tasks compared to random selection, AL
remains unconcerned about the internal
structure of the selected sequences (typ-
ically, sentences). We propose a semi-
supervised AL approach for sequence la-
beling where only highly uncertain sub-
sequences are presented to human anno-
tators, while all others in the selected se-
quences are automatically labeled. For the
task of entity recognition, our experiments
reveal that this approach reduces annota-
tion efforts in terms of manually labeled
tokens by up to 60 % compared to the stan-
dard, fully supervised AL scheme.
