This paper describes the use of a pair
Hidden Markov Model (pair HMM) sys-
tem in mining transliteration pairs from
noisy Wikipedia data. A pair HMM vari-
ant that uses nine transition parameters,
and emission parameters associated with
single character mappings between source
and target language alphabets is identified
and used in estimating transliteration sim-
ilarity. The system resulted in a precision
of 78% and recall of 83% when evaluated
on a random selection of English-Russian
Wikipedia topics.
