In Chinese texts, words are not separated by
white spaces. This is problematic for many nat-
ural language processing tasks. The standard
approach is to segment the Chinese character
sequence into words. Here, we investigate Chi-
nese word segmentation for statistical machine
translation. We pursue two goals: the first one
is the maximization of the final translation qual-
ity; the second is the minimization of the man-
ual effort for building a translation system.
The commonly used method for getting the
word boundaries is based on a word segmenta-
tion tool and a predefined monolingual dictio-
nary. To avoid the dependence of the trans-
lation system on an external dictionary, we
have developed a system that learns a domain-
specific dictionary from the parallel training
corpus. This method produces results that are
comparable with the predefined dictionary.
Further more, our translation system is able
to work without word segmentation with only a
minor loss in translation quality.
