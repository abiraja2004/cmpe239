1. Brief Description
Over the last two decades, computational linguistics has been revolutionized as a result
of three closely related developments, two empirical and one theoretical: increases in 
computing power, the new availability of large linguistic datasets, and a paradigm shift 
toward the view that language processing by computers is best approached through the 
tools of statistical inference. During roughly the same time frame, there have been 
similar theoretical developments in cognitive psychology towards a view of major 
aspects of human cognition as instances of rational statistical inference. Developments 
in these two fields have set the stage for renewed interest in computational approaches 
to human language processing. In this tutorial, we briefly survey some of the key 
theoretical issues at the forefront of this interdisciplinary field today, and show how 
modeling techniques from NLP are being employed, extended, and coupled with 
experimental techniques from psycholinguistics to further our understanding of real-time 
human language use.
