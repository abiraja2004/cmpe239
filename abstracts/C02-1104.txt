  
We present in this paper a technique allowing to 
choose the parsing granularity within the same 
approach relying on a constraint-based formalism. 
Its main advantage lies in the fact that the same 
linguistic resources are used whatever the 
granularity. Such a method is useful in particular 
for systems such as text-to-speech that usually need 
a simple bracketing, but in some cases requires a 
precise syntactic structure. We illustrate this 
method in comparing the results for three different 
granularity levels and give some figures about 
their respective performance in parsing a tagged 
corpus.
