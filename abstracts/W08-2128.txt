We describe the system submitted to
the closed challenge of the CoNLL-2008
shared task on joint parsing of syntactic
and semantic dependencies. Syntactic de-
pendencies are processed with the Malt-
Parser 0.4. Semantic dependencies are
processed with a combination of memory-
based classifiers. The system achieves
78.43 labeled macro F1 for the complete
problem, 86.07 labeled attachment score
for syntactic dependencies, and 70.51 la-
beled F1 for semantic dependencies.
