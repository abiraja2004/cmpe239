We adapt discriminative reranking to im-
prove the performance of grounded lan-
guage acquisition, specifically the task of
learning to follow navigation instructions
from observation. Unlike conventional
reranking used in syntactic and semantic
parsing, gold-standard reference trees are
not naturally available in a grounded set-
ting. Instead, we show how the weak su-
pervision of response feedback (e.g. suc-
cessful task completion) can be used as
an alternative, experimentally demonstrat-
ing that its performance is comparable to
training on gold-standard parse trees.
