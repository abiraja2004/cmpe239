 
This paper deals with automatic classification of 
Arabic web documents. Such a classification is very 
useful for affording directory search functionality, 
which has been used by many web portals and 
search engines to cope with an ever-increasing 
number of documents on the web. In this paper, 
Naive Bayes (NB) which is a statistical machine 
learning algorithm, is used to classify non-vocalized 
Arabic web documents (after their words have been 
transformed to the corresponding canonical form, 
i.e., roots) to one of five pre-defined categories. 
Cross validation experiments are used to evaluate 
the NB categorizer. The data set used during these 
experiments consists of 300 web documents per 
category. The results of cross validation in the 
leave-one-out experiment show that, using 2,000 
terms/roots, the categorization accuracy varies from 
one category to another with an average accuracy 
over all categories of 68.78 %. Furthermore, the 
best categorization performance by category during 
cross validation experiments goes up to 92.8%. 
Further tests carried out on a manually collected 
evaluation set which consists of 10 documents from 
each of the 5 categories, show that the overall 
classification accuracy achieved over all categories 
is 62%,  and that the best result by category  reaches 
90%.   
Keywords: Na?ve Bayes, Arabic document 
categorization, cross validation, TF-IDF.
