 
The automatic analysis and classification of 
text using fine-grained attitude labels is the 
main task we address in our research. The de-
veloped @AM system relies on compositio-
nality principle and a novel approach based on 
the rules elaborated for semantically distinct 
verb classes. The evaluation of our method on 
1000 sentences, that describe personal expe-
riences, showed promising results: average 
accuracy on fine-grained level was 62%, on 
middle level ? 71%, and on top level ? 88%.
