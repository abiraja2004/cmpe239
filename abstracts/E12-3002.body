Classifying text genres across languages
can bring the benefits of genre classifi-
cation to the target language without the
costs of manual annotation. This article
introduces the first approach to this task,
which exploits text features that can be con-
sidered stable genre predictors across lan-
guages. My experiments show this method
to perform equally well or better than
full text translation combined with mono-
lingual classification, while requiring fewer
resources.
