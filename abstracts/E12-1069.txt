Arabic morphology is complex, partly be-
cause of its richness, and partly because
of common irregular word forms, such as
broken plurals (which resemble singular
nouns), and nouns with irregular gender
(feminine nouns that look masculine and
vice versa). In addition, Arabic morpho-
syntactic agreement interacts with the lex-
ical semantic feature of rationality, which
has no morphological realization. In this
paper, we present a series of experiments
on the automatic prediction of the latent
linguistic features of functional gender and
number, and rationality in Arabic. We com-
pare two techniques, using simple maxi-
mum likelihood (MLE) with back-off and
a support vector machine based sequence
tagger (Yamcha). We study a number of
orthographic, morphological and syntactic
learning features. Our results show that
the MLE technique is preferred for words
seen in the training data, while the Yam-
cha technique is optimal for unseen words,
which are our real target. Furthermore, we
show that for unseen words, morphological
features help beyond orthographic features
and that syntactic features help even more.
A combination of the two techniques im-
proves overall performance even further.
