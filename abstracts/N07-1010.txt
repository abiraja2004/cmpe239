A twin-model is proposed for coreference res-
olution: a link component, modeling the coref-
erential relationship between an anaphor and
a candidate antecedent, and a creation com-
ponent modeling the possibility that a phrase
is not coreferential with any candidate an-
tecedent. The creation model depends on all
candidate antecedents and is often expensive
to compute; Therefore constraints are imposed
on feature forms so that features in the cre-
ation model can be efficiently computed from
feature values in the link model. The pro-
posed twin-model is tested on the data from
the 2005 Automatic Content Extraction (ACE)
task and the proposed model performs bet-
ter than a thresholding baseline without tuning
free parameter.
