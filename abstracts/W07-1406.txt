 
We present a novel approach to RTE that 
exploits a structure-oriented sentence rep-
resentation followed by a similarity func-
tion. The structural features are automati-
cally acquired from tree skeletons that are 
extracted and generalized from dependency 
trees. Our method makes use of a limited 
size of training data without any external 
knowledge bases (e.g. WordNet) or hand-
crafted inference rules. We have achieved 
an accuracy of 71.1% on the RTE-3 devel-
opment set performing a 10-fold cross 
validation and 66.9% on the RTE-3 test 
data.
