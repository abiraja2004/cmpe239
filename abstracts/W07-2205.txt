As the organizers of the ACL 2007 Deep
Linguistic Processing workshop (Baldwin et
al., 2007), we were asked to discuss our per-
spectives on the role of current trends in
deep linguistic processing for parsing tech-
nology. We are particularly interested in
the ways in which efficient, broad coverage
parsing systems for linguistically expressive
grammars can be built and integrated into
applications which require richer syntactic
structures than shallow approaches can pro-
vide. This often requires hybrid technolo-
gies which use shallow or statistical methods
for pre- or post-processing, to extend cover-
age, or to disambiguate the output.
