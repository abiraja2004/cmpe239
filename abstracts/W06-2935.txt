Unlexicalized probabilistic context-free
parsing is a general and flexible approach
that sometimes reaches competitive re-
sults in multilingual dependency parsing
even if a minimum of language-specific
information is supplied. Furthermore, in-
tegrating parser results (good at long de-
pendencies) and tagger results (good at
short range dependencies, and more easily
adaptable to treebank peculiarities) gives
competitive results in all languages.
