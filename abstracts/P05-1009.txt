We describe a new sentence realization
framework for text-to-text applications.
This framework uses IDL-expressions as
a representation formalism, and a gener-
ation mechanism based on algorithms for
intersecting IDL-expressions with proba-
bilistic language models. We present both
theoretical and empirical results concern-
ing the correctness and efficiency of these
algorithms.
