Existing algorithms for the Generation of
Referring Expressions (GRE) aim at gen-
erating descriptions that allow a hearer to
identify its intended referent uniquely; the
length of the expression is also considered,
usually as a secondary issue. We explore
the possibility of making the trade-off be-
tween these two factors more explicit, via
a general cost function which scores these
two aspects separately. We sketch some
more complex phenomena which might be
amenable to this treatment.
