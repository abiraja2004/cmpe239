This paper describes a novel algorithm to dy-
namically set endpointing thresholds based on
a rich set of dialogue features to detect the end
of user utterances in a dialogue system. By
analyzing the relationship between silences in
user?s speech to a spoken dialogue system and
a wide range of automatically extracted fea-
tures from discourse, semantics, prosody, tim-
ing and speaker characteristics, we found that
all features correlate with pause duration and
with whether a silence indicates the end of the
turn, with semantics and timing being the most
informative. Based on these features, the pro-
posed method reduces latency by up to 24%
over a fixed threshold baseline. Offline evalu-
ation results were confirmed by implementing
the proposed algorithm in the Let?s Go system.
