Out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words present a
significant challenge for Machine Trans-
lation. For low-resource languages, lim-
ited training data increases the frequency
of OOV words and this degrades the qual-
ity of the translations. Past approaches
have suggested using stems or synonyms
for OOV words. Unlike the previous
methods, we show how to handle not just
the OOV words but rare words as well
in an Example-based Machine Transla-
tion (EBMT) paradigm. Presence of OOV
words and rare words in the input sentence
prevents the system from finding longer
phrasal matches and produces low qual-
ity translations due to less reliable lan-
guage model estimates. The proposed
method requires only a monolingual cor-
pus of the source language to find can-
didate replacements. A new framework
is introduced to score and rank the re-
placements by efficiently combining fea-
tures extracted for the candidate replace-
ments. A lattice representation scheme al-
lows the decoder to select from a beam
of possible replacement candidates. The
new framework gives statistically signif-
icant improvements in English-Chinese
and English-Haitian translation systems.
