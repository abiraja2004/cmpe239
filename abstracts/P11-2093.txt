We present a pointwise approach to Japanese
morphological analysis (MA) that ignores
structure information during learning and tag-
ging. Despite the lack of structure, it is able to
outperform the current state-of-the-art struc-
tured approach for Japanese MA, and achieves
accuracy similar to that of structured predic-
tors using the same feature set. We also
find that the method is both robust to out-
of-domain data, and can be easily adapted
through the use of a combination of partial an-
notation and active learning.
