 
Previous work on quantifier scope annotation focuses on scoping sentences with only two quantified noun phrases (NPs), where the quan-tifiers are restricted to a predefined list. It also ignores negation, modal/logical operators, and other sentential adverbials. We present a com-prehensive scope annotation scheme. We anno-tate the scope interaction between all scopal terms in the sentence from quantifiers to scopal adverbials, without putting any restriction on the number of scopal terms in a sentence. In ad-dition, all NPs, explicitly quantified or not, with no restriction on the type of quantification, are investigated for possible scope interactions. 1
