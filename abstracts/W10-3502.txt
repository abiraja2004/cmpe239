One of the valuable features of any col-
laboratively constructed semantic resource
(CSR) is its ability to ? as a system ? con-
tinuously correct itself. Wikipedia is an ex-
cellent example of such a process, with van-
dalism and misinformation being removed
or reverted in astonishing time by a coali-
tion of human editors and machine bots.
However, some errors are harder to spot
than others, a problem which can lead to
persistent unchecked errors, particularly on
more obscure, less viewed article pages. In
this paper we discuss the problems of incor-
rect link targets in Wikipedia, and propose
a method of automatically highlighting and
correcting them using only the semantic
information found in this encyclopaedia?s
link structure.
