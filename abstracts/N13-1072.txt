A respelling is an alternative spelling of a
word in the same writing system, intended to
clarify pronunciation. We introduce the task
of automatic generation of a respelling from
the word?s phonemic representation. Our ap-
proach combines machine learning with lin-
guistic constraints and electronic resources.
We evaluate our system both intrinsically
through a human judgment experiment, and
extrinsically by passing its output to a letter-
to-phoneme converter. The results show that
the respellings generated by our system are
better on average than those found on the Web,
and approach the quality of respellings de-
signed by an expert.
