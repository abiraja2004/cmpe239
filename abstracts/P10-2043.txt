Motivated by the recent interest in stream-
ing algorithms for processing large text
collections, we revisit the work of
Ravichandran et al (2005) on using the
Locality Sensitive Hash (LSH) method of
Charikar (2002) to enable fast, approxi-
mate comparisons of vector cosine simi-
larity. For the common case of feature
updates being additive over a data stream,
we show that LSH signatures can be main-
tained online, without additional approxi-
mation error, and with lower memory re-
quirements than when using the standard
offline technique.
