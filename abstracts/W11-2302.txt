This paper describes modifications to acous-
tic speech signals produced by speakers with
dysarthria in order to make those utter-
ances more intelligible to typical listeners.
These modifications include the correction of
tempo, the adjustment of formant frequencies
in sonorants, the removal of aberrant voic-
ing, the deletion of phoneme insertion errors,
and the replacement of erroneously dropped
phonemes. Through simple evaluations of in-
telligibility with na??ve listeners, we show that
the correction of phoneme errors results in the
greatest increase in intelligibility and is there-
fore a desirable mechanism for the eventual
creation of augmentative application software
for individuals with dysarthria.
