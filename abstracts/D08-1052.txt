In this paper, we first introduce a new archi-
tecture for parsing, bidirectional incremental
parsing. We propose a novel algorithm for in-
cremental construction, which can be applied
to many structure learning problems in NLP.
We apply this algorithm to LTAG dependency
parsing, and achieve significant improvement
on accuracy over the previous best result on
the same data set.
