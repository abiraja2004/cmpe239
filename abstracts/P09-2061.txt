We propose a distance phrase reordering
model (DPR) for statistical machine trans-
lation (SMT), where the aim is to cap-
ture phrase reorderings using a structure
learning framework. On both the reorder-
ing classification and a Chinese-to-English
translation task, we show improved perfor-
mance over a baseline SMT system.
