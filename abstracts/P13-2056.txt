Cross-lingual projection methods can ben-
efit from resource-rich languages to im-
prove performances of NLP tasks in
resources-scarce languages. However,
these methods confronted the difficulty of
syntactic differences between languages
especially when the pair of languages
varies greatly. To make the projection
method well-generalize to diverse lan-
guages pairs, we enhance the projec-
tion method based on word alignments
by introducing target-language word rep-
resentations as features and proposing a
novel noise removing method based on
these word representations. Experiments
showed that our methods improve the per-
formances greatly on projections between
English and Chinese.
