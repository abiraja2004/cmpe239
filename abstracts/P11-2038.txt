In this paper, we show that local features com-
puted from the derivations of tree substitution
grammars ? such as the identify of particu-
lar fragments, and a count of large and small
fragments ? are useful in binary grammatical
classification tasks. Such features outperform
n-gram features and various model scores by
a wide margin. Although they fall short of
the performance of the hand-crafted feature
set of Charniak and Johnson (2005) developed
for parse tree reranking, they do so with an
order of magnitude fewer features. Further-
more, since the TSGs employed are learned
in a Bayesian setting, the use of their deriva-
tions can be viewed as the automatic discov-
ery of tree patterns useful for classification.
On the BLLIP dataset, we achieve an accuracy
of 89.9% in discriminating between grammat-
ical text and samples from an n-gram language
model.
