We describe a word alignment platform 
which ensures text pre-processing (to-
kenization, POS-tagging, lemmatization, 
chunking, sentence alignment) as re-
quired by an accurate word alignment. 
The platform combines two different 
methods, producing distinct alignments. 
The basic word aligners are described in 
some details and are individually evalu-
ated. The union of the individual align-
ments is subject to a filtering post-
processing phase. Two different filtering 
methods are also presented. The evalua-
tion shows that the combined word 
alignment contains 10.75% less errors 
than the best individual aligner.
