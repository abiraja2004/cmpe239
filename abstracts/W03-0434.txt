This paper describes a robust linear classifica-
tion system for Named Entity Recognition. A
similar system has been applied to the CoNLL
text chunking shared task with state of the art
performance. By using different linguistic fea-
tures, we can easily adapt this system to other
token-based linguistic tagging problems. The
main focus of the current paper is to investigate
the impact of various local linguistic features
for named entity recognition on the CoNLL-
2003 (Tjong Kim Sang and De Meulder, 2003)
shared task data. We show that the system per-
formance can be enhanced significantly with
some relative simple token-based features that
are available for many languages. Although
more sophisticated linguistic features will also
be helpful, they provide much less improve-
ment than might be expected.
