 
In this paper a morphological component 
with a limited capability to automatically 
interpret (and generate) derived words is 
presented. The system combines an ex- 
tended two-level morphology \[Trost, 1991a; 
Trost, 1991b\] with a feature-based word 
grammar building on a hierarchical lexicon. 
Polymorphemic stems not explicitly stored 
in the lexicon are given a compositional in- 
terpretation. That way the system allows 
to minimize redundancy in the lexicon be- 
cause derived words that are transparent 
need not to be stored explicitly. Also, words 
formed ad-hoc can be recognized correctly. 
The system is implemented in CommonLisp 
and has been tested on examples from Ger- 
man derivation.
