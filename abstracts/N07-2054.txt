We present the first known empirical study
on speech summarization without lexi-
cal features for Mandarin broadcast news.
We evaluate acoustic, lexical and struc-
tural features as predictors of summary
sentences. We find that the summarizer
yields good performance at the average F-
measure of 0.5646 even by using the com-
bination of acoustic and structural features
alone, which are independent of lexical
features. In addition, we show that struc-
tural features are superior to lexical fea-
tures and our summarizer performs sur-
prisingly well at the average F-measure
of 0.3914 by using only acoustic features.
These findings enable us to summarize
speech without placing a stringent demand
on speech recognition accuracy.
