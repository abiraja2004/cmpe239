 
In this paper, we adapt the TF-IDF model to the 
Japanese grapheme-phoneme alignment task, by 
way of a simple statistical model and an incremen- 
tal learning method. In the incremental learning 
method, grapheme-phoneme alignment paradigms 
are disambiguated one at a time according to the 
relative plausibility of the highest scoring align- 
ment schema, and the statistical model is re-trained 
accordingly. On limited evaluation, the learning 
method achieved an accuracy of 93.28%, represent- 
ing a slight improvement over a baseline rule-based 
method.
