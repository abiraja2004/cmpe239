This papers reports the application of
the QARLA evaluation framework to the
DUC 2004 testbed (tasks 2 and 5). Our
experiment addresses two issues: how
well QARLA evaluation measures corre-
late with human judgements, and what ad-
ditional insights can be provided by the
QARLA framework to the DUC evalua-
tion exercises.
