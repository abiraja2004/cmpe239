The quality of bilingual data is a key factor
in Statistical Machine Translation (SMT).
Low-quality bilingual data tends to pro-
duce incorrect translation knowledge and
also degrades translation modeling per-
formance. Previous work often used su-
pervised learning methods to filter low-
quality data, but a fair amount of human
labeled examples are needed which are
not easy to obtain. To reduce the re-
liance on labeled examples, we propose
an unsupervised method to clean bilin-
gual data. The method leverages the mu-
tual reinforcement between the sentence
pairs and the extracted phrase pairs, based
on the observation that better sentence
pairs often lead to better phrase extraction
and vice versa. End-to-end experiments
show that the proposed method substan-
tially improves the performance in large-
scale Chinese-to-English translation tasks.
