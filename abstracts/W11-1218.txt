 
We describe a set of techniques that have 
been developed while collecting parallel 
texts for Russian-English language pair and 
building a corpus of parallel sentences for 
training a statistical machine translation 
system. We discuss issues of verifying 
potential parallel texts and filtering out 
automatically translated documents. Finally 
we evaluate the quality of the 1-million-
sentence corpus which we believe may be a 
useful resource for machine translation 
research.
