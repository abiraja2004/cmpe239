 
The complexity of sentences characteristic to 
biomedical articles poses a challenge to natu-
ral language parsers, which are typically 
trained on large-scale corpora of non-technical 
text. We propose a text simplification process, 
bioSimplify, that seeks to reduce the complex-
ity of sentences in biomedical abstracts in or-
der to improve the performance of syntactic 
parsers on the processed sentences. Syntactic 
parsing is typically one of the first steps in a 
text mining pipeline. Thus, any improvement 
in performance would have a ripple effect 
over all processing steps. We evaluated our 
method using a corpus of biomedical sen-
tences annotated with syntactic links. Our em-
pirical results show an improvement of 2.90% 
for the Charniak-McClosky parser and of 
4.23% for the Link Grammar parser when 
processing simplified sentences rather than the 
original sentences in the corpus.
