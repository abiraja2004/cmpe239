Producing a fluent ordering for a set of
prenominal modifiers in a noun phrase
(NP) is a problematic task for natural lan-
guage generation and machine translation
systems. We present a novel approach
to this issue, adapting multiple sequence
alignment techniques used in computa-
tional biology to the alignment of modi-
fiers. We describe two training techniques
to create such alignments based on raw
text, and demonstrate ordering accuracies
superior to earlier reported approaches.
