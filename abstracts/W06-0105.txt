This paper presents a semantic model for
Chinese garden-path sentences. Based on
the Sentence Degeneration model of
HNC theory, a garden-path can arise
from two types of ambiguities: SD type
ambiguity and NP allocated ambiguity.
This paper provides an approach to proc-
ess garden-paths, in which ambiguity de-
tection and analysis take the place of re-
vision. The performance of the approach
is evaluated on a small manually anno-
tated test set. The results show that our
algorithm can analyze Chinese gar-
den-path sentences effectively.
