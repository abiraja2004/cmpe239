Multi-document summarization has
been an important problem in infor-
mation retrieval. It aims to dis-
till the most important information
from a set of documents to gener-
ate a compressed summary. Given
a sentence graph generated from a
set of documents where vertices repre-
sent sentences and edges indicate that
the corresponding vertices are simi-
lar, the extracted summary can be de-
scribed using the idea of graph dom-
ination. In this paper, we propose
a new principled and versatile frame-
work for multi-document summariza-
tion using the minimum dominating
set. We show that four well-known
summarization tasks including generic,
query-focused, update, and compara-
tive summarization can be modeled as
different variations derived from the
proposed framework. Approximation
algorithms for performing summariza-
tion are also proposed and empirical
experiments are conducted to demon-
strate the effectiveness of our proposed
framework.
