 
Dialog man tigement addresses two specific 
problems: (1) providing a coherent overall 
structure to interaction that extends beyond the 
single turn, (2) correctly managing mixed- 
initiative interaction. We propose a dialog 
management architecture based on the following 
elements: handlers that manage interaction 
focussed on tightly coupled sets of information, 
a product that reflects mutually agreed-upon 
information and an agenda that orders the topics 
relevant to task completion.
