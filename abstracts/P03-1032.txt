This paper discusses the challenges and pro-
poses a solution to performing information re-
trieval on the Web using Chinese natural language
speech query. The main contribution of this re-
search is in devising a divide-and-conquer strategy
to alleviate the speech recognition errors. It uses
the query model to facilitate the extraction of main
core semantic string (CSS) from the Chinese natu-
ral language speech query. It then breaks the CSS
into basic components corresponding to phrases,
and uses a multi-tier strategy to map the basic
components to known phrases in order to further
eliminate the errors. The resulting system has been
found to be effective.
