 
This paper describes our word sense dis-
ambiguation (WSD) system participating in 
the SemEval-2007 tasks.  The core system 
is a fully supervised system based on a Na-
?ve Bayes classifier using multiple knowl-
edge sources.  Toward a larger goal of in-
corporating the intrinsic nature of individ-
ual target words in disambiguation, thus in-
troducing a cognitive element in automatic 
WSD, we tried to fine-tune the results ob-
tained from the core system with human-
informed feature preference, and compared 
it with automatic feature selection as com-
monly practised in statistical WSD.  De-
spite the insignificant improvement ob-
served in this preliminary attempt, more 
systematic analysis remains to be done for 
a cognitively plausible account of the fac-
tors underlying the lexical sensitivity of 
WSD, which would inform and enhance 
the development of WSD systems in return.
