A stochastic approach to learning phonology.
The model presented captures 7-15% more
phonologically plausible underlying forms
than a simple majority solution, because it
prefers ?pure? alternations. It could be use-
ful in cases where an approximate solution is
needed, or as a seed for more complex mod-
els. A similar process could be involved in
some stages of child language acquisition; in
particular, early learning of phonotactics.
