 
Through tile alignment of definitions fronl 
two or more dilTerent sources, it is 
possible to retrieve pairs of words that can 
be used indistinguishably in the same 
sentence without changing tile meaning of 
the concept. As lexicographic work 
exploits common defining schemes, such 
as genus and dilTerentia, a concept is 
simihu'ly defined by different dictionaries. 
The dilTerence in words used between two 
lexicographic sources lets us extend lhe 
lexical knowledge base, so that clustering 
is available through merging two or more 
dictionaries into a single database and 
then using an approlwiate alignment 
techlaique. Since aligmnent starts from thc 
same entry of two dictionaries, clustering 
is l~lster than any other technique. 
Tile algorithm introduced here is analogy- 
based, and starts from calculating the 
Levenshtein distance, which is a variation 
o1' the edit distance, and allows us to align 
the definitions. As a measure of similarity, 
the concept el' longest collocation couple 
is introduced, which is the basis of 
clustering similar words. The process 
iterates, replacing similar pairs of words 
in tile definitions until no new clusters are 
found.
