This paper describes the technical con-
tribution of the supporting resources pro-
vided for the BioNLP Shared Task 2013.
Following the tradition of the previous
two BioNLP Shared Task events, the task
organisers and several external groups
sought to make system development easier
for the task participants by providing auto-
matically generated analyses using a vari-
ety of automated tools. Providing analy-
ses created by different tools that address
the same task also enables extrinsic evalu-
ation of the tools through the evaluation of
their contributions to the event extraction
task. Such evaluation can improve under-
standing of the applicability and benefits
of specific tools and representations. The
supporting resources described in this pa-
per will continue to be publicly available
from the shared task homepage
