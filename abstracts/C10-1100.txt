We use web-scale N-grams in a base NP
parser that correctly analyzes 95.4% of the
base NPs in natural text. Web-scale data
improves performance. That is, there is no
data like more data. Performance scales
log-linearly with the number of parame-
ters in the model (the number of unique
N-grams). The web-scale N-grams are
particularly helpful in harder cases, such
as NPs that contain conjunctions.
