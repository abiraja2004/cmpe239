This paper introduces several extractive
approaches for automatic image tagging,
relying exclusively on information mined
from texts. Through evaluations on two
datasets, we show that our methods ex-
ceed competitive baselines by a large mar-
gin, and compare favorably with the state-
of-the-art that uses both textual and image
features.
