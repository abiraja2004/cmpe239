Representing documents by vectors that are
independent of language enhances machine
translation and multilingual text categoriza-
tion. We use discriminative training to create
a projection of documents from multiple lan-
guages into a single translingual vector space.
We explore two variants to create these pro-
jections: Oriented Principal Component Anal-
ysis (OPCA) and Coupled Probabilistic Latent
Semantic Analysis (CPLSA). Both of these
variants start with a basic model of docu-
ments (PCA and PLSA). Each model is then
made discriminative by encouraging compa-
rable document pairs to have similar vector
representations. We evaluate these algorithms
on two tasks: parallel document retrieval
for Wikipedia and Europarl documents, and
cross-lingual text classification on Reuters.
The two discriminative variants, OPCA and
CPLSA, significantly outperform their corre-
sponding baselines. The largest differences in
performance are observed on the task of re-
trieval when the documents are only compa-
rable and not parallel. The OPCA method is
shown to perform best.
