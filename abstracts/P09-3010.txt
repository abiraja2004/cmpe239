 
In this paper we describe the Rovereto Emotive 
Corpus (REC) which we collected to investigate 
the relationship between emotion and coopera-
tion in dialogue tasks. It is an area where still 
many unsolved questions are present. One of the 
main open issues is the annotation of the so-
called ?blended? emotions and their recognition. 
Usually, there is a low agreement among raters 
in annotating emotions and, surprisingly, emo-
tion recognition is higher in a condition of mod-
ality deprivation (i. e. only acoustic or only visu-
al modality vs. bimodal display of emotion). Be-
cause of these previous results, we collected a 
corpus in which ?emotive? tokens are pointed 
out during the recordings by psychophysiologi-
cal indexes (ElectroCardioGram, and Galvanic 
Skin Conductance). From the output values of 
these indexes a general recognition of each emo-
tion arousal is allowed. After this selection we 
will annotate emotive interactions with our mul-
timodal annotation scheme, performing a kappa 
statistic on annotation results to validate our 
coding scheme. In the near future, a logistic re-
gression on annotated data will be performed to 
find out correlations between cooperation and 
negative emotions. A final step will be an fMRI 
experiment on emotion recognition of blended 
emotions from face displays.
