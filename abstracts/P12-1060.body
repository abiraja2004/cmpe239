The amount of labeled sentiment data in En-
glish is much larger than that in other lan-
guages. Such a disproportion arouse interest
in cross-lingual sentiment classification, which
aims to conduct sentiment classification in the
target language (e.g. Chinese) using labeled
data in the source language (e.g. English).
Most existing work relies on machine trans-
lation engines to directly adapt labeled data
from the source language to the target lan-
guage. This approach suffers from the limited
coverage of vocabulary in the machine transla-
tion results. In this paper, we propose a gen-
erative cross-lingual mixture model (CLMM)
to leverage unlabeled bilingual parallel data.
By fitting parameters to maximize the likeli-
hood of the bilingual parallel data, the pro-
posed model learns previously unseen senti-
ment words from the large bilingual parallel
data and improves vocabulary coverage signifi-
cantly. Experiments on multiple data sets show
that CLMM is consistently effective in two set-
tings: (1) labeled data in the target language are
unavailable; and (2) labeled data in the target
language are also available.
