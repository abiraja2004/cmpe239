A key task in an extraction system for
query-oriented multi-document summari-
sation, necessary for computing relevance
and redundancy, is modelling text seman-
tics. In the Embra system, we use a repre-
sentation derived from the singular value
decomposition of a term co-occurrence
matrix. We present methods to show the
reliability of performance improvements.
We find that Embra performs better with
dimensionality reduction.
