 
The lack of Chinese sentiment corpora limits 
the research progress on Chinese sentiment 
classification. However, there are many freely 
available English sentiment corpora on the 
Web.  This paper focuses on the problem of 
cross-lingual sentiment classification, which 
leverages an available English corpus for Chi-
nese sentiment classification by using the Eng-
lish corpus as training data. Machine transla-
tion services are used for eliminating the lan-
guage gap between the training set and test set, 
and English features and Chinese features are 
considered as two independent views of the 
classification problem. We propose a co-
training approach to making use of unlabeled 
Chinese data.  Experimental results show the 
effectiveness of the proposed approach, which 
can outperform the standard inductive classifi-
ers and the transductive classifiers.
