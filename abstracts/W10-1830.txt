This paper describes a new kind of seman-
tic annotation in parallel treebanks. We
build French-German parallel treebanks of
mountaineering reports, a text genre that
abounds with geographical names which
we classify and ground with reference to
a large gazetteer of Swiss toponyms. We
discuss the challenges in obtaining a high
recall and precision in automatic ground-
ing, and sketch how we represent the
grounding information in our treebank.
