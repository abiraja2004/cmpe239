 
We introduce an alternative approach to ex-
tracting word pair associations from corpora, 
based purely on surface distances in the text. 
We contrast it with the prevailing window-
based co-occurrence model and show it to be 
more statistically robust and to disclose a 
broader selection of significant associative re-
lationships - owing largely to the property of 
scale-independence. In the process we provide 
insights into the limiting characteristics of 
window-based methods which complement the 
sometimes conflicting application-oriented lit-
erature in this area.
