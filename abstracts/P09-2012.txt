Tree substitution grammars (TSGs) of-
fer many advantages over context-free
grammars (CFGs), but are hard to learn.
Past approaches have resorted to heuris-
tics. In this paper, we learn a TSG us-
ing Gibbs sampling with a nonparamet-
ric prior to control subtree size. The
learned grammars perform significantly
better than heuristically extracted ones on
parsing accuracy.
