Requirements elicitation is  one of the first 
processes of software development and it is 
intended to be hand-made by means of ana-
lyst-stakeholder  interviews.  As  a  natural-
language-based activity, requirements elici-
tation can take advantages of Computational 
Linguistics  techniques,  in order to achieve 
better results looking for automation in this 
field.  In this paper we survey some of the 
work  related  to  software  development  au-
tomation, guided by Computational Linguis-
tics techniques, and performed by the Com-
putational  Language Research Group from 
the Universidad Nacional de Colombia. We 
aim  the  definition  of  future  trans-national 
effort to be made in this research line.
