This paper is about interpreting human com-
munication in meetings using audio, video and
other signals. Automatic meeting recognition
and understanding is extremely challenging,
since communication in a meeting is sponta-
neous and conversational, and involves mul-
tiple speakers and multiple modalities. This
leads to a number of significant research prob-
lems in signal processing, in speech recog-
nition, and in discourse interpretation, tak-
ing account of both individual and group be-
haviours. Addressing these problems requires
an interdisciplinary effort. In this paper, I
discuss the capture and annotation of multi-
modal meeting recordings?resulting in the
AMI meeting corpus?and how we have built
on this to develop techniques and applications
for the recognition and interpretation of meet-
ings.
