 
In this paper, we present findings from a hu-
man judgement task we conducted on the ef-
fectiveness of syntax filtering in a word com-
pletion task.  Human participants were asked 
to review a series of incomplete sentences and 
identify which words from accompanying lists 
extend the expressions in a grammatically ap-
propriate way.  The accompanying word lists 
were generated by two word completion sys-
tems (our own plus a third-party commercial 
system) where the ungrammatical items were 
filtered out.  Overall, participants agreed more, 
to a statistically significant degree, with the 
syntax-filtered systems than with baseline.  
However, further analysis suggests that syntax 
filtering alone does not necessarily improve 
the overall acceptability and usability of the 
word completion output.  Given that word 
completion is typically employed in applica-
tions to aid writing, unlike other NLP tasks, 
accounting for the role of writer vs. reader be-
comes critical.  Evaluating word completion 
and, more generally, applications for alterna-
tive and augmentative communication (AAC) 
will be discussed.
