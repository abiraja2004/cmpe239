As the web evolves, increasing quantities of
structured information is embedded in web
pages in disparate formats. For example, a
digital camera?s description may include its
price and megapixels whereas a professor?s
description may include her name, univer-
sity, and research interests. Both types of
pages may include additional ambiguous in-
formation. General search engines (GSEs)
do not support queries over these types of
data because they ignore the web document
semantics. Conversely, describing requi-
site semantics through structured queries into
databases populated by information extraction
(IE) techniques are expensive and not easily
adaptable to new domains. This paper de-
scribes a methodology for rapidly develop-
ing search engines capable of answering struc-
tured queries over unstructured corpora by uti-
lizing machine learning to avoid explicit IE.
We empirically show that with minimum ad-
ditional human effort, our system outperforms
a GSE with respect to structured queries with
clear object semantics.
