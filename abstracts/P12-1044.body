We present a novel approach for building
verb subcategorization lexicons using a simple
graphical model. In contrast to previous meth-
ods, we show how the model can be trained
without parsed input or a predefined subcate-
gorization frame inventory. Our method out-
performs the state-of-the-art on a verb clus-
tering task, and is easily trained on arbitrary
domains. This quantitative evaluation is com-
plemented by a qualitative discussion of verbs
and their frames. We discuss the advantages of
graphical models for this task, in particular the
ease of integrating semantic information about
verbs and arguments in a principled fashion.
We conclude with future work to augment the
approach.
