 
The problem we want to handle in this paper  
is vagueness. A notion of space, which we basi- 
cally have, plays an important part in the fac- 
ulty of thinking and speech. In this paper, we 
concentrate on a particular class of spatial de- 
scriptions, namely descriptions about positional 
relations on a two-dimensional space. A theo- 
retical device we present in this paper is called 
the potential model The potential model pro- 
vides a means for accumulating from fragmen- 
tary information. It is possible to derive max- 
imally plausible interpretation from a chunk of 
information accumulated in the model. When 
new information is given, the potential model 
is modefied so that that new information is 
taken into account. As a result, the interpre- 
tations with maximal plausibility may change. 
A program called SPRINT(SPatial Relation IN- 
Terpreter) reflecting our theory is in the way of 
construction.
