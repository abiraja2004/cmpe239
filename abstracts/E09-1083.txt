This paper presents the results of a series
of experiments which examine the impact
of two information status categories (given
and new) and frequency of occurrence on
pitch accent realisations. More specifi-
cally the experiments explore within-type
similarity of pitch accent productions and
the effect information status and frequency
of occurrence have on these productions.
The results indicate a significant influence
of both pitch accent type and information
status category on the degree of within-
type variability, in line with exemplar-
theoretic expectations.
