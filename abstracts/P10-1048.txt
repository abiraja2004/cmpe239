We present a novel approach to integrate
transliteration into Hindi-to-Urdu statisti-
cal machine translation. We propose two
probabilistic models, based on conditional
and joint probability formulations, that are
novel solutions to the problem. Our mod-
els consider both transliteration and trans-
lation when translating a particular Hindi
word given the context whereas in pre-
vious work transliteration is only used
for translating OOV (out-of-vocabulary)
words. We use transliteration as a tool
for disambiguation of Hindi homonyms
which can be both translated or translit-
erated or transliterated differently based
on different contexts. We obtain final
BLEU scores of 19.35 (conditional prob-
ability model) and 19.00 (joint probability
model) as compared to 14.30 for a base-
line phrase-based system and 16.25 for a
system which transliterates OOV words in
the baseline system. This indicates that
transliteration is useful for more than only
translating OOV words for language pairs
like Hindi-Urdu.
