 
This paper focuses on the exploration of 
term dependence in the application of 
sentence retrieval. The adjacent terms ap-
pearing in query are assumed to be related 
with each other. These assumed depend-
ences among query terms will be further 
validated for each sentence and sentences, 
which present strong syntactic relation-
ship among query terms, are considered 
more relevant. Experimental results have 
fully demonstrated the promising of the 
proposed models in improving sentence 
retrieval effectiveness.
