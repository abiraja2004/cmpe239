We present the results of the Joint Student
Response Analysis and 8th Recognizing Tex-
tual Entailment Challenge, aiming to bring to-
gether researchers in educational NLP tech-
nology and textual entailment. The task of
giving feedback on student answers requires
semantic inference and therefore is related to
recognizing textual entailment. Thus, we of-
fered to the community a 5-way student re-
sponse labeling task, as well as 3-way and 2-
way RTE-style tasks on educational data. In
addition, a partial entailment task was piloted.
We present and compare results from 9 partic-
ipating teams, and discuss future directions.
