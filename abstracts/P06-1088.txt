With performance above 97% accuracy for
newspaper text, part of speech (POS) tag-
ging might be considered a solved prob-
lem. Previous studies have shown that
allowing the parser to resolve POS tag
ambiguity does not improve performance.
However, for grammar formalisms which
use more fine-grained grammatical cate-
gories, for example TAG and CCG, tagging
accuracy is much lower. In fact, for these
formalisms, premature ambiguity resolu-
tion makes parsing infeasible.
We describe a multi-tagging approach
which maintains a suitable level of lexical
category ambiguity for accurate and effi-
cient CCG parsing. We extend this multi-
tagging approach to the POS level to over-
come errors introduced by automatically
assigned POS tags. Although POS tagging
accuracy seems high, maintaining some
POS tag ambiguity in the language pro-
cessing pipeline results in more accurate
CCG supertagging.
