In this paper, we propose an approach 
for identifying curatable articles from a 
large document set.  This system 
considers three parts of an article (title 
and abstract, MeSH terms, and captions) 
as its three individual representations 
and utilizes two domain-specific 
resources (UMLS and a tumor name list) 
to reveal the deep knowledge contained 
in the article.  An SVM classifier is 
trained and cross-validation is employed 
to find the best combination of 
representations.  The experimental 
results show overall high performance.
