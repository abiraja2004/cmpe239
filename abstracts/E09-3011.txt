In this paper we compare different ap-
proaches to extract definitions of four
types using a combination of a rule-based
grammar and machine learning. We col-
lected a Dutch text corpus containing 549
definitions and applied a grammar on it.
Machine learning was then applied to im-
prove the results obtained with the gram-
mar. Two machine learning experiments
were carried out. In the first experi-
ment, a standard classifier and a classi-
fier designed specifically to deal with im-
balanced datasets are compared. The al-
gorithm designed specifically to deal with
imbalanced datasets for most types outper-
forms the standard classifier. In the second
experiment we show that classification re-
sults improve when information on defini-
tion structure is included.
