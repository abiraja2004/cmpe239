We show that informative lexical cate-
gories from a strongly lexicalised for-
malism such as Combinatory Categorial
Grammar (CCG) can improve dependency
parsing of Hindi, a free word order lan-
guage. We first describe a novel way to
obtain a CCG lexicon and treebank from
an existing dependency treebank, using a
CCG parser. We use the output of a su-
pertagger trained on the CCGbank as a
feature for a state-of-the-art Hindi depen-
dency parser (Malt). Our results show that
using CCG categories improves the accu-
racy of Malt on long distance dependen-
cies, for which it is known to have weak
rates of recovery.
