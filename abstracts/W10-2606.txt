 We compare self-training with and with-out reranking for parser domain adapta-tion, and examine the impact of syntactic parser adaptation on a semantic role la-beling system.  Although self-training without reranking has been found not to improve in-domain accuracy for parsers trained on the WSJ Penn Treebank, we show that it is surprisingly effective for parser domain adaptation.  We also show that simple self-training of a syntactic parser improves out-of-domain accuracy of a semantic role labeler. 1
