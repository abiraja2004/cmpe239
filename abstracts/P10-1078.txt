This paper presents a framework for au-
tomatically processing information com-
ing from community Question Answering
(cQA) portals with the purpose of gen-
erating a trustful, complete, relevant and
succinct summary in response to a ques-
tion. We exploit the metadata intrinsically
present in User Generated Content (UGC)
to bias automatic multi-document summa-
rization techniques toward high quality in-
formation. We adopt a representation of
concepts alternative to n-grams and pro-
pose two concept-scoring functions based
on semantic overlap. Experimental re-
sults on data drawn from Yahoo! An-
swers demonstrate the effectiveness of our
method in terms of ROUGE scores. We
show that the information contained in the
best answers voted by users of cQA por-
tals can be successfully complemented by
our method.
