Emerging text-intensive enterprise applica-
tions such as social analytics and semantic
search pose new challenges of scalability and
usability to Information Extraction (IE) sys-
tems. This paper presents SystemT, a declar-
ative IE system that addresses these challenges
and has been deployed in a wide range of en-
terprise applications. SystemT facilitates the
development of high quality complex annota-
tors by providing a highly expressive language
and an advanced development environment.
It also includes a cost-based optimizer and a
high-performance, flexible runtime with mini-
mummemory footprint. We present SystemT
as a useful resource that is freely available,
and as an opportunity to promote research in
building scalable and usable IE systems.
