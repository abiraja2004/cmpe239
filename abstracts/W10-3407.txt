 
This paper presents a cross-linguistic 
analysis of the largest dictionaries cur-
rently existing for Romanian, French, and 
German, and a new, robust and portable 
method for Dictionary Entry Parsing 
(DEP), based on Segmentation-
Cohesion-Dependency (SCD) configura-
tions. The SCD configurations are ap-
plied successively on each dictionary en-
try to identify its lexicographic segments 
(the first SCD configuration), to extract 
its sense tree (the second configuration), 
and to parse its atomic sense definitions 
(the third one). Using previous results on 
DLR (The Romanian Thesaurus ? new 
format), the present paper adapts and ap-
plies the SCD-based technology to other 
four large and complex thesauri: DAR 
(The Romanian Thesaurus ? old format), 
TLF (Le Tr?sor de la Langue Fran?aise), 
DWB (Deutsches W?rterbuch ? 
GRIMM), and GWB (G?the-
W?rterbuch). This experiment is illu-
strated on significantly large parsed en-
tries of these thesauri, and proved the fol-
lowing features: (1) the SCD-based me-
thod is a completely formal grammar-
free approach for dictionary parsing, with 
efficient (weeks-time adaptable) model-
ing through sense hierarchies and parsing 
portability for a new dictionary. (2) SCD-
configurations separate and run sequen-
tially and independently the processes of 
lexicographic segment recognition, sense 
tree extraction, and atomic definition  
 
parsing. (3) The whole DEP process with 
SCD-configurations is optimal. (4) SCD-
configurations, through sense marker 
classes and their dependency hyper-
graphs, offer an unique instrument of lex-
icon construction comparison, sense con-
cept design and DEP standardization.
