Contextual Binary Feature Grammars
were recently proposed by (Clark et al,
2008) as a learnable representation for
richly structured context-free and con-
text sensitive languages. In this pa-
per we examine the representational
power of the formalism, its relationship
to other standard formalisms and lan-
guage classes, and its appropriateness
for modelling natural language.
