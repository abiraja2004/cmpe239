Semantic role labeling (SRL) methods
typically use features from syntactic parse
trees. We propose a novel method that
uses Lexicalized Tree-Adjoining Gram-
mar (LTAG) based features for this task.
We convert parse trees into LTAG deriva-
tion trees where the semantic roles are
treated as hidden information learned by
supervised learning on annotated data de-
rived from PropBank. We extracted var-
ious features from the LTAG derivation
trees and trained a discriminative decision
list model to predict semantic roles. We
present our results on the full CoNLL 2005
SRL task.
