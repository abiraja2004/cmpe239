We improve the quality of statistical machine
translation (SMT) by applying models that
predict word forms from their stems using
extensive morphological and syntactic infor-
mation from both the source and target lan-
guages. Our inflection generation models are
trained independently of the SMT system. We
investigate different ways of combining the in-
flection prediction component with the SMT
system by training the base MT system on
fully inflected forms or on word stems. We
applied our inflection generation models in
translating English into two morphologically
complex languages, Russian and Arabic, and
show that our model improves the quality of
SMT over both phrasal and syntax-based SMT
systems according to BLEU and human judge-
ments.
