Abstract
Colour is a key component in the success-
ful dissemination of information. Since
many real-world concepts are associated with
colour, for example danger with red, linguistic
information is often complemented with the
use of appropriate colours in information vi-
sualization and product marketing. Yet, there
is no comprehensive resource that captures
concept?colour associations. We present a
method to create a large word?colour asso-
ciation lexicon by crowdsourcing. A word-
choice question was used to obtain sense-level
annotations and to ensure data quality. We fo-
cus especially on abstract concepts and emo-
tions to show that even they tend to have
strong colour associations. Thus, using the
right colours can not only improve semantic
coherence, but also inspire the desired emo-
tional response.
