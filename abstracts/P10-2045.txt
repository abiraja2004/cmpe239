Many NLP tasks need accurate knowl-
edge for semantic inference. To this end,
mostly WordNet is utilized. Yet Word-
Net is limited, especially for inference be-
tween predicates. To help filling this gap,
we present an algorithm that generates
inference rules between predicates from
FrameNet. Our experiment shows that the
novel resource is effective and comple-
ments WordNet in terms of rule coverage.
