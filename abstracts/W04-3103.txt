We explore the use of speculative lan-
guage in MEDLINE abstracts. Results
from a manual annotation experiment sug-
gest that the notion of speculative sentence
can be reliably annotated by humans. In
addition, an experiment with automated
methods also suggest that reliable auto-
mated methods might also be developed.
Distributional observations are also pre-
sented as well as a discussion of possible
uses for a system that can recognize spec-
ulative language.
