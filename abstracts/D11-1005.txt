We describe a method for prediction of lin-
guistic structure in a language for which only
unlabeled data is available, using annotated
data from a set of one or more helper lan-
guages. Our approach is based on a model
that locally mixes between supervised mod-
els from the helper languages. Parallel data
is not used, allowing the technique to be ap-
plied even in domains where human-translated
texts are unavailable. We obtain state-of-the-
art performance for two tasks of structure pre-
diction: unsupervised part-of-speech tagging
and unsupervised dependency parsing.
