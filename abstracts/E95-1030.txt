 
The pattern matching capabilities of 
neural networks can be used to loc- 
ate syntactic onstituents of natural an- 
guage. This paper describes a fully auto- 
mated hybrid system, using neural nets 
operating within a grammatic frame- 
work. It addresses the representation 
of language for connectionist processing, 
and describes methods of constraining 
the problem size. The function of the 
network is briefly explained, and results 
are given.
