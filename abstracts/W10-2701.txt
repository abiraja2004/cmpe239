We present an episodic memory compo-
nent for enhancing the dialogue of artifi-
cial companions with the capability to re-
fer to, take up and comment on past in-
teractions with the user, and to take into
account in the dialogue long-term user
preferences and interests. The proposed
episodic memory is based on RDF repre-
sentations of the agent?s experiences and
is linked to the agent?s semantic memory
containing the agent?s knowledge base of
ontological data and information about the
user?s interests.
