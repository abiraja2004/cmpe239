In the paper we discuss the problem of low
recall for the named entity (NE) recogni-
tion task for Polish. We discuss to what
extent the recall of NE recognition can be
improved by reducing the space of NE cat-
egories. We also present several exten-
sions to the binary model which give an
improvement of the recall. The extensions
include: new features, application of ex-
ternal knowledge and post-processing. For
the partial evaluation the final model ob-
tained 90.02% recall with 91.30% preci-
sion on the corpus of economic news.
