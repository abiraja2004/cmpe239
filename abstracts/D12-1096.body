Constituency parser performance is primarily
interpreted through a single metric, F-score
on WSJ section 23, that conveys no linguis-
tic information regarding the remaining errors.
We classify errors within a set of linguisti-
cally meaningful types using tree transforma-
tions that repair groups of errors together. We
use this analysis to answer a range of ques-
tions about parser behaviour, including what
linguistic constructions are difficult for state-
of-the-art parsers, what types of errors are be-
ing resolved by rerankers, and what types are
introduced when parsing out-of-domain text.
