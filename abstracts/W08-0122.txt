This work proposes opinion frames as a repre-
sentation of discourse-level associations that
arise from related opinion targets and which
are common in task-oriented meeting dialogs.
We define the opinion frames and explain their
interpretation. Additionally we present an
annotation scheme that realizes the opinion
frames and via human annotation studies, we
show that these can be reliably identified.
