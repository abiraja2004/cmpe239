 
As the proposition of the next-generation 
Web ? semantic Web, semantic computing 
has been drawing more and more attention 
within the circle and the industries. A lot of 
research has been conducted on the theory 
and methodology of the subject, and 
potential applications have also been 
investigated and proposed in many fields. 
The progress of semantic computing made 
so far cannot be detached from its 
supporting pivot ? language resources, for 
instance, language knowledge bases. This 
paper proposes three perspectives of 
semantic computing from a macro view and 
describes the current status of affairs about 
the construction of language knowledge 
bases and the related research and 
applications that have been carried out on 
the basis of these resources via a case study 
in the Institute of Computational Linguistics 
at Peking University.
