for preservation of endangered languages and 
making data available to speakers and 
researchers of a language. A data base such as 
TypeCraft is important for typology studies both 
for well documented languages as well as little 
documented languages and is a valid tool for 
comparison of languages.  This requires that 
linguistic elements must be coded in a manner 
that allows comparability across widely varying 
language data. In this paper, I discuss how I 
have used the coding system in TypeCraft for 
the documentation of data from ? ?d? language, a 
language belonging to the Edoid group of the 
Benue-Congo subfamily of the Volta-Congo 
language family and spoken in Mid-Western 
Nigeria, West Africa. The study shows how 
syntactic, semantic and morphological 
properties of multi-verb constructions in ? ?d? 
(Benue-Congo) can be represented in a 
relational database.
