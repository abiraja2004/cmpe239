 
Table is a very common presentation scheme, 
but few papers touch on table extraction in text 
data mining. This paper l'ocuscs on mining 
tables from large-scale HTML texts. Table 
filtering, recognition, interpretation, and 
presentation arc discussed. Heuristic rules and 
cell similarities arc employed to identify tables. 
The F-measure ot' table recognition is 86.50%. 
We also propose an algorithm to capture 
attribute-value r lationships alnong table cells. 
Finally, more structured ata is extracted and 
presented.
