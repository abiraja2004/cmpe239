We describe the CMU-UKA Syntax Augmented
Machine Translation system ?SAMT? used for the
shared task ?Machine Translation for European Lan-
guages? at the ACL 2007 Workshop on Statistical
Machine Translation. Following an overview of syn-
tax augmented machine translation, we describe pa-
rameters for components in our open-source SAMT
toolkit that were used to generate translation results
for the Spanish to English in-domain track of the
shared task and discuss relative performance against
our phrase-based submission.
