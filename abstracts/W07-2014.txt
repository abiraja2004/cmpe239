The TempEval task proposes a simple way
to evaluate automatic extraction of temporal
relations. It avoids the pitfalls of evaluat-
ing a graph of inter-related labels by defin-
ing three sub tasks that allow pairwise eval-
uation of temporal relations. The task not
only allows straightforward evaluation, it
also avoids the complexities of full tempo-
ral parsing.
