Recent work on statistical quantifier scope
disambiguation (QSD) has improved upon
earlier work by scoping an arbitrary num-
ber and type of noun phrases. No corpus-
based method, however, has yet addressed
QSD when incorporating the implicit uni-
versal of plurals and/or operators such as
negation. In this paper we report early,
though promising, results for automatic
QSD when handling both phenomena. We
also present a general model for learning
to build partial orders from a set of pair-
wise preferences. We give an n log n algo-
rithm for finding a guaranteed approxima-
tion of the optimal solution, which works
very well in practice. Finally, we signifi-
cantly improve the performance of the pre-
vious model using a rich set of automati-
cally generated features.
