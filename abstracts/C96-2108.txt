 
The verb subcategorization frame information 
plays a major role of disambiguations in many 
NLP applications. Japanese, however, imposes 
difficulties of subcategorizing in part because it 
allows arbitrary ellipses of case elements. We 
propose a new type of verb subcategorization 
frame code set that combines the verb's surface 
case set and the deep case set, as a solution to the 
difficulties of empirical researches on Japanese. 
The lexicon developed by this design has 
comprehensive information on the correspond- 
ences between the surface case frame and the 
deep case frame, and yet restrains the potential 
combinatorial explosion of the number of verb 
subcategorization frames by carefully identifying 
superficially different frames with an idea of 
alternative case markers and semantic roles, and 
by introducing the notion of surface case frame 
permutations. The number of different surface/ 
deep case mapping types is 250, after we 
completed the new subcategorization frame code 
development for 30,000 verbs and adjectives.
