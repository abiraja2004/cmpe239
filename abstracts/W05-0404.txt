In this paper, we introduce a new data
representation format for language pro-
cessing, the syntactic and semantic graphs
(SSGs), and show its use for call classifi-
cation in spoken dialog systems. For each
sentence or utterance, these graphs in-
clude lexical information (words), syntac-
tic information (such as the part of speech
tags of the words and the syntactic parse of
the utterance), and semantic information
(such as the named entities and seman-
tic role labels). In our experiments, we
used written language as the training data
while computing SSGs and tested on spo-
ken language. In spite of this mismatch,
we have shown that this is a very promis-
ing approach for classifying complex ex-
amples, and by using SSGs it is possible
to reduce the call classification error rate
by 4.74% relative.
