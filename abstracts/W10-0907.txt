Open Information Extraction is a recent
paradigm for machine reading from arbitrary
text. In contrast to existing techniques, which
have used only shallow syntactic features, we
investigate the use of semantic features (se-
mantic roles) for the task of Open IE. We com-
pare TEXTRUNNER (Banko et al, 2007), a
state of the art open extractor, with our novel
extractor SRL-IE, which is based on UIUC?s
SRL system (Punyakanok et al, 2008). We
find that SRL-IE is robust to noisy heteroge-
neous Web data and outperforms TEXTRUN-
NER on extraction quality. On the other
hand, TEXTRUNNER performs over 2 orders
of magnitude faster and achieves good pre-
cision in high locality and high redundancy
extractions. These observations enable the
construction of hybrid extractors that output
higher quality results than TEXTRUNNER and
similar quality as SRL-IE in much less time.
