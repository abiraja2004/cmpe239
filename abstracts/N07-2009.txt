Abstract
We introduce a novel framework for the
expression, rapid-prototyping, and eval-
uation of statistical machine-translation
(MT) systems using graphical mod-
els. The framework extends dynamic
Bayesian networks with multiple con-
nected different-length streams, switching
variable existence and dependence mech-
anisms, and constraint factors. We have
implemented a new general-purpose MT
training/decoding system in this frame-
work, and have tested this on a variety of
existing MT models (including the 4 IBM
models), and some novel ones as well,
all using Europarl as a test corpus. We
describe the semantics of our representa-
tion, and present preliminary evaluations,
showing that it is possible to prototype
novel MT ideas in a short amount of time.
