This paper presents an implemented hy-
brid approach to grammar and style
checking, combining an industrial pattern-
based grammar and style checker with bi-
directional, large-scale HPSG grammars
for German and English. Under this ap-
proach, deep processing is applied selec-
tively based on the error hypotheses of a
shallow system. We have conducted a com-
parative evaluation of the two components,
supporting an integration scenario where
the shallow system is best used for error de-
tection, whereas the HPSG grammars add
error correction for both grammar and con-
trolled language style errors.
