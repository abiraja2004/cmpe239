One of the key issues in spoken language trans-
lation is how to deal with unrestricted expres-
sions in spontaneous utterances. This research
is centered on the development of a Chinese
paraphraser that automatically paraphrases ut-
terances prior to transfer in Chinese-Japanese
spoken language translation. In this paper, a
pattern-based approach to paraphrasing is pro-
posed for which only morphological analysis is
required. In addition, a pattern construction
method is described through which paraphras-
ing patterns can be efficiently learned from a
paraphrase corpus and human experience. Us-
ing the implemented paraphraser and the ob-
tained patterns, a paraphrasing experiment was
conducted and the results were evaluated.
