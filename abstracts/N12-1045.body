In this paper we present a fully unsupervised
nonparametric Bayesian model that jointly in-
duces POS tags and morphological segmen-
tations. The model is essentially an infi-
nite HMM that infers the number of states
from data. Incorporating segmentation into
the same model provides the morphological
features to the system and eliminates the need
to find them during preprocessing step. We
show that learning both tasks jointly actually
leads to better results than learning either task
with gold standard data from the other task
provided. The evaluation on multilingual data
shows that the model produces state-of-the-art
results on POS induction.
