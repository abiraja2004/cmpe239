This paper describes the SyntaLex entries in
the English Lexical Sample Task of SENSEVAL-3.
There are four entries in all, where each of the dif-
ferent entries corresponds to use of word bigrams
or Part of Speech tags as features. The systems rely
on bagged decision trees, and focus on using pairs
of lexical and syntactic features individually and in
combination. They are descendants of the Duluth
systems that participated in SENSEVAL-2.
