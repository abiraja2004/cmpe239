 
In this paper we present a novel feature-
enriched approach that learns to detect the 
conversation focus of threaded discus-
sions by combining NLP analysis and IR 
techniques. Using the graph-based algo-
rithm HITS, we integrate different fea-
tures such as lexical similarity, poster 
trustworthiness, and speech act analysis of 
human conversations with feature-
oriented link generation functions. It is 
the first quantitative study to analyze hu-
man conversation focus in the context of 
online discussions that takes into account 
heterogeneous sources of evidence. Ex-
perimental results using a threaded dis-
cussion corpus from an undergraduate 
class show that it achieves significant per-
formance improvements compared with 
the baseline system.
