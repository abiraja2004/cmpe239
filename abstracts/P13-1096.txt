During real-life interactions, people are
naturally gesturing and modulating their
voice to emphasize specific points or to
express their emotions. With the recent
growth of social websites such as YouTube,
Facebook, and Amazon, video reviews are
emerging as a new source of multimodal
and natural opinions that has been left al-
most untapped by automatic opinion anal-
ysis techniques. This paper presents a
method for multimodal sentiment classi-
fication, which can identify the sentiment
expressed in utterance-level visual datas-
treams. Using a new multimodal dataset
consisting of sentiment annotated utter-
ances extracted from video reviews, we
show that multimodal sentiment analysis
can be effectively performed, and that the
joint use of visual, acoustic, and linguistic
modalities can lead to error rate reductions
of up to 10.5% as compared to the best
performing individual modality.
