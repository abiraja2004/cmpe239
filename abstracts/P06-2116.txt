We present an elegant and extensible
model that is capable of providing seman-
tic interpretations for an unusually wide
range of textual tables in documents. Un-
like the few existing table analysis mod-
els, which largely rely on relatively ad hoc
heuristics, our linguistically-oriented ap-
proach is systematic and grammar based,
which allows our model (1) to be concise
and yet (2) recognize a wider range of data
models than others, and (3) disambiguate
to a significantly finer extent the under-
lying semantic interpretation of the table
in terms of data models drawn from rela-
tion database theory. To accomplish this,
the model introduces Viterbi parsing under
two-dimensional stochastic CFGs. The
cleaner grammatical approach facilitates
not only greater coverage, but also gram-
mar extension and maintenance, as well as
a more direct and declarative link to se-
mantic interpretation, for which we also
introduce a new, cleaner data model. In
disambiguation experiments on recogniz-
ing relevant data models of unseen web ta-
bles from different domains, a blind evalu-
ation of the model showed 60% precision
and 80% recall.
