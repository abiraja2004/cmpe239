 
A new, flexible inference method for Horn logic pro- 
gram is proposed. It is also a drastic gencndization of 
chart I)aming, partial instaatiation of clauses in a pro- 
gram ronghly corresponding to arcs in a chart. Chart- 
like i)al~ing and semantic-head-driven g eration emerge 
from this method. With a parsimonious instantiation 
scheme for ambiguity packing, the parsing eoml)lexity 
reduces to that of standard chart-based algorithms.
