We present an approach to statistical
machine translation that combines ideas
from phrase-based SMT and traditional
grammar-based MT. Our system incor-
porates the concept of multi-word trans-
lation units into transfer of dependency
structure snippets, and models and trains
statistical components according to state-
of-the-art SMT systems. Compliant with
classical transfer-based MT, target depen-
dency structure snippets are input to a
grammar-based generator. An experimen-
tal evaluation shows that the incorpora-
tion of a grammar-based generator into an
SMT framework provides improved gram-
maticality while achieving state-of-the-art
quality on in-coverage examples, suggest-
ing a possible hybrid framework.
