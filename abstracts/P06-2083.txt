We present a term recognition approach
to extract acronyms and their definitions
from a large text collection. Parentheti-
cal expressions appearing in a text collec-
tion are identified as potential acronyms.
Assuming terms appearing frequently in
the proximity of an acronym to be
the expanded forms (definitions) of the
acronyms, we apply a term recognition
method to enumerate such candidates and
to measure the likelihood scores of the
expanded forms. Based on the list of
the expanded forms and their likelihood
scores, the proposed algorithm determines
the final acronym-definition pairs. The
proposed method combined with a letter
matching algorithm achieved 78% preci-
sion and 85% recall on an evaluation cor-
pus with 4,212 acronym-definition pairs.
