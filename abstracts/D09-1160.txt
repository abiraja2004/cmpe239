This paper proposes a method that speeds
up a classifier trained with many con-
junctive features: combinations of (prim-
itive) features. The key idea is to pre-
compute as partial results the weights of
primitive feature vectors that appear fre-
quently in the target NLP task. A trie
compactly stores the primitive feature vec-
tors with their weights, and it enables the
classifier to find for a given feature vec-
tor its longest prefix feature vector whose
weight has already been computed. Ex-
perimental results for a Japanese depen-
dency parsing task show that our method
speeded up the SVM and LLM classifiers
of the parsers, which achieved accuracy of
90.84/90.71%, by a factor of 10.7/11.6.
