Chinese Pinyin input method is very impor-
tant for Chinese language information pro-
cessing. Users may make errors when they
are typing in Chinese words. In this paper, we
are concerned with the reasons that cause the
errors. Inspired by the observation that press-
ing backspace is one of the most common us-
er behaviors to modify the errors, we collect
54, 309, 334 error-correction pairs from a real-
world data set that contains 2, 277, 786 user-
s via backspace operations. In addition, we
present a comparative analysis of the data to
achieve a better understanding of users? input
behaviors. Comparisons with English typos
suggest that some language-specific properties
result in a part of Chinese input errors.
