 
A semi-automatic procedure of linguistic 
knowledge acquisition is proposed, which 
combines corpus-based techniques with the 
conventional rule-based approach. The 
rule-based component generates all the pos- 
sible hypotheses of defects which the ex- 
isting linguistic knowledge might contain, 
when it fails to parse a sentence. The 
rule-based component does not try to iden- 
tify the defects, but generates a set of hy- 
potheses and the corpus-based component 
chooses the plausible ones among them. 
The procedure will be used for adapting or 
re-using existing linguistic resources for new 
application domains.
