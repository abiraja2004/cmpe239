This paper proposes a new approach to
domain adaptation in statistical machine
translation (SMT) based on a vector space
model (VSM). The general idea is first to
create a vector profile for the in-domain
development (?dev?) set. This profile
might, for instance, be a vector with a di-
mensionality equal to the number of train-
ing subcorpora; each entry in the vector re-
flects the contribution of a particular sub-
corpus to all the phrase pairs that can be
extracted from the dev set. Then, for
each phrase pair extracted from the train-
ing data, we create a vector with features
defined in the same way, and calculate its
similarity score with the vector represent-
ing the dev set. Thus, we obtain a de-
coding feature whose value represents the
phrase pair?s closeness to the dev. This is
a simple, computationally cheap form of
instance weighting for phrase pairs. Ex-
periments on large scale NIST evaluation
data show improvements over strong base-
lines: +1.8 BLEU on Arabic to English
and +1.4 BLEU on Chinese to English
over a non-adapted baseline, and signifi-
cant improvements in most circumstances
over baselines with linear mixture model
adaptation. An informal analysis suggests
that VSM adaptation may help in making
a good choice among words with the same
meaning, on the basis of style and genre.
