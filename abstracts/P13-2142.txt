Determining the stance expressed by an
author from a post written for a two-
sided debate in an online debate forum
is a relatively new problem. We seek to
improve Anand et al?s (2011) approach
to debate stance classification by model-
ing two types of soft extra-linguistic con-
straints on the stance labels of debate
posts, user-interaction constraints and ide-
ology constraints. Experimental results on
four datasets demonstrate the effectiveness
of these inter-post constraints in improv-
ing debate stance classification.
