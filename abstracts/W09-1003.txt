This paper presents a model-based ap-
proach to dialogue management that is
guided by data-driven dialogue act predic-
tion. The statistical prediction is based on
stochastic context-free grammars that have
been obtained by means of grammatical
inference. The prediction performance of
the method compares favourably to that of
a heuristic baseline and to that of n-gram
language models.
The act prediction is explored both for
dialogue acts without realised semantic
content (consisting only of communicative
functions) and for dialogue acts with re-
alised semantic content.
