 
This paper presents the strategy and design 
of a highly efficient semiautomatic method for 
labelling the semantic features of common 
nouns, using semantic relationships between 
words, and based on the information extracted 
from an electronic monolingual dictionary. The 
method, that uses genus data, specific relators 
and synonymy information, obtains an accuracy 
of over 99% and a scope of 68,2% with regard to 
all the common nouns contained in a real corpus 
of over 1 million words, after the manual 
labelling of only 100 nouns.
