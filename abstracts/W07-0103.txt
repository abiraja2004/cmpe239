In this paper we propose algorithms
to automatically classify sentences into
metaphoric or normal usages. Our algo-
rithms only need the WordNet and bigram
counts, and does not require training. We
present empirical results on a test set de-
rived from the Master Metaphor List. We
also discuss issues that make classification
of metaphors a tough problem in general.
