This paper describes the French-English trans-
lation system developed by the Avenue re-
search group at Carnegie Mellon University
for the Seventh Workshop on Statistical Ma-
chine Translation (NAACL WMT12). We
present a method for training data selection,
a description of our hierarchical phrase-based
translation system, and a discussion of the im-
pact of data size on best practice for system
building.
