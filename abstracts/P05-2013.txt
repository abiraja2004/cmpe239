This paper presents the results of auto-
matically inducing a Combinatory Cate-
gorial Grammar (CCG) lexicon from a
Turkish dependency treebank. The fact
that Turkish is an agglutinating free word-
order language presents a challenge for
language theories. We explored possible
ways to obtain a compact lexicon, consis-
tent with CCG principles, from a treebank
which is an order of magnitude smaller
than Penn WSJ.
