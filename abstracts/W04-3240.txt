 
It is often useful to classify email accord-
ing to the intent of the sender (e.g., "pro-
pose a meeting", "deliver information"). 
We present experimental results in learn-
ing to classify email in this fashion, 
where each class corresponds to a verb-
noun pair taken from a predefined ontol-
ogy describing typical ?email speech 
acts?.   We demonstrate that, although 
this categorization problem is quite dif-
ferent from ?topical? text classification, 
certain categories of messages can none-
theless be detected with high precision 
(above 80%) and reasonable recall (above 
50%) using existing text-classification 
learning methods. This result suggests 
that useful task-tracking tools could be 
constructed based on automatic classifi-
cation into this taxonomy.
