This paper describes a distributional ap-
proach to the semantics of verb-particle
constructions (e.g. put up, make off ). We
report first on a framework for implement-
ing and evaluating such models. We then go
on to report on the implementation of some
techniques for using statistical models ac-
quired from corpus data to infer the mean-
ing of verb-particle constructions.
