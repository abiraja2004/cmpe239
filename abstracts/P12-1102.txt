The problem addressed in this paper is to seg-
ment a given multilingual document into seg-
ments for each language and then identify the
language of each segment. The problem was
motivated by an attempt to collect a large
amount of linguistic data for non-major lan-
guages from the web. The problem is formu-
lated in terms of obtaining the minimum de-
scription length of a text, and the proposed so-
lution finds the segments and their languages
through dynamic programming. Empirical re-
sults demonstrating the potential of this ap-
proach are presented for experiments using
texts taken from the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights and Wikipedia, covering more
than 200 languages.
