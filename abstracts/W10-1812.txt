We present an annotation scheme for the
annotation of complex predicates, under-
stood as constructions with more than one
lexical unit, each contributing part of the
information normally associated with a
single predicate. We discuss our anno-
tation guidelines of four types of com-
plex predicates, and the treatment of sev-
eral difficult cases, related to ambiguity,
overlap and coordination. We then discuss
the process of marking up the Portuguese
CINTIL corpus of 1M tokens (written and
spoken) with a new layer of information
regarding complex predicates. We also
present the outcomes of the annotation
work and statistics on the types of CPs that
we found in the corpus.
