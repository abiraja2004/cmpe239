syllables in a word or number of words in a 
phrase), or rhythm, plays an important role 
in Chinese syntax. This paper systematically 
surveys the distribution of rhythm in 
constructions in Chinese from the statistical 
data acquired from a shallow tree bank. 
Based on our survey, we then used the 
rhythm feature in a practical shallow parsing 
task by using rhythm as a statistical feature 
to augment a PCFG model. Our results show 
that using the probabilistic rhythm feature 
significantly improves the performance of 
our shallow parser.
