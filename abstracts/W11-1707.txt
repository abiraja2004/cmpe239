 
Sentiment analysis is one of the recent, 
highly dynamic fields in Natural Language 
Processing. Most existing approaches are 
based on word-level analysis of texts and 
are able to detect only explicit expressions 
of sentiment.  In this paper, we present an 
approach towards automatically detecting 
emotions (as underlying components of 
sentiment) from contexts in which no clues 
of sentiment appear, based on 
commonsense knowledge. The resource we 
built towards this aim ? EmotiNet - is a 
knowledge base of concepts with 
associated affective value. Preliminary 
evaluations show that this approach is 
appropriate for the task of implicit emotion 
detection, thus improving the performance 
of sentiment detection and classification in 
text.
