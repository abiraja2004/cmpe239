We describe the Argument Selection and
Coercion task for the SemEval-2010 eval-
uation exercise. This task involves char-
acterizing the type of compositional oper-
ation that exists between a predicate and
the arguments it selects. Specifically, the
goal is to identify whether the type that
a verb selects is satisfied directly by the
argument, or whether the argument must
change type to satisfy the verb typing. We
discuss the problem in detail, describe the
data preparation for the task, and analyze
the results of the submissions.
