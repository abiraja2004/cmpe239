We present BAYESUM (for ?Bayesian
summarization?), a model for sentence ex-
traction in query-focused summarization.
BAYESUM leverages the common case in
which multiple documents are relevant to a
single query. Using these documents as re-
inforcement for query terms, BAYESUM is
not afflicted by the paucity of information
in short queries. We show that approxi-
mate inference in BAYESUM is possible
on large data sets and results in a state-
of-the-art summarization system. Further-
more, we show how BAYESUM can be
understood as a justified query expansion
technique in the language modeling for IR
framework.
