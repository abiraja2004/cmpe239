Survival analysis is often used in medical and
biological studies to examine the time until
some specified event occurs, such as the time
until death of terminally ill patients. In this
paper, however, we apply survival analysis to
eye movement data in order to model the sur-
vival function of fixation time distributions in
reading. Semiparametric regression modeling
and novel evaluation methods for probabilis-
tic models of eye movements are presented.
Survival models adjusting for the influence of
linguistic and cognitive effects are shown to
reduce prediction error within a critical time
period, roughly between 150 and 250 ms fol-
lowing fixation onset.
