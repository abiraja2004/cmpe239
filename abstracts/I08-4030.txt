 
This paper presents systems submitted to 
the close track of Fourth SIGHAN Bakeoff. 
We built up three systems based on Condi-
tional Random Field for Chinese Word 
Segmentation, Named Entity Recognition 
and Part-Of-Speech Tagging respectively. 
Our systems employed basic features as 
well as a large number of linguistic features. 
For segmentation task, we adjusted the BIO 
tags according to confidence of each char-
acter. Our final system achieve a F-score of 
94.18 at CTB, 92.86 at NCC, 94.59 at SXU 
on Segmentation, 85.26 at MSRA on 
Named Entity Recognition, and 90.65 at 
PKU on Part-Of-Speech Tagging.
