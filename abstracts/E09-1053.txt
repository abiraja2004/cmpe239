We propose a novel algorithm for extract-
ing dependencies from the derivations of
a large fragment of CCG. Unlike earlier
proposals, our dependency structures are
always tree-shaped. We then use these de-
pendency trees to compare the strong gen-
erative capacities of CCG and TAG and
obtain surprising results: Both formalisms
generate the same languages of derivation
trees ? but the mechanisms they use to
bring the words in these trees into a linear
order are incomparable.
