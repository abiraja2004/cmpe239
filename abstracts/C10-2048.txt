 
Previous works tend to compute the 
similarity between two sentences based 
on the comparison of their nearest 
meanings. However, the nearest 
meanings do not always represent their 
actual meanings. This paper presents a 
method which computes the similarity 
between two sentences based on a com-
parison of their actual meanings. This is 
achieved by transforming an existing 
most-outstanding corpus-based measure 
into a knowledge-based measure, which 
is then integrated with word sense dis-
ambiguation. The experimental results 
on a standard data set show that the pro-
posed method outperforms the baseline 
and the improvement achieved is statisti-
cally significant at 0.025 levels.
