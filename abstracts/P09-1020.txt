 
This paper proposes a forest-based tree se-
quence to string translation model for syntax- 
based statistical machine translation, which 
automatically learns tree sequence to string 
translation rules from word-aligned source-
side-parsed bilingual texts. The proposed 
model leverages on the strengths of both tree 
sequence-based and forest-based translation 
models. Therefore, it can not only utilize forest 
structure that compactly encodes exponential 
number of parse trees but also capture non-
syntactic translation equivalences with linguis-
tically structured information through tree se-
quence. This makes our model potentially 
more robust to parse errors and structure di-
vergence. Experimental results on the NIST 
MT-2003 Chinese-English translation task 
show that our method statistically significantly 
outperforms the four baseline systems.
