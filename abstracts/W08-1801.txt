Question Answering (QA) systems are of-
ten built modularly, with a text retrieval
component feeding forward into an answer
extraction component. Conventional wis-
dom suggests that, the higher the quality of
the retrieval results used as input to the an-
swer extraction module, the better the ex-
tracted answers, and hence system accu-
racy, will be. This turns out to be a poor
assumption, because text retrieval and an-
swer extraction are tightly coupled. Im-
provements in retrieval quality can be lost
at the answer extraction module, which can
not necessarily recognize the additional
answer candidates provided by improved
retrieval. Going forward, to improve ac-
curacy on the QA task, systems will need
greater coordination between text retrieval
and answer extraction modules.
