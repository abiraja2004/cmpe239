We present a novel unsupervised framework
for focused meeting summarization that views
the problem as an instance of relation extrac-
tion. We adapt an existing in-domain rela-
tion learner (Chen et al, 2011) by exploit-
ing a set of task-specific constraints and fea-
tures. We evaluate the approach on a decision
summarization task and show that it outper-
forms unsupervised utterance-level extractive
summarization baselines as well as an exist-
ing generic relation-extraction-based summa-
rization method. Moreover, our approach pro-
duces summaries competitive with those gen-
erated by supervised methods in terms of the
standard ROUGE score.
