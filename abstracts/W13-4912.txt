This paper investigates the impact of dif-
ferent morphological and lexical information
on data-driven dependency parsing of Per-
sian, a morphologically rich language. We
explore two state-of-the-art parsers, namely
MSTParser andMaltParser, on the recently re-
leased Persian dependency treebank and es-
tablish some baselines for dependency pars-
ing performance. Three sets of issues are
addressed in our experiments: effects of us-
ing gold and automatically derived features,
finding the best features for the parser, and
a suitable way to alleviate the data sparsity
problem. The final accuracy is 87.91% and
88.37% labeled attachment scores for Malt-
Parser and MSTParser, respectively.
