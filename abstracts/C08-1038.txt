We present dependency-based n-gram
models for general-purpose, wide-
coverage, probabilistic sentence realisa-
tion. Our method linearises unordered
dependencies in input representations
directly rather than via the application
of grammar rules, as in traditional chart-
based generators. The method is simple,
efficient, and achieves competitive accu-
racy and complete coverage on standard
English (Penn-II, 0.7440 BLEU, 0.05
sec/sent) and Chinese (CTB6, 0.7123
BLEU, 0.14 sec/sent) test data.
