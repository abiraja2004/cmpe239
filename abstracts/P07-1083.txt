A character-based measure of similarity is
an important component of many natu-
ral language processing systems, including
approaches to transliteration, coreference,
word alignment, spelling correction, and the
identification of cognates in related vocabu-
laries. We propose an alignment-based dis-
criminative framework for string similarity.
We gather features from substring pairs con-
sistent with a character-based alignment of
the two strings. This approach achieves
exceptional performance; on nine separate
cognate identification experiments using six
language pairs, we more than double the pre-
cision of traditional orthographic measures
like Longest Common Subsequence Ratio
and Dice?s Coefficient. We also show strong
improvements over other recent discrimina-
tive and heuristic similarity functions.
