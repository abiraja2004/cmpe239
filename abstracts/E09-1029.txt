The paper presents a multi-document sum-
marization system which builds company-
specific summaries from a collection of fi-
nancial news such that the extracted sen-
tences contain novel and relevant infor-
mation about the corresponding organiza-
tion. The user?s familiarity with the com-
pany?s profile is assumed. The goal of
such summaries is to provide information
useful for the short-term trading of the cor-
responding company, i.e., to facilitate the
inference from news to stock price move-
ment in the next day. We introduce a
novel query (i.e., company name) expan-
sion method and a simple unsupervized al-
gorithm for sentence ranking. The sys-
tem shows promising results in compari-
son with a competitive baseline.
