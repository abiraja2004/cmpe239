In this paper we develop a story genera-
tor that leverages knowledge inherent in
corpora without requiring extensive man-
ual involvement. A key feature in our ap-
proach is the reliance on a story planner
which we acquire automatically by record-
ing events, their participants, and their
precedence relationships in a training cor-
pus. Contrary to previous work our system
does not follow a generate-and-rank archi-
tecture. Instead, we employ evolutionary
search techniques to explore the space of
possible stories which we argue are well
suited to the story generation task. Experi-
ments on generating simple children?s sto-
ries show that our system outperforms pre-
vious data-driven approaches.
