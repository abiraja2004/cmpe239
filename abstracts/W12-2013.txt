Prior work has shown the utility of syntactic
tree fragments as features in judging the gram-
maticality of text. To date such fragments have
been extracted from derivations of Bayesian-
induced Tree Substitution Grammars (TSGs).
Evaluating on discriminative coarse and fine
grammaticality classification tasks, we show
that a simple, deterministic, count-based ap-
proach to fragment identification performs on
par with the more complicated grammars of
Post (2011). This represents a significant re-
duction in complexity for those interested in
the use of such fragments in the development
of systems for the educational domain.
