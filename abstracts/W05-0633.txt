Our system for semantic role labeling is
multi-stage in nature, being based on tree
pruning techniques, statistical methods for
lexicalised feature encoding, and a C4.5
decision tree classifier. We use both shal-
low and deep syntactic information from
automatically generated chunks and parse
trees, and develop a model for learning
the semantic arguments of predicates as a
multi-class decision problem. We evalu-
ate the performance on a set of relatively
?cheap? features and report an F1 score of
68.13% on the overall test set.
