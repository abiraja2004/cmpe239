 
The character-based tagging approach 
is a dominant technique for Chinese 
word segmentation, and both discrimi-
native and generative models can be 
adopted in that framework. However, 
generative and discriminative charac-
ter-based approaches are significantly 
different and complement each other. 
A simple joint model combining the 
character-based generative model and 
the discriminative one is thus proposed 
in this paper to take advantage of both 
approaches. Experiments on the Sec-
ond SIGHAN Bakeoff show that this 
joint approach achieves 21% relative 
error reduction over the discriminative 
model and 14% over the generative one. 
In addition, closed tests also show that 
the proposed joint model outperforms 
all the existing approaches reported in 
the literature and achieves the best F-
score in four out of five corpora.
