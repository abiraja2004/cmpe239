Given the increasing amount of conversa-
tion data, techniques to automatically ac-
quire information about conversation par-
ticipants have become more important.
Towards this goal, we investigate the prob-
lem of conversation entailment, a task
that determines whether a given conversa-
tion discourse entails a hypothesis about
the participants. This paper describes
the challenges related to conversation en-
tailment based on our collected data and
presents a probabilistic framework that in-
corporates conversation context in entail-
ment prediction. Our preliminary exper-
imental results have shown that conver-
sation context, in particular dialogue act,
plays an important role in conversation en-
tailment.
