Large databases of facts are prevalent in
many applications. Such databases are
accurate, but as they broaden their scope
they become increasingly incomplete. In
contrast to extending such a database, we
present a system to query whether it con-
tains an arbitrary fact. This work can be
thought of as re-casting open domain in-
formation extraction: rather than growing
a database of known facts, we smooth this
data into a database in which any possi-
ble fact has membership with some confi-
dence. We evaluate our system predicting
held out facts, achieving 74.2% accuracy
and outperforming multiple baselines. We
also evaluate the system as a common-
sense filter for the ReVerb Open IE sys-
tem, and as a method for answer validation
in a Question Answering task.
