Previous research in cross-document en-
tity coreference has generally been re-
stricted to the offline scenario where the
set of documents is provided in advance.
As a consequence, the dominant approach
is based on greedy agglomerative cluster-
ing techniques that utilize pairwise vec-
tor comparisons and thus require O(n2)
space and time. In this paper we ex-
plore identifying coreferent entity men-
tions across documents in high-volume
streaming text, including methods for uti-
lizing orthographic and contextual infor-
mation. We test our methods using several
corpora to quantitatively measure both the
efficacy and scalability of our streaming
approach. We show that our approach
scales to at least an order of magnitude
larger data than previous reported meth-
ods.
