 
This paper reports a preliminary study 
addressing two challenges in measuring 
the effectiveness of information extrac-
tion (IE) technology: 
? Developing a methodology for ex-
trinsic evaluation of IE; and, 
? Estimating the impact of improving 
IE technology on the ability to per-
form an application task. 
The methodology described can be em-
ployed for further controlled experi-
ments regarding information extraction.
