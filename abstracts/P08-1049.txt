Chinese abbreviations are widely used in
modern Chinese texts. Compared with
English abbreviations (which are mostly
acronyms and truncations), the formation of
Chinese abbreviations is much more complex.
Due to the richness of Chinese abbreviations,
many of them may not appear in available par-
allel corpora, in which case current machine
translation systems simply treat them as un-
known words and leave them untranslated. In
this paper, we present a novel unsupervised
method that automatically extracts the relation
between a full-form phrase and its abbrevia-
tion from monolingual corpora, and induces
translation entries for the abbreviation by us-
ing its full-form as a bridge. Our method does
not require any additional annotated data other
than the data that a regular translation system
uses. We integrate our method into a state-of-
the-art baseline translation system and show
that it consistently improves the performance
of the baseline system on various NIST MT
test sets.
