We present a discrete optimization model based on
a linear programming formulation as an alternative
to the cascade of classiers implemented in many
language processing systems. Since NLP tasks are
correlated with one another, sequential processing
does not guarantee optimal solutions. We apply our
model in an NLG application and show that it per-
forms better than a pipeline-based system.
