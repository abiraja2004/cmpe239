We present a translation model enriched with
shallow syntactic and semantic information
about the source language. Base-phrase la-
bels and semantic role labels are incorporated
into an hierarchical model by creating shal-
low semantic ?trees?. Results show an in-
crease in performance of up to 6% in BLEU
scores for English-Spanish translation over a
standard phrase-based SMT baseline.
