Morpho Challenge is an annual evalu-
ation campaign for unsupervised mor-
pheme analysis. In morpheme analysis,
words are segmented into smaller mean-
ingful units. This is an essential part in
processing complex word forms in many
large-scale natural language processing
applications, such as speech recognition,
information retrieval, and machine trans-
lation. The discovery of morphemes is
particularly important for morphologically
rich languages where inflection, deriva-
tion and composition can produce a huge
amount of different word forms. Morpho
Challenge aims at language-independent
unsupervised learning algorithms that can
discover useful morpheme-like units from
raw text material. In this paper we de-
fine the challenge, review proposed algo-
rithms, evaluations and results so far, and
point out the questions that are still open.
