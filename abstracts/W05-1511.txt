We investigated the performance efficacy
of beam search parsing and deep parsing
techniques in probabilistic HPSG parsing
using the Penn treebank. We first tested
the beam thresholding and iterative pars-
ing developed for PCFG parsing with an
HPSG. Next, we tested three techniques
originally developed for deep parsing: quick
check, large constituent inhibition, and hy-
brid parsing with a CFG chunk parser. The
contributions of the large constituent inhi-
bition and global thresholding were not sig-
nificant, while the quick check and chunk
parser greatly contributed to total parsing
performance. The precision, recall and av-
erage parsing time for the Penn treebank
(Section 23) were 87.85%, 86.85%, and 360
ms, respectively.
