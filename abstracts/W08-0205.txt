Many of the computational linguistics classes
at Ohio State draw a diverse crowd of students,
who bring different levels of preparation to
the classroom. In the same classroom, we of-
ten get graduate and undergraduate students
from Linguistics, Computer Science, Electri-
cal Engineering and other departments; teach-
ing the same material to all of these students
presents an interesting challenge to the in-
structor. In this paper, I discuss some of the
teaching strategies that I have employed to
help integrate students in two classes on auto-
matic speech recognition topics; strategies for
a graduate seminar class and a standard ?lec-
ture? class are presented. Both courses make
use of communal, online activities to facilitate
interaction between students.
