We present CarmelTC, a novel hybrid text clas-
sification approach for analyzing essay answers
to qualitative physics questions, which builds
upon work presented in (Rose? et al, 2002a).
CarmelTC learns to classify units of text based
on features extracted from a syntactic analysis
of that text as well as on a Naive Bayes clas-
sification of that text. We explore the trade-
offs between symbolic and ?bag of words? ap-
proaches. Our goal has been to combine the
strengths of both of these approaches while
avoiding some of the weaknesses. Our evalu-
ation demonstrates that the hybrid CarmelTC
approach outperforms two ?bag of words? ap-
proaches, namely LSA and a Naive Bayes, as
well as a purely symbolic approach.
