 
This paper presents a simple unsupervised 
learning algorithm for classifying reviews 
as recommended (thumbs up) or not rec-
ommended (thumbs down). The classifi-
cation of a review is predicted by the 
average semantic orientation of the 
phrases in the review that contain adjec-
tives or adverbs. A phrase has a positive 
semantic orientation when it has good as-
sociations (e.g., ?subtle nuances?) and a 
negative semantic orientation when it has 
bad associations (e.g., ?very cavalier?). In 
this paper, the semantic orientation of a 
phrase is calculated as the mutual infor-
mation between the given phrase and the 
word ?excellent? minus the mutual 
information between the given phrase and 
the word ?poor?. A review is classified as 
recommended if the average semantic ori-
entation of its phrases is positive. The al-
gorithm achieves an average accuracy of 
74% when evaluated on 410 reviews from 
Epinions, sampled from four different 
domains (reviews of automobiles, banks, 
movies, and travel destinations). The ac-
curacy ranges from 84% for automobile 
reviews to 66% for movie reviews.
