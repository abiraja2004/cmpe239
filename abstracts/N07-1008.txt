This paper presents a maximum entropy ma-
chine translation system using a minimal set
of translation blocks (phrase-pairs). While
recent phrase-based statistical machine trans-
lation (SMT) systems achieve significant im-
provement over the original source-channel sta-
tistical translation models, they 1) use a large
inventory of blocks which have significant over-
lap and 2) limit the use of training to just a
few parameters (on the order of ten). In con-
trast, we show that our proposed minimalist
system (DTM2) achieves equal or better per-
formance by 1) recasting the translation prob-
lem in the traditional statistical modeling ap-
proach using blocks with no overlap and 2) re-
lying on training most system parameters (on
the order of millions or larger). The new model
is a direct translation model (DTM) formu-
lation which allows easy integration of addi-
tional/alternative views of both source and tar-
get sentences such as segmentation for a source
language such as Arabic, part-of-speech of both
source and target, etc. We show improvements
over a state-of-the-art phrase-based decoder in
Arabic-English translation.
