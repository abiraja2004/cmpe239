This paper studies the impact of written lan-
guage variations and the way it affects the cap-
italization task over time. A discriminative
approach, based on maximum entropy mod-
els, is proposed to perform capitalization, tak-
ing the language changes into consideration.
The proposed method makes it possible to use
large corpora for training. The evaluation is
performed over newspaper corpora using dif-
ferent testing periods. The achieved results
reveal a strong relation between the capital-
ization performance and the elapsed time be-
tween the training and testing data periods.
