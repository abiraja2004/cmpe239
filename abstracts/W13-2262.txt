We apply multi-rate HMMs, a tree struc-
tured HMM model, to the word-alignment
problem. Multi-rate HMMs allow us to
model reordering at both the morpheme
level and the word level in a hierarchical
fashion. This approach leads to better ma-
chine translation results than a morpheme-
aware model that does not explicitly model
morpheme reordering.
