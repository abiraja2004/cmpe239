We describe a method for discovering ir-
regularities in temporal mood patterns ap-

and labeling them with a natural language
explanation. Simple techniques based
on comparing corpus frequencies, coupled
with large quantities of data, are shown to
be effective for identifying the events un-
derlying changes in global moods.
