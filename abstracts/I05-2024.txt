We present a neural-network based self-
organizing approach that enables vi-
sualization of the information retrieval
while at the same time improving its
precision. In computer experiments,
two-dimensional documentary maps in
which queries and documents were
mapped in topological order accord-
ing to their similarities were created.
The ranking of the results retrieved us-
ing the maps was better than that of
the results obtained using a conven-
tional TFIDF method. Furthermore, the
precision of the proposed method was
much higher than that of the conven-
tional TFIDF method when the process
was focused on retrieving highly rel-
evant documents, suggesting that the
proposed method might be especially
suited to information retrieval tasks in
which precision is more critical than re-
call.
