Recognizing bridging anaphora is difficult due
to the wide variation within the phenomenon,
the resulting lack of easily identifiable surface
markers and their relative rarity. We develop
linguistically motivated discourse structure,
lexico-semantic and genericity detection fea-
tures and integrate these into a cascaded mi-
nority preference algorithm that models bridg-
ing recognition as a subtask of learning fine-
grained information status (IS). We substan-
tially improve bridging recognition without
impairing performance on other IS classes.
