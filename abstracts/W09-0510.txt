Taking so-called split utterances as our
point of departure, we argue that a new
perspective on the major challenge of dis-
ambiguation becomes available, given a
framework in which both parsing and gen-
eration incrementally involve the same
mechanisms for constructing trees reflect-
ing interpretation (Dynamic Syntax: (Cann
et al, 2005; Kempson et al, 2001)). With
all dependencies, syntactic, semantic and
pragmatic, defined in terms of incremental
progressive tree growth, the phenomenon
of speaker/hearer role-switch emerges as
an immediate consequence, with the po-
tential for clarification, acknowledgement,
correction, all available incrementally at
any sub-sentential point in the interpreta-
tion process. Accordingly, at all interme-
diate points where interpretation of an ut-
terance subpart is not fully determined for
the hearer in context, uncertainty can be
resolved immediately by suitable clarifica-
tion/correction/repair/extension as an ex-
change between interlocutors. The result
is a major check on the combinatorial ex-
plosion of alternative structures and inter-
pretations at each choice point, and the ba-
sis for a model of how interpretation in
context can be established without either
party having to make assumptions about
what information they and their interlocu-
tor share in resolving ambiguities.
