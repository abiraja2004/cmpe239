We apply Support Vector Machines (SVMs) to
identify English base phrases (chunks). SVMs
are known to achieve high generalization perfor-
mance even with input data of high dimensional
feature spaces. Furthermore, by the Kernel princi-
ple, SVMs can carry out training with smaller com-
putational overhead independent of their dimen-
sionality. We apply weighted voting of 8 SVMs-
based systems trained with distinct chunk repre-
sentations. Experimental results show that our ap-
proach achieves higher accuracy than previous ap-
proaches.
