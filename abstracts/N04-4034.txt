In conventional language modeling, the words
from only one speaker at a time are repre-
sented, even for conversational tasks such as
meetings and telephone calls. In a conversa-
tional or meeting setting, however, speakers
can have significant influence on each other.
To recover such un-modeled inter-speaker in-
formation, we introduce an approach for con-
versational language modeling that considers
words from other speakers when predicting
words from the current one. By augmenting a
normal trigram context, our new multi-speaker
language model (MSLM) improves on both
Switchboard and ICSI Meeting Recorder cor-
pora. Using an MSLM and a conditional mu-
tual information based word clustering algo-
rithm, we achieve a 8.9% perplexity reduction
on Switchboard and a 12.2% reduction on the
ICSI Meeting Recorder data.
