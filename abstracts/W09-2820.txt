 
The GREC-MSR task is to generate appropri-
ate references to an entity in the context of a 
piece of discourse longer than a sentence. In 
MSR ?09 run of this task, the main aim is to 
select the actual main subject reference 
(MSR) from a list of given referential expres-
sions that is appropriate in context. We used a 
machine learning approach augmented with 
some rules to select the most appropriate ref-
erential expression. Our approach uses the 
training set for learning and then combines 
some of the rules found by observation to im-
prove the system.
