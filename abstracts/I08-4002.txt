 
Recently, many studies have been focused 
on extracting transliteration pairs from bi-
lingual texts. Most of these studies are 
based on the statistical transliteration mod-
el. The paper discusses the limitations of 
previous approaches and proposes novel 
approaches called dynamic window and to-
kenizer to overcome these limitations. Ex-
perimental results show that the average 
rates of word and character precision are 
99.0% and 99.78%, respectively.
