Dependency Tree Semantics (DTS) is an underspecified formalism for representing
quantifier scope ambiguities in natural language. DTS features a direct interface
with a Dependency grammar and an incremental, constraint-based disambiguation
mechanism. In this paper, we discuss the meaning of quantifier dependency in DTS
by translating its well formed structures into formulae of a Second Order Logic
augmented with Mostowskian generalized quantifiers.
