In this study we apply and evaluate an
iterative pairwise alignment program for
producing multiple sequence alignments,
ALPHAMALIG (Alonso et al, 2004), us-
ing as material the phonetic transcriptions
of words used in Bulgarian dialectological
research. To evaluate the quality of the
multiple alignment, we propose two new
methods based on comparing each column
in the obtained alignments with the cor-
responding column in a set of gold stan-
dard alignments. Our results show that the
alignments produced by ALPHAMALIG
correspond well with the gold standard
alignments, making this algorithm suitable
for the automatic generation of multiple
string alignments. Multiple string align-
ment is particularly interesting for histor-
ical reconstruction based on sound corre-
spondences.
