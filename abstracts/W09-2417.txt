In this paper, we describe the SemEval-2010
shared task on ?Linking Events and Their Par-
ticipants in Discourse?. This task is a variant
of the classical semantic role labelling task.
The novel aspect is that we focus on linking
local semantic argument structures across sen-
tence boundaries. Specifically, the task aims at
linking locally uninstantiated roles to their co-
referents in the wider discourse context (if such
co-referents exist). This task is potentially ben-
eficial for a number of NLP applications and
we hope that it will not only attract researchers
from the semantic role labelling community
but also from co-reference resolution and infor-
mation extraction.
