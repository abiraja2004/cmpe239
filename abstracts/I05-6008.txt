Many NLP tasks that require syntactic
analysis necessitate an accurate de-
scription of the lexical components,
morpho-syntactic constraints and the
semantic idiosyncracies of fixed ex-
pressions. (Moon, 1998) and (Riehem-
ann, 2001) show that many fixed ex-
pressions and idioms allow limited vari-
ation and modification inside their com-
plementation.
This paper discusses to what extent a
corpus-based method can help us estab-
lish the variation and adjectival modi-
fication potential of Dutch support verb
constructions. We also discuss what
problems the data poses when apply-
ing an automated data-driven method to
solve the problem.
