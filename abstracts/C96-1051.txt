 
Preparation, recording, segmentation a d pitch 
labelling of Slovenian diphone inventories are 
described. A special user friendly intert'ace 
package was developed in order to facilitate 
these operations. As acquisition of a labelled 
diphone inventory or adaptation of a speech 
synthesis ystem to synthesise further voices 
is manually intensive, an automatic procedure 
is required. A speech recogniser, based on 
Hidden Markov Models in forced segmenta- 
tion mode is used to outline phone boundaries 
within spoken logatoms. A statistical evalua- 
tion of manual and automatic segmentation dis- 
crepancies i performed so as to estinmte the 
reliability of automatically derived labels. Fi- 
nally, diphone boundaries are determined and 
pitch markers are assigned to voiced sections 
of the speech signal.
