 
We propose a NLP methodology for ana-
lyzing patent claims that combines sym-
bolic grammar formalisms with data-
intensive methods while enhancing analy-
sis robustness. The output of our analyzer 
is a shallow interlingual representation 
that captures both the structure and con-
tent of a claim text. The methodology can 
be used in any patent-related application, 
such as machine translation, improving 
readability of patent claims, information 
retrieval, extraction, summarization, gen-
eration, etc. The methodology should be 
universal in the sense that it could be ap-
plied to any language, other parts of pat-
ent documentation and text as such.
