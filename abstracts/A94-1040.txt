 
A new type of thesaurus for word process- 
ing is proposed. It comprises 7 semantic 
and 8 syntagmatic types of links between 
Russian words and collocations. The orig- 
inal version now includes ca. 76,000 ba- 
sic dictionary entries, 660,000 semantic and 
292,000 syntagmatic links, English inter- 
face, and communication with any text edi- 
tor. Methods of delivery enriching are used 
based on generic and synonymous links.
