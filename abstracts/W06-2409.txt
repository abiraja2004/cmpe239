This paper discusses an approach to mod-
eling monolingual and bilingual dictio-
naries in the description logic species of
the OWL Web Ontology Language (OWL
DL). The central idea is that the model
of a bilingual dictionary is a combination
of the models of two monolingual dictio-
naries, in addition to an abstract transla-
tion model. The paper addresses the ad-
vantages of using OWL DL for the design
of monolingual and bilingual dictionaries
and proposes a generalized architecture for
that purpose. Moreover, mechanisms for
querying and checking the consistency of
such models are presented, and it is con-
cluded that DL provides means which are
capable of adequately meeting the require-
ments on the design of multilingual dictio-
naries.
