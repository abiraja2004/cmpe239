This paper describes the phrase-based
SMT systems developed for our partici-
pation in the WMT13 Shared Translation
Task. Translations for English?German
and English?French were generated us-
ing a phrase-based translation system
which is extended by additional models
such as bilingual, fine-grained part-of-
speech (POS) and automatic cluster lan-
guage models and discriminative word
lexica (DWL). In addition, we combined
reordering models on different sentence
abstraction levels.
