Mining opinion targets is a fundamen-
tal and important task for opinion min-
ing from online reviews. To this end,
there are usually two kinds of methods:
syntax based and alignment based meth-
ods. Syntax based methods usually ex-
ploited syntactic patterns to extract opin-
ion targets, which were however prone to
suffer from parsing errors when dealing
with online informal texts. In contrast,
alignment based methods used word align-
ment model to fulfill this task, which could
avoid parsing errors without using pars-
ing. However, there is no research fo-
cusing on which kind of method is more
better when given a certain amount of re-
views. To fill this gap, this paper empiri-
cally studies how the performance of these
two kinds of methods vary when chang-
ing the size, domain and language of the
corpus. We further combine syntactic pat-
terns with alignment model by using a par-
tially supervised framework and investi-
gate whether this combination is useful or
not. In our experiments, we verify that
our combination is effective on the corpus
with small and medium size.
