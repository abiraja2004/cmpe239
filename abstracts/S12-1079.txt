The first was a corpus-based method that extracted lexical and semantic features from pairs of chunks from each sentence that were associated through a chunk alignment algorithm. The features were used as input to a classifier trained on the same features ex-tracted from a corpus of gold standard training data. The second approach involved breadth-first chunk association and the application of a rule-based scoring algorithm. Both approaches were evaluated against the test data for the SemEval 2012 Semantic Text Similarity task. The results show that the rule-based chunk approach is superior. 1
