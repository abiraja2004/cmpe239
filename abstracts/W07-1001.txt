We consider the diagnostic utility of vari-
ous syntactic complexity measures when ex-
tracted from spoken language samples of
healthy and cognitively impaired subjects.
We examine measures calculated from man-
ually built parse trees, as well as the same
measures calculated from automatic parses.
We show statistically significant differences
between clinical subject groups for a num-
ber of syntactic complexity measures, and
these differences are preserved with auto-
matic parsing. Different measures show dif-
ferent patterns for our data set, indicating
that using multiple, complementary mea-
sures is important for such an application.
