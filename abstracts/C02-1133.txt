The title of a document has two roles, to give
a compact summary and to lead the reader to
read the document. Conventional title gener-
ation focuses on finding key expressions from
the author?s wording in the document to give
a compact summary and pays little attention
to the reader?s interest. To make the title play
its second role properly, it is indispensable to
clarify the content (?what to say?) and word-
ing (?how to say?) of titles that are effective to
attract the target reader?s interest. In this arti-
cle, we first identify typical content and wording
of titles aimed at general readers in a compar-
ative study between titles of technical papers
and headlines rewritten for newspapers. Next,
we describe the results of a questionnaire sur-
vey on the effects of the content and wording
of titles on the reader?s interest. The survey of
general and knowledgeable readers shows both
common and different tendencies in interest.
