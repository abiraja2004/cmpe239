We present an asymmetric approach to
a run-time combination of two parsers
where one component serves as a predic-
tor to the other one. Predictions are inte-
grated by means of weighted constraints
and therefore are subject to preferential
decisions. Previously, the same architec-
ture has been successfully used with pre-
dictors providing partial or inferior infor-
mation about the parsing problem. It has
now been applied to a situation where the
predictor produces exactly the same type
of information at a fully competitive qual-
ity level. Results show that the combined
system outperforms its individual compo-
nents, even though their performance in
isolation is already fairly high.
