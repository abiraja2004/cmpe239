We present a method of extracting open-
domain commonsense knowledge by apply-
ing discourse parsing to a large corpus of per-
sonal stories written by Internet authors. We
demonstrate the use of a linear-time, joint syn-
tax/discourse dependency parser for this pur-
pose, and we show how the extracted dis-
course relations can be used to generate open-
domain textual inferences. Our evaluations
of the discourse parser and inference models
show some success, but also identify a num-
ber of interesting directions for future work.
