In this paper, we investigate the prob-
lem of automatically predicting segment
boundaries in spoken multiparty dialogue.
We extend prior work in two ways. We
first apply approaches that have been pro-
posed for predicting top-level topic shifts
to the problem of identifying subtopic
boundaries. We then explore the impact
on performance of using ASR output as
opposed to human transcription. Exam-
ination of the effect of features shows
that predicting top-level and predicting
subtopic boundaries are two distinct tasks:
(1) for predicting subtopic boundaries,
the lexical cohesion-based approach alone
can achieve competitive results, (2) for
predicting top-level boundaries, the ma-
chine learning approach that combines
lexical-cohesion and conversational fea-
tures performs best, and (3) conversational
cues, such as cue phrases and overlapping
speech, are better indicators for the top-
level prediction task. We also find that
the transcription errors inevitable in ASR
output have a negative impact on models
that combine lexical-cohesion and conver-
sational features, but do not change the
general preference of approach for the two
tasks.
