In this paper, we investigate how modeling
content structure can benefit text analysis ap-
plications such as extractive summarization
and sentiment analysis. This follows the lin-
guistic intuition that rich contextual informa-
tion should be useful in these tasks. We
present a framework which combines a su-
pervised text analysis application with the in-
duction of latent content structure. Both of
these elements are learned jointly using the
EM algorithm. The induced content struc-
ture is learned from a large unannotated cor-
pus and biased by the underlying text analysis
task. We demonstrate that exploiting content
structure yields significant improvements over
approaches that rely only on local context.1
