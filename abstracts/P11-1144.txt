We describe a new approach to disambiguat-
ing semantic frames evoked by lexical predi-
cates previously unseen in a lexicon or anno-
tated data. Our approach makes use of large
amounts of unlabeled data in a graph-based
semi-supervised learning framework. We con-
struct a large graph where vertices correspond
to potential predicates and use label propa-
gation to learn possible semantic frames for
new ones. The label-propagated graph is used
within a frame-semantic parser and, for un-
known predicates, results in over 15% abso-
lute improvement in frame identification ac-
curacy and over 13% absolute improvement
in full frame-semantic parsing F1 score on a
blind test set, over a state-of-the-art supervised
baseline.
