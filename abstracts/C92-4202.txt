 
Large-scale knowledge-based machine translation 
requires ignificant amounts of lexical knowledge 
in order to map syntactic structures to conceptual 
structures. Tfiis paper presents a framework in 
which lexical knowledge is separated into differ- 
ent levels of representation, which are arranged in 
a hierarchical model based on principles of knowl- 
edge representation a d lexical semantics. The pro- 
posed methodology is language-independent, a d 
has been used to organize lexical knowledge for 
both English and Japanese.
