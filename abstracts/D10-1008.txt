In the 1980s, plot units were proposed as a
conceptual knowledge structure for represent-
ing and summarizing narrative stories. Our
research explores whether current NLP tech-
nology can be used to automatically produce
plot unit representations for narrative text. We
create a system called AESOP that exploits
a variety of existing resources to identify af-
fect states and applies ?projection rules? to
map the affect states onto the characters in a
story. We also use corpus-based techniques
to generate a new type of affect knowledge
base: verbs that impart positive or negative
states onto their patients (e.g., being eaten is
an undesirable state, but being fed is a desir-
able state). We harvest these ?patient polar-
ity verbs? from a Web corpus using two tech-
niques: co-occurrence with Evil/Kind Agent
patterns, and bootstrapping over conjunctions
of verbs. We evaluate the plot unit representa-
tions produced by our system on a small col-
lection of Aesop?s fables.
