 
News Comments on the web express 
readers? attitudes or opinions about an 
event or object in the corresponding 
news article. And opinion target extrac-
tion from news comments is very impor-
tant for many useful Web applications. 
However, many sentences in the com-
ments are irregular and informal, and 
sometimes the opinion targets are impli-
cit. Thus the task is very challenging and 
it has not been investigated yet. In this 
paper, we propose a new approach to un-
iformly extracting explicit and implicit 
opinion targets from news comments by 
using Centering Theory. The approach 
uses global information in news articles 
as well as contextual information in ad-
jacent sentences of comments. Our expe-
rimental results verify the effectiveness 
of the proposed approach.
