With the proliferation of user-generated arti-
cles over the web, it becomes imperative to de-
velop automated methods that are aware of the
ideological-bias implicit in a document col-
lection. While there exist methods that can
classify the ideological bias of a given docu-
ment, little has been done toward understand-
ing the nature of this bias on a topical-level. In
this paper we address the problem of modeling
ideological perspective on a topical level using
a factored topic model. We develop efficient
inference algorithms using Collapsed Gibbs
sampling for posterior inference, and give var-
ious evaluations and illustrations of the util-
ity of our model on various document collec-
tions with promising results. Finally we give a
Metropolis-Hasting inference algorithm for a
semi-supervised extension with decent results.
