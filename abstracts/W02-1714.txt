: This paper describes the use of XML in three generic interacting speech technology 
systems.  The first, a phonological syllable recognition system, generates feature-based finite-state 
automaton representations of phonotactic constraints in XML. It employs axioms of event logic to 
interpret multilinear representations of speech utterances and outputs candidate syllables to the second 
system, an XML syllable lexicon. This system enables users to generate their own lexicons and its default 
lexicon is used to accept or reject the candidate syllables output by the speech recognition system. 
Furthermore its XML representation facilitates its use by the third system which generates additional 
lexicons, based on different feature sets, by means of a transduction process. The applicability of these 
alternative feature sets in the generation of synthetic speech can then be tested using these new lexicons.
