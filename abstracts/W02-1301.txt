 
This paper is a draft position paper for discussion at the ELSNET Brainstorming Workshop 
2000-2010 in Katwijk aan Zee, The Netherlands, on 23-24 November, 2000. The paper first 
describes some general emerging trends which are expected to deeply affect, or even 
transform, the field of speech technology research in the future, including trends towards 
advanced systems research, natural interactivity, multimodality, and medium-scale science. A 
timeline survey of future speech-related technologies is then presented followed by analysis 
of some of the implications of the proposed timelines. Timeline projections may turn out to 
have been false, of course, but even their turning out to be true is subject to future actions 
which are (not) taken to make them true. Accordingly, the final part of the paper discusses 
some actions which would seem desirable from the point of view of strengthening the 
position of European speech-related research.
