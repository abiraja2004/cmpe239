This paper proposes a supervised learn-
ing method for detecting a semantic rela-
tion between a given pair of named enti-
ties, which may be located in different sen-
tences. The method employs newly intro-
duced contextual features based on center-
ing theory as well as conventional syntac-
tic and word-based features. These features
are organized as a tree structure and are
fed into a boosting-based classification al-
gorithm. Experimental results show the pro-
posed method outperformed prior methods,
and increased precision and recall by 4.4%
and 6.7%.
