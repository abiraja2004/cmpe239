We define a probabilistic morphological ana-
lyzer using a data-driven approach for Syriac in
order to facilitate the creation of an annotated
corpus. Syriac is an under-resourced Semitic
language for which there are no available lan-
guage tools such as morphological analyzers.
We introduce novel probabilistic models for
segmentation, dictionary linkage, and morpho-
logical tagging and connect them in a pipeline
to create a probabilistic morphological analyzer
requiring only labeled data. We explore the per-
formance of models with varying amounts of
training data and find that with about 34,500
labeled tokens, we can outperform a reason-
able baseline trained on over 99,000 tokens and
achieve an accuracy of just over 80%. When
trained on all available training data, our joint
model achieves 86.47% accuracy, a 29.7% re-
duction in error rate over the baseline.
