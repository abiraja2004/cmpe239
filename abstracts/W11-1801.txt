The BioNLP Shared Task 2011, an informa-
tion extraction task held over 6 months up to
March 2011, met with community-wide par-
ticipation, receiving 46 final submissions from
24 teams. Five main tasks and three support-
ing tasks were arranged, and their results show
advances in the state of the art in fine-grained
biomedical domain information extraction and
demonstrate that extraction methods success-
fully generalize in various aspects.
