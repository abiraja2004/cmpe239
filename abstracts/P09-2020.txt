We present a syntactic and lexically based
discourse segmenter (SLSeg) that is de-
signed to avoid the common problem of
over-segmenting text. Segmentation is the
first step in a discourse parser, a system
that constructs discourse trees from el-
ementary discourse units. We compare
SLSeg to a probabilistic segmenter, show-
ing that a conservative approach increases
precision at the expense of recall, while re-
taining a high F-score across both formal
and informal texts.
