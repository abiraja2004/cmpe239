This paper describes a Verb Phrase Ellipsis
(VPE) detection system, built for robust-
ness, accuracy and domain independence.
The system is corpus-based, and uses a va-
riety of machine learning techniques on free
text that has been automatically parsed us-
ing two different parsers. Tested on a mixed
corpus comprising a range of genres, the sys-
tem achieves a 72% F1-score. It is designed
as the first stage of a complete VPE resolu-
tion system that is input free text, detects
VPEs, and proceeds to find the antecedents
and resolve them.
