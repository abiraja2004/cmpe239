Our system for the CoNLL 2008 shared
task uses a set of individual parsers, a set of
stand-alone semantic role labellers, and a
joint system for parsing and semantic role
labelling, all blended together. The system
achieved a macro averaged labelled F
1
-
score of 79.79 (WSJ 80.92, Brown 70.49)
for the overall task. The labelled attach-
ment score for syntactic dependencies was
86.63 (WSJ 87.36, Brown 80.77) and the
labelled F
1
-score for semantic dependen-
cies was 72.94 (WSJ 74.47, Brown 60.18).
