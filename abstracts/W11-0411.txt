Within the framework of the construction of a
fact database, we defined guidelines to extract
named entities, using a taxonomy based on an
extension of the usual named entities defini-
tion. We thus defined new types of entities
with broader coverage including substantive-
based expressions. These extended named en-
tities are hierarchical (with types and compo-
nents) and compositional (with recursive type
inclusion and metonymy annotation). Human
annotators used these guidelines to annotate a
1.3M word broadcast news corpus in French.
This article presents the definition and novelty
of extended named entity annotation guide-
lines, the human annotation of a global corpus
and of a mini reference corpus, and the evalu-
ation of annotations through the computation
of inter-annotator agreements. Finally, we dis-
cuss our approach and the computed results,
and outline further work.
