This paper proposes a new method of
ranking near-synonyms ordered by their
suitability of nuances in a particular con-
text. Our method distincts near-synonyms
by semantic features extracted from their
definition statements in an ordinary dictio-
nary, and ranks them by the types of fea-
tures and a particular context. Our method
is an initial step to achieve a semantic
paraphrase system for authoring support.
