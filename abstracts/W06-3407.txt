 
We introduce a novel topic segmentation 
approach that combines evidence of topic 
shifts from lexical cohesion with linguistic 
evidence such as syntactically distinct fea-
tures of segment initial and final contribu-
tions.  Our evaluation shows that this hy-
brid approach outperforms state-of-the-art 
algorithms even when applied to loosely 
structured, spontaneous dialogue.  Further 
analysis reveals that using dialogue ex-
changes versus dialogue contributions im-
proves topic segmentation quality.
