We describe the use of a hierarchical topic
model for automatically identifying syntactic
and lexical patterns that explicitly state on-
tological relations. We leverage distant su-
pervision using relations from the knowledge
base FreeBase, but do not require any man-
ual heuristic nor manual seed list selections.
Results show that the learned patterns can be
used to extract new relations with good preci-
sion.
