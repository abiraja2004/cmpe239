We are developing corpus-based techniques for iden-
tifying semantic relations at an intermediate level of
description (more specific than those used in case
frames, but more general than those used in tra-
ditional knowledge representation systems). In this
paper we describe a classification algorithm for iden-
tifying relationships between two-word noun com-
pounds. We find that a very simple approach using
a machine learning algorithm and a domain-specific
lexical hierarchy successfully generalizes from train-
ing instances, performing better on previously un-
seen words than a baseline consisting of training on
the words themselves.
