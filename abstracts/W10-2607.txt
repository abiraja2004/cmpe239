We investigate the classification of utter-
ances into high-level dialog act categories
using word-based features, under condi-
tions where the train and test data dif-
fer by genre and/or language. We han-
dle the cross-language cases with ma-
chine translation of the test utterances.
We analyze and compare two feature-
based approaches to using unlabeled data
in adaptation: restriction to a shared fea-
ture set, and an implementation of Blitzer
et al?s Structural Correspondence Learn-
ing. Both methods lead to increased detec-
tion of backchannels in the cross-language
cases by utilizing correlations between
backchannel words and utterance length.
