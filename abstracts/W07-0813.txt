 
We propose an enhanced Part-of-Speech 
(POS) tagger of Semitic languages that 
treats Modern Standard Arabic (hence-
forth Arabic) and Modern Hebrew 
(henceforth Hebrew) using the same 
probabilistic model and architectural set-
ting. We start out by porting an existing 
Hidden Markov Model POS tagger for 
Hebrew to Arabic by exchanging a mor-
phological analyzer for Hebrew with 
Buckwalter's (2002) morphological ana-
lyzer for Arabic. This gives state-of-the-
art accuracy (96.12%), comparable to Ha-
bash and Rambow?s (2005) analyzer-
based POS tagger on the same Arabic 
datasets. However, further improvement 
of such analyzer-based tagging methods is 
hindered by the incomplete coverage of 
standard morphological analyzer (Bar 
Haim et al, 2005). To overcome this cov-
erage problem we supplement the output 
of Buckwalter's analyzer with syntheti-
cally constructed analyses that are pro-
posed by a model which uses character 
information (Diab et al, 2004) in a way 
that is similar to Nakagawa's (2004) sys-
tem for Chinese and Japanese. A version 
of this extended model that (unlike Naka-
gawa) incorporates synthetically con-
structed analyses also for known words 
achieves 96.28% accuracy on the standard 
Arabic test set.
