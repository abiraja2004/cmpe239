 
This paper describes first steps towards 
extending the METU Turkish Corpus 
from a sentence-level language resource to 
a discourse-level resource by annotating 
its discourse connectives and their 
arguments. The project is based on the 
same principles as the Penn Discourse 
TreeBank (http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~pdtb) 
and is supported by TUBITAK, The 
Scientific and Technological Research 
Council of Turkey. We first present the 
goals of the project and the METU 
Turkish corpus. We then describe how we 
decided what to take as explicit discourse 
connectives and the range of syntactic 
classes they come from. With 
representative examples of each class, we 
examine explicit connectives, their linear 
ordering, and types of syntactic units that 
can serve as their arguments. We then 
touch upon connectives with respect to 
free word order in Turkish and 
punctuation, as well as the important issue 
of how much material is needed to specify 
an argument. We close with a brief 
discussion of current plans.
