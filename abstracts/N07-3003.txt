We present our work on using Wikipedia
as a knowledge source for Natural Lan-
guage Processing. We first describe our
previous work on computing semantic re-
latedness from Wikipedia, and its applica-
tion to a machine learning based corefer-
ence resolution system. Our results sug-
gest that Wikipedia represents a semantic
resource to be treasured for NLP applica-
tions, and accordingly present the work di-
rections to be explored in the future.
