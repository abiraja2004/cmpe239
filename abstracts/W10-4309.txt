Two of the main corpora available for
training discourse relation classifiers are
the RST Discourse Treebank (RST-DT)
and the Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB),
which are both based on the Wall Street
Journal corpus. Most recent work us-
ing discourse relation classifiers have em-
ployed fully-supervised methods on these
corpora. However, certain discourse rela-
tions have little labeled data, causing low
classification performance for their asso-
ciated classes. In this paper, we attempt
to tackle this problem by employing a
semi-supervised method for discourse re-
lation classification. The proposed method
is based on the analysis of feature co-
occurrences in unlabeled data. This in-
formation is then used as a basis to ex-
tend the feature vectors during training.
The proposed method is evaluated on both
RST-DT and PDTB, where it significantly
outperformed baseline classifiers. We be-
lieve that the proposed method is a first
step towards improving classification per-
formance, particularly for discourse rela-
tions lacking annotated data.
