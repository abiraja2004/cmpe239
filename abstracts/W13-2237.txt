We present a novel online learning ap-
proach for statistical machine translation
tailored to the computer assisted transla-
tion scenario. With the introduction of
a simple online feature, we are able to
adapt the translation model on the fly
to the corrections made by the transla-
tors. Additionally, we do online adaption
of the feature weights with a large mar-
gin algorithm. Our results show that our
online adaptation technique outperforms
the static phrase based statistical machine
translation system by 6 BLEU points abso-
lute, and a standard incremental adaptation
approach by 2 BLEU points absolute.
