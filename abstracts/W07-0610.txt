Semantic networks have been used suc-
cessfully to explain access to the men-
tal lexicon. Topological analyses of these
networks have focused on acquisition and
generation. We extend this work to look
at models that distinguish semantic rela-
tions. We find the scale-free properties
of association networks are not found in
synonymy-homonymy networks, and that
this is consistent with studies of childhood
acquisition of these relationships. We fur-
ther find that distributional models of lan-
guage acquisition display similar topolog-
ical properties to these networks.
