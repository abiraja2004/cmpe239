This paper presents a probabilistic model
for sense disambiguation which chooses
the best sense based on the conditional
probability of sense paraphrases given a
context. We use a topic model to decom-
pose this conditional probability into two
conditional probabilities with latent vari-
ables. We propose three different instanti-
ations of the model for solving sense dis-
ambiguation problems with different de-
grees of resource availability. The pro-
posed models are tested on three different
tasks: coarse-grained word sense disam-
biguation, fine-grained word sense disam-
biguation, and detection of literal vs. non-
literal usages of potentially idiomatic ex-
pressions. In all three cases, we outper-
form state-of-the-art systems either quan-
titatively or statistically significantly.
