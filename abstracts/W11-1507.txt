Cultural heritage institutions are making their
digital content available and searchable on-
line. Digital metadata descriptions play an im-
portant role in this endeavour. This metadata
is mostly manually created and often lacks de-
tailed annotation, consistency and, most im-
portantly, explicit semantic content descrip-
tors which would facilitate online browsing
and exploration of available information. This
paper proposes the enrichment of existing
cultural heritage metadata with automatically
generated semantic content descriptors. In
particular, it is concerned with metadata en-
coding archival descriptions (EAD) and pro-
poses to use automatic term recognition and
term clustering techniques for knowledge ac-
quisition and content-based document classi-
fication purposes.
