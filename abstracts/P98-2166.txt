 
This paper describes a proposal for 
Portuguese possessive pronominal anaphor 
(PPA) resolution, a problem little considered 
so far. Particularly, we address the problem 
of Portuguese 3rd person intrasentential 
PPAs seu/sua/seus/suas (his/her/their/its, for 
human and non-human subjects in English), 
which constitute 30% of pronominal 
occurrences in our corpus (Brazilian laws 
about environment protection). Considering 
some differences between PPAs and other 
kinds of anaphors, such as personal or 
demonstrative pronouns, we define three 
knowledge sources (KSs) for PPA resolution: 
surface patterns (taking in account factors 
such as syntactic parallelism), possessive 
relationship rules and sentence centering. 
These knowledge sources are organized in a 
blackboard architecture for PPA resolution, 
which provides both knowledge and 
procedure distribution among autonomous 
entities (reflexive agents), each of them 
specialized in a particular aspect of the 
problem solving. The proposal has been 
implemented and its results are discussed at 
the end of the work.
