We experiment with several chunking models.
Deeper architectures achieve better gener-
alization. Quadratic filters, a simplification
of a theoretical model of V1 complex cells,
reliably increase accuracy. In fact, logistic
regression with quadratic filters outperforms
a standard single hidden layer neural network.
Adding quadratic filters to logistic regression
is almost as effective as feature engineering.
Despite predicting each output label indepen-
dently, our model is competitive with ones
that use previous decisions.
