Deterministic parsing has emerged as an ef-
fective alternative for complex parsing algo-
rithms which search the entire search space
to get the best probable parse tree. In this pa-
per, we present an online large margin based
training framework for deterministic pars-
ing using Nivre?s Shift-Reduce parsing al-
gorithm. Online training facilitates the use
of high dimensional features without cre-
ating memory bottlenecks unlike the popu-
lar SVMs. We participated in the CoNLL
Shared Task-2007 and evaluated our system
for ten languages. We got an average multi-
lingual labeled attachment score of 74.54 %
(with 65.50% being the average and 80.32%
the highest) and an average multilingual un-
labeled attachment score of 80.30% (with
71.13% being the average and 86.55% the
highest).
