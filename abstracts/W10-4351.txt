In this paper we present a proposal for the
development of dialog systems that, on the
one hand, takes into account the benefits of
using standards like VoiceXML, whilst on
the other, includes a statistical dialog mod-
ule to avoid the effort of manually defin-
ing the dialog strategy. This module is
trained using a labeled dialog corpus, and
selects the next system response consider-
ing a classification process that takes into
account the dialog history. Thus, system
developers only need to define a set of
VoiceXML files, each including a system
prompt and the associated grammar to rec-
ognize the users responses to the prompt.
We have applied this technique to develop
a dialog system in VoiceXML that pro-
vides railway information in Spanish.
