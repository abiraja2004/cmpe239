 
Integrating information from different 
stages of an NLP processing pipeline can 
yield significant error reduction. We dem-
onstrate how re-ranking can improve name 
tagging in a Chinese information extrac-
tion system by incorporating information 
from relation extraction, event extraction, 
and coreference. We evaluate three state-
of-the-art re-ranking algorithms (MaxEnt-
Rank, SVMRank, and p-Norm Push Rank-
ing), and show the benefit of multi-stage 
re-ranking for cross-sentence and cross-
document inference.
