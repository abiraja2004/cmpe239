 
This paper presents a framework for unsuper-
vised natural language morphology induction 
wherein candidate suffixes are grouped into 
candidate inflection classes, which are then ar-
ranged in a lattice structure.  With similar can-
didate inflection classes placed near one an-
other in the lattice, I propose this structure is 
an ideal search space in which to isolate the 
true inflection classes of a language.  This pa-
per discusses and motivates possible search 
strategies over the inflection class lattice struc-
ture.
