This paper discusses the basic structures
necessary for the generation of reference
to objects in a visual scene. We construct
a study designed to elicit naturalistic re-
ferring expressions to relatively complex
objects, and find aspects of reference that
have not been accounted for in work on
Referring Expression Generation (REG).
This includes reference to object parts,
size comparisons without crisp measure-
ments, and the use of analogies. By draw-
ing on research in cognitive science, neu-
rophysiology, and psycholinguistics, we
begin developing the input structure and
background knowledge necessary for an
algorithm capable of generating the kinds
of reference we observe.
