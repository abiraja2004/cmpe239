We introduce a supervised approach for ex-
tracting bio-molecular events by using linguis-
tic features that represent the contexts of the
candidate event triggers and participants. We
use Support Vector Machines as our learning
algorithm and train separate models for event
types that are described with a single theme
participant, multiple theme participants, or a
theme and a cause participant. We perform ex-
periments with linear kernel and edit-distance
based kernel and report our results on the
BioNLP?09 Shared Task test data set.
