 
This paper presents a morphological lexicon for English 
that handle more than 317000 inflected forms derived 
from over 90000 stems. The lexicon is available in two 
formats. The first can be used by an implementation f 
a two-level processor for morphological nalysis (Kart- 
tunen and Wittenhurg, 1983; Antworth, 1990). The 
second, derived from the first one for efficiency rea- 
sons, consists of a disk-based atabase using a UNIX 
hash table facility (Seltzer and Yigit, 1991). We also 
built an X Window tool to facilitate the maintenance 
and browsing of the lexicon. The package is ready to 
be integrated into an natural anguage application such 
as a parser through hooks written in Lisp and C. 
To our knowledge, this package is the only available 
free English morphological nalyzer with very wide cov- 
erage. 
attributes. To improve performance, we used PC- 
KIMMO as a generator on our lexicons to build a disk- 
based hashed database with a UNIX database facility 
(Seltzer and Yigit, 1991). Both formats, PC-KIMMO 
and database, are now available for distribution. We 
also provide an X Window tool for the database to fa- 
cilitate maintenance and access. Each format contains 
the morphological information for over 317000 English 
words. The morphological database for English runs 
under UNIX; PC-KIMMO runs under UNIX and on a 
PC. 
This package can be easily embedded into a natural 
language parser; hooks for accessing the morphological 
database from a parser are provided for both Lucid 
Common Lisp and C. This morphological database is 
currently being used in a graphical workbench (XTAG) 
for the development of tree-adjoining rammars and 
their parsers (Paroubek et al, 1992).
