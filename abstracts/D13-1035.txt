This paper describes a method that predicts
which trades players execute during a win-
lose game. Our method uses data collected
from chat negotiations of the game The Set-
tlers of Catan and exploits the conversation
to construct dynamically a partial model of
each player?s preferences. This in turn yields
equilibrium trading moves via principles from
game theory. We compare our method against
four baselines and show that tracking how
preferences evolve through the dialogue and
reasoning about equilibrium moves are both
crucial to success.
