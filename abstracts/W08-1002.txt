We report on some recent parse selection ex-
periments carried out with GG, a large-scale
HPSG grammar for German. Using a manu-
ally disambiguated treebank derived from the
Verbmobil corpus, we achieve over 81% exact
match accuracy compared to a 21.4% random
baseline, corresponding to an error reduction
rate of 3.8.
