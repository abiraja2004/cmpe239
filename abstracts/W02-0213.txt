This paper presents work on using
Bayesian networks for the dialogue act
recognition module of a dialogue sys-
tem for Dutch dialogues. The Bayesian
networks can be constructed from the
data in an annotated dialogue corpus.
For two series of experiments - using
different corpora but the same anno-
tation scheme - recognition results are
presented and evaluated.
