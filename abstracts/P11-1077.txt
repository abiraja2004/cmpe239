We investigate whether wording, stylistic
choices, and online behavior can be used
to predict the age category of blog authors.
Our hypothesis is that significant changes
in writing style distinguish pre-social me-
dia bloggers from post-social media blog-
gers. Through experimentation with a
range of years, we found that the birth
dates of students in college at the time
when social media such as AIM, SMS text
messaging, MySpace and Facebook first
became popular, enable accurate age pre-
diction. We also show that internet writing
characteristics are important features for
age prediction, but that lexical content is
also needed to produce significantly more
accurate results. Our best results allow for
81.57% accuracy.
