 
Temporal expressions are one of the important 
structures in natural language. In order to un-
derstand text, temporal expressions have to be 
identified and normalized by providing ISO-
based values. In this paper we present a shal-
low approach for automatic recognition of 
temporal expressions based on a supervised 
machine learning approach trained on an an-
notated corpus for temporal information, 
namely TimeBank. Our experiments demon-
strate a performance level comparable to a 
rule-based implementation and achieve the 
scores of 0.872, 0.836 and 0.852 for precision, 
recall and F1-measure for the detection task 
respectively, and 0.866, 0.796, 0.828 when an 
exact match is required.
