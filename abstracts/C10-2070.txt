We present a new method, based on
graph theory, for bilingual lexicon ex-
traction without relying on resources with
limited availability like parallel corpora.
The graphs we use represent linguis-
tic relations between words such as ad-
jectival modification. We experiment
with a number of ways of combining
different linguistic relations and present
a novel method, multi-edge extraction
(MEE), that is both modular and scalable.
We evaluate MEE on adjectives, verbs
and nouns and show that it is superior
to cooccurrence-based extraction (which
does not use linguistic analysis). Finally,
we publish a reproducible baseline to es-
tablish an evaluation benchmark for bilin-
gual lexicon extraction.
