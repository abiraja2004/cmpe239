 
In a Wizard-of-Oz experiment with multiple 
wizard subjects, each wizard viewed automated 
speech recognition (ASR) results for utterances 
whose interpretation is critical to task success: 
requests for books by title from a library data-
base. To avoid non-understandings, the wizard 
directly queried the application database with 
the ASR hypothesis (voice search). To learn 
how to avoid misunderstandings, we investi-
gated how wizards dealt with uncertainty in 
voice search results. Wizards were quite suc-
cessful at selecting the correct title from query 
results that included a match. The most suc-
cessful wizard could also tell when the query 
results did not contain the requested title. Our 
learned models of the best wizard?s behavior 
combine features available to wizards with 
some that are not, such as recognition confi-
dence and acoustic model scores.
