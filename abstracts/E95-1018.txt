 
Recent work within the field of Categorial 
Grammar  has seen the development of ap- 
proaches that allow different modes of lo- 
gical behaviour to be displayed within a 
single system, something corresponding to 
making available differing modes of lin- 
guistic description. Earlier attempts to 
achieve this goal have employed modal op- 
erators called structural modalities, whose 
use presents a number of problems. I pro-. 
pose an alternative approach, involving co- 
existence and interrelation of different sub- 
logics, that eliminates the need for struc- 
tural modalities, whilst maintaining the de- 
scriptive power they provide.
