We report the results of our work on automat-
ing the transliteration decision of named en-
tities for English to Arabic machine trans-
lation. We construct a classification-based
framework to automate this decision, evalu-
ate our classifier both in the limited news and
the diverse Wikipedia domains, and achieve
promising accuracy. Moreover, we demon-
strate a reduction of translation error and
an improvement in the performance of an
English-to-Arabic machine translation sys-
tem.
