 
We describe a methodology and associated software 
system for the construction of a large lexicon from 
an existing machine-readable (published) dictionary. 
The lexicon serves as a component of an English mor- 
phological and syntactic analyesr and contains entries 
with grammatical definitions compatible with the word 
and sentence grammar employed by the analyser. We 
describe a software system with two integrated com- 
ponents. One of these is capable of extracting syn- 
tactically rich, theory-neutral lexical templates from 
a suitable machine-readabh source. The second sup- 
ports interactive and semi-automatic generation and 
testing of target lexical entries in order to derive a size- 
able, accurate and consistent lexicon from the source 
dictionary which contains partial (and occasionally in- 
accurate) information. Finally, we evaluate the utility 
of the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary EnglgsA as 
a suitable source dictionary for the target lexicon.
