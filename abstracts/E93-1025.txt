 
We give an analysis of ellipsis resolution 
in terms of a straightforward iscourse 
copying algorithm that correctly predicts 
a wide range of phenomena. The treat- 
ment does not suffer from problems inher- 
ent in identity-of-relations analyses. Fur- 
thermore, in contrast o the approach of 
Dalrymple t al. \[1991\], the treatment di- 
rectly encodes the intuitive distinction be- 
tween full NPs and the referential elements 
that corefer with them through what we 
term role linking. The correct predictions 
for several problematic examples of ellip- 
sis naturally result. Finally, the analysis 
extends directly to other discourse copying 
phenomena.
