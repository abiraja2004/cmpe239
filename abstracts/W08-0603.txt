An adaptable relation extraction system for the
biomedical domain is presented. The system
makes use of a large set of contextual and shal-
low syntactic features, which can be automati-
cally optimised for each relation type. The sys-
tem is tested on three different relation types;
protein-protein interactions, tissue expression
relations and fragment to parent protein rela-
tions.
