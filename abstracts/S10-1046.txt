In this paper, we describe the system sub-
mitted by the team TUD to Task 8 at
SemEval 2010. The challenge focused on
the identification of semantic relations be-
tween pairs of nominals in sentences col-
lected from the web. We applied max-
imum entropy classification using both
lexical and syntactic features to describe
the nominals and their context. In addi-
tion, we experimented with features de-
scribing the semantic relatedness (SR) be-
tween the target nominals and a set of clue
words characteristic to the relations. Our
best submission with SR features achieved
69.23% macro-averaged F-measure, pro-
viding 8.73% improvement over our base-
line system. Thus, we think SR can serve
as a natural way to incorporate external
knowledge to relation classification.
