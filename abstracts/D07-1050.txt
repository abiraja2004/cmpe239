We present results that show that incorporat-
ing lexical and structural semantic informa-
tion is effective for word sense disambigua-
tion. We evaluated the method by using pre-
cise information from a large treebank and
an ontology automatically created from dic-
tionary sentences. Exploiting rich semantic
and structural information improves preci-
sion 2?3%. The most gains are seen with
verbs, with an improvement of 5.7% over a
model using only bag of words and n-gram
features.
