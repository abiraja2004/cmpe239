 
We propose a gold standard for evaluating two 
types of information extraction output -- noun 
phrase (NP) chunks (Abney 1991; Ramshaw and 
Marcus 1995) and technical terms (Justeson and 
Katz 1995; Daille 2000; Jacquemin 2002). The 
gold standard is built around the notion that since 
different semantic and syntactic variants of terms 
are arguably correct, a fully satisfactory assess-
ment of the quality of the output must include 
task-based evaluation. We conducted an experi-
ment that assessed subjects? choice of index terms 
in an information access task. Subjects showed 
significant preference for index terms that are 
longer, as measured by number of words, and 
more complex, as measured by number of prepo-
sitions. These terms, which were identified by a 
human indexer, serve as the gold standard. The 
experimental protocol is a reliable and rigorous 
method for evaluating the quality of a set of terms. 
An important advantage of this task-based evalua-
tion is that a set of index terms which is different 
than the gold standard can ?win? by providing 
better information access than the gold standard 
itself does. And although the individual human 
subject experiments are time consuming, the ex-
perimental interface, test materials and data 
analysis programs are completely re-usable.
