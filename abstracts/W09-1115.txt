In this paper we investigate the task of auto-
matic generation of slide presentations from
academic papers, focusing initially on slide
to paper alignment. We compare and eval-
uate four different alignment systems which
utilize various combinations of methods used
widely in other alignment and question an-
swering approaches, such as TF-IDF term
weighting and query expansion. Our best
aligner achieves an accuracy of 75% and our
findings show that for this application, av-
erage TF-IDF scoring performs more poorly
than a simpler method based on the number of
matched terms, and query expansion degrades
aligner performance.
