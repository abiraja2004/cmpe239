We investigate methods for evaluating
agreement among a relatively large group
of annotators who have not received exten-
sive training and differ in terms of ability
and motivation. We show that it is possi-
ble to isolate a reliable subgroup of anno-
tators, so that aspects of the difficulty of
the underlying task can be studied. Our
task is to annotate the argumentative struc-
ture of short texts.
