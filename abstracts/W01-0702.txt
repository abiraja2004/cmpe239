Memory-based learning (MBL) has
enjoyed considerable success in
corpus-based natural language process-
ing (NLP) tasks and is thus a reliable
method of getting a high-level of per-
formance when building corpus-based
NLP systems. However there is a
bottleneck in MBL whereby any novel
testing item has to be compared against
all the training items in memory base.
For this reason there has been some
interest in various forms of memory
editing whereby some method of
selecting a subset of the memory base
is employed to reduce the number of
comparisons. This paper investigates
the use of a modified self-organising
map (SOM) to select a subset of the
memory items for comparison. This
method involves reducing the number
of comparisons to a value proportional
to the square root of the number of
training items. The method is tested on
the identification of base noun-phrases
in the Wall Street Journal corpus,
using sections 15 to 18 for training and
section 20 for testing.
