This paper describes the clustering-based
approach to Word Sense Disambiguation
that is followed by the TKB-UO system at
SemEval-2007. The underlying disambigua-
tion method only uses WordNet as external
resource, and does not use training data. Re-
sults obtained in both Coarse-grained En-
glish all-words task (task 7) and English
fine-grained all-words subtask (task 17) are
presented.
