This paper presents the results from the
ACL-SIGHAN-sponsored First Interna-
tional Chinese Word Segmentation Bake-
off held in 2003 and reported in con-
junction with the Second SIGHAN Work-
shop on Chinese Language Processing,
Sapporo, Japan. We give the motivation
for having an international segmentation
contest (given that there have been two
within-China contests to date) and we re-
port on the results of this first international
contest, analyze these results, and make
some recommendations for the future.
