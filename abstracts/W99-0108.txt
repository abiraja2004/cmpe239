 
In order to produce coherent text. natural lan- 
guage generation systems must have the ability 
to generate pronouns in the appropriate places. 
In the past, pronoun usage was primarily inves- 
tigated with respect to the accessibility of ref- 
erents. We.argue that generating appropriate 
referring expressions requires looking at fac- 
tors beyond accessibility. Also important are 
sentence boundaries, distance from last men- 
tion, discourse structure and ambiguity. We 
present an algorithm for generating appropri- 
ate anaphoric expressions which takes the tent+ 
poral structure of texts and knowledge about 
ambiguous contexts into account. We back up 
our hypotheses with some empirical results in- 
dicating that our algorithm chooses the right 
referring expression i 85% of the cases.
