(2010) in investigating the lexical organization 
of verbs. Particularly, we look at the influence 
of frequency on the process of lexical acquis i-
tion and use. We examine data obtained from 
psycholinguistic action naming  tasks per-
formed by children and adults (speakers of 
Brazilian Portuguese), and analyze some cha-
racteristics of the verbs used by each group in 
terms of similarity of content, using Jaccard?s 
coefficient, and of topology, using graph 
theory. The experiments suggest that younger 
children tend to use more frequent verbs than 
adults to describe events in the world.
