. This paper suggests a methodology which is aimed to extract the 
terminologically relevant collocations for translation purposes. Our basic idea is 
to use a hybrid method which combines the statistical method and linguistic 
rules. The extraction system used in our work operated at three steps: (1) 
Tokenization and POS tagging of the corpus; (2) Extraction of multi-word units 
using statistical measure; (3) Linguistic filtering to make use of syntactic 
patterns and stop-word list. As a result, hybrid method using linguistic filters 
proved to be a suitable method for selecting terminological collocations, it has 
considerably improved the precision of the extraction which is much higher 
than that of purely statistical method. In our test, hybrid method combining 
?Log-likelihood ratio? and ?linguistic rules? had the best performance in the 
extraction. We believe that terminological collocations and phrases extracted in 
this way, could be used effectively either to supplement existing terminological 
collections or to be used in addition to traditional reference works.
