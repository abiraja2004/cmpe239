We present a new edition of the Google Books
Ngram Corpus, which describes how often
words and phrases were used over a period
of five centuries, in eight languages; it reflects
6% of all books ever published. This new edi-
tion introduces syntactic annotations: words
are tagged with their part-of-speech, and head-
modifier relationships are recorded. The an-
notations are produced automatically with sta-
tistical models that are specifically adapted to
historical text. The corpus will facilitate the
study of linguistic trends, especially those re-
lated to the evolution of syntax.
