This paper presents an evaluation
method employing a latent variable
model for paraphrases with their con-
texts. We assume that the context of a
sentence is indicated by a latent vari-
able of the model as a topic and that
the likelihood of each variable can be
inferred. A paraphrase is evaluated
for whether its sentences are used in
the same context. Experimental re-
sults showed that the proposed method
achieves almost 60% accuracy and that
there is not a large performance differ-
ence between the two models. The re-
sults also revealed an upper bound of
accuracy of 77% with the method when
using only topic information.
