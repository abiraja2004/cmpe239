In complex grammar-based systems, even
small changes may have an unforeseeable
impact on overall system performance. Re-
gression testing of the system and its com-
ponents becomes crucial for the grammar
engineers developing the system. As part
of this regression testing, the testsuites
themselves must be designed to accurately
assess coverage and progress and to help
rapidly identify problems. We describe
a system of passage-query pairs divided
into three types of phenomenon-based test-
suites (sanity, query, basic correct). These
allow for rapid development and for spe-
cific coverage assessment. In addition,
real-world testsuites allow for overall per-
formance and coverage assessment. These
testsuites are used in conjunction with the
more traditional representation-based re-
gression testsuites used by grammar engi-
neers.
