Deidentification of clinical records is a
crucial step before these records can be
distributed to non-hospital researchers.
Most approaches to deidentification rely
heavily on dictionaries and heuristic rules;
these approaches fail to remove most per-
sonal health information (PHI) that cannot
be found in dictionaries. They also can fail
to remove PHI that is ambiguous between
PHI and non-PHI.
Named entity recognition (NER) tech-
nologies can be used for deidentification.
Some of these technologies exploit both
local and global context of a word to iden-
tify its entity type. When documents are
grammatically written, global context can
improve NER.
In this paper, we show that we can dei-
dentify medical discharge summaries us-
ing support vector machines that rely on a
statistical representation of local context.
We compare our approach with three dif-
ferent systems. Comparison with a rule-
based approach shows that a statistical
representation of local context contributes
more to deidentification than dictionaries
and hand-tailored heuristics. Compari-
son with two well-known systems, SNoW
and IdentiFinder, shows that when the lan-
guage of documents is fragmented, local
context contributes more to deidentifica-
tion than global context.
