The availability of databases of images labeled
with keywords is necessary for developing and
evaluating image annotation models. Dataset
collection is however a costly and time con-
suming task. In this paper we exploit the vast
resource of images available on the web. We
create a database of pictures that are natu-
rally embedded into news articles and propose
to use their captions as a proxy for annota-
tion keywords. Experimental results show that
an image annotation model can be developed
on this dataset alne without the overhead of
manual annotation. We also demonstrate that
the news article associated with the picture
can be used to boost image annotation perfor-
mance.
