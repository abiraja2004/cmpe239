 
This paper proposes a new approach to 
phrase rescoring for statistical machine 
translation (SMT).  A set of novel fea-
tures capturing the translingual equiva-
lence between a source and a target 
phrase pair are introduced. These features 
are combined with linear regression 
model and neural network to predict the 
quality score of the phrase translation 
pair. These phrase scores are used to dis-
criminatively rescore the baseline MT 
system?s phrase library: boost good 
phrase translations while prune bad ones. 
This approach not only significantly im-
proves machine translation quality, but 
also reduces the model size by a consid-
erable margin.
