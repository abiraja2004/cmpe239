This paper describes the University of North
Texas SUBFINDER system. The system is
able to provide the most likely set of sub-
stitutes for a word in a given context, by
combining several techniques and knowl-
edge sources. SUBFINDER has successfully
participated in the best and out of ten (oot)
tracks in the SEMEVAL lexical substitution
task, consistently ranking in the first or sec-
ond place.
