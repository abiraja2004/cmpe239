 
Named Entity Recognition is one of the 
key techniques in the fields of natural 
language processing, information retrieval, 
question answering and so on. 
Unfortunately, Chinese Named Entity 
Recognition (NER) is more difficult for 
the lack of capitalization information and 
the uncertainty in word segmentation. In 
this paper, we present a hybrid algorithm 
which can combine a class-based 
statistical model with various types of 
human knowledge very well. In order to 
avoid data sparseness problem, we 
employ a back-off model and?????
?/TONG YI CI CI LIN? , a Chinese 
thesaurus, to smooth the parameters in the 
model. The F-measure of person names, 
location names, and organization names 
on the newswire test data for the 1999 
IEER evaluation in Mandarin is 86.84%, 
84.40% and 76.22% respectively.
