What makes a poem beautiful? We use
computational methods to compare the stylis-
tic and content features employed by award-
winning poets and amateur poets. Building
upon existing techniques designed to quanti-
tatively analyze style and affect in texts, we
examined elements of poetic craft such as dic-
tion, sound devices, emotive language, and
imagery. Results showed that the most impor-
tant indicator of high-quality poetry we could
detect was the frequency of references to con-
crete objects. This result highlights the influ-
ence of Imagism in contemporary professional
poetry, and suggests that concreteness may be
one of the most appealing features of poetry to
the modern aesthetic. We also report on other
features that characterize high-quality poetry
and argue that methods from computational
linguistics may provide important insights into
the analysis of beauty in verbal art.
