 
This paper documents the participation of the 
Research Institute for Artificial Intelligence of 
the Romanian Academy (RACAI) to the Task 
17 ? All-words Word Sense Disambiguation 
on a Specific Domain, of the SemEval-2 com-
petition. We describe three unsupervised WSD 
systems that make extensive use of the Prince-
ton WordNet (WN) structure and WordNet 
Domains in order to perform the disambigua-
tion. The best of them has been ranked the 12th 
by the task organizers out of 29 judged runs.
