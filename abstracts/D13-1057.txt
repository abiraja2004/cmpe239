Coreference resolution is a well known clus-
tering task in Natural Language Processing. In
this paper, we describe the Latent Left Linking
model (L3M), a novel, principled, and linguis-
tically motivated latent structured prediction
approach to coreference resolution. We show
that L3M admits efficient inference and can be
augmented with knowledge-based constraints;
we also present a fast stochastic gradient based
learning. Experiments on ACE and Ontonotes
data show that L3M and its constrained ver-
sion, CL3M, are more accurate than several
state-of-the-art approaches as well as some
structured prediction models proposed in the
literature.
