 
This research is aimed at the problem of 
disambiguating toponyms (place names) 
in terms of a classification derived by 
merging information from two publicly 
available gazetteers. To establish the dif-
ficulty of the problem, we measured the 
degree of ambiguity, with respect to a 
gazetteer, for toponyms in news. We 
found that 67.82% of the toponyms found 
in a corpus that were ambiguous in a gaz-
etteer lacked a local discriminator in the 
text. Given the scarcity of human-
annotated data, our method used unsuper-
vised machine learning to develop disam-
biguation rules. Toponyms were 
automatically tagged with information 
about them found in a gazetteer. A 
toponym that was ambiguous in the gazet-
teer was automatically disambiguated 
based on preference heuristics. This 
automatically tagged data was used to 
train a machine learner, which disambigu-
ated toponyms in a human-annotated 
news corpus at 78.5% accuracy.
