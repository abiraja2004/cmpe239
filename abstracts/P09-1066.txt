 
This paper presents collaborative decoding 
(co-decoding), a new method to improve ma-
chine translation accuracy by leveraging trans-
lation consensus between multiple machine 
translation decoders. Different from system 
combination and MBR decoding, which post-
process the n-best lists or word lattice of ma-
chine translation decoders, in our method mul-
tiple machine translation decoders collaborate 
by exchanging partial translation results. Us-
ing an iterative decoding approach, n-gram 
agreement statistics between translations of 
multiple decoders are employed to re-rank 
both full and partial hypothesis explored in 
decoding. Experimental results on data sets for 
NIST Chinese-to-English machine translation 
task show that the co-decoding method can 
bring significant improvements to all baseline 
decoders, and the outputs from co-decoding 
can be used to further improve the result of 
system combination.
