This article describes the implementation
of Word Sense Disambiguation system that
participated in the SemEval-2007 multilin-
gual Chinese-English lexical sample task.
We adopted a supervised learning approach
with Maximum Entropy classifier. The fea-
tures used were neighboring words and their
part-of-speech, as well as single words in the
context, and other syntactic features based
on shallow parsing. In addition, we used
word category information of a Chinese the-
saurus as features for verb disambiguation.
For the task we participated in, we obtained
precision of 0.716 in micro-average, which
is the best among all participated systems.
