One common mistake made by non-native
speakers of English is to drop the articles a, an,
or the. We apply the log-linear model to auto-
matically restore missing articles based on fea-
tures of the noun phrase. We first show that the
model yields competitive results in article gen-
eration. Further, we describe methods to adjust
the model with respect to the initial quality of
the sentence. Our best results are 20.5% arti-
cle error rate (insertions, deletions and substi-
tutions) for sentences where 30% of the articles
have been dropped, and 38.5% for those where
70% of the articles have been dropped.
