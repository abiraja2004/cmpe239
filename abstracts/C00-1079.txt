 
Due to grammatical similarities, even a 
one-to-one mapping between Korean and 
Japanese words (or morphemes) can usually 
result in a high quality Korean-to-Japanese 
machine translation. However, multi-word 
translation units (MWTU) such as idioms, 
compound words, etc., need an n-to-m 
mapping, and their component words often 
do not appear adjacently, resulting in a 
discontinuous MWTU. During translation, 
the MWTU should be treated as one lexical 
item rather than a phrase. In this paper, we 
define the types of MWTUs and propose 
their representation a d recognition method 
depending on their characteristics in 
Korean-to-Japanese MT system. In an 
experimental evaluation, the proposed 
method turned out to be very effective in 
handling MWTUs, showing an average 
recognition accuracy of 98.4% and a fast 
recognition time.
