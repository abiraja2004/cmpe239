Since written Chinese has no space to de-
limit words, segmenting Chinese texts be-
comes an essential task. During this task,
the problem of unknown word occurs. It is
impossible to register all words in a dictio-
nary as new words can always be created
by combining characters. We propose a
unified solution to detect unknown words
in Chinese texts. First, a morphological
analysis is done to obtain initial segmen-
tation and POS tags and then a chunker is
used to detect unknown words.
