: Causation is a very pervasive 
phenomenom in natural language which can be 
expressed by numerous linguistic alternatives. 
Any language user or natural language 
generation system is thus confronted with the 
.problem of choosing one alternative over 
another. In this paper, I analyze the semantic 
constraints determining the selection of analytic 
causatives in Dutch and how this can be 
accounted for in a systemic functional 
generation system. 
Keywords: Multilingual Text Generation, 
Systexiaic Functional Linguistics, Analytic 
causatives, Dutch.
