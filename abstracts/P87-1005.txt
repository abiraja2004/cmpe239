 
An improved version of IRACQ (for Interpretation 
Rule ACQuisition) is presented. I Our approach to 
semantic knowledge acquisition: 1 ) is in the context of 
a general purpose NL interface rather than one that 
accesses only databases, 2) employs a knowledge 
representation formalism with limited inferencing 
capabilities, 3) assumes a trained person but not an 
AI expert, and 4) provides a complete environment for 
not only acquiring semantic knowledge, but also main- 
taining and editing it in a consistent knowledge base. 
IRACQ is currently in use at the Naval Ocean Sys- 
tems Center.
