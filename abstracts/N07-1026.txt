Graph-based semi-supervised learning has
recently emerged as a promising approach
to data-sparse learning problems in natu-
ral language processing. All graph-based
algorithms rely on a graph that jointly rep-
resents labeled and unlabeled data points.
The problem of how to best construct this
graph remains largely unsolved. In this
paper we introduce a data-driven method
that optimizes the representation of the
initial feature space for graph construc-
tion by means of a supervised classifier.
We apply this technique in the frame-
work of label propagation and evaluate
it on two different classification tasks, a
multi-class lexicon acquisition task and a
word sense disambiguation task. Signifi-
cant improvements are demonstrated over
both label propagation using conventional
graph construction and state-of-the-art su-
pervised classifiers.
