The Duluth Word Alignment System partici-
pated in the 2003 HLT-NAACL Workshop on
Parallel Text shared task on word alignment for
both English?French and Romanian?English.
It is a Perl implementation of IBM Model 2.
We used approximately 50,000 aligned sen-
tences as training data for each language pair,
and found the results for Romanian?English to
be somewhat better. We also varied the Model
2 distortion parameters among the values 2, 4,
and 6, but did not observe any significant dif-
ferences in performance as a result.
