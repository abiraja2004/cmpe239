We describe our system for the CoNLL-2012
shared task, which seeks to model corefer-
ence in OntoNotes for English, Chinese, and
Arabic. We adopt a hybrid approach to
coreference resolution, which combines the
strengths of rule-based methods and learning-
based methods. Our official combined score
over all three languages is 56.35. In particu-
lar, our score on the Chinese test set is the best
among the participating teams.
