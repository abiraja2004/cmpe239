We describe an experiment on a temporal or-
dering task in this paper. We show that by se-
lecting event pairs based on discourse struc-
ture and by modifying the pre-existent tem-
poral classification scheme to fit the data bet-
ter, we significantly improve inter-annotator
agreement, as well as broaden the coverage of
the task. We also present analysis of the cur-
rent temporal classification scheme and pro-
pose ways to improve it in future work.
