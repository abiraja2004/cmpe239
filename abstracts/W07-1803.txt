We present two experiments in the localiza-
tion of spoken dialogue systems. The do-
main of the dialogue system is an MP3 ap-
plication for automobiles. In the first expe-
riment, a grammar in Nuance GSL format
was rewritten in Grammatical Framework
(GF). Within GF, the grammar was extended
from two to six languages, giving a baseline
for semantically complete grammars. In the
second experiment, the German version of
this baseline GF grammar was extended with
the goal to restore the coverage of the origi-
nal Nuance grammar.

Part of this work was done under the TALK1 re-
search project, funded by EU FP6 [ref. 507802].
The Nuance grammar was written by Jochen
Steigner, Peter Poller, and Rosemary Stegmann. The
first GF experiment was made together with Bjo?rn
Bringert. The Spanish grammar was written to-
gether with Libertad Tansini.
