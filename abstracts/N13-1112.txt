We examine the task of temporal relation clas-
sification. Unlike existing approaches to this
task, we (1) classify an event-event or event-
time pair as one of the 14 temporal relations
defined in the TimeBank corpus, rather than
as one of the six relations collapsed from the
original 14; (2) employ sophisticated linguis-
tic knowledge derived from a variety of se-
mantic and discourse relations, rather than fo-
cusing on morpho-syntactic knowledge; and
(3) leverage a novel combination of rule-based
and learning-based approaches, rather than re-
lying solely on one or the other. Experiments
with the TimeBank corpus demonstrate that
our knowledge-rich, hybrid approach yields
a 15?16% relative reduction in error over a
state-of-the-art learning-based baseline sys-
tem.
