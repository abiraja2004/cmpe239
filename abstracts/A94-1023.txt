 
Biological specimens have historically been la- 
beled with English descriptions of the location 
of collection. To perform spatial, statistical, 
or historic studies, these descriptions must be 
converted into geodetic oordinates. A study 
of the sublanguage used in the descriptions 
shows much less frequent than typical usage of 
observer-relative relations uch as "left of," but 
shows problems with name ambiguity, finding 
the referents of generic terms like "the stream," 
ordinal numbering of river forks and valley 
branches, object-oriented prepositions ("be- 
hind"), fuzzy boundaries (how close is "at," 
how far is still "north of"), etc. The LEI system 
implements a semi-automated understanding 
of such location descriptions. Components of 
LEI include a language analyzer, a geograph- 
ical reasoner, an object-oriented geographic 
knowledge base derived from US Geological 
Survey digital maps with user input, and a 
graphical user interface. LEI parses preposi- 
tional phrases into spatial relations, converts 
these into areas, then computes polygon over- 
lays to find the intersection, and returns the 
minimum bounding rectangle. The user is con- 
suited on unknown words/phrases and ambigu- 
ous descriptions.
