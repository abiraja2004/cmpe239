Though the utility of domain
Ontologies is now widely
acknowledged in the IT (Information
Technology) community, several
barriers must be overcome before
Ontologies become practical and
useful tools. One important
achievement would be to reduce the
cost of identifying and manually
entering several thousand-concept
descriptions. This paper describes a
text mining technique to aid an
Ontology Engineer to identify the
important concepts in a Domain
Ontology.
