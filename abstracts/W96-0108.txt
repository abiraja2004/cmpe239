 
This paper describes an automatic, ontext-sensitive, word-error correction system based 
on statistical language modeling (SLM) as applied to optical character recognition (OCR) post- 
processing. The system exploits information from multiple sources, including letter n-grams, 
character confusion probabilities, and word-bigram probabilities. Letter n-grams are used to 
index the words in the lexicon. Given a sentence to be corrected, the system decomposes ach 
string in the sentence into letter n-grams and retrieves word candidates from the lexicon by 
comparing string n-grams with lexicon-entry n-grams. The retrieved candidates are ranked by 
the conditional probability of matches with the string, given character confusion probabilities. 
Finally, the wordobigram odel and Viterbi algorithm are used to determine the best scoring 
word sequence for the sentence. The system can correct non-word errors as well as real-word 
errors and achieves a 60.2% error reduction rate for real OCR text. In addition, the system can 
learn the character confusion probabilities for a specific OCR environment and use them in 
self-calibration toachieve better performance.
