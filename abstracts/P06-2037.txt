This paper studies the enrichment of Span-
ish WordNet with synset glosses automat-
ically obtained from the English Word-
Net glosses using a phrase-based Statisti-
cal Machine Translation system. We con-
struct the English-Spanish translation sys-
tem from a parallel corpus of proceed-
ings of the European Parliament, and study
how to adapt statistical models to the do-
main of dictionary definitions. We build
specialized language and translation mod-
els from a small set of parallel definitions
and experiment with robust manners to
combine them. A statistically significant
increase in performance is obtained. The
best system is finally used to generate a
definition for all Spanish synsets, which
are currently ready for a manual revision.
As a complementary issue, we analyze the
impact of the amount of in-domain data
needed to improve a system trained en-
tirely on out-of-domain data.
