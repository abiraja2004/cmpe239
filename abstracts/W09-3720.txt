We present an approach to disambiguating verb senses which differ
w.r.t. the inferences they allow. It combines standard ontological tools
and formalisms with a formal semantic analysis and is hence more
formalised and more detailed than existing lexical semantic resources
like WordNet and FrameNet [Fellbaum, 1998, Baker et al, 1998]. The
resource presented here implements formal semantic descriptions of
verbs in the Web Ontology Language (OWL) and exploits its reasoning
potential based on Description Logics (DL) for the disambiguation of
verbs in context, since before the correct sense of a verb can be reliably
determined, its syntactic arguments have to be disambiguated first. We
present details on this process, which is based on a mapping from the
French EuroWordNet [Vossen, 1998] to SUMO [Niles and Pease, 2003].
Moreover, we focus on the selectional restrictions of verbs w.r.t. the
ontological type of their arguments, as well as their representation as
necessary and sufficient conditions in the TBox. After a DL reasoner
has identified the verb sense on the basis of these conditions, we make
use of the more expressive Semantic Web Rule Language to calculate
the inferences that are permitted on the selected interpretation.
