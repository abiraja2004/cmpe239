  
Dynamic lexical acquisition is a procedure 
where the lexicon of an NLP system is 
updated automatically during sentence 
analysis.  In our system, new words and new 
attributes are proposed online according to 
the context of each sentence, and then get 
accepted or rejected during syntactic analysis.  
The accepted lexical information is stored in 
an auxiliary lexicon which can be used in 
conjunction with the existing dictionary in 
subsequent processing.  In this way, we are 
able to process sentences with an incomplete 
lexicon and fill in the missing info without 
the need of human editing.  As the auxiliary 
lexicons are corpus-based, domain-specific 
dictionaries can be created automatically by 
combining the existing dictionary with 
different auxiliary lexicons.  Evaluation 
shows that this mechanism significantly 
improves the coverage of our parser.
