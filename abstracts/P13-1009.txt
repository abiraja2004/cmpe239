Temporal resolution systems are tradition-
ally tuned to a particular language, re-
quiring significant human effort to trans-
late them to new languages. We present
a language independent semantic parser
for learning the interpretation of tempo-
ral phrases given only a corpus of utter-
ances and the times they reference. We
make use of a latent parse that encodes
a language-flexible representation of time,
and extract rich features over both the
parse and associated temporal semantics.
The parameters of the model are learned
using a weakly supervised bootstrapping
approach, without the need for manually
tuned parameters or any other language
expertise. We achieve state-of-the-art ac-
curacy on all languages in the TempEval-
2 temporal normalization task, reporting
a 4% improvement in both English and
Spanish accuracy, and to our knowledge
the first results for four other languages.
