Speech-to-speech translation can be ap-
proached using finite state models and
several ideas borrowed from automatic
speech recognition. The models can be
Hidden Markov Models for the accous-
tic part, language models for the source
language and finite state transducers for
the transfer between the source and target
language. A ?serial architecture? would
use the Hidden Markov and the language
models for recognizing input utterance
and the transducer for finding the transla-
tion. An ?integrated architecture?, on the
other hand, would integrate all the mod-
els in a single network where the search
process takes place. The output of this
search process is the target word sequence
associated to the optimal path. In both
architectures, HMMs can be trained from
a source-language speech corpus, and the
translation model can be learned automat-
ically from a parallel text training cor-
pus. The experiments presented here cor-
respond to speech-input translations from
Spanish to English and from Italian to En-
glish, in applications involving the inter-
action (by telephone) of a customer with
the front-desk of a hotel.
