The empirical adequacy of synchronous
context-free grammars of rank two (2-SCFGs)
(Satta and Peserico, 2005), used in syntax-
based machine translation systems such as
Wu (1997), Zhang et al (2006) and Chi-
ang (2007), in terms of what alignments they
induce, has been discussed in Wu (1997) and
Wellington et al (2006), but with a one-sided
focus on so-called ?inside-out alignments?.
Other alignment configurations that cannot be
induced by 2-SCFGs are identified in this pa-
per, and their frequencies across a wide col-
lection of hand-aligned parallel corpora are
examined. Empirical lower bounds on two
measures of alignment error rate, i.e. the one
introduced in Och and Ney (2000) and one
where only complete translation units are con-
sidered, are derived for 2-SCFGs and related
formalisms.
