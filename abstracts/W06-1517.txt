The ability to represent cross-serial depen-
dencies is one of the central features of
Tree Adjoining Grammar (TAG). The class
of dependency structures representable by
lexicalized TAG derivations can be captured
by two graph-theoretic properties: a bound
on the gap degree of the structures, and a
constraint called well-nestedness. In this
paper, we compare formalisms from two
strands of extensions to TAG in the context
of the question, how they behave with re-
spect to these constraints. In particular, we
show that multi-component TAG does not
necessarily retain the well-nestedness con-
straint, while this constraint is inherent to
Coupled Context-Free Grammar (Hotz and
Pitsch, 1996).
