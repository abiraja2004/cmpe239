We present a novel learning framework for
pipeline models aimed at improving the com-
munication between consecutive stages in a
pipeline. Our method exploits the confidence
scores associated with outputs at any given
stage in a pipeline in order to compute prob-
abilistic features used at other stages down-
stream. We describe a simple method of in-
tegrating probabilistic features into the linear
scoring functions used by state of the art ma-
chine learning algorithms. Experimental eval-
uation on dependency parsing and named en-
tity recognition demonstrate the superiority of
our approach over the baseline pipeline mod-
els, especially when upstream stages in the
pipeline exhibit low accuracy.
