The paper is about the issue of addressing in
multi-party dialogues. Analysis of addressing
behavior in face to face meetings results in
the identification of several addressing mech-
anisms. From these we extract several utter-
ance features and features of non-verbal com-
municative behavior of a speaker, like gaze
and gesturing, that are relevant for observers to
identify the participants the speaker is talking
to. A method for the automatic prediction of
the addressee of speech acts is discussed.
