In this paper a novel solution to auto-
matic and unsupervised word sense induc-
tion (WSI) is introduced. It represents an
instantiation of the ?one sense per colloca-
tion? observation (Gale et al, 1992). Like
most existing approaches it utilizes clus-
tering of word co-occurrences. This ap-
proach differs from other approaches to
WSI in that it enhances the effect of the
one sense per collocation observation by
using triplets of words instead of pairs.
The combination with a two-step cluster-
ing process using sentence co-occurrences
as features allows for accurate results. Ad-
ditionally, a novel and likewise automatic
and unsupervised evaluation method in-
spired by Schu?tze?s (1992) idea of evalu-
ation of word sense disambiguation algo-
rithms is employed. Offering advantages
like reproducability and independency of
a given biased gold standard it also en-
ables automatic parameter optimization of
the WSI algorithm.
