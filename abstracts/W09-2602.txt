This paper reports on the develop-
ment of a core semantics for German
which was implemented on the ba-
sis of an English semantics that con-
verts LFG f-structures to flat meaning
representations in a Neo-Davidsonian
style. Thanks to the parallel design
of the broad-coverage LFG grammars
written in the context of the ParGram
project (Butt et al, 2002) and the
general surface independence of LFG
f-structure analyses, the development
process was substantially facilitated.
We also discuss the overall architec-
ture of the semantic conversion sys-
tem from a crosslinguistic, theoretical
perspective.
