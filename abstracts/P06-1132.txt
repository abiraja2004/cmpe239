 
Japanese case markers, which indicate the gram-
matical relation of the complement NP to the 
predicate, often pose challenges to the generation 
of Japanese text, be it done by a foreign language 
learner, or by a machine translation (MT) system. 
In this paper, we describe the task of predicting 
Japanese case markers and propose machine 
learning methods for solving it in two settings: (i) 
monolingual, when given information only from 
the Japanese sentence; and (ii) bilingual, when 
also given information from a corresponding Eng-
lish source sentence in an MT context. We formu-
late the task after the well-studied task of English 
semantic role labelling, and explore features from 
a syntactic dependency structure of the sentence. 
For the monolingual task, we evaluated our models 
on the Kyoto Corpus and achieved over 84% ac-
curacy in assigning correct case markers for each 
phrase. For the bilingual task, we achieved an ac-
curacy of 92% per phrase using a bilingual dataset 
from a technical domain. We show that in both 
settings, features that exploit dependency informa-
tion, whether derived from gold-standard annota-
tions or automatically assigned, contribute signifi-
cantly to the prediction of case markers.1
