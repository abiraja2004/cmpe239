Tree-to-string systems (and their forest-
based extensions) have gained steady pop-
ularity thanks to their simplicity and effi-
ciency, but there is a major limitation: they
are unable to guarantee the grammatical-
ity of the output, which is explicitly mod-
eled in string-to-tree systems via target-
side syntax. We thus propose to com-
bine the advantages of both, and present
a novel constituency-to-dependency trans-
lation model, which uses constituency
forests on the source side to direct the
translation, and dependency trees on the
target side (as a language model) to en-
sure grammaticality. Medium-scale exper-
iments show an absolute and statistically
significant improvement of +0.7 BLEU
points over a state-of-the-art forest-based
tree-to-string system even with fewer
rules. This is also the first time that a tree-
to-tree model can surpass tree-to-string
counterparts.
