In this paper we discuss the notions of hy-
pertext, blog, wiki and cognitive mapping
in order to find a solution to the main prob-
lems of processing text data stored in these
forms. We propose the structure and archi-
tecture of Novelle as a new environment
to compose texts. Its flexible model al-
lows the collaboration for contents and a
detailed description of ownership. Data
are stored in a XML repository, so as to
use the capabilities of this language. To
develop quickly and efficiently we choose
AJAX technology over the Ruby on Rails
framework.
