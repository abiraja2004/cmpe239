 
This work evaluates a system that uses in-
terpolated predictions of reading difficulty 
that are based on both vocabulary and 
grammatical features.  The combined ap-
proach is compared to individual gram-
mar- and language modeling-based 
approaches.  While the vocabulary-based 
language modeling approach outper-
formed the grammar-based approach, 
grammar-based predictions can be com-
bined using confidence scores with the 
vocabulary-based predictions to produce 
more accurate predictions of reading dif-
ficulty for both first and second language 
texts.  The results also indicate that gram-
matical features may play a more impor-
tant role in second language readability 
than in first language readability.
