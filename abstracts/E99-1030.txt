 
Lexicon definition is one of the main bot- 
tlenecks in the development of new ap- 
plications in the field of Information Ex- 
traction from text. Generic resources 
(e.g., lexical databases) are promising for 
reducing the cost of specific lexica defi- 
nition, but they introduce lexical ambi- 
guity. This paper proposes a methodol- 
ogy for building application-specific lex- 
ica by using WordNet. Lexical ambiguity 
is kept under control by marking synsets 
in WordNet with field labels taken from 
the Dewey Decimal Classification.
