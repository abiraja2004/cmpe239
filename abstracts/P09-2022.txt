This paper presents a predicate-argument
structure analysis that simultaneously con-
ducts zero-anaphora resolution. By adding
noun phrases as candidate arguments that
are not only in the sentence of the target
predicate but also outside of the sentence,
our analyzer identifies arguments regard-
less of whether they appear in the sen-
tence or not. Because we adopt discrimi-
native models based on maximum entropy
for argument identification, we can easily
add new features. We add language model
scores as well as contextual features. We
also use contextual information to restrict
candidate arguments.
