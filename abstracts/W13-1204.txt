This paper describes an approach for investi-
gating the representation of events and their
distribution in a corpus. We collect and
analyze statistics about subject-verb-object
triplets and their content, which helps us com-
pare corpora belonging to the same domain
but to different genre/text type. We argue that
event structure is strongly related to the genre
of the corpus, and propose statistical proper-
ties that are able to capture these genre differ-
ences. The results obtained can be used for the
improvement of Information Extraction.
