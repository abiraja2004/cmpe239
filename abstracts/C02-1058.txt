An unsupervised method for word sense disam-
biguation using a bilingual comparable corpus was
developed.  First, it extracts statistically significant
pairs of related words from the corpus of each lan-
guage.  Then, aligning pairs of related words
translingually, it calculates the correlation between
the senses of a first-language polysemous word and
the words related to the polysemous word, which
can be regarded as clues for determining the most
suitable sense.  Finally, for each instance of the
polysemous word, it selects the sense that maxi-
mizes the score, i.e., the sum of the correlations
between each sense and the clues appearing in the
context of the instance.  To overcome both the
problem of ambiguity in the translingual alignment
of pairs of related words and that of disparity of
topical coverage between corpora of different lan-
guages, an algorithm for calculating the correlation
between senses and clues iteratively was devised.
An experiment using Wall Street Journal and Ni-
hon Keizai Shimbun corpora showed that the new
method has promising performance; namely, the
applicability and precision of its sense selection are
88.5% and 77.7%, respectively, averaged over 60
test polysemous words.
