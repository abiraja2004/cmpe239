This paper presents an effective dependency
parsing approach of incorporating short de-
pendency information from unlabeled data.
The unlabeled data is automatically parsed
by a deterministic dependency parser, which
can provide relatively high performance for
short dependencies between words. We then
train another parser which uses the informa-
tion on short dependency relations extracted
from the output of the first parser. Our pro-
posed approach achieves an unlabeled at-
tachment score of 86.52, an absolute 1.24%
improvement over the baseline system on
the data set of Chinese Treebank.
