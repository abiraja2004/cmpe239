. Fixed multiword expressions are strings of words which to-
gether behave like a single word. This research establishes a method for
the automatic extraction of such expressions. Our method involves three
stages. In the first, a statistical measure is used to extract candidate bi-
grams. In the second, we use this list to select occurrences of candidate
expressions in a corpus, together with their surrounding contexts. These
examples are used as training data for supervised machine learning, re-
sulting in a classifier which can identify target multiword expressions.
The final stage is the estimation of the part of speech of each extracted
expression based on its context of occurence. Evaluation demonstrated
that collocation measures alone are not effective in identifying target ex-
pressions. However, when trained on one million examples, the classifier
identified target multiword expressions with precision greater than 90%.
Part of speech estimation had precision and recall of over 95%.
