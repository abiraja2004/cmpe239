In situated dialogue, humans and agents have
mismatched capabilities of perceiving the
shared environment. Their representations
of the shared world are misaligned. Thus
referring expression generation (REG) will
need to take this discrepancy into consider-
ation. To address this issue, we developed
a hypergraph-based approach to account for
group-based spatial relations and uncertain-
ties in perceiving the environment. Our em-
pirical results have shown that this approach
outperforms a previous graph-based approach
with an absolute gain of 9%. However, while
these graph-based approaches perform effec-
tively when the agent has perfect knowledge
or perception of the environment (e.g., 84%),
they perform rather poorly when the agent has
imperfect perception of the environment (e.g.,
45%). This big performance gap calls for new
solutions to REG that can mediate a shared
perceptual basis in situated dialogue.
