In this paper we present LXGram, a general purpose grammar for the
deep linguistic processing of Portuguese that aims at delivering detailed
and high precision meaning representations. LXGram is grounded on the
linguistic framework of Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG).
HPSG is a declarative formalism resorting to unification and a type sys-
tem with multiple inheritance. The semantic representations that LX-
Gram associates with linguistic expressions use the Minimal Recursion
Semantics (MRS) format, which allows for the underspecification of scope
effects. LXGram is developed in the Linguistic KnowledgeBuilder (LKB)
system, a grammar development environment that provides debugging
tools and efficient algorithms for parsing and generation. The implemen-
tation of LXGram has focused on the structure of Noun Phrases, and LX-
Gram accounts for many NP related phenomena. Its coverage continues
to be increased with new phenomena, and there is active work on ex-
tending the grammar?s lexicon. We have already integrated, or plan to
integrate, LXGram in a few applications, namely paraphrasing, treebank-
ing and language variant detection. Grammar coverage has been tested
on newspaper text.
