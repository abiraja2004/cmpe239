Broad-coverage corpora annotated with
semantic role, or argument structure, in-
formation are becoming available for the
rst time. Statistical systems have been
trained to automatically label seman-
tic roles from the output of statistical
parsers on unannotated text. In this pa-
per, we quantify the eect of parser accu-
racy on these systems' performance, and
examine the question of whether a at-
ter \chunked" representation of the in-
put can be as eective for the purposes
of semantic role identication.
