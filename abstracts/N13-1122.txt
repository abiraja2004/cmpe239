Information extraction from microblog posts
is an important task, as today microblogs cap-
ture an unprecedented amount of information
and provide a view into the pulse of the world.
As the core component of information extrac-
tion, we consider the task of Twitter entity
linking in this paper.
In the current entity linking literature, mention
detection and entity disambiguation are fre-
quently cast as equally important but distinct
problems. However, in our task, we find that
mention detection is often the performance
bottleneck. The reason is that messages on
micro-blogs are short, noisy and informal texts
with little context, and often contain phrases
with ambiguous meanings.
To rigorously address the Twitter entity link-
ing problem, we propose a structural SVM
algorithm for entity linking that jointly op-
timizes mention detection and entity disam-
biguation as a single end-to-end task. By com-
bining structural learning and a variety of first-
order, second-order, and context-sensitive fea-
tures, our system is able to outperform exist-
ing state-of-the art entity linking systems by
15% F1.
