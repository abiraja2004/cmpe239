We present the novel task of predicting tem-
poral features of continuations of user input,
while that input is still ongoing. We show that
the remaining duration of an ongoing word, as
well as the duration of the next can be predicted
reasonably well, and we put this information to
use in a system that synchronously completes
a user?s speech. While we focus on collabo-
rative completions, the techniques presented
here may also be useful for the alignment of
back-channels and immediate turn-taking in an
incremental SDS, or to synchronously monitor
the user?s speech fluency for other reasons.
