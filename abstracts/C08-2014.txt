We propose a method to obtain subsenten-
tial alignments from several languages si-
multaneously. The method handles sev-
eral languages at once, and avoids the com-
plexity explosion due to the usual pair-by-
pair processing. It can be used for differ-
ent units (characters, morphemes, words,
chunks). An evaluation of word align-
ments with a trilingual machine translation
corpus has been conducted. A comparison
of the results with those obtained by state
of the art alignment software is reported.
