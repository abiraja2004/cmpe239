Although many algorithms have been devel-
oped to harvest lexical resources, few organize
the mined terms into taxonomies. We pro-
pose (1) a semi-supervised algorithm that uses
a root concept, a basic level concept, and re-
cursive surface patterns to learn automatically
from the Web hyponym-hypernym pairs sub-
ordinated to the root; (2) a Web based concept
positioning procedure to validate the learned
pairs? is-a relations; and (3) a graph algorithm
that derives from scratch the integrated tax-
onomy structure of all the terms. Comparing
results with WordNet, we find that the algo-
rithm misses some concepts and links, but also
that it discovers many additional ones lacking
in WordNet. We evaluate the taxonomization
power of our method on reconstructing parts
of the WordNet taxonomy. Experiments show
that starting from scratch, the algorithm can
reconstruct 62% of the WordNet taxonomy for
the regions tested.
