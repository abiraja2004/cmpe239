 
A user-friendly interface to search bilingual 
resources is of great help to NLP developers as 
well as pure-linguists. Using bilingual re-
sources is difficult for linguists who are unfa-
miliar with computation, which hampers capa-
bilities of bilingual resources. NLP developers 
sometimes need a kind of workbench to check 
their resources. The online interface this paper 
introduces can satisfy these needs. In order to 
implement the interface, this research deals 
with how to align Korean and Japanese phras-
es and interpolates them into the original bi-
lingual corpus in an automatic way.
