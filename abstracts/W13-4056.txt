We present two dialogue systems for lan-
guage learning which both restrict the di-
alog to a specific domain thereby pro-
moting robustness and the learning of a
given vocabulary. The systems vary in how
much they constrain the learner?s answer :
one system places no other constrain on
the learner than that provided by the re-
stricted domain and the dialog context ; the
other provides the learner with an exercise
whose solution is the expected answer.
The first system uses supervised learning
for simulating a human tutor whilst the
second one uses natural language gener-
ation techniques to produce grammar ex-
ercises which guide the learner toward the
expected answer.
