We present a method that paraphrases a given
sentence by first generating candidate para-
phrases and then ranking (or classifying)
them. The candidates are generated by ap-
plying existing paraphrasing rules extracted
from parallel corpora. The ranking compo-
nent considers not only the overall quality of
the rules that produced each candidate, but
also the extent to which they preserve gram-
maticality and meaning in the particular con-
text of the input sentence, as well as the de-
gree to which the candidate differs from the
input. We experimented with both a Max-
imum Entropy classifier and an SVR ranker.
Experimental results show that incorporating
features from an existing paraphrase recog-
nizer in the ranking component improves per-
formance, and that our overall method com-
pares well against a state of the art paraphrase
generator, when paraphrasing rules apply to
the input sentences. We also propose a new
methodology to evaluate the ranking compo-
nents of generate-and-rank paraphrase gener-
ators, which evaluates them across different
combinations of weights for grammaticality,
meaning preservation, and diversity. The pa-
per is accompanied by a paraphrasing dataset
we constructed for evaluations of this kind.
