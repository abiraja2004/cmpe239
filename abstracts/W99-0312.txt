 
A mark up language for tagging discourse, 
and for converting discourse sequences into 
a written format, according to highly context 
sensitive procedures, will be illustrated as 
well as a system for document annotation. 
The context in which a given 
communicative intercourse has taken place 
needs to be made available to ensure 
consistent interpretation of both single 
sequences of discourse and global concepts 
that are carried along during the dialogue or 
conversation. Full vis~ility of different 
communicative intentions that reflect the 
evolution of conversations in time and 
space, as well as access to various modes of 
communicative actions and changing 
conditions of interpretation, is relevant and 
necessary, especially in contexts where 
interaction is based upon asynchronous 
communication. Interpretation ~hif~s, that 
each sequence of a dialogue is likely to 
undergo, may create distortions in the 
interpretation of the overall intercourse and 
communicative action leading to the 
creation of the final document. Some 
contextual concretions, which may be based 
upon false assumptions, are particularly 
powerful Persistent interpretative links 
may be evoked and activated at any time, 
even if unintentionally. Special attention 
needs to be paid to ensure that undesirable 
links are not established and unintentional 
contextual concretions are not added. Use 
of a consistently applied, commonly shared 
conceptual tool for assit~ning context- 
sensitive interpretative values to each 
sequence of discourse holds great promise 
for avoidance of this problem Appropriately 
packaged ocuments and parts of documents 
could carry along their own originating 
context of discourse in the form of attached 
information. Accurate illustrations using a 
fidly functional set of tools I have developed 
are provided here to show how fi~zziness 
and misinterpretation (caused by an absence 
of consistent interpretative clues about 
originating contextual conditions for 
discourse and conversations) may be 
significantly reduced or even eliminated.
