In the current work, we focus on systems that
provide incremental directions and monitor
the progress of mobile users following those
directions. Such directions are based on dy-
namic quantities like the visibility of reference
points and their distance from the user. An
intelligent navigation assistant might take ad-
vantage of the user?s mobility within the set-
ting to achieve communicative goals, for ex-
ample, by repositioning him to a point from
which a description of the target is easier to
produce. Calculating spatial variables over a
corpus of human-human data developed for
this study, we trained a classifier to detect con-
texts in which a target object can be felici-
tously described. Our algorithm matched the
human subjects with 86% precision.
