This paper presents a first-order logic learn-
ing approach to determine rhetorical relations
between discourse segments. Beyond lin-
guistic cues and lexical information, our ap-
proach exploits compositional semantics and
segment discourse structure data. We report
a statistically significant improvement in clas-
sifying relations over attribute-value learn-
ing paradigms such as Decision Trees, RIP-
PER and Naive Bayes. For discourse pars-
ing, our modified shift-reduce parsing model
that uses our relation classifier significantly
outperforms a right-branching majority-class
baseline.
