In order to pursue research on generating
referring expressions in a situated collab-
oration task, we set up a data-collection
experiment based on the Tangram puzzle.
For a pair of participants we recorded ev-
ery utterance in synchronisation with the
current state of the puzzle as well as all
operations by the participants. Referring
expressions were annotated with their ref-
erents in order to build a referring expres-
sion corpus in Japanese. We provide pre-
liminary results on the analysis of the cor-
pus from various standpoints, focussing on
action-mentioning expressions.
