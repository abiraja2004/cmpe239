Lockheed Martin?s Advanced Technology Lab-
oratories has been designing, developing, test-
ing, and evaluating spoken language under-
standing systems in several unique operational
environments over the past five years. Through
these experiences we have encountered numer-
ous challenges in making each system become
an integral part of a user?s operations. In this
paper, we discuss these challenges and report
how we overcame them with respect to a num-
ber of domains.
