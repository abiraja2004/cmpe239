This paper proposes a machine learning
based question classification method us-
ing a kernel function, Hierarchical Di-
rected Acyclic Graph (HDAG) Kernel.
The HDAG Kernel directly accepts struc-
tured natural language data, such as sev-
eral levels of chunks and their relations,
and computes the value of the kernel func-
tion at a practical cost and time while re-
flecting all of these structures. We ex-
amine the proposed method in a ques-
tion classification experiment using 5011
Japanese questions that are labeled by
150 question types. The results demon-
strate that our proposed method improves
the performance of question classification
over that by conventional methods such as
bag-of-words and their combinations.
