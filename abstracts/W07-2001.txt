This paper presents a first attempt of an
application-driven evaluation exercise of
WSD. We used a CLIR testbed from the
Cross Lingual Evaluation Forum. The ex-
pansion, indexing and retrieval strategies
where fixed by the organizers. The par-
ticipants had to return both the topics and
documents tagged with WordNet 1.6 word
senses. The organization provided training
data in the form of a pre-processed Semcor
which could be readily used by participants.
The task had two participants, and the orga-
nizer also provide an in-house WSD system
for comparison.
