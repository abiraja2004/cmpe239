Parallel corpus is a valuable resource used
in various fields of multilingual natural
language processing. One of the most
significant problems in using parallel cor-
pora is the lack of their availability. Re-
searchers have investigated approaches to
collecting parallel texts from the Web. A
basic component of these approaches is
an algorithm that judges whether a pair
of texts is parallel or not. In this paper,
we propose an algorithm that accelerates
this task without losing accuracy by pre-
processing a bilingual dictionary as well
as the collection of texts. This method
achieved 250,000 pairs/sec throughput on
a single CPU, with the best F1 score
of 0.960 for the task of detecting 200
Japanese-English translation pairs out of
40, 000. The method is applicable to texts
of any format, and not specific to HTML
documents labeled with URLs. We report
details of these preprocessing methods and
the fast comparison algorithm. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first re-
ported experiment of extracting Japanese?
English parallel texts from a large corpora
based solely on linguistic content.
