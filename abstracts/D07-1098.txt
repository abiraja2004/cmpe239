 
Deterministic dependency parsers use pars-
ing actions to construct dependencies. 
These parsers do not compute the probabil-
ity of the whole dependency tree. They 
only determine parsing actions stepwisely 
by a trained classifier. To globally model 
parsing actions of all steps that are taken on 
the input sentence, we propose two kinds 
of probabilistic parsing action models that 
can compute the probability of the whole 
dependency tree. The tree with the maxi-
mal probability is outputted. The experi-
ments are carried on 10 languages, and the 
results show that our probabilistic parsing 
action models outperform the original de-
terministic dependency parser.
