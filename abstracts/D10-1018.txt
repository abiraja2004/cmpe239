This paper focuses on the task of insert-
ing punctuation symbols into transcribed con-
versational speech texts, without relying on
prosodic cues. We investigate limitations as-
sociated with previous methods, and propose a
novel approach based on dynamic conditional
random fields. Different from previous work,
our proposed approach is designed to jointly
perform both sentence boundary and sentence
type prediction, and punctuation prediction on
speech utterances.
We performed evaluations on a transcribed
conversational speech domain consisting of
both English and Chinese texts. Empirical re-
sults show that our method outperforms an ap-
proach based on linear-chain conditional ran-
dom fields and other previous approaches.
