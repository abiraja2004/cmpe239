In this paper, we present an approach to
include morpho-syntactic dependencies into
the training of the statistical alignment
models. Existing statistical translation sys-
tems usually treat different derivations of
the same base form as they were indepen-
dent of each other. We propose a method
which explicitly takes into account such in-
terdependencies during the EM training of
the statistical alignment models. The eval-
uation is done by comparing the obtained
Viterbi alignments with a manually anno-
tated reference alignment. The improve-
ments of the alignment quality compared
to the, to our knowledge, best system are
reported on the German-English Verbmobil
corpus.
