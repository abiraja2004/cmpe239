While significant effort has been put into an-
notating linguistic resources for several lan-
guages, there are still many left that have
only small amounts of such resources. This
paper investigates a method of propagat-
ing information (specifically mention detec-
tion information) into such low resource
languages from richer ones. Experiments
run on three language pairs (Arabic-English,
Chinese-English, and Spanish-English) show
that one can achieve relatively decent perfor-
mance by propagating information from a lan-
guage with richer resources such as English
into a foreign language alone (no resources
or models in the foreign language). Fur-
thermore, while examining the performance
using various degrees of linguistic informa-
tion in a statistical framework, results show
that propagated features from English help
improve the source-language system perfor-
mance even when used in conjunction with all
feature types built from the source language.
The experiments also show that using propa-
gated features in conjunction with lexically-
derived features only (as can be obtained di-
rectly from a mention annotated corpus) yields
similar performance to using feature types de-
rived from many linguistic resources.
