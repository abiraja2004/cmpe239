This paper describes a system that pro-
duces extractive summaries of short
works of literary fiction. The ultimate
purpose of produced summaries is de-
fined as helping a reader to determine
whether she would be interested in read-
ing a particular story. To this end, the
summary aims to provide a reader with
an idea about the settings of a story (such
as characters, time and place) without re-
vealing the plot. The approach presented
here relies heavily on the notion of as-
pect. Preliminary results show an im-
provement over two na?ve baselines: a
lead baseline and a more sophisticated
variant of it. Although modest, the results
suggest that using aspectual information
may be of help when summarizing fic-
tion. A more thorough evaluation involv-
ing human judges is under way.
