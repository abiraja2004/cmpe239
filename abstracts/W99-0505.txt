 
The mapping from WordNet o Hector senses m Senseval provides a "gold standard" against wluch to 
judge our ability to compare lexlcal resources The "gold standard" is provided through aword overlap analysis 
(with and without a stop list) for flus mapping, achieving at most a 36 percent correct mapping (inflated by 9 
percent from "empty" assignments) An alternaUve componenttal analysis of the defimtaons, using syntacUc, 
collocatmnal, and semantac component and relation identification (through the use ofdefimng patterns integrated 
seamlessly mto the parsing thclaonary), provides an almost 41 percent correct mapping, with an additaonal 4
percent by recogmzmg semantic omponents not used in the Senseval mapping Defimtion sets of the Senseval 
words from three pubhshed thclaonanes and Dorr's lextcal knowledge base were added to WordNet and the Hector 
database to exanune the nature of the mapping process between defimtton sets of more and less sco\[~e The 
tecbauques described here consUtute only an maaal implementation f the componenUal nalysis approach and 
suggests that considerable further improvements can be aclueved
