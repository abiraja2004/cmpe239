Domain adaptation is an important problem
in natural language processing (NLP) due to
the lack of labeled data in novel domains. In
this paper, we study the domain adaptation
problem from the instance weighting per-
spective. We formally analyze and charac-
terize the domain adaptation problem from
a distributional view, and show that there
are two distinct needs for adaptation, cor-
responding to the different distributions of
instances and classification functions in the
source and the target domains. We then
propose a general instance weighting frame-
work for domain adaptation. Our empir-
ical results on three NLP tasks show that
incorporating and exploiting more informa-
tion from the target domain through instance
weighting is effective.
