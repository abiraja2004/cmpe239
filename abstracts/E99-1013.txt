 
This paper proposes a method to over- 
come the drawbacks of WordNet when 
applied to information retrieval by com- 
plementing it with Roget's thesaurus and 
corpus-derived thesauri. Words and rela- 
tions which are not included in WordNet 
can be found in the corpus-derived the- 
sauri. Effects of polysemy can be min- 
imized with weighting method consider- 
ing all query terms and all of the the- 
sauri. Experimental results show that 
our method enhances information re- 
trieval performance significantly.

1995), computing lexical cohesion (Stairmand, 
1997), word sense disambiguation (Voorhees, 
1993), and so on, but the results have not been 
very successful. 
Previously, we conducted query expansion ex- 
periments using WordNet (Mandala et al, to ap- 
pear 1999) and found limitations, which can be 
summarized as follows :
