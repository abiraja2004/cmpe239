The field of linguistics has always been
reliant on language data, since that is its
principal object of study. One of the major
obstacles that linguists encounter is find-
ing data relevant to their research. In this
paper, we propose a three-stage approach
to help linguists find relevant data. First,
language data embedded in existing lin-
guistic scholarly discourse is collected and
stored in a database. Second, the lan-
guage data is automatically analyzed and
enriched, and language profiles are created
from the enriched data. Third, a search
facility is provided to allow linguists to
search the original data, the enriched data,
and the language profiles in a variety of
ways. This work demonstrates the benefits
of using natural language processing tech-
nology to create resources and tools for
linguistic research, allowing linguists to
have easy access not only to language data
embedded in existing linguistic papers, but
also to automatically generated language
profiles for hundreds of languages.
