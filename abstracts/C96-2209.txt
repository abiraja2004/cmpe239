 
In this paper, we want to describe a tag- 
ger/lemmatiser for Dutch medical voca- 
bulary, which consists of a full-form dic- 
tionary and a morphological recogniser 
for unknown vocabulary coupled to an 
expert system-like disambiguation mo- 
dule. Attention is also paid to the main 
datastructures: a lexical database and 
feature bundles implemented as direc- 
ted acyclic graphs. Some evaluation re- 
sults are presented as well. The tag- 
ger/lemmatiser currently functions as a 
lexical front-end for a syntactic parser. 
For pure tagging/lemmatising purposes, 
a reduced tagset (not suited for sentence 
analysis) can be used as well.
