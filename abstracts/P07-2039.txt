Identification of transliterated names is a
particularly difficult task of Named Entity
Recognition (NER), especially in the Chi-
nese context. Of all possible variations of
transliterated named entities, the difference
between PRC and Taiwan is the most preva-
lent and most challenging. In this paper, we
introduce a novel approach to the automatic
extraction of diverging transliterations of
foreign named entities by bootstrapping co-
occurrence statistics from tagged and seg-
mented Chinese corpus. Preliminary experi-
ment yields promising results and shows its
potential in NLP applications.
