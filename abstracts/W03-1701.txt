 
This paper proposes an unsupervised 
training approach to resolving overlap-
ping ambiguities in Chinese word seg-
mentation. We present an ensemble of 
adapted Na?ve Bayesian classifiers that 
can be trained using an unlabelled Chi-
nese text corpus. These classifiers differ 
in that they use context words within 
windows of different sizes as features. 
The performance of our approach is 
evaluated on a manually annotated test set. 
Experimental results show that the pro-
posed approach achieves an accuracy of 
94.3%, rivaling the rule-based and super-
vised training methods.
