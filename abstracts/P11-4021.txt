In this paper we present Clairlib, an open-
source toolkit for Natural Language Process-
ing, Information Retrieval, and Network Anal-
ysis. Clairlib provides an integrated frame-
work intended to simplify a number of generic
tasks within and across those three areas. It
has a command-line interface, a graphical in-
terface, and a documented API. Clairlib is
compatible with all the common platforms and
operating systems. In addition to its own func-
tionality, it provides interfaces to external soft-
ware and corpora. Clairlib comes with a com-
prehensive documentation and a rich set of tu-
torials and visual demos.
