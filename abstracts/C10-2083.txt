 
We propose a novel MLN-based method 
that collectively conducts SRL on 
groups of news sentences. Our method is 
built upon a baseline SRL, which uses 
no parsers and leverages redundancy. 
We evaluate our method on a manually 
labeled news corpus and demonstrate 
that news redundancy significantly im-
proves the performance of the baseline, 
e.g., it improves the F-score from 
64.13% to 67.66%.  *
