Many works (of both fiction and non-fiction)
span multiple, intersecting narratives, each of
which constitutes a story in its own right. In
this work I introduce the task of multiple nar-
rative disentanglement (MND), in which the
aim is to tease these narratives apart by assign-
ing passages from a text to the sub-narratives
to which they belong. The motivating exam-
ple I use is David Foster Wallace?s fictional
text Infinite Jest. I selected this book because
it contains multiple, interweaving narratives
within its sprawling 1,000-plus pages. I pro-
pose and evaluate a novel unsupervised ap-
proach to MND that is motivated by the theory
of narratology. This method achieves strong
empirical results, successfully disentangling
the threads in Infinite Jest and significantly
outperforming baseline strategies in doing so.
