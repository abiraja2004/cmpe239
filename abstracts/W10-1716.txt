This paper describes the development of
French?English and English?French ma-
chine translation systems for the 2010
WMT shared task evaluation. These sys-
tems were standard phrase-based statisti-
cal systems based on the Moses decoder,
trained on the provided data only. Most
of our efforts were devoted to the choice
and extraction of bilingual data used for
training. We filtered out some bilingual
corpora and pruned the phrase table. We
also investigated the impact of adding two
types of additional bilingual texts, ex-
tracted automatically from the available
monolingual data. We first collected bilin-
gual data by performing automatic trans-
lations of monolingual texts. The second
type of bilingual text was harvested from
comparable corpora with Information Re-
trieval techniques.
