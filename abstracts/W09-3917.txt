Our aim is to build listening agents that
can attentively listen to the user and sat-
isfy his/her desire to speak and have him-
self/herself heard. This paper investigates
the characteristics of such listening-oriented
dialogues so that such a listening process
can be achieved by automated dialogue sys-
tems. We collected both listening-oriented
dialogues and casual conversation, and ana-
lyzed them by comparing the frequency of
dialogue acts, as well as the dialogue flows
using HiddenMarkovModels (HMMs). The
analysis revealed that listening-oriented dia-
logues and casual conversation have charac-
teristically different dialogue flows and that
it is important for listening agents to self-
disclose before asking questions and to utter
more questions and acknowledgment than in
casual conversation to be good listeners.
