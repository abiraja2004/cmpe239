This paper focuses on the automatic segmentation 
of inflectional affixes of the Kazakh Language (KL) 
on the basis of studying the corpus of KL. Kazakh is 
an agglutinative language with word structures 
formed by productive affixation of derivational and 
inflectional suffixes to stems. Based on the analysis 
of the configuration of inflectional affixes, it firstly 
constructs the Finite-State Automation and the 
segmentation of inflectional affixes. Secondly it 
targets at specially constructing the Finite-State 
Automations of nouns and verbs, which are the 
most changeable and complex part of speech of KL. 
And thirdly it adopts the methods of Bidirectional 
Omni-Word Segmentation and lexical analysis to 
achieve the goal of stemming and fine segmentation 
of inflectional affixes of KL. And finally it gives an 
additional account of studying the segmentation of 
ambiguous inflectional affixes. The paper intends 
to improve the accuracy and the quickness of 
stemming the inflectional affixes of KL.
