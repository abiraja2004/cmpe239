An approach is presented to the auto-
matic discovery of labels of relations be-
tween pairs of ontological classes. Using
a hyperlinked encyclopaedic resource, we
gather evidence for likely predicative la-
bels by searching for sentences that de-
scribe relations between terms. The terms
are instances of the pair of ontological
classes under consideration, drawn from
a populated knowledge base. Verbs or
verb phrases are automatically extracted,
yielding a ranked list of candidate rela-
tions. Human judges rate the extracted
relations. The extracted relations provide
a basis for automatic ontology discovery
from a non-relational database. The ap-
proach is demonstrated on a database from
the natural history domain.
