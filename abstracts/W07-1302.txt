Phylogenetic analyses of languages need to
explicitly address whether the languages un-
der consideration are related to each other at
all. Recently developed permutation tests al-
low this question to be explored by testing
whether words in one set of languages are
significantly more similar to those in another
set of languages when paired up by seman-
tics than when paired up at random. Seven
different phonetic similarity metrics are im-
plemented and evaluated on their effective-
ness within such multilateral comparison
systems when deployed to detect genetic re-
lations among the Indo-European and Uralic
language families.
