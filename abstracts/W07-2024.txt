 
The increasing number of web sources is 
exacerbating the named-entity ambiguity 
problem. This paper explores the use of 
various token-based and phrase-based fea-
tures in unsupervised clustering of web 
pages containing personal names. From 
these experiments, we find that the use of 
rich features can significantly improve the 
disambiguation performance for web per-
sonal names.
