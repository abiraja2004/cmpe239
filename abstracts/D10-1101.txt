In this paper, we focus on the opinion tar-
get extraction as part of the opinion min-
ing task. We model the problem as an in-
formation extraction task, which we address
based on Conditional Random Fields (CRF).
As a baseline we employ the supervised al-
gorithm by Zhuang et al (2006), which rep-
resents the state-of-the-art on the employed
data. We evaluate the algorithms comprehen-
sively on datasets from four different domains
annotated with individual opinion target in-
stances on a sentence level. Furthermore, we
investigate the performance of our CRF-based
approach and the baseline in a single- and
cross-domain opinion target extraction setting.
Our CRF-based approach improves the perfor-
mance by 0.077, 0.126, 0.071 and 0.178 re-
garding F-Measure in the single-domain ex-
traction in the four domains. In the cross-
domain setting our approach improves the per-
formance by 0.409, 0.242, 0.294 and 0.343 re-
garding F-Measure over the baseline.
