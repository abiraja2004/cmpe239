This paper proposes an unsupervised
word segmentation algorithm that identi-
fies word boundaries in continuous source
language text in order to improve the
translation quality of statistical machine
translation (SMT) approaches. The
method can be applied to any language
pair where the source language is unseg-
mented and the target language segmen-
tation is known. First, an iterative boot-
strap method is applied to learn multi-
ple segmentation schemes that are consis-
tent with the phrasal segmentations of an
SMT system trained on the resegmented
bitext. In the second step, multiple seg-
mentation schemes are integrated into a
single SMT system by characterizing the
source language side and merging iden-
tical translation pairs of differently seg-
mented SMT models. Experimental re-
sults translating five Asian languages into
English revealed that the method of in-
tegrating multiple segmentation schemes
outperforms SMT models trained on any
of the learned word segmentations and
performs comparably to available state-of-
the-art monolingually-built segmentation
tools.
