This work introduces a model free approach to
sentence compression, which grew out of ideas
from Nomoto (2008), and examines how it com-
pares to a state-of-art model intensive approach
known as Tree-to-Tree Transducer, or T3 (Cohn
and Lapata, 2008). It is found that a model free
approach significantly outperforms T3 on the par-
ticular data we created from the Internet. We also
discuss what might have caused T3?s poor perfor-
mance.
