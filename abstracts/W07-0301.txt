This paper reports on progress applying
partially observable Markov decision pro-
cesses (POMDPs) to a commercial dia-
log domain: troubleshooting. In the trou-
bleshooting domain, a spoken dialog sys-
tem helps a user to fix a product such as
a failed DSL connection. Past work has
argued that a POMDP is a principled ap-
proach to building spoken dialog systems
in the simpler slot-filling domain; this pa-
per explains how the POMDPs formula-
tion can be extended to the more complex
troubleshooting domain. Results from di-
alog simulation verify that a POMDP out-
performs a handcrafted baseline.
