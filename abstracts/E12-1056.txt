This paper describes Subcat-LMF, an ISO-
LMF compliant lexicon representation for-
mat featuring a uniform representation
of subcategorization frames (SCFs) for
the two languages English and German.
Subcat-LMF is able to represent SCFs at a
very fine-grained level. We utilized Subcat-
LMF to standardize lexicons with large-
scale SCF information: the English Verb-
Net and two German lexicons, i.e., a subset
of IMSlex and GermaNet verbs. To evalu-
ate our LMF-model, we performed a cross-
lingual comparison of SCF coverage and
overlap for the standardized versions of the
English and German lexicons. The Subcat-
LMF DTD, the conversion tools and the
standardized versions of VerbNet and IMS-
lex subset are publicly available.1
