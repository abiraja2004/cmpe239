We present a new framework for classify-
ing common nouns that extends named-
entity classification. We used a fixed set
of 26 semantic labels, which we called su-
persenses. These are the labels used by
lexicographers developing WordNet. This
framework has a number of practical ad-
vantages. We show how information con-
tained in the dictionary can be used as ad-
ditional training data that improves accu-
racy in learning new nouns. We also de-
fine a more realistic evaluation procedure
than cross-validation.
