Speech interface is often required in many
application environments such as telephone-
based information retrieval, car navigation sys-
tems, and user-friendly interfaces, but the low
speech recognition rate makes it difficult to ex-
tend its application to new fields. Several ap-
proaches to increase the accuracy of the recog-
nition rate have been researched by error cor-
rection of the recognition results, but previ-
ous approaches were mainly lexical-oriented
ones in post error correction. We suggest
an improved syllable-based model and a new
semantic-oriented approach to correct both se-
mantic and lexical errors, which is also more
accurate for especially domain-specific speech
error correction. Through extensive experi-
ments using a speech-driven in-vehicle telem-
atics information retrieval, we demonstrate
the superior performance of our approach and
some advantages over previous lexical-oriented
approaches.
