 
The continuous expansion of the multilingual 
information society has led in recent years to a pressing 
demand for multilingual linguistic resources suitable to 
be used for different applications.  
In this paper we present the WordNet Domains 
Hierarchy (WDH), a language-independent resource 
composed of 164, hierarchically organized, domain 
labels (e.g. Architecture, Sport, Medicine). Although 
WDH has been successfully applied to various Natural 
Language Processing tasks, the first available version 
presented some problems, mostly related to the lack of a 
clear semantics of the domain labels. Other correlated 
issues were the coverage and the balancing of the 
domains. We illustrate a new version of WDH 
addressing these problems by an explicit and systematic 
reference to the Dewey Decimal Classification. The new 
version of WDH has a better defined semantics and is 
applicable to a wider range of tasks.
