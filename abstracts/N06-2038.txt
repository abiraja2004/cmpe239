There are several approaches that
model information extraction as a to-
ken classification task, using various
tagging strategies to combine multiple
tokens. We describe the tagging strate-
gies that can be found in the litera-
ture and evaluate their relative perfor-
mances. We also introduce a new strat-
egy, called Begin/After tagging or BIA,
and show that it is competitive to the
best other strategies.
