We report on the SUM project which applies
automatic summarisation techniques to the le-
gal domain. We pursue a methodology based
on Teufel and Moens (2002) where sentences
are classified according to their argumentative
role. We describe some experiments with judg-
ments of the House of Lords where we have
performed automatic linguistic annotation of a
small sample set in order to explore correla-
tions between linguistic features and argumen-
tative roles. We use state-of-the-art NLP tech-
niques to perform the linguistic annotation us-
ing XML-based tools and a combination of rule-
based and statistical methods. We focus here
on the predictive capacity of tense and aspect
features for a classifier.
