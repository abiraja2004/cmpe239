In word sense disambiguation (WSD), the heuristic
of choosing the most common sense is extremely
powerful because the distribution of the senses of a
word is often skewed. The first (or predominant)
sense heuristic assumes the availability of hand-
tagged data. Whilst there are hand-tagged corpora
available for some languages, these are relatively
small in size and many word forms either do not
occur, or occur infrequently. In this paper we in-
vestigate the performance of an unsupervised first
sense heuristic where predominant senses are ac-
quired automatically from raw text. We evaluate on
both the SENSEVAL-2 and SENSEVAL-3 English all-
words data. For accurate WSD the first sense heuris-
tic should be used only as a back-off, where the evi-
dence from the context is not strong enough. In this
paper however, we examine the performance of the
automatically acquired first sense in isolation since
it turned out that the first sense taken from SemCor
outperformed many systems in SENSEVAL-2.
