 
Automatic key phrase extraction is funda-
mental to the success of many recent digital 
library applications and semantic information 
retrieval techniques and a difficult and essen-
tial problem in Vietnamese natural language 
processing (NLP). In this work, we propose a 
novel method for key phrase extracting of 
Vietnamese text that exploits the Vietnamese 
Wikipedia as an ontology and exploits spe-
cific characteristics of the Vietnamese lan-
guage for the key phrase selection stage. We 
also explore NLP techniques that we propose 
for the analysis of Vietnamese texts, focusing 
on the advanced candidate phrases recogni-
tion phase as well as part-of-speech (POS) 
tagging. Finally, we review the results of sev-
eral experiments that have examined the im-
pacts of strategies chosen for Vietnamese key 
phrase extracting.
