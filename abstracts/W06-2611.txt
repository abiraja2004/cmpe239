 
This article describes a robust semantic 
parser that uses a broad knowledge base 
created by interconnecting three major 
resources: FrameNet, VerbNet and 
PropBank. The FrameNet corpus con-
tains the examples annotated with se-
mantic roles whereas the VerbNet lexi-
con provides the knowledge about the 
syntactic behavior of the verbs. We 
connect VerbNet and FrameNet by 
mapping the FrameNet frames to the 
VerbNet Intersective Levin classes. The 
PropBank corpus, which is tightly con-
nected to the VerbNet lexicon, is used to 
increase the verb coverage and also to 
test the effectiveness of our approach. 
The results indicate that our model is an 
interesting step towards the design of 
free-text semantic parsers.
