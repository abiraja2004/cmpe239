Stemmers have many applications in natu-
ral language processing and some fields
such as information retrieval. Many algo-
rithms have been proposed for stemming.
In this paper, we propose a new algorithm
for Persian language. Our algorithm is a
bottom up algorithm that is capable to re-
organize without changing the implementa-
tion. Our experiments show that the pro-
posed algorithm has a suitable result in
stemming and flexibility.
