We present a framework to extract the
most important features (tree fragments)
from a Tree Kernel (TK) space according
to their importance in the target kernel-
based machine, e.g. Support Vector Ma-
chines (SVMs). In particular, our min-
ing algorithm selects the most relevant fea-
tures based on SVM estimated weights
and uses this information to automatically
infer an explicit representation of the in-
put data. The explicit features (a) improve
our knowledge on the target problem do-
main and (b) make large-scale learning
practical, improving training and test time,
while yielding accuracy in line with tradi-
tional TK classifiers. Experiments on se-
mantic role labeling and question classifi-
cation illustrate the above claims.
