This paper proposes a supervised learn-
ing method to recognize expressions that
show a relation between two named en-
tities, e.g., person, location, or organiza-
tion. The method uses two novel fea-
tures, 1) whether the candidate words in-
herently express relations and 2) how the
candidate words are influenced by the past
relations of two entities. These features
together with conventional syntactic and
contextual features are organized as a tree
structure and are fed into a boosting-based
classification algorithm. Experimental re-
sults show that the proposed method out-
performs conventional methods.
