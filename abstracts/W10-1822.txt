We present a proposal for the annotation
of multi-word expressions in a 1M corpus
of contemporary portuguese. Our aim is
to create a resource that allows us to study
multi-word expressions (MWEs) in their
context. The corpus will be a valuable ad-
ditional resource next to the already ex-
isting MWE lexicon that was based on a
much larger corpus of 50M words. In this
paper we discuss the problematic cases for
annotation and proposed solutions, focus-
ing on the variational properties of MWEs.
