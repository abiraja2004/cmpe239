Most existing HLT pipelines assume the input
is pure text or, at most, HTML and either ig-
nore (logical) document structure or remove
it. We argue that identifying the structure of
documents is essential in digital library and
other types of applications, and show that it
is relatively straightforward to extend existing
pipelines to achieve ones in which the struc-
ture of a document is preserved.
