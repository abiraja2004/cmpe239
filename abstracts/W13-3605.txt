 
This paper describes the NLP2CT Grammati-
cal Error Detection and Correction system for 
the CoNLL 2013 shared task, with a focus on 
the errors of article or determiner (ArtOrDet), 
noun number (Nn), preposition (Prep), verb 
form (Vform) and subject-verb agreement 
(SVA). A hybrid model is adopted for this spe-
cial task. The process starts with spell-
checking as a preprocessing step to correct any 
possible erroneous word. We used a Maxi-
mum Entropy classifier together with manual-
ly rule-based filters to detect the grammatical 
errors in English. A language model based on 
the Google N-gram corpus was employed to 
select the best correction candidate from a 
confusion matrix. We also explored a graph-
based label propagation approach to overcome 
the sparsity problem in training the model. Fi-
nally, a number of deterministic rules were 
used to increase the precision and recall. The 
proposed model was evaluated on the test set 
consisting of 50 essays and with about 500 
words in each essay. Our system achieves the 
5
th
 and 3
rd
 F1 scores on official test set among 
all 17 participating teams based on gold-
standard edits before and after revision, re-
spectively.
