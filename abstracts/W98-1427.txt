 
Natural anguage generation technology is now ripe for commercial exploitation, but one of the 
remaining bottlenecks is that of providing NLG ?systems with user-friendly interfaces for Specifying the 
content of documents tobe generated. We present here a new technique we have developed for providing 
such interfaces: WYSIWYM editing. WYSIWYM (What You See Is What You Meant) makes novel use 
of the system's generator toprovide anatural language input device which requires no NL interpretation 
. . . . 
- -  only NL generation.
