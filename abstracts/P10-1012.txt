As described in this paper, we propose
a new automatic evaluation method for
machine translation using noun-phrase
chunking. Our method correctly deter-
mines the matching words between two
sentences using corresponding noun
phrases. Moreover, our method deter-
mines the similarity between two sen-
tences in terms of the noun-phrase or-
der of appearance. Evaluation experi-
ments were conducted to calculate the
correlation among human judgments,
along with the scores produced us-
ing automatic evaluation methods for
MT outputs obtained from the 12 ma-
chine translation systems in NTCIR-
7. Experimental results show that
our method obtained the highest cor-
relations among the methods in both
sentence-level adequacy and fluency.
