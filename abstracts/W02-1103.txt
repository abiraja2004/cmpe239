In this paper we face the automatic con-
struction of a lexical taxonomy for the
Spanish language using as input a taxon-
omy of English (WordNet)1 and a set of
bilingual (English/Spanish) resources.
Although applied to Spanish/English our
method claims to be general enough to be
applied in the cases a skeletal taxonomy
already exists and we dispose of methods
for mapping items to this taxonomy with
known confidence scores.
