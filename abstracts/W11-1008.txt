We show that reifying the rules from hyper-
edge weights to first-class graph nodes au-
tomatically gives us rule expectations in any
kind of grammar expressible as a deductive
system, without any explicit algorithm for cal-
culating rule expectations (such as the inside-
outside algorithm). This gives us expecta-
tion maximization training for any grammar
class with a parsing algorithm that can be
stated as a deductive system, for free. Having
such a framework in place accelerates turn-
over time for experimenting with new gram-
mar classes and parsing algorithms?to imple-
ment a grammar learner, only the parse forest
construction has to be implemented.
