This paper describes the NMSU-Pitt-UNCA
word-sense disambiguation system participat-
ing in the Senseval-3 English lexical sample
task. The focus of the work is on using seman-
tic class-based collocations to augment tradi-
tional word-based collocations. Three separate
sources of word relatedness are used for these
collocations: 1) WordNet hypernym relations;
2) cluster-based word similarity classes; and 3)
dictionary definition analysis.
