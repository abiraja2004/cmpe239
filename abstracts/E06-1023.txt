This paper proposes a method for deal-
ing with repairs in action control dialogue
to resolve participants? misunderstanding.
The proposed method identifies the re-
pair target based on common grounding
rather than surface expressions. We extend
Traum?s grounding act model by introduc-
ing degree of groundedness, and partial
and mid-discourse unit grounding. This
paper contributes to achieving more natu-
ral human-machine dialogue and instanta-
neous and flexible control of agents.
