We present a general learning-based approach
for phrase-level sentiment analysis that adopts
an ordinal sentiment scale and is explicitly
compositional in nature. Thus, we can model
the compositional effects required for accu-
rate assignment of phrase-level sentiment. For
example, combining an adverb (e.g., ?very?)
with a positive polar adjective (e.g., ?good?)
produces a phrase (?very good?) with in-
creased polarity over the adjective alone. In-
spired by recent work on distributional ap-
proaches to compositionality, we model each
word as a matrix and combine words us-
ing iterated matrix multiplication, which al-
lows for the modeling of both additive and
multiplicative semantic effects. Although the
multiplication-based matrix-space framework
has been shown to be a theoretically ele-
gant way to model composition (Rudolph and
Giesbrecht, 2010), training such models has
to be done carefully: the optimization is non-
convex and requires a good initial starting
point. This paper presents the first such al-
gorithm for learning a matrix-space model for
semantic composition. In the context of the
phrase-level sentiment analysis task, our ex-
perimental results show statistically signifi-
cant improvements in performance over a bag-
of-words model.
