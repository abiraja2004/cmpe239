 
This paper describes an hierarchical approach 
to WordNet sense distinctions that provides 
different types of automatic Word Sense Dis-
ambiguation (WSD) systems, which perform 
at varying levels of accuracy.  For tasks where 
fine-grained sense distinctions may not be es-
sential, an accurate coarse-grained WSD sys-
tem may be sufficient. The paper discusses the 
criteria behind the three different levels of 
sense granularity, as well as the machine learn-
ing approach used by the WSD system.
