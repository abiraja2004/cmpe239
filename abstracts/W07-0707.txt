Evaluation and error analysis of machine
translation output are important but difficult
tasks. In this work, we propose a novel
method for obtaining more details about ac-
tual translation errors in the generated output
by introducing the decomposition of Word
Error Rate (WER) and Position independent
word Error Rate (PER) over different Part-
of-Speech (POS) classes. Furthermore, we
investigate two possible aspects of the use
of these decompositions for automatic er-
ror analysis: estimation of inflectional errors
and distribution of missing words over POS
classes. The obtained results are shown to
correspond to the results of a human error
analysis. The results obtained on the Euro-
pean Parliament Plenary Session corpus in
Spanish and English give a better overview
of the nature of translation errors as well as
ideas of where to put efforts for possible im-
provements of the translation system.
