 
Asian languages are far from most west-
ern-style in their non-separate word se-
quence especially Chinese. The 
preliminary step of Asian-like language 
processing is to find the word boundaries 
between words. In this paper, we present 
a general purpose model for both Chinese 
word segmentation and named entity rec-
ognition. This model was built on the 
word sequence classification with prob-
ability model, i.e., conditional random 
fields (CRF). We used a simple feature set 
for CRF which achieves satisfactory clas-
sification result on the two tasks. Our 
model achieved 91.00 in F rate in UPUC-
Treebank data, and 78.71 for NER task.
