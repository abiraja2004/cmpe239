Our submission was a reduced version of
the system described in Haghighi and Klein
(2010), with extensions to improve mention
detection to suit the OntoNotes annotation
scheme. Including exact matching mention
detection in this shared task added a new and
challenging dimension to the problem, partic-
ularly for our system, which previously used
a very permissive detection method. We im-
proved this aspect of the system by adding
filters based on the annotation scheme for
OntoNotes and analysis of system behavior on
the development set. These changes led to im-
provements in coreference F-score of 10.06,
5.71, 6.78, 6.63 and 3.09 on the MUC, B3,
Ceaf-e, Ceaf-m and Blanc, metrics, respec-
tively, and a final task score of 47.10.
