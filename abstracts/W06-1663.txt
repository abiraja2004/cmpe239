This paper presents an empirical eval-
uation of the quality of publicly avail-
able large-scale knowledge resources. The
study includes a wide range of manu-
ally and automatically derived large-scale
knowledge resources. In order to establish
a fair and neutral comparison, the qual-
ity of each knowledge resource is indi-
rectly evaluated using the same method on
a Word Sense Disambiguation task. The
evaluation framework selected has been
the Senseval-3 English Lexical Sample
Task. The study empirically demonstrates
that automatically acquired knowledge re-
sources surpass both in terms of preci-
sion and recall the knowledge resources
derived manually, and that the combina-
tion of the knowledge contained in these
resources is very close to the most frequent
sense classifier. As far as we know, this is
the first time that such a quality assessment
has been performed showing a clear pic-
ture of the current state-of-the-art of pub-
licly available wide coverage semantic re-
sources.
