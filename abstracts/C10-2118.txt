Studies of discourse relations have not, in
the past, attempted to characterize what
serves as evidence for them, beyond lists
of frozen expressions, or markers, drawn
from a few well-defined syntactic classes.
In this paper, we describe how the lexical-
ized discourse relation annotations of the
Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB) led to
the discovery of a wide range of additional
expressions, annotated as AltLex (alterna-
tive lexicalizations) in the PDTB 2.0. Fur-
ther analysis of AltLex annotation sug-
gests that the set of markers is open-
ended, and drawn from a wider variety
of syntactic types than currently assumed.
As a first attempt towards automatically
identifying discourse relation markers, we
propose the use of syntactic paraphrase
methods.
