 
Using the formalism of generalized phrase structure 
grammar (GF~SG) in an NL system (e.g. for machine translation 
(MT)) is promising since the modular structure of the 
formalism is very well suited to meet some particular needs of 
MT. However, it seems impossible to implement GPSG in its 
1985 version straightforwardly. This would involve a vast 
overgeneration f structures as well as processes to filter out 
everything but the admissible tree(s). We therefore argue for a 
constructive rsion of GPSG where information is gathered in 
subsequent s eps to produce syntactic structures. As a result, 
we consider it necessary to incorporate procedural spects into 
the formalism in order to use it as a linguistic basis for NL 
parsing and generation. The paper discusses the major 
implications of such a modified view of GPSG. 1
