. We present a preliminary study of several parser adaptation
techniques evaluated on the GENIA corpus of MEDLINE abstracts [1,2].
We begin by observing that the Penn Treebank (PTB) is lexically im-
poverished when measured on various genres of scientific and techni-
cal writing, and that this significantly impacts parse accuracy. To re-
solve this without requiring in-domain treebank data, we show how ex-
isting domain-specific lexical resources may be leveraged to augment
PTB-training: part-of-speech tags, dictionary collocations, and named-
entities. Using a state-of-the-art statistical parser [3] as our baseline, our
lexically-adapted parser achieves a 14.2% reduction in error. With oracle-
knowledge of named-entities, this error reduction improves to 21.2%.
