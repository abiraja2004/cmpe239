 
We propose an O(M(n2)) time algorithm 
for the recognition of Tree Adjoining Lan- 
guages (TALs), where n is the size of the 
input string and M(k) is the time needed 
to multiply two k x k boolean matrices. 
Tree Adjoining Grammars (TAGs) are for- 
malisms uitable for natural language pro- 
cessing and have received enormous atten- 
tion in the past among not only natural 
language processing researchers but also al- 
gorithms designers. The first polynomial 
time algorithm for TAL parsing was pro- 
posed in 1986 and had a run time of O(n6). 
Quite recently, an O(n 3 M(n)) algorithm 
has been proposed. The algorithm pre- 
sented in this paper improves the run time 
of the recent result using an entirely differ- 
ent approach.
