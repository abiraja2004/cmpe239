This paper describes the importation of
Manually Annotated Sub-Corpus (MASC)
data and annotations into the linguistic
database ANNIS, which allows users to vi-
sualize and query linguistically-annotated
corpora. We outline the process of
mapping MASC?s GrAF representation to
ANNIS?s internal format relANNIS and
demonstrate how the system provides ac-
cess to multiple annotation layers in the
corpus. This access provides information
about inter-layer relations and dependen-
cies that have been previously difficult to
explore, and which are highly valuable for
continued development of language pro-
cessing applications.
