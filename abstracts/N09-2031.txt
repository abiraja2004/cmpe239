 
This paper proposes an approach for bilingual 
dictionary extraction from comparable corpora. 
The proposed approach is based on the obser-
vation that a word and its translation share 
similar dependency relations. Experimental re-
sults using 250 randomly selected translation 
pairs prove that the proposed approach signifi-
cantly outperforms the traditional context-
based approach that uses bag-of-words around 
translation candidates.
