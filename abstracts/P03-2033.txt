We have developed willex, a tool that
helps grammar developers to work effi-
ciently by using annotated corpora and
recording parsing errors. Willex has two
major new functions. First, it decreases
ambiguity of the parsing results by com-
paring them to an annotated corpus and
removing wrong partial results both au-
tomatically and manually. Second, willex
accumulates parsing errors as data for the
developers to clarify the defects of the
grammar statistically. We applied willex
to a large-scale HPSG-style grammar as
an example.
