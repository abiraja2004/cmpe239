For the 11th straight year, the Conference
on Computational Natural Language Learn-
ing has been accompanied by a shared task
whose purpose is to promote natural language
processing applications and evaluate them in
a standard setting. In 2009, the shared task
was dedicated to the joint parsing of syntac-
tic and semantic dependencies in multiple lan-
guages. This shared task combines the shared
tasks of the previous five years under a unique
dependency-based formalism similar to the
2008 task. In this paper, we define the shared
task, describe how the data sets were created
and show their quantitative properties, report
the results and summarize the approaches of
the participating systems.
