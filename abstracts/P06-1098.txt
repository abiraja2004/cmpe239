We present a hierarchical phrase-based
statistical machine translation in which a
target sentence is efficiently generated in
left-to-right order. The model is a class
of synchronous-CFG with a Greibach Nor-
mal Form-like structure for the projected
production rule: The paired target-side
of a production rule takes a phrase pre-
fixed form. The decoder for the target-
normalized form is based on an Early-
style top down parser on the source side.
The target-normalized form coupled with
our top down parser implies a left-to-
right generation of translations which en-
ables us a straightforward integration with
ngram language models. Our model was
experimented on a Japanese-to-English
newswire translation task, and showed sta-
tistically significant performance improve-
ments against a phrase-based translation
system.
