Abstract
In this paper, we investigate the multiword
verbs in the English sublanguage of MED-
LINE abstracts. Based on the integration of
the domain-specific named entity knowledge
and syntactic as well as statistical information,
this work mainly focuses on how to evaluate a
proper multiword verb candidate. Our results
present a sound balance between the low- and
high-frequency multiword verb candidates in
the sublanguage corpus. We get a F-measure of
0.753, when tested on a manual sample subset
consisting of multiword candidates with both
low- and high-frequencies.
