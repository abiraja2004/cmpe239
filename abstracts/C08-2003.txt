We define the task of incremental or 0-
lag utterance segmentation, that is, the task
of segmenting an ongoing speech recog-
nition stream into utterance units, and
present first results. We use a combination
of hidden event language model, features
from an incremental parser, and acous-
tic / prosodic features to train classifiers on
real-world conversational data (from the
Switchboard corpus). The best classifiers
reach an F-score of around 56%, improv-
ing over baseline and related work.
