 
Partial cognates are pairs of words in two 
languages that have the same meaning in 
some, but not all contexts. Detecting the 
actual meaning of a partial cognate in 
context can be useful for Machine Trans-
lation tools and for Computer-Assisted 
Language Learning tools. In this paper 
we propose a supervised and a semi-
supervised method to disambiguate par-
tial cognates between two languages: 
French and English. The methods use 
only automatically-labeled data; therefore 
they can be applied for other pairs of lan-
guages as well. We also show that our 
methods perform well when using cor-
pora from different domains.
