Nilsson and Nivre (2009) introduced a tree-
based model of persons? eye movements in
reading. The individual variation between
readers reportedly made application across
readers impossible. While a tree-based model
seems plausible for eye movements, we show
that competitive results can be obtained with
a linear CRF model. Increasing the inductive
bias also makes learning across readers pos-
sible. In fact we observe next-to-no perfor-
mance drop when evaluating models trained
on gaze records of multiple readers on new
readers.
