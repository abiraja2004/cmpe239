Ranking documents or sentences accord-
ing to both topic and sentiment relevance
should serve a critical function in helping
users when topics and sentiment polari-
ties of the targeted text are not explicitly
given, as is often the case on the web. In
this paper, we propose several sentiment
information retrieval models in the frame-
work of probabilistic language models, as-
suming that a user both inputs query terms
expressing a certain topic and also speci-
fies a sentiment polarity of interest in some
manner. We combine sentiment relevance
models and topic relevance models with
model parameters estimated from training
data, considering the topic dependence of
the sentiment. Our experiments prove that
our models are effective.
