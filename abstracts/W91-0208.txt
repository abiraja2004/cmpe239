 
Drawing on a growing database of systematic relationships between word-senses, 
the authors argue that a significant class of these represent Lexical Implication 
Rules, a set of formal rules within the domain of lexical semantics; these they 
distinguish from other types of semantic relation more closely dependent on 
metaphor and world-knowledge. Some formal properties of Lexical Implication 
Rules are proposed, as evidence of their linguistic, rather than real-world, nature.
