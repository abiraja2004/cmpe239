We demonstrate a system for flexible
querying against text that has been anno-
tated with the results of NLP processing.
The system supports self-overlapping and
parallel layers, integration of syntactic and
ontological hierarchies, flexibility in the
format of returned results, and tight inte-
gration with SQL. We present a query lan-
guage and its use on examples taken from
the NLP literature.
