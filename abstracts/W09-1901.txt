In this paper we present our experiments with
active learning to improve the performance
of our probabilistic anaphora resolution sys-
tem. We have adopted entropy-based uncer-
tainty measures to select new instances to be
added to our training data. The actively se-
lected instances, however, were not more suc-
cessful in improving the performance of the
system than the same amount of randomly se-
lected instances. The uncertainty measures
we used behave differently from each other
when selecting new instances, but none of
them achieved remarkable performance. Fur-
ther studies on active sample selection for
anaphora resolution are necessary.
