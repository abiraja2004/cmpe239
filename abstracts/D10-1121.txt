Mining sentiment from user generated content
is a very important task in Natural Language
Processing. An example of such content is
threaded discussions which act as a very im-
portant tool for communication and collabo-
ration in the Web. Threaded discussions in-
clude e-mails, e-mail lists, bulletin boards,
newsgroups, and Internet forums. Most of the
work on sentiment analysis has been centered
around finding the sentiment toward products
or topics. In this work, we present a method
to identify the attitude of participants in an
online discussion toward one another. This
would enable us to build a signed network
representation of participant interaction where
every edge has a sign that indicates whether
the interaction is positive or negative. This
is different from most of the research on so-
cial networks that has focused almost exclu-
sively on positive links. The method is exper-
imentally tested using a manually labeled set
of discussion posts. The results show that the
proposed method is capable of identifying at-
titudinal sentences, and their signs, with high
accuracy and that it outperforms several other
baselines.
