Word alignment methods can gain valu-
able guidance by ensuring that their align-
ments maintain cohesion with respect to
the phrases specified by a monolingual de-
pendency tree. However, this hard con-
straint can also rule out correct alignments,
and its utility decreases as alignment mod-
els become more complex. We use a pub-
licly available structured output SVM to
create a max-margin syntactic aligner with
a soft cohesion constraint. The resulting
aligner is the first, to our knowledge, to use
a discriminative learning method to train
an ITG bitext parser.
