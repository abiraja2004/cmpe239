This paper investigates the use of concept-
based representations for text categoriza-
tion. We introduce a new approach to cre-
ate concept-based text representations, and
apply it to a standard text categorization
collection. The representations are used as
input to a Support Vector Machine classi-
fier, and the results show that there are cer-
tain categories for which concept-based rep-
resentations constitute a viable supplement
to word-based ones. We also demonstrate
how the performance of the Support Vec-
tor Machine can be improved by combining
representations.
