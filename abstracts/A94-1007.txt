ing English sentences including coordinate 
conjunctions such as "and", "or", "but" and 
the equivalent words. Syntactic analysis 
of the English coordinate sentences i one 
of the most difficult problems for machine 
translation (MT) systems. The problem 
is selecting, from all possible candidates, 
the correct syntactic structure formed by 
an individual coordinate conjunction, i.e. 
determining which constituents are coor- 
dinated by the conjunction. Typically, so 
many possible structures are produced that 
MT systems cannot select he correct one, 
even if the grammars allow to write the 
rules in the simple notations. This pa- 
per presents an English coordinate struc- 
ture analysis model, which provides top- 
down scope information of the correct syn- 
tactic structure by taking advantage of the 
symmetric patterns of the parallelism. The 
model is based on a balance matching oper- 
ation for two lists of the feature sets, which 
provides four effects: the reduction of anal- 
ysis cost, the improvement of word dis- 
ambiguation, the interpretation f ellipses, 
and robust analysis. This model was prac- 
tically implemented and incorporated into 
the English-Japanese MT system, and pro- 
vided about 75% accuracy in the practical 
translation use.
