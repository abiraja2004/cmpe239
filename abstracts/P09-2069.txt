This paper presents the first stochastic
finite-state morphological parser for Turk-
ish. The non-probabilistic parser is a
standard finite-state transducer implemen-
tation of two-level morphology formal-
ism. A disambiguated text corpus of
200 million words is used to stochas-
tize the morphotactics transducer, then it
is composed with the morphophonemics
transducer to get a stochastic morpho-
logical parser. We present two applica-
tions to evaluate the effectiveness of the
stochastic parser; spelling correction and
morphology-based language modeling for
speech recognition.
