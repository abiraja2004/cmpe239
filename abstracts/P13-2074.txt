We experiment with adding semantic role
information to a string-to-tree machine
translation system based on the rule ex-
traction procedure of Galley et al (2004).
We compare methods based on augment-
ing the set of nonterminals by adding se-
mantic role labels, and altering the rule
extraction process to produce a separate
set of rules for each predicate that encom-
pass its entire predicate-argument struc-
ture. Our results demonstrate that the sec-
ond approach is effective in increasing the
quality of translations.
