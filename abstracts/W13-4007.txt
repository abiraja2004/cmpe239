 
In this paper we focus on modeling 
friendships between humans as a way of 
working towards technology that can initiate 
and sustain a lifelong relationship with users. 
We do this by predicting friendship status in a 
dyad using a set of automatically harvested 
verbal and nonverbal features from videos of 
the interaction of students in a peer tutoring 
study. We propose a new computational 
model used to model friendship status in our 
data, based on a group sparse model (GSM) 
with L2,1 norm which is designed to 
accommodate the sparse and noisy properties 
of the multi-channel features. Our GSM model 
achieved the best overall performance 
compared to a non-sparse linear model (NLM) 
and a regular sparse linear model (SLM), as 
well as outperforming human raters. Dyadic 
features, such as number and length of 
conversational turns and mutual gaze, in 
addition to low level features such as F0 and 
gaze at task, were found to be good predictors 
of friendship status.
