The task of automatically acquiring semanti-
cally related words have led people to study
distributional similarity. The distributional
hypothesis states that words that are simi-
lar share similar contexts. In this paper we
present a technique that aims at improving
the performance of a syntax-based distribu-
tional method by augmenting the original in-
put of the system (syntactic co-occurrences)
with the output of the system (nearest neigh-
bours). This technique is based on the idea of
the transitivity of similarity.
