We present an architecture for the integra-
tion of shallow and deep NLP components
which is aimed at flexible combination
of different language technologies for a
range of practical current and future appli-
cations. In particular, we describe the inte-
gration of a high-level HPSG parsing sys-
tem with different high-performance shal-
low components, ranging from named en-
tity recognition to chunk parsing and shal-
low clause recognition. The NLP com-
ponents enrich a representation of natu-
ral language text with layers of new XML
meta-information using a single shared
data structure, called the text chart. We de-
scribe details of the integration methods,
and show how information extraction and
language checking applications for real-
world German text benefit from a deep
grammatical analysis.
