 
Sarcasm transforms the polarity of an ap-
parently positive or negative utterance into 
its opposite. We report on a method for 
constructing a corpus of sarcastic Twitter 
messages in which determination of the 
sarcasm of each message has been made by 
its author. We use this reliable corpus to 
compare sarcastic utterances in Twitter to 
utterances that express positive or negative 
attitudes without sarcasm. We investigate 
the impact of lexical and pragmatic factors 
on machine learning effectiveness for iden-
tifying sarcastic utterances and we compare 
the performance of machine learning tech-
niques and human judges on this task. Per-
haps unsurprisingly, neither the human 
judges nor the machine learning techniques 
perform very well.
