We present a system that automati-
cally identifies Attribution, an intra-
sentential relation in the RST Tree-
bank. The system uses uses syntactic
information from Penn Treebank parse
trees. It identifies Attributions as struc-
tures in which a verb takes an SBAR
complement, and achieves a f-score of
.92. This supports our claim that the
Attribution relation should be elimi-
nated from a discourse treebank, since
it represents information that is already
present in the Penn Treebank, in a dif-
ferent form. More generally, we sug-
gest that intra-sentential relations in the
RST Treebank might all be eliminable
in this way.
