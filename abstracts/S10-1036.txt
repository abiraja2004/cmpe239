 
In this paper we present KX, a system for key-phrase extraction developed at FBK-IRST, which exploits basic linguistic annotation combined with simple statistical measures to select a list of weighted keywords from a document. The system is flexible in that it of-fers to the user the possibility of setting pa-rameters such as frequency thresholds for col-location extraction and indicators for key-phrase relevance, as well as it allows for do-main adaptation exploiting a corpus of docu-ments in an unsupervised way. KX is also eas-ily adaptable to new languages in that it re-quires only a PoS-Tagger to derive lexical pat-terns. In the SemEval task 5 ?Automatic Key-phrase Extraction from Scientific Articles?, KX performance achieved satisfactory results both in finding reader-assigned keywords and in the combined keywords subtask.  1
