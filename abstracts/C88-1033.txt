 
This paper presents an approach to deal with the underspecification of 
Aktionsarten i German sentences. In German the difference between an 
accomplishment and the associated progressive state is often not marked 
on the sentence level. This distinction is important for correctly 
interpreting texts and for translation into languages which provide 
morphological markings of Aktionsarten. To maintain compositionality we 
suggest a two-step analysis of a text with respect o the temporal relations 
and the classification as events or states. This analysis is guided by the 
Discourse Representation Theory developed by Kamp and makes use of 
world knowledge and an inference component. 
The problem of classification can be reformulated as the problem of 
finding an embedding function f from the representational entities onto 
the domain of a model. The models we use are structures built from 
intervals of time, events and individuals. Considering intensional models of 
this type will allow us to give truth-conditions for progressive states related 
to corresponding accomplishments. We restrict ourselves to progressive 
states of intentional actions and use the beliefs of the agent.
