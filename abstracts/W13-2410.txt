The present paper introduces approach to
improve English-Russian sentence align-
ment, based on POS-tagging of automat-
ically aligned (by HunAlign) source and
target texts. The initial hypothesis is
tested on a corpus of bitexts. Sequences
of POS tags for each sentence (exactly,
nouns, adjectives, verbs and pronouns)
are processed as ?words? and Damerau-
Levenshtein distance between them is
computed. This distance is then normal-
ized by the length of the target sentence
and is used as a threshold between sup-
posedly mis-aligned and ?good? sentence
pairs. The experimental results show pre-
cision 0.81 and recall 0.8, which allows
the method to be used as additional data
source in parallel corpora alignment. At
the same time, this leaves space for further
improvement.
