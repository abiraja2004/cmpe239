LTP (Language Technology Platform) is
an integrated Chinese processing platform
which includes a suite of high perfor-
mance natural language processing (NLP)
modules and relevant corpora. Espe-
cially for the syntactic and semantic pars-
ing modules, we achieved good results
in some relevant evaluations, such as
CoNLL and SemEval. Based on XML in-
ternal data representation, users can easily
use these modules and corpora by invok-
ing DLL (Dynamic Link Library) or Web
service APIs (Application Program Inter-
face), and view the processing results di-
rectly by the visualization tool.
