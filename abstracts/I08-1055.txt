This paper proposes a corpus-based ap-
proach for answering why-questions. Con-
ventional systems use hand-crafted patterns
to extract and evaluate answer candidates.
However, such hand-crafted patterns are
likely to have low coverage of causal expres-
sions, and it is also difficult to assign suit-
able weights to the patterns by hand. In our
approach, causal expressions are automati-
cally collected from corpora tagged with se-
mantic relations. From the collected expres-
sions, features are created to train an an-
swer candidate ranker that maximizes the
QA performance with regards to the corpus
of why-questions and answers. NAZEQA, a
Japanese why-QA system based on our ap-
proach, clearly outperforms a baseline that
uses hand-crafted patterns with a Mean Re-
ciprocal Rank (top-5) of 0.305, making it
presumably the best-performing fully imple-
mented why-QA system.
