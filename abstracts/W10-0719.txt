We present a compendium of recent and cur-
rent projects that utilize crowdsourcing tech-
nologies for language studies, finding that the
quality is comparable to controlled labora-
tory experiments, and in some cases superior.
While crowdsourcing has primarily been used
for annotation in recent language studies, the
results here demonstrate that far richer data
may be generated in a range of linguistic dis-
ciplines from semantics to psycholinguistics.
For these, we report a number of successful
methods for evaluating data quality in the ab-
sence of a ?correct? response for any given
data point.
