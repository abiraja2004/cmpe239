This paper describes a system for the
CoNLL-2005 Shared Task on Semantic
Role Labeling. We trained two parsers
with the training corpus in which the se-
mantic argument information is attached
to the constituent labels, we then used the
resulting parse trees as the input of the
pipelined SRL system. We present our re-
sults of combining the output of various
SRL systems using different parsers.
