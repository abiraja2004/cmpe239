Qualia Structures have many applications
within computational linguistics, but currently
there are no corresponding lexical resources
such as WordNet or FrameNet. This paper
presents an approach to automatically learn
qualia structures for nominals from the World
Wide Web and thus opens the possibility to ex-
plore the impact of qualia structures for natural
language processing at a larger scale. Further-
more, our approach can be also used support a
lexicographer in the task of manually creating
a lexicon of qualia structures. The approach is
based on the idea of matching certain lexico-
syntactic patterns conveying a certain seman-
tic relation on the World Wide Web using stan-
dard search engines. We evaluate our approach
qualitatively by comparing our automatically
learned qualia structures with the ones from the
literature, but also quantitatively by presenting
results of a human evaluation.
