 
 ?Tree SRL system? is a Semantic Role Label-
ling supervised system based on a tree-distance 
algorithm and a simple k-NN implementation. 
The novelty of the system lies in comparing the 
sentences as tree structures with multiple rela-
tions instead of extracting vectors of features 
for each relation and classifying them. The sys-
tem was tested with the English CoNLL-2009 
shared task data set where 79% accuracy was 
obtained.
