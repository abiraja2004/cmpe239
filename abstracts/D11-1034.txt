We investigate the differences between
language models compiled from original
target-language texts and those compiled
from texts manually translated to the tar-
get language. Corroborating established
observations of Translation Studies, we
demonstrate that the latter are signifi-
cantly better predictors of translated sen-
tences than the former, and hence fit the
reference set better. Furthermore, trans-
lated texts yield better language mod-
els for statistical machine translation than
original texts.
