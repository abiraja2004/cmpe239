The paper discusses two topics: firstly an
approach of using multiple layers of an-
notation is sketched out. Regarding the
XML representation this approach is sim-
ilar to standoff annotation. A second topic
is the use of heterogeneous linguistic re-
sources (e.g., XML annotated documents,
taggers, lexical nets) as a source for semi-
automatic multi-dimensional markup to
resolve typical linguistic issues, dealing
with anaphora resolution as a case study.1
