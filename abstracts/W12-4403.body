We present a new approach to named-entity
recognition that jointly learns to identify
named-entities in parallel text. The sys-
tem generates seed candidates through local,
cross-language edit likelihood and then boot-
straps to make broad predictions across both
languages, optimizing combined contextual,
word-shape and alignment models. It is com-
pletely unsupervised, with no manually la-
beled items, no external resources, only us-
ing parallel text that does not need to be eas-
ily alignable. The results are strong, with
F > 0.85 for purely unsupervised named-
entity recognition across languages, compared
to just F = 0.35 on the same data for su-
pervised cross-domain named-entity recogni-
tion within a language. A combination of un-
supervised and supervised methods increases
the accuracy to F = 0.88. We conclude that
we have found a viable new strategy for unsu-
pervised named-entity recognition across low-
resource languages and for domain-adaptation
within high-resource languages.
