The names of named entities very often oc-
cur as constituents of larger noun phrases
which denote different types of entity. Un-
derstanding the structure of the embedding
phrase can be an enormously beneficial first
step to enhancing whatever processing is in-
tended to follow the named entity recogni-
tion in the first place. In this paper, we
examine the integration of general purpose
linguistic processors together with domain
specific named entity recognition in order to
carry out the task of baseNP detection. We
report a best F-score of 87.17% on this task.
We also report an inter-annotator agreement
score of 98.8 Kappa on the task of baseNP
annotation of a new data set.
