We propose a statistical test for measuring
grammatical productivity. We show that
very young children?s knowledge is consistent
with a systematic grammar that independently
combines linguistic units. To a testable extent,
the usage-based approach to language and lan-
guage learning, which emphasizes the role of
lexically specific memorization, is inconsis-
tent with the child language data. We also dis-
cuss the connection of this research with de-
velopments in computational and theoretical
linguistics.
