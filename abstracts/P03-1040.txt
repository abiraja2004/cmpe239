We define noun phrase translation as a
subtask of machine translation. This en-
ables us to build a dedicated noun phrase
translation subsystem that improves over
the currently best general statistical ma-
chine translation methods by incorporat-
ing special modeling and special features.
We achieved 65.5% translation accuracy
in a German-English translation task vs.
53.2% with IBM Model 4.
