Detecting conflicting statements is a foun-
dational text understanding task with appli-
cations in information analysis. We pro-
pose an appropriate definition of contradiction
for NLP tasks and develop available corpora,
from which we construct a typology of con-
tradictions. We demonstrate that a system for
contradiction needs to make more fine-grained
distinctions than the common systems for en-
tailment. In particular, we argue for the cen-
trality of event coreference and therefore in-
corporate such a component based on topical-
ity. We present the first detailed breakdown
of performance on this task. Detecting some
types of contradiction requires deeper inferen-
tial paths than our system is capable of, but
we achieve good performance on types arising
from negation and antonymy.
