Automatic error detection is desired in
the post-processing to improve machine
translation quality. The previous work is
largely based on confidence estimation us-
ing system-based features, such as word
posterior probabilities calculated from N -
best lists or word lattices. We propose to
incorporate two groups of linguistic fea-
tures, which convey information from out-
side machine translation systems, into er-
ror detection: lexical and syntactic fea-
tures. We use a maximum entropy clas-
sifier to predict translation errors by inte-
grating word posterior probability feature
and linguistic features. The experimen-
tal results show that 1) linguistic features
alone outperform word posterior probabil-
ity based confidence estimation in error
detection; and 2) linguistic features can
further provide complementary informa-
tion when combined with word confidence
scores, which collectively reduce the clas-
sification error rate by 18.52% and im-
prove the F measure by 16.37%.
