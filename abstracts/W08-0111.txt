We look at the average frequency of con-
trastive connectives in the SPaRKy Restaurant
Corpus with respect to realization ratings by
human judges. We implement a discriminative
n-gram ranker to model these ratings and ana-
lyze the resulting n-gram weights to determine
if our ranker learns this distribution. Surpris-
ingly, our ranker learns to avoid contrastive
connectives. We look at possible explanations
for this distribution, and recommend improve-
ments to both the generator and ranker of the
sentence plans/realizations.
