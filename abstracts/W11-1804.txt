This paper presents the preparation, resources,
results and analysis of the Infectious Diseases
(ID) information extraction task, a main task
of the BioNLP Shared Task 2011. The ID
task represents an application and extension
of the BioNLP?09 shared task event extrac-
tion approach to full papers on infectious dis-
eases. Seven teams submitted final results to
the task, with the highest-performing system
achieving 56% F-score in the full task, com-
parable to state-of-the-art performance in the
established BioNLP?09 task. The results in-
dicate that event extraction methods general-
ize well to new domains and full-text publi-
cations and are applicable to the extraction of
events relevant to the molecular mechanisms
of infectious diseases.
