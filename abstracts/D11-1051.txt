In this paper, we propose a novel topic
model based on incorporating dictionary
definitions. Traditional topic models treat
words as surface strings without assuming
predefined knowledge about word mean-
ing. They infer topics only by observing
surface word co-occurrence. However, the
co-occurred words may not be semanti-
cally related in a manner that is relevant
for topic coherence. Exploiting dictionary
definitions explicitly in our model yields
a better understanding of word semantics
leading to better text modeling. We exploit
WordNet as a lexical resource for sense
definitions. We show that explicitly mod-
eling word definitions helps improve per-
formance significantly over the baseline
for a text categorization task.
