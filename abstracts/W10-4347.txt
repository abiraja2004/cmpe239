We use automatically extracted acoustic
features to detect speech which is gener-
ated under stress, achieving 76.24% accu-
racy with a binary logistic regression. Our
data are task-oriented human-human dia-
logues in which a time-limit is unexpect-
edly introduced partway through. Anal-
ysis suggests that we can detect approxi-
mately when this event occurs. We also
consider the importance of normalizing
the acoustic features by speaker, and de-
tecting stress in new speakers.
