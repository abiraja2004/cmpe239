We present a system for extracting the
dates of illness events (year and month of
the event occurrence) from posting histo-
ries in the context of an online medical
support community. A temporal tagger re-
trieves and normalizes dates mentioned in-
formally in social media to actual month
and year referents. Building on this, an
event date extraction system learns to in-
tegrate the likelihood of candidate dates
extracted from time-rich sentences with
temporal constraints extracted from event-
related sentences. Our integrated model
achieves 89.7% of the maximum perfor-
mance given the performance of the tem-
poral expression retrieval step.
