Automatic sentiment classification has been
extensively studied and applied in recent
years. However, sentiment is expressed dif-
ferently in different domains, and annotating
corpora for every possible domain of interest
is impractical. We investigate domain adap-
tation for sentiment classifiers, focusing on
online reviews for different types of prod-
ucts. First, we extend to sentiment classifi-
cation the recently-proposed structural cor-
respondence learning (SCL) algorithm, re-
ducing the relative error due to adaptation
between domains by an average of 30% over
the original SCL algorithm and 46% over
a supervised baseline. Second, we identify
a measure of domain similarity that corre-
lates well with the potential for adaptation
of a classifier from one domain to another.
This measure could for instance be used to
select a small set of domains to annotate
whose trained classifiers would transfer well
to many other domains.
