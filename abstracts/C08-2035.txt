The originality of this work leads in tack-
ling text compression using an unsuper-
vised method, based on a deep linguistic
analysis, and without resorting on a learn-
ing corpus. This work presents a system
for dependent tree pruning, while preserv-
ing the syntactic coherence and the main
informational contents, and led to an op-
erational software, named COLIN. Exper-
iment results show that our compressions
get honorable satisfaction levels, with a
mean compression ratio of 38 %.
