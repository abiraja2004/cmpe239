This paper presents a method for incor-
porating word pronunciation information
in a noisy channel model for spelling cor-
rection. The proposed method builds an
explicit error model for word pronuncia-
tions. By modeling pronunciation simi-
larities between words we achieve a sub-
stantial performance improvement over
the previous best performing models for
spelling correction.
