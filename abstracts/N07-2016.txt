Dependency analysis of natural language
gives rise to non-projective structures.
The constraint of well-nestedness on de-
pendency trees has been recently shown
to give a good fit with empirical linguis-
tic data. We present a reformulation of
this constraint using properties of non-
projective edges and show its formal re-
lationship to level types of non-projective
edges; we also derive a simple O(n2) al-
gorithm for checking well-nestedness.
