Automated annotation of social behavior
in conversation is necessary for large-scale
analysis of real-world conversational data.
Important behavioral categories, though,
are often sparse and often appear only
in specific subsections of a conversation.
This makes supervised machine learning
difficult, through a combination of noisy
features and unbalanced class distribu-
tions. We propose within-instance con-
tent selection, using cue features to selec-
tively suppress sections of text and bias-
ing the remaining representation towards
minority classes. We show the effective-
ness of this technique in automated anno-
tation of empowerment language in online
support group chatrooms. Our technique
is significantly more accurate than multi-
ple baselines, especially when prioritizing
high precision.
