In a supertagging task, sequence labeling
models are commonly used. But their lim-
ited ability to model long-distance informa-
tion presents a bottleneck to make further im-
provements. In this paper, we modeled this
long-distance information in dependency for-
malism and integrated it into the process of
HPSG supertagging. The experiments showed
that the dependency information is very in-
formative for supertag disambiguation. We
also evaluated the improved supertagger in the
HPSG parser.
