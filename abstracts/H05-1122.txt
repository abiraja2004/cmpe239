 
This paper explores the segmentation of 
tutorial dialogue into cohesive topics. A 
latent semantic space was created using 
conversations from human to human tu-
toring transcripts, allowing cohesion be-
tween utterances to be measured using 
vector similarity.  Previous cohesion-
based segmentation methods that focus on 
expository monologue are reapplied to 
these dialogues to create benchmarks for 
performance.  A novel moving window 
technique using orthonormal bases of se-
mantic vectors significantly outperforms 
these benchmarks on this dialogue seg-
mentation task.
