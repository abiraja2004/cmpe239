This paper introduces a new, reversible
method for converting syntactic structures
with discontinuous constituents into tradi-
tional syntax trees. The method is applied
to the Tiger Corpus of German and results
for PCFG parsing requiring such context-
free trees are provided. A labeled depen-
dency evaluation shows that the new conver-
sion method leads to better results by pre-
serving local relationships and introducing
fewer inconsistencies into the training data.
