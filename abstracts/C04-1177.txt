In this paper we show that an unsupervised method for
ranking word senses automatically can be used to iden-
tify infrequently occurring senses. We demonstrate this
using a ranking of noun senses derived from the BNC
and evaluating on the sense-tagged text available in both
SemCor and the SENSEVAL-2 English all-words task.
We show that the method does well at identifying senses
that do not occur in a corpus, and that those that are erro-
neously filtered but do occur typically have a lower fre-
quency than the other senses. This method should be
useful for word sense disambiguation systems, allowing
effort to be concentrated on more frequent senses; it may
also be useful for other tasks such as lexical acquisition.
Whilst the results on balanced corpora are promising, our
chief motivation for the method is for application to do-
main specific text. For text within a particular domain
many senses from a generic inventory will be rare, and
possibly redundant. Since a large domain specific cor-
pus of sense annotated data is not available, we evaluate
our method on domain-specific corpora and demonstrate
that sense types identified for removal are predominantly
senses from outside the domain.
