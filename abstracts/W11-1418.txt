Semantic distance is the degree of closeness
between two pieces of text determined by their
meaning. Semantic distance is typically mea-
sured by analyzing a set of documents or a list
of terms and assigning a metric based on the
likeness of their meaning or the concept they
represent. Although related research provides
some semantic-based algorithms, few applica-
tions exist. This work proposes a semantic-
based approach for automatically identifying
potential course equivalencies given their cat-
alog descriptions. The method developed by
Li et al (2006) is extended in this paper to take
a course description from one university as the
input and suggest equivalent courses offered at
another university. Results are evaluated and
future work is discussed.
