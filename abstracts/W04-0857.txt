This paper describes the four entries from the Uni-
versity of Utah in the semantic role labeling task
of SENSEVAL-3. All the entries took a statisti-
cal machine learning approach, using the subset
of the FrameNet corpus provided by SENSEVAL-3
as training data. Our approach was to develop a
model of natural language generation from seman-
tics, and train the model using maximum likelihood
and smoothing. Our models performed satisfacto-
rily in the competition, and can flexibly handle vary-
ing permutations of provided versus inferred infor-
mation.
