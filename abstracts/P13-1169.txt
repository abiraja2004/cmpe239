In Community question answering (QA)
sites, malicious users may provide decep-
tive answers to promote their products or
services. It is important to identify and fil-
ter out these deceptive answers. In this
paper, we first solve this problem with
the traditional supervised learning meth-
ods. Two kinds of features, including tex-
tual and contextual features, are investi-
gated for this task. We further propose
to exploit the user relationships to identify
the deceptive answers, based on the hy-
pothesis that similar users will have simi-
lar behaviors to post deceptive or authentic
answers. To measure the user similarity,
we propose a new user preference graph
based on the answer preference expressed
by users, such as ?helpful? voting and
?best answer? selection. The user prefer-
ence graph is incorporated into traditional
supervised learning framework with the
graph regularization technique. The ex-
periment results demonstrate that the user
preference graph can indeed help improve
the performance of deceptive answer pre-
diction.
