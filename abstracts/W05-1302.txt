In this paper we present the evaluation
of a set of string similarity metrics used
to resolve the mapping from strings to
concepts in the UMLS MetaThesaurus.
String similarity is conceived as a single
component in a full Reference Resolution
System that would resolve such a map-
ping. Given this qualification, we obtain
positive results achieving 73.6 F-measure
(76.1 precision and 71.4 recall) for the
task of assigning the correct UMLS con-
cept to a given string. Our results demon-
strate that adaptive string similarity meth-
ods based on Conditional Random Fields
outperform standard metrics in this do-
main.
