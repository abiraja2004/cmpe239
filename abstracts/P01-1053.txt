An approach to automatic detection of
syllable boundaries is presented. We
demonstrate the use of several manu-
ally constructed grammars trained with
a novel algorithm combining the advan-
tages of treebank and bracketed corpora
training. We investigate the effect of
the training corpus size on the perfor-
mance of our system. The evaluation
shows that a hand-written grammar per-
forms better on finding syllable bound-
aries than does a treebank grammar.
