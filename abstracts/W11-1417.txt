We apply a previously reported measure of di-
alog cohesion to a corpus of spoken tutoring
dialogs in which motivation was measured.
We find that cohesion significantly predicts
changes in student motivation, as measured
with a modified MSLQ instrument. This sug-
gests that non-intrusive dialog measures can
be used to measure motivation during tutoring.
