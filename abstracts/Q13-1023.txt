Adjectives like good, great, and excellent are
similar in meaning, but differ in intensity. In-
tensity order information is very useful for
language learners as well as in several NLP
tasks, but is missing in most lexical resources
(dictionaries, WordNet, and thesauri). In this
paper, we present a primarily unsupervised
approach that uses semantics from Web-scale
data (e.g., phrases like good but not excel-
lent) to rank words by assigning them posi-
tions on a continuous scale. We rely on Mixed
Integer Linear Programming to jointly deter-
mine the ranks, such that individual decisions
benefit from global information. When rank-
ing English adjectives, our global algorithm
achieves substantial improvements over pre-
vious work on both pairwise and rank corre-
lation metrics (specifically, 70% pairwise ac-
curacy as compared to only 56% by previous
work). Moreover, our approach can incorpo-
rate external synonymy information (increas-
ing its pairwise accuracy to 78%) and extends
easily to new languages. We also make our
code and data freely available.1
