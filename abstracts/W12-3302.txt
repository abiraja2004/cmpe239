In my thesis I propose a data-oriented study
on how social power relations between par-
ticipants manifest in the language and struc-
ture of online written dialogs. I propose that
there are different types of power relations
and they are different in the ways they are ex-
pressed and revealed in dialog and across dif-
ferent languages, genres and domains. So far,
I have defined four types of power and anno-
tated them in corporate email threads in En-
glish and found support that they in fact man-
ifest differently in the threads. Using dialog
and language features, I have built a system to
predict participants possessing these types of
power within email threads. I intend to extend
this system to other languages, genres and do-
mains and to improve it?s performance using
deeper linguistic analysis.
