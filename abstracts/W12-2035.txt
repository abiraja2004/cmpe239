 
Grammatical error correction has been an active 
research area in the field of Natural Language 
Processing. In this paper, we integrated four 
distinct learning-based modules to correct 
determiner and preposition errors in leaners? 
writing. Each module focuses on a particular 
type of error. Our modules were tested in 
well-formed data and learners? writing. The 
results show that our system achieves high 
recall while preserves satisfactory precision.
