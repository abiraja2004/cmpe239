 
This paper shows that it is very often 
possible to identify the source language 
of medium-length speeches in the EU-
ROPARL corpus on the basis of fre-
quency counts of word n-grams (87.2%-
96.7% accuracy depending on classifica-
tion method). The paper also examines in 
detail which positive markers are most 
powerful and identifies a number of lin-
guistic aspects as well as culture- and 
domain-related ones.1
