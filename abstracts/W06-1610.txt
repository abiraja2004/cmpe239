 
In this paper, we present ParaEval, an 
automatic evaluation framework that uses 
paraphrases to improve the quality of 
machine translation evaluations. Previous 
work has focused on fixed n-gram 
evaluation metrics coupled with lexical 
identity matching. ParaEval addresses 
three important issues: support for para-
phrase/synonym matching, recall meas-
urement, and correlation with human 
judgments. We show that ParaEval corre-
lates significantly better than BLEU with 
human assessment in measurements for 
both fluency and adequacy.
