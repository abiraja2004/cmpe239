 
This paper proposes a convolution forest ker-
nel to effectively explore rich structured fea-
tures embedded in a packed parse forest. As 
opposed to the convolution tree kernel, the 
proposed forest kernel does not have to com-
mit to a single best parse tree, is thus able to 
explore very large object spaces and much 
more structured features embedded in a forest. 
This makes the proposed kernel more robust 
against parsing errors and data sparseness is-
sues than the convolution tree kernel. The pa-
per presents the formal definition of convolu-
tion forest kernel and also illustrates the com-
puting algorithm to fast compute the proposed 
convolution forest kernel. Experimental results 
on two NLP applications, relation extraction 
and semantic role labeling, show that the pro-
posed forest kernel significantly outperforms 
the baseline of the convolution tree kernel.
