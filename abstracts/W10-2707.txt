We describe a ?How was your day??
(HWYD) Companion whose purpose is to
establish a comforting and supportive rela-
tionship with a user via a conversation on
a variety of work-related topics. The sys-
tem has several fairly novel features aimed
at increasing the naturalness of the interac-
tion: a rapid ?short loop? response primed
by the results of acoustic emotion anal-
ysis, and an ?interruption manager?, en-
abling the user to interrupt lengthy or ap-
parently inappropriate system responses,
prompting a replanning of behaviour on
the part of the system. The ?long loop?
also takes into account the emotional state
of the user, but using more conventional
dialogue management and planning tech-
niques. We describe the architecture and
components of the implemented prototype
HWYD system.
