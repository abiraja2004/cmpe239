 
The learning and self-adaptive capability in 
dialog systems has become increasingly 
important with the advances in a wide range of 
applications. For any application, particularly 
the one dealing with a technical domain, the 
system should pay attention to not only the user 
experience level and dialog goals, but more 
importantly, the mechanism to adapt he system 
behavior to the evolving state of the user. This 
paper describes a methodology that first 
identifies the user experience level and utility 
metrics of the goal and sub-goals, then 
automatically adjusts those parameters based on 
discourse history and thus directs adaptive 
dialog management.
