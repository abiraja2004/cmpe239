 
In this paper we explore the identification of 
negated molecular events (e.g. protein binding, 
gene expressions, regulation, etc.) in biomedi-
cal research abstracts. We construe the prob-
lem as a classification task and apply a ma-
chine learning (ML) approach that uses lexi-
cal, syntactic, and semantic features associated 
with sentences that represent events. Lexical 
features include negation cues, whereas syn-
tactic features are engineered from constitu-
ency parse trees and the command relation be-
tween constituents. Semantic features include 
event type and participants. We also consider a 
rule-based approach that uses only the com-
mand relation. On a test dataset, the ML ap-
proach showed significantly better results 
(51% F-measure) compared to the command-
based rules (35-42% F-measure). Training a 
separate classifier for each event class proved 
to be useful, as the micro-averaged F-score 
improved to 63% (with 88% precision), dem-
onstrating the potential of task-specific ML 
approaches to negation detection.
