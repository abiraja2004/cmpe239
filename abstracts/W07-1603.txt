PrepLex is a lexicon of French prepositions
which provides all the syntactic information
needed for parsing. It was built by compar-
ing and merging several authoritative lexical
sources. This lexicon also includes infor-
mation about the prepositions or classes of
prepositions that appear in French verb sub-
categorization frames. This resource has
been developed as a first step in making cur-
rent French preposition lexicons available
for effective natural language processing.
