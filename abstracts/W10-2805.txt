In this paper we explore the computational
modelling of compositionality in distri-
butional models of semantics. In par-
ticular, we model the semantic composi-
tion of pairs of adjacent English Adjec-
tives and Nouns from the British National
Corpus. We build a vector-based seman-
tic space from a lemmatised version of
the BNC, where the most frequent A-N
lemma pairs are treated as single tokens.
We then extrapolate three different mod-
els of compositionality: a simple additive
model, a pointwise-multiplicative model
and a Partial Least Squares Regression
(PLSR) model. We propose two evalu-
ation methods for the implemented mod-
els. Our study leads to the conclusion that
regression-based models of composition-
ality generally out-perform additive and
multiplicative approaches, and also show a
number of advantages that make them very
promising for future research.
