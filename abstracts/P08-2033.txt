We investigate elaborative summarisation,
where the aim is to identify supplementary in-
formation that expands upon a key fact. We
envisage such summaries being useful when
browsing certain kinds of (hyper-)linked doc-
ument sets, such as Wikipedia articles or
repositories of publications linked by cita-
tions. For these collections, an elaborative
summary is intended to provide additional in-
formation on the linking anchor text. Our con-
tribution in this paper focuses on identifying
and exploring a real task in which summarisa-
tion is situated, realised as an In-Browser tool.
We also introduce a neighbourhood scoring
heuristic as a means of scoring matches to rel-
evant passages of the document. In a prelim-
inary evaluation using this method, our sum-
marisation system scores above our baselines
and achieves a recall of 57% annotated gold
standard sentences.
