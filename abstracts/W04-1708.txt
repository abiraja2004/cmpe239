Assisting in foreign language learning is one of
the major areas in which natural language pro-
cessing technology can contribute. This paper
proposes a computerized method of measuring
communicative skill in English as a foreign lan-
guage. The proposed method consists of two
parts. The first part involves a test sentence
selection part to achieve precise measurement
with a small test set. The second part is the ac-
tual measurement, which has three steps. Step
one asks proficiency-known human subjects to
translate Japanese sentences into English. Step
two gauges the match between the translations
of the subjects and correct translations based
on the n-gram overlap or the edit distance be-
tween translations. Step three learns the rela-
tionship between proficiency and match. By re-
gression it finds a straight-line fitting for the
scatter plot representing the proficiency and
matches of the subjects. Then, it estimates pro-
ficiency of proficiency-unknown users by using
the line and the match. Based on this approach,
we conducted experiments on estimating the
Test of English for International Communica-
tion (TOEIC) score. We collected two sets of
data consisting of English sentences translated
from Japanese. The first set consists of 330 sen-
tences, each translated to English by 29 subjects
with varied English proficiency. The second set
consists of 510 sentences translated in a similar
manner by a separate group of 18 subjects. We
found that the estimated scores correlated with
the actual scores.
