We explore a novel computational ap-
proach to identifying ?constructions? or
?multi-word expressions? (MWEs) in an
annotated corpus. In this approach,
MWEs have no special status, but emerge
in a general procedure for finding the best
statistical grammar to describe the train-
ing corpus. The statistical grammar for-
malism used is that of stochastic tree sub-
stitution grammars (STSGs), such as used
in Data-Oriented Parsing. We present an
algorithm for calculating the expected fre-
quencies of arbitrary subtrees given the
parameters of an STSG, and a method
for estimating the parameters of an STSG
given observed frequencies in a tree bank.
We report quantitative results on the ATIS
corpus of phrase-structure annotated sen-
tences, and give examples of the MWEs
extracted from this corpus.
