 
Information Extraction (IE) systems today are com- 
monly based on pattern matching. The patterns are 
regular expressions tored in a customizable knowl- 
edge base. Adapting an IE system to a new subject 
domain entails the construction of a new pattern base 
- -  a time-consuming and expensive task. We describe 
a strategy for building patterns from examples. To 
adapt the IE system to a new domain quickly, the 
user chooses a set of examples in a training text, and 
for each example gives the logical form entries which 
the example induces. The system transforms these 
examples into patterns and then applies meta-rules 
to generalize these patterns.
