Previous work on German parsing has pro-
vided confusing and conflicting results con-
cerning the difficulty of the task and whether
techniques that are useful for English, such
as lexicalization, are effective for German.
This paper aims to provide some understand-
ing and solid baseline numbers for the task.
We examine the performance of three tech-
niques on three treebanks (Negra, Tiger, and
Tu?Ba-D/Z): (i) Markovization, (ii) lexicaliza-
tion, and (iii) state splitting. We additionally
explore parsing with the inclusion of gram-
matical function information. Explicit gram-
matical functions are important to German
language understanding, but they are numer-
ous, and na??vely incorporating them into a
parser which assumes a small phrasal category
inventory causes large performance reductions
due to increasing sparsity.
