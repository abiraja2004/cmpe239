We present a simple method for generating
translations with the Moses toolkit (Koehn
et al, 2007) from existing hypotheses pro-
duced by other translation engines. As
the structures underlying these translation
engines are not known, an evaluation-
based strategy is applied to select sys-
tems for combination. The experiments
show promising improvements in terms of
BLEU.
