In this paper, we study the problem of auto-
matic enrichment of a morphologically under-
specified treebank for Arabic, a morpholog-
ically rich language. We show that we can
map from a tagset of size six to one with 485
tags at an accuracy rate of 94%-95%. We
can also identify the unspecified lemmas in
the treebank with an accuracy over 97%. Fur-
thermore, we demonstrate that using our au-
tomatic annotations improves the performance
of a state-of-the-art Arabic morphological tag-
ger. Our approach combines a variety of tech-
niques from corpus-based statistical models to
linguistic rules that target specific phenomena.
These results suggest that the cost of treebank-
ing can be reduced by designing underspec-
ified treebanks that can be subsequently en-
riched automatically.
