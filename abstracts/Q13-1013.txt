In this paper, we present Dijkstra-WSA, a
novel graph-based algorithm for word sense
alignment. We evaluate it on four different
pairs of lexical-semantic resources with dif-
ferent characteristics (WordNet-OmegaWiki,
WordNet-Wiktionary, GermaNet-Wiktionary
and WordNet-Wikipedia) and show that it
achieves competitive performance on 3 out
of 4 datasets. Dijkstra-WSA outperforms the
state of the art on every dataset if it is com-
bined with a back-off based on gloss similar-
ity. We also demonstrate that Dijkstra-WSA
is not only flexibly applicable to different re-
sources but also highly parameterizable to op-
timize for precision or recall.
