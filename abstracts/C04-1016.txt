 
In this paper we report on the results of an 
experiment in designing resource-light metrics that 
predict the potential translation complexity of a 
text or a corpus of homogenous texts for state-of-
the-art MT systems. We show that the best 
prediction of translation complexity is given by the 
average number of syllables per word (ASW). The 
translation complexity metrics based on this 
parameter are used to normalise automated MT 
evaluation scores such as BLEU, which otherwise 
are variable across texts of different types. The 
suggested approach makes a fairer comparison 
between the MT systems evaluated on different 
corpora. The translation complexity metric was 
integrated into two automated MT evaluation 
packages ? BLEU and the Weighted N-gram 
model. The extended MT evaluation tools are 
available from the first author?s web site:
