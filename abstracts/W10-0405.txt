The system helps learners identify lexico-grammatical errors by matching pat-terns gleaned from a very large corpus of learners? texts.  Users are guided to appropri-ate language patterns as they write and revise through online declarative and procedural re-sources.  Even as more robust and fully auto-matic feedback technologies evolve, comprehensive resource-rich support will re-main necessary for second-language (L2) writers who must develop practical life-long language learning strategies.  To assist lan-guage tutors support novice L2 writers, we have also produced tools that help tutors rein-force their students? independent writing and proofreading strategies.  The operation and ra-tionale of this approach have been imple-mented and evaluated in several Hong Kong universities and secondary schools.
