This paper studies the application of the
Web Selectors word sense disambiguation
system on a specific domain. The system
was primarily applied without any domain
tuning, but the incorporation of domain
predominant sense information was ex-
plored. Results indicated that the system
performs relatively the same with domain
predominant sense information as without,
scoring well above a random baseline, but
still 5 percentage points below results of
using the first sense.
