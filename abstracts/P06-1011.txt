We present a novel method for extract-
ing parallel sub-sentential fragments from
comparable, non-parallel bilingual cor-
pora. By analyzing potentially similar
sentence pairs using a signal processing-
inspired approach, we detect which seg-
ments of the source sentence are translated
into segments in the target sentence, and
which are not. This method enables us
to extract useful machine translation train-
ing data even from very non-parallel cor-
pora, which contain no parallel sentence
pairs. We evaluate the quality of the ex-
tracted data by showing that it improves
the performance of a state-of-the-art sta-
tistical machine translation system.
