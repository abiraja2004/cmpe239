Traditional learning-based coreference re-
solvers operate by training a mention-
pair classifier for determining whether two
mentions are coreferent or not. Two in-
dependent lines of recent research have
attempted to improve these mention-pair
classifiers, one by learning a mention-
ranking model to rank preceding men-
tions for a given anaphor, and the other
by training an entity-mention classifier
to determine whether a preceding clus-
ter is coreferent with a given mention.
We propose a cluster-ranking approach to
coreference resolution that combines the
strengths of mention rankers and entity-
mention models. We additionally show
how our cluster-ranking framework natu-
rally allows discourse-new entity detection
to be learned jointly with coreference res-
olution. Experimental results on the ACE
data sets demonstrate its superior perfor-
mance to competing approaches.
