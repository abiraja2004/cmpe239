Dependency parsing has gained attention in
natural language understanding because the
representation of dependency tree is simple,
compact and direct such that robust partial
understanding and task portability can be
achieved more easily. However, many de-
pendency parsers make hard decisions with
local information while selecting among
the next parse states. As a consequence,
though the obtained dependency trees are
good in some sense, the N-best output is
not guaranteed to be globally optimal in
general.
In this paper, a stochastic dependency pars-
ing scheme based on A* admissible search
is formally presented. By well representing
the parse state and appropriately designing
the cost and heuristic functions, depend-
ency parsing can be modeled as an A*
search problem, and solved with a generic
algorithm of state space search. When
evaluated on the Chinese Tree Bank, this
parser can obtain 85.99% dependency ac-
curacy at 68.39% sentence accuracy, and
14.62% node ratio for dynamic heuristic.
This parser can output N-best dependency
trees, and integrate the semantic processing
into the search process easily.
