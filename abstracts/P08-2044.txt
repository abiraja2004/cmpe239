 
While speech recognition systems have come 
a long way in the last thirty years, there is still 
room for improvement.  Although readily 
available, these systems are sometimes inac-
curate and insufficient.  The research pre-
sented here outlines a technique called 
Distributed Listening which demonstrates no-
ticeable improvements to existing speech rec-
ognition methods.  The Distributed Listening 
architecture introduces the idea of multiple, 
parallel, yet physically separate automatic 
speech recognizers called listeners. Distrib-
uted Listening also uses a piece of middleware 
called an interpreter.  The interpreter resolves 
multiple interpretations using the Phrase 
Resolution Algorithm (PRA). These efforts 
work together to increase the accuracy of the 
transcription of spoken utterances.
