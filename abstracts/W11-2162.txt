This paper describes the system presented for
the English-Spanish translation task by the
collaboration between CEU-UCH and UPV
for 2011 WMT. A comparison of indepen-
dent phrase-based translation models interpo-
lation for each available training corpora were
tested, giving an improvement of 0.4 BLEU
points over the baseline. Output N -best lists
were rescored via a target Neural Network
Language Model. An improvement of one
BLEU point over the baseline was obtained
adding the two features, giving 31.5 BLEU
and 57.9 TER for the primary system, com-
puted over lowercased and detokenized out-
puts. The system was positioned second in the
final ranking.
