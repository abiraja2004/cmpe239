We describe a data-driven approach to
building interpretable discourse structures
for appointment scheduling dialogues. We
represent discourse structures as headed
trees and model them with probabilis-
tic head-driven parsing techniques. We
show that dialogue-based features regard-
ing turn-taking and domain specific goals
have a large positive impact on perfor-
mance. Our best model achieves an f -
score of 43.2% for labelled discourse rela-
tions and 67.9% for unlabelled ones, sig-
nificantly beating a right-branching base-
line that uses the most frequent relations.
