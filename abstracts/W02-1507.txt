In this paper, we propose a classification of gram-
mar development strategies according to two crite-
ria : hand-written versus automatically acquired
grammars, and grammars based on a low versus
high level of syntactic abstraction. Our classifica-
tion yields four types of grammars. For each type,
we discuss implementation and evaluation issues.
