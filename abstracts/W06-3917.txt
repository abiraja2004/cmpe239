Semantic Networks (SN) are a knowledge representation paradigm especially
suited for the meaning representation of natural language expressions. In order
to clearly define their basic constructs, the relations and functions used in a se-
mantic network must be given a logical characterization. The paper exemplifies
this strategy for Multilayered Extended Semantic Networks (the so-called Multi-
Net paradigm). In particular, it is shown that the axioms characterizing the logical
properties of the expressional means of an SN have to be classified according to
different criteria which are connected with specific types of inference.
