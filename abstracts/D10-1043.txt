 
This paper studies two issues, non-isomorphic 
structure translation and target syntactic structure 
usage, for statistical machine translation in the 
context of forest-based tree to tree sequence trans-
lation. For the first issue, we propose a novel 
non-isomorphic translation framework to capture 
more non-isomorphic structure mappings than tra-
ditional tree-based and tree-sequence-based trans-
lation methods. For the second issue, we propose a 
parallel space searching method to generate hypo-
thesis using tree-to-string model and evaluate its 
syntactic goodness using tree-to-tree/tree sequence 
model. This not only reduces the search complexity 
by merging spurious-ambiguity translation paths 
and solves the data sparseness issue in training, but 
also serves as a syntax-based target language mod-
el for better grammatical generation. Experiment 
results on the benchmark data show our proposed 
two solutions are very effective, achieving signifi-
cant performance improvement over baselines 
when applying to different translation models.
