 
The main drawback of previous Chinese cha-
racter error detection systems is the high false 
alarm rate. To solve this problem, we propose 
a system that combines a statistic method and 
template matching to detect Chinese character 
errors. Error types include pronunciation-
related errors and form-related errors. Possible 
errors of a character can be collected to form a 
confusion set. Our system automatically gene-
rates templates with the help of a dictionary 
and confusion sets. The templates can be used 
to detect and correct errors in essays. In this 
paper, we compare three methods proposed in 
previous works. The experiment results show 
that our system can reduce the false alarm sig-
nificantly and give the best performance on f-
score.
