 
The lexicons for Knowledge-Based Machine 
Translation systems require knowledge in- 
tensive morphological, syntactic and se- 
mantic information. This information is of- 
ten used in different ways and usually for- 
matted for a specific NLP system. This 
tends to make both the acquisition and 
maintenance of lexical databases cumber- 
some, inefficient and error-prone. In order 
to solve these problems, we have developed 
a program called COOL which automates 
the acquisition and maintenance processes 
and allows us to standardize and central- 
ize the databases. This system is currently 
being used in the ESTRATO machine trans- 
lation project at the Center for Machine 
Translation.
