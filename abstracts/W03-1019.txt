Discriminative models have been of inter-
est in the NLP community in recent years.
Previous research has shown that they
are advantageous over generative mod-
els. In this paper, we investigate how dif-
ferent objective functions and optimiza-
tion methods affect the performance of the
classifiers in the discriminative learning
framework. We focus on the sequence la-
belling problem, particularly POS tagging
and NER tasks. Our experiments show
that changing the objective function is not
as effective as changing the features in-
cluded in the model.
