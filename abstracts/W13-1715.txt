 
Native Language Identification (NLI), which 
tries to identify the native language (L1) of a 
second language learner based on their writ-
ings, is helpful for advancing second language 
learning and authorship profiling in forensic 
linguistics. With the availability of relevant 
data resources, much work has been done to 
explore the native language of a foreign lan-
guage learner. In this report, we present our 
system for the first shared task in Native Lan-
guage Identification (NLI). We use a linear 
SVM classifier and explore features of words, 
word and character n-grams, style, and 
metadata. Our official system achieves accu-
racy of 0.773, which ranks it 18th among the 
29 teams in the closed track.
