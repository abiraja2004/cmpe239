In this paper we address the problem of
identifying reciprocal relationships in English.
In particular we introduce an algorithm that
semi-automatically discovers patterns encod-
ing reciprocity based on a set of simple but
effective pronoun templates. Using a set of
most frequently occurring patterns, we extract
pairs of reciprocal pattern instances by search-
ing the web. Then we apply two unsuper-
vised clustering procedures to form meaning-
ful clusters of such reciprocal instances. The
pattern discovery procedure yields an accu-
racy of 97%, while the clustering procedures
indicate accuracies of 91% and 82%. More-
over, the resulting set of 10,882 reciprocal in-
stances represent a broad-coverage resource.
