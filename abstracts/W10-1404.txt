 
We present a set of experiments on depend-
ency parsing of the Basque Dependency Tree-
bank (BDT). The present work has examined 
several directions that try to explore the rich 
set of morphosyntactic features in the BDT: i) 
experimenting the impact of morphological 
features, ii) application of dependency tree 
transformations, iii) application of a two-stage 
parsing scheme (stacking), and iv) combina-
tions of the individual experiments. All the 
tests were conducted using MaltParser (Nivre 
et al, 2007a), a freely available and state of 
the art dependency parser generator.
