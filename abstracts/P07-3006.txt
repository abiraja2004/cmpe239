Effectively identifying events in unstruc-
tured text is a very difficult task. This is
largely due to the fact that an individual
event can be expressed by several sentences.
In this paper, we investigate the use of clus-
tering methods for the task of grouping the
text spans in a news article that refer to the
same event. The key idea is to cluster the
sentences, using a novel distance metric that
exploits regularities in the sequential struc-
ture of events within a document. When
this approach is compared to a simple bag
of words baseline, a statistically significant
increase in performance is observed.
