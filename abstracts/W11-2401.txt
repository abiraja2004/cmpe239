Reading comprehension activities are an au-
thentic task including a rich, language-based
context, which makes them an interesting real-
life challenge for research into automatic con-
tent analysis. For textual entailment research,
content assessment of reading comprehension
exercises provides an interesting opportunity
for extrinsic, real-purpose evaluation, which
also supports the integration of context and
task information into the analysis.
In this paper, we discuss the first results for
content assessment of reading comprehension
activities for German and present results which
are competitive with the current state of the
art for English. Diving deeper into the results,
we provide an analysis in terms of the differ-
ent question types and the ways in which the
information asked for is encoded in the text.
We then turn to analyzing the role of the ques-
tion and argue that the surface-based account
of information that is given in the question
should be replaced with a more sophisticated,
linguistically informed analysis of the informa-
tion structuring of the answer in the context of
the question that it is a response to.
