 
This paper describes a word and phrase 
alignment approach based on a depend-
ency analysis of French/English parallel 
corpora, referred to as alignment by ?syn-
tax-based propagation.? Both corpora are 
analysed with a deep and robust depend-
ency parser. Starting with an anchor pair 
consisting of two words that are transla-
tions of one another within aligned sen-
tences, the alignment link is propagated to 
syntactically connected words.
