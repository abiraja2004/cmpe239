The potential benefit of integrating con-
textual information for recommendation
has received much research attention re-
cently, especially with the ever-increasing
interest in mobile-based recommendation
services. However, context based recom-
mendation research is limited due to the
lack of standard evaluation data with con-
textual information and reliable technol-
ogy for extracting such information. As
a result, there are no widely accepted con-
clusions on how, when and whether con-
text helps. Additionally, a system of-
ten suffers from the so called cold start
problem due to the lack of data for train-
ing the initial context based recommenda-
tion model. This paper proposes a novel
solution to address these problems with
automated information extraction tech-
niques. We also compare several ap-
proaches for utilizing context based on
a new data set collected using the pro-
posed solution. The experimental results
demonstrate that 1) IE-based techniques
can help create a large scale context data
with decent quality from online reviews,
at least for restaurant recommendations;
2) context helps recommender systems
rank items, however, does not help pre-
dict user ratings; 3) simply using context
to filter items hurts recommendation per-
formance, while a new probabilistic latent
relational model we proposed helps.
