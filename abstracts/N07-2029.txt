Document representation has a large im-
pact on the performance of document re-
trieval and clustering algorithms. We
propose a hybrid document indexing
scheme that combines the traditional bag-
of-words representation with spectral em-
bedding. This method accounts for the
specifics of the document collection and
also uses semantic similarity information
based on a large scale statistical analysis.
Clustering experiments showed improve-
ments over the traditional tf-idf represen-
tation and over the spectral methods based
solely on the document collection.
