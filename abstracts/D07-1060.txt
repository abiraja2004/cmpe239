We present the idea of estimating seman-
tic distance in one, possibly resource-poor,
language using a knowledge source in an-
other, possibly resource-rich, language. We
do so by creating cross-lingual distributional
profiles of concepts, using a bilingual lexi-
con and a bootstrapping algorithm, but with-
out the use of any sense-annotated data or
word-aligned corpora. The cross-lingual
measures of semantic distance are evaluated
on two tasks: (1) estimating semantic dis-
tance between words and ranking the word
pairs according to semantic distance, and
(2) solving Reader?s Digest ?Word Power?
problems. In task (1), cross-lingual mea-
sures are superior to conventional monolin-
gual measures based on a wordnet. In task
(2), cross-lingual measures are able to solve
more problems correctly, and despite scores
being affected by many tied answers, their
overall performance is again better than the
best monolingual measures.
