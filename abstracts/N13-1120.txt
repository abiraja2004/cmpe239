In this work, we study the problem of mea-
suring relational similarity between two word
pairs (e.g., silverware:fork and clothing:shirt).
Due to the large number of possible relations,
we argue that it is important to combine mul-
tiple models based on heterogeneous informa-
tion sources. Our overall system consists of
two novel general-purpose relational similar-
ity models and three specific word relation
models. When evaluated in the setting of a
recently proposed SemEval-2012 task, our ap-
proach outperforms the previous best system
substantially, achieving a 54.1% relative in-
crease in Spearman?s rank correlation.
