We describe a new interactive annotation
scheme between a human annotator who
carries out simplified annotations on CFG
trees, and a statistical parser that converts
the human annotations automatically into a
richly annotated HPSG treebank. In order
to check the proposed scheme?s effectiveness,
we performed automatic pseudo-annotations
that emulate the system?s idealized behavior
and measured the performance of the parser
trained on those annotations. In addition,
we implemented a prototype system and con-
ducted manual annotation experiments on a
small test set.
