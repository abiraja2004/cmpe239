Accurate and robust metrics for automatic eval-
uation are key to the development of statistical
machine translation (MT) systems. We first
introduce a new regression model that uses a
probabilistic finite state machine (pFSM) to
compute weighted edit distance as predictions
of translation quality. We also propose a novel
pushdown automaton extension of the pFSM
model for modeling word swapping and cross
alignments that cannot be captured by stan-
dard edit distance models. Our models can eas-
ily incorporate a rich set of linguistic features,
and automatically learn their weights, elimi-
nating the need for ad-hoc parameter tuning.
Our methods achieve state-of-the-art correla-
tion with human judgments on two different
prediction tasks across a diverse set of standard
evaluations (NIST OpenMT06,08; WMT06-
08).
