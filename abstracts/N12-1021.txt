We propose a new shared task on grading stu-
dent answers with the goal of enabling well-
targeted and flexible feedback in a tutorial di-
alogue setting. We provide an annotated cor-
pus designed for the purpose, a precise speci-
fication for a prediction task and an associated
evaluation methodology. The task is feasible
but non-trivial, which is demonstrated by cre-
ating and comparing three alternative baseline
systems. We believe that this corpus will be
of interest to the researchers working in tex-
tual entailment and will stimulate new devel-
opments both in natural language processing
in tutorial dialogue systems and textual entail-
ment, contradiction detection and other tech-
niques of interest for a variety of computa-
tional linguistics tasks.
