 We present VENSES, a linguistically-based approach for semantic inference which is built around a neat division of labour between two main components: a grammatically-driven subsystem which is responsible for the level of predicate-arguments well-formedness and works on the output of a deep parser that produces augmented head-dependency structures. A second subsystem fires allowed logical and lexical inferences on the basis of different types of structural transformations intended to produce a semantically valid meaning correspondence. In the current challenge, we produced a new version of the system, where we do away with grammatical relations and only use semantic roles to generate weighted scores. We also added a number of additional modules to cope with fine-grained inferential triggers which were not present in previous dataset. Different levels of argumenthood have been devised in order to cope with semantic uncertainty generated by nearly-inferrable Text-Hypothesis pairs where the interpretation needs reasoning. RTE3 has introduced texts of paragraph length: in turn this has prompted us to upgrade VENSES by the addition of a discourse level anaphora resolution module, which is paramount to allow entailment in pairs where the relevant portion of text contains pronominal expressions. We present the system, its relevance to the task at hand and an evaluation. 1
