 
We describe the modification of a grammar to take ad- 
vantage of prosodic information automatically extracted 
from speech. The work includes (1) the development 
of an integer "break index" representation f prosodic 
phrase boundary information, (2) the automatic detec- 
tion of prosodic phrase breaks using a hidden Markov 
model on relative duration of phonetic segments, and 
(3) the integration of the prosodic phrase break informa- 
tion in SRI's Spoken Language System to rule out alter- 
native parses in otherwise syntactically ambiguous sen- 
tences. Initial experiments using ambiguous sentences 
read by radio announcers achieved good results in both 
detection and parsing. Automatically detected phrase 
break indices had a correlation greater than 0.86 with 
hand-labeled data for speaker-dependent models; and, 
in a subset of sentences with preposition ambiguities, 
the number of parses was reduced by 25% with a simple 
grammar modification.
