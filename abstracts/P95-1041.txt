 
This paper describes aheuristic-based approach to 
word-sense disambiguation. The heuristics that are 
applied to disambiguate a word depend on its part of 
speech, and on its relationship to neighboring salient 
words in the text. Parts of speech are found through a 
tagger, and related neighboring words are identified by a 
phrase xtractor operating on the tagged text. To suggest 
possible senses, each heuristic draws on semantic rela- 
tions extracted from a Webster's dictionary and the 
semantic thesaurus WordNet. For a given word, all 
applicable heuristics are tried, and those senses that are 
rejected by all heuristics are discarded. In all, the disam- 
biguator uses 39 heuristics based on 12 relationships.
