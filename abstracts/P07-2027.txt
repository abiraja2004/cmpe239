We describe an algorithm for a novel task: disam-
biguating the pronoun you in conversation. You can
be generic or referential; finding referential you is im-
portant for tasks such as addressee identification or
extracting ?owners? of action items. Our classifier
achieves 84% accuracy in two-person conversations;
an initial study shows promising performance even on
more complex multi-party meetings.
