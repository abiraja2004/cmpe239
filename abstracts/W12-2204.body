Generally, people with dyslexia are poor read-
ers but strong visual thinkers. The use of
graphical schemes for helping text compre-
hension is recommended in education man-
uals. This study explores the relation be-
tween text readability and the visual concep-
tual schemes which aim to make the text more
clear for these specific target readers. Our re-
sults are based on a user study for Spanish na-
tive speakers through a group of twenty three
dyslexic users and a control group of similar
size. The data collected from our study com-
bines qualitative data from questionnaires and
quantitative data from tests carried out using
eye tracking. The findings suggest that graph-
ical schemes may help to improve readability
for dyslexics but are, unexpectedly, counter-
productive for understandability.
