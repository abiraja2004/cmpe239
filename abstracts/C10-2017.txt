This article delves into the scoring func-
tion of the statistical paraphrase genera-
tion model. It presents an algorithm for
exact computation and two applicative ex-
periments. The first experiment analyses
the behaviour of a statistical paraphrase
generation decoder, and raises some is-
sues with the ordering of n-best outputs.
The second experiment shows that a major
boost of performance can be obtained by
embedding a true score computation in-
side a Monte-Carlo sampling based para-
phrase generator.
