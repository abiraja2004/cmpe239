Domain adaptation is an important problem in
named entity recognition (NER). NER classi-
fiers usually lose accuracy in the domain trans-
fer due to the different data distribution be-
tween the source and the target domains. The
major reason for performance degrading is
that each entity type often has lots of domain-
specific term representations in the different
domains. The existing approaches usually
need an amount of labeled target domain data
for tuning the original model. However, it
is a labor-intensive and time-consuming task
to build annotated training data set for every
target domain. We present a domain adapta-
tion method with latent semantic association
(LaSA). This method effectively overcomes
the data distribution difference without lever-
aging any labeled target domain data. LaSA
model is constructed to capture latent seman-
tic association among words from the unla-
beled corpus. It groups words into a set of
concepts according to the related context snip-
pets. In the domain transfer, the original term
spaces of both domains are projected to a con-
cept space using LaSA model at first, then the
original NER model is tuned based on the se-
mantic association features. Experimental re-
sults on English and Chinese corpus show that
LaSA-based domain adaptation significantly
enhances the performance of NER.
