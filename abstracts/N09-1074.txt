This paper introduces three new syntactic
models for representing speech with repairs.
These models are developed to test the intu-
ition that the erroneous parts of speech repairs
(reparanda) are not generated or recognized as
such while occurring, but only after they have
been corrected. Thus, they are designed to
minimize the differences in grammar rule ap-
plications between fluent and disfluent speech
containing similar structure. The three models
considered in this paper are also designed to
isolate the mechanism of impact, by systemat-
ically exploring different variables.
