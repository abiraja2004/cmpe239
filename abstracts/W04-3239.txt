The focus of research in text classification has ex-
panded from simple topic identification to more
challenging tasks such as opinion/modality identi-
fication. Unfortunately, the latter goals exceed the
ability of the traditional bag-of-word representation
approach, and a richer, more structural representa-
tion is required. Accordingly, learning algorithms
must be created that can handle the structures ob-
served in texts. In this paper, we propose a Boosting
algorithm that captures sub-structures embedded in
texts. The proposal consists of i) decision stumps
that use subtrees as features and ii) the Boosting al-
gorithm which employs the subtree-based decision
stumps as weak learners. We also discuss the rela-
tion between our algorithm and SVMs with tree ker-
nel. Two experiments on opinion/modality classifi-
cation confirm that subtree features are important.
