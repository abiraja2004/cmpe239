 
The purpose of the study is to develop an 
integrated knowledge management system for the 
domains of genome and nano-technology, in 
which terminology-based literature mining, 
knowledge acquisition, knowledge structuring, 
and knowledge retrieval are combined. The system 
supports integrating different databases (papers 
and patents, technologies and innovations) and 
retrieving different types of knowledge 
simultaneously. The main objective of the system 
is to facilitate knowledge acquisition from 
documents and new knowledge discovery through 
a terminology-based similarity calculation and a 
visualization of automatically structured 
knowledge. Implementation issues of the system 
are also mentioned. 
Key Words: Structuring knowledge, knowledge 
acquisition, information extraction, natural 
language processing, automatic term recognition,
