We present a log-linear model for the disam-
biguation of the analyses produced by a Ger-
man broad-coverage LFG, focussing on the
properties (or features) this model is based
on. We compare this model to an initial
model based only on a part of the proper-
ties provided to the final model and observe
that the performance of a log-linear model
for parse selection depends heavily on the
types of properties that it is based on. In
our case, the error reduction achieved with
the log-linear model based on the extended
set of properties is 51.0% and thus com-
pares very favorably to the error reduction
of 34.5% achieved with the initial model.
