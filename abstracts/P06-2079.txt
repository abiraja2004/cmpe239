This paper examines two problems in
document-level sentiment analysis: (1) de-
termining whether a given document is a
review or not, and (2) classifying the po-
larity of a review as positive or negative.
We first demonstrate that review identifi-
cation can be performed with high accu-
racy using only unigrams as features. We
then examine the role of four types of sim-
ple linguistic knowledge sources in a po-
larity classification system.
