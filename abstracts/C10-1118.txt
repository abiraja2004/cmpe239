 
We employ Maximum Entropy model to con-
duct sub-tree alignment between bilingual 
phrasal structure trees. Various lexical and 
structural knowledge is explored to measure the 
syntactic similarity across Chinese-English bi-
lingual tree pairs. In the experiment, we evalu-
ate the sub-tree alignment using both gold 
standard tree bank and the automatically parsed 
corpus with manually annotated sub-tree align-
ment. Compared with a heuristic similarity 
based method, the proposed method significant-
ly improves the performance with only limited 
sub-tree aligned data. To examine its effective-
ness for multilingual applications, we further at-
tempt different approaches to apply the sub-tree 
alignment in both phrase and syntax based SMT 
systems. We then compare the performance 
with that of the widely used word alignment. 
Experimental results on benchmark data show 
that sub-tree alignment benefits both systems by 
relaxing the constraint of the word alignment.
