In this paper, we describe the algorithms and
experimental results of Brandeis University
in the participation of the CoNLL Task 2011
closed track. We report the features used in
our system, and describe a novel cluster-based
chaining algorithm to improve performance of
coreference identification. We evaluate the
system using the OntoNotes data set and de-
scribe our results.
