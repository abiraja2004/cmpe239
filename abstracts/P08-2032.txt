This paper proposes a novel method to extract
named entities including unfamiliar words
which do not occur or occur few times in a
training corpus using a large unannotated cor-
pus. The proposed method consists of two
steps. The first step is to assign the most simi-
lar and familiar word to each unfamiliar word
based on their context vectors calculated from
a large unannotated corpus. After that, tra-
ditional machine learning approaches are em-
ployed as the second step. The experiments of
extracting Japanese named entities from IREX
corpus and NHK corpus show the effective-
ness of the proposed method.
