This paper presents a comparable trans-
lation corpus created to investigate trans-
lation variation phenomena in terms of
contrasts between languages, text types
and translation methods (machine vs.
computer-aided vs. human). These phe-
nomena are reflected in linguistic fea-
tures of translated texts belonging to dif-
ferent registers and produced with differ-
ent translation methods. For their analysis,
we combine methods derived from trans-
lation studies, language variation and ma-
chine translation, concentrating especially
on textual and lexico-grammatical varia-
tion. To our knowledge, none of the ex-
isting corpora can provide comparable re-
sources for a comprehensive analysis of
variation across text types and translation
methods. Therefore, the corpus resources
created, as well as our analysis results will
find application in different research areas,
such as translation studies, machine trans-
lation, and others.
