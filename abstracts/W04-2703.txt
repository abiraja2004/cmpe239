This paper describes a new, large scale
discourse-level annotation project ? the Penn
Discourse TreeBank (PDTB). We present an
approach to annotating a level of discourse
structure that is based on identifying discourse
connectives and their arguments. The PDTB
is being built directly on top of the Penn Tree-
Bank and Propbank, thus supporting the extrac-
tion of useful syntactic and semantic features
and providing a richer substrate for the devel-
opment and evaluation of practical algorithms.
We provide a detailed preliminary analysis of
inter-annotator agreement ? both the level of
agreement and the types of inter-annotator vari-
ation.
