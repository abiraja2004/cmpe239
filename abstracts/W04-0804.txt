The SENSEVAL-3 task to perform word-sense
disambiguation of WordNet glosses was
designed to encourage development of technology
to make use of standard lexical resources. The
task was based on the availability of sense-
disambiguated hand-tagged glosses created in the
eXtended WordNet project. The hand-tagged
glosses provided a ?gold standard? for judging
the performance of automated disambiguation
systems. Seven teams participated in the task,
with a total of 10 runs. Scoring these runs as an
?all-words? task, along with considerable
discussions among participants, provided more
insights than just the underlying technology. The
task identified several issues about the nature of
the WordNet sense inventory and the underlying
use of wordnet design principles, particularly the
significance of WordNet-style relations.
