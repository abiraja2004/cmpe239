 
We describe a new approach for syntheti-
cally combining the output of several dif-
ferent Machine Translation (MT) engines 
operating on the same input.  The goal is 
to produce a synthetic combination that 
surpasses all of the original systems in 
translation quality.  Our approach uses the 
individual MT engines as ?black boxes? 
and does not require any explicit coopera-
tion from the original MT systems.  A de-
coding algorithm uses explicit word 
matches, in conjunction with confidence 
estimates for the various engines and a tri-
gram language model in order to score 
and rank a collection of sentence hypothe-
ses that are synthetic combinations of 
words from the various original engines.  
The highest scoring sentence hypothesis 
is selected as the final output of our sys-
tem.  Experiments, using several Arabic-
to-English systems of similar quality, 
show a substantial improvement in the 
quality of the translation output.
