A novel and robust approach to improv-
ing statistical machine translation fluency
is developed within a minimum Bayes-
risk decoding framework. By segment-
ing translation lattices according to con-
fidence measures over the maximum like-
lihood translation hypothesis we are able
to focus on regions with potential transla-
tion errors. Hypothesis space constraints
based on monolingual coverage are ap-
plied to the low confidence regions to im-
prove overall translation fluency.
