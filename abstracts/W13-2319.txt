Semantically annotated corpora play an
important role in natural language pro-
cessing. This paper presents the results
of a pilot study on building a sense-tagged
parallel corpus, part of ongoing construc-
tion of aligned corpora for four languages
(English, Chinese, Japanese, and Indone-
sian) in four domains (story, essay, news,
and tourism) from the NTU-Multilingual
Corpus. Each subcorpus is first sense-
tagged using a wordnet and then these
synsets are linked. Upon the completion
of this project, all annotated corpora will
be made freely available. The multilingual
corpora are designed to not only provide
data for NLP tasks like machine transla-
tion, but also to contribute to the study
of translation shift and bilingual lexicogra-
phy as well as the improvement of mono-
lingual wordnets.
