We describe our first attempts to re-engineer
the curriculum of our introductory NLP course
by using two important building blocks: (1)
Access to an easy-to-learn programming lan-
guage and framework to build hands-on pro-
gramming assignments with real-world data
and corpora and, (2) Incorporation of interest-
ing ideas from recent NLP research publica-
tions into assignment and examination prob-
lems. We believe that these are extremely im-
portant components of a curriculum aimed at a
diverse audience consisting primarily of first-
year graduate students from both linguistics
and computer science. Based on overwhelm-
ingly positive student feedback, we find that
our attempts were hugely successful.
