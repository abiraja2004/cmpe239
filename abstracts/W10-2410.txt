This article describes the first trial on bidirec-
tional Thai-English machine transliteration ap-
plied on the NEWS 2010 transliteration cor-
pus. The system relies on segmenting source-
language  words into syllable-like units,  find-
ing unit's pronunciations, consulting a syllable 
transliteration  table  to  form  target-language 
word hypotheses, and ranking the hypotheses 
by using syllable n-gram. The approach yields 
84.2% and 70.4% mean F-scores on English-
to-Thai  and  Thai-to-English  transliteration. 
Discussion  on  existing  problems  and  future 
solutions are addressed.
