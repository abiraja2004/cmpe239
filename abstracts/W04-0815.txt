 
This paper describes a system developed for the 
transformation of English sentences into a first 
order logical form representation. The metho d-
ology is centered on the use of a dependency 
grammar based parser . We demonstrate the suit-
ability of applying a dependency parser based 
solution to the given task and in turn explain 
some of the limitations and challenges involved 
when using such an approach. The efficiencies 
and deficiencies of our approach are discussed 
as well as considerations for further enhanc e-
ments.
