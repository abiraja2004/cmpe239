Past work of generating referring expres-
sions mainly utilized attributes of objects
and binary relations between objects in or-
der to distinguish the target object from
others. However, such an approach does
not work well when there is no distinc-
tive attribute among objects. To over-
come this limitation, this paper proposes
a novel generation method utilizing per-
ceptual groups of objects and n-ary re-
lations among them. The evaluation us-
ing 18 subjects showed that the proposed
method could effectively generate proper
referring expressions.
