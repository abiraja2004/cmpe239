We present a new method for performing
sequence labelling based on the idea of us-
ing a machine-learning classifier to gen-
erate several possible output sequences,
and then applying an inference proce-
dure to select the best sequence among
those. Most sequence labelling methods
following a similar approach require the
base classifier to make probabilistic pre-
dictions. In contrast, our method can
be used with virtually any type of clas-
sifier. This is illustrated by implement-
ing a sequence classifier on top of a (non-
probabilistic) memory-based learner. In
a series of experiments, this method is
shown to outperform two other methods;
one naive baseline approach, and another
more sophisticated method.
