The requirements of the depth and precision
of annotation vary for different intended uses
of the corpus but it has been commonly ac-
cepted nowadays that the standard annotations
of surface structure are only the first steps in
a more ambitious research program, aiming at
a creation of advanced resources for most dif-
ferent systems of natural language processing
and for testing and further enrichment of lin-
guistic and computational theories. Among
the several possible directions in which we be-
lieve the standard annotation systems should
go (and in some cases already attempt to go)
beyond the POS tagging or shallow syntactic
annotations, the following four are character-
ized in the present contribution: (i) predicate-
argument representation of the underlying syn-
tactic relations as basically corresponding to a
rooted tree that can be univocally linearized,
(ii) the inclusion of the information structure
using very simple means (the left-to-right or-
der of the nodes and three attribute values),
(iii) relating this underlying structure (render-
ing the ?linguistic meaning,? i.e. the semanti-
cally relevant counterparts of the grammatical
means of expression) to certain central aspects
of referential semantics (reference assignment
and coreferential relations), and (iv) handling
of word sense disambiguation. The first three
issues are documented in the present paper on
the basis of our experience with the devel-
opment of the structure and scenario of the
Prague Dependency Treebank which provides
for syntactico-semantic annotation of large text
segments from the Czech National Corpus and
which is based on a solid theoretical frame-
work.
