Recent work in designing spoken dialogue
systems has focused on using Reinforce-
ment Learning to automatically learn the
best action for a system to take at any
point in the dialogue to maximize dia-
logue success. While policy development
is very important, choosing the best fea-
tures to model the user state is equally im-
portant since it impacts the actions a sys-
tem should make. In this paper, we com-
pare the relative utility of adding three fea-
tures to a model of user state in the do-
main of a spoken dialogue tutoring sys-
tem. In addition, we also look at the ef-
fects of these features on what type of a
question a tutoring system should ask at
any state and compare it with our previ-
ous work on using feedback as the system
action.
