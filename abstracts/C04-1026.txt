We propose a syntax-semantics interface that
realises the mapping between syntax and se-
mantics as a relation and does not make func-
tionality assumptions in either direction. This
interface is stated in terms of Extensible De-
pendency Grammar (XDG), a grammar formal-
ism we newly specify. XDG?s constraint-based
parser supports the concurrent flow of informa-
tion between any two levels of linguistic rep-
resentation, even when only partial analyses are
available. This generalises the concept of under-
specification.
