 
Existing Augmentative and Alternative Com-
munication vocabularies assign multimodal 
stimuli to words with multiple meanings. The 
ambiguity hampers the vocabulary effective-
ness when used by people with language dis-
abilities. For example, the noun ?a missing 
letter? may refer to a character or a written 
message, and each corresponds to a different 
picture. A vocabulary with images and sounds 
unambiguously linked to words can better 
eliminate misunderstanding and assist com-
munication for people with language disorders. 
We explore a new approach of creating such a 
vocabulary via automatically assigning se-
mantically unambiguous groups of synonyms 
to sound and image labels. We propose an un-
supervised word sense disambiguation (WSD) 
voting algorithm, which combines different 
semantic relatedness measures. Our voting al-
gorithm achieved over 80% accuracy with a 
sound label dataset, which significantly out-
performs WSD with individual measures. We 
also explore the use of human judgments of 
evocation between members of concept pairs, 
in the label disambiguation task. Results show 
that evocation achieves similar performance to 
most of the existing relatedness measures.
