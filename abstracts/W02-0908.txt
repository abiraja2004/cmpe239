The use of semantic resources is com-
mon in modern NLP systems, but methods
to extract lexical semantics have only re-
cently begun to perform well enough for
practical use. We evaluate existing and
new similarity metrics for thesaurus ex-
traction, and experiment with the trade-
off between extraction performance and
efficiency. We propose an approximation
algorithm, based on canonical attributes
and coarse- and fine-grained matching,
that reduces the time complexity and ex-
ecution time of thesaurus extraction with
only a marginal performance penalty.
