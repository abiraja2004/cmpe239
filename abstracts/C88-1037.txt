 
In this paper we propose a new method to express quantifica- 
tion and especially quantifier scope in French generation. Our 
approach is based on two points: the identification of the sen- 
tence components between which quantifier scope can indeed 
be expressed and a mechanism to reinforce the expression of 
quantifier scope. This approach is being integrated in a writ- 
ten French generator , called Hermes, which will become the 
generator of a portable natural anguage interface.
