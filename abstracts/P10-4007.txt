This paper describes the KomParse sys-
tem, a natural-language dialog system
in the three-dimensional virtual world
Twinity. In order to fulfill the various
communication demands between non-
player characters (NPCs) and users in
such an online virtual world, the system
realizes a flexible and hybrid approach
combining knowledge-intensive domain-
specific question answering, task-specific
and domain-specific dialog with robust
chatbot-like chitchat.
