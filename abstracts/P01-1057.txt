The STOP system, which generates
personalised smoking-cessation letters,
was evaluated by a randomised con-
trolled clinical trial. We believe this is
the largest and perhaps most rigorous
task effectiveness evaluation ever per-
formed on an NLG system. The de-
tailed results of the clinical trial have
been presented elsewhere, in the med-
ical literature. In this paper we discuss
the clinical trial itself: its structure and
cost, what we did and did not learn from
it (especially considering that the trial
showed that STOP was not effective),
and how it compares to other NLG eval-
uation techniques.
