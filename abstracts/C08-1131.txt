As human beings, our  mental  processes
for  recognising  linguistic  symbols  gen-
erate  perceptual  neighbourhoods  around
such symbols where confusion errors oc-
cur. Such  neighbourhoods  also  pro-
vide  us  with  conscious  mental  associa-
tions between symbols. This  paper  for-
malises orthographic models for similarity
of Japanese kanji, and provides a proof-
of-concept dictionary extension leveraging
the mental associations provided by ortho-
graphic proximity.
