We present an adaptation technique for
statistical machine translation, which ap-
plies the well-known Bayesian learning
paradigm for adapting the model param-
eters. Since state-of-the-art statistical ma-
chine translation systems model the trans-
lation process as a log-linear combination
of simpler models, we present the formal
derivation of how to apply such paradigm
to the weights of the log-linear combina-
tion. We show empirical results in which
a small amount of adaptation data is able
to improve both the non-adapted system
and a system which optimises the above-
mentioned weights on the adaptation set
only, while gaining both in reliability and
speed.
