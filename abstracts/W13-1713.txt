This paper describes MITRE?s participation in
the native language identification (NLI) task
at BEA-8. Our best effort performed at an ac-
curacy of 82.6% in the eleven-way NLI task,
placing it in a statistical tie with the best per-
forming systems. We describe the variety
of machine learning approaches that we ex-
plored, including Winnow, language model-
ing, logistic regression and maximum-entropy
models. Our primary features were word and
character n-grams. We also describe several
ensemble methods that we employed for com-
bining these base systems.
