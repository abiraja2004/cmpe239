Beam search is a fast and empirically effective
method for translation decoding, but it lacks
formal guarantees about search error. We de-
velop a new decoding algorithm that combines
the speed of beam search with the optimal cer-
tificate property of Lagrangian relaxation, and
apply it to phrase- and syntax-based transla-
tion decoding. The new method is efficient,
utilizes standard MT algorithms, and returns
an exact solution on the majority of transla-
tion examples in our test data. The algorithm
is 3.5 times faster than an optimized incremen-
tal constraint-based decoder for phrase-based
translation and 4 times faster for syntax-based
translation.
