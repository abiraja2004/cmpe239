The paper presents the work being done so
far on the building of the Croatian Morpho-
logical Lexicon (CML). It has been collec-
ted since 2002 in the Institute of Linguistics,
Faculty of Philosophy, University of Zagreb.
The CML is planned to have two sub-lexi-
cons: derivative/compositional and inflec-
tional, both produced by a generator. The re-
sult of generation is lexicon as two distinct
lists of generated combinations of morph-
emes and complete word-forms both with
additional data that can be used in further
processing. The inflectional component is
presented more in detail in the second part
of the paper. At the end, the several possible
applications of CML are discussed.
