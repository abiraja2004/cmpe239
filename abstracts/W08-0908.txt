This paper reports on the first stage of build-
ing an educational tool for international gradu-
ate students to improve their academic writing
skills. Taking a text-categorization approach,
we experimented with several models to au-
tomatically classify sentences in research ar-
ticle introductions into one of three rhetori-
cal moves. The paper begins by situating the
project within the larger framework of intelli-
gent computer-assisted language learning. It
then presents the details of the study with very
encouraging results. The paper then concludes
by commenting on how the system may be im-
proved and how the project is intended to be
pursued and evaluated.
