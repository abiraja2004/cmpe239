 
We argue that the conventional pproach 
to Interactive Machine ~Ih-anslation is not 
the best way to provide assistance to 
skilled translators, and propose an alter- 
native whose central feature is the use 
of the target text as a medium of inter- 
action. We describe an automatic word- 
completion system intended to serve as a 
vehicle for exploring the feasibility of this 
new approach, and give results in terms 
of keystrokes aved in a test corpus.
