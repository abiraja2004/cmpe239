Readability of a summary is usually graded
manually on five aspects of readability: gram-
maticality, coherence and structure, focus,
referential clarity and non-redundancy. In the
context of automated metrics for evaluation
of summary quality, content evaluations have
been presented through the last decade and
continue to evolve, however a careful exami-
nation of readability aspects of summary qual-
ity has not been as exhaustive. In this paper
we explore alternative evaluation metrics for
?grammaticality? and ?coherence and struc-
ture? that are able to strongly correlate with
manual ratings. Our results establish that our
methods are able to perform pair-wise rank-
ing of summaries based on grammaticality, as
strongly as ROUGE is able to distinguish for
content evaluations. We observed that none
of the five aspects of readability are indepen-
dent of each other, and hence by addressing
the individual criterion of evaluation we aim to
achieve automated appreciation of readability
of summaries.
