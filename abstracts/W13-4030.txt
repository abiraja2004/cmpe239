In situated dialogue, speakers share time
and space. We present a statistical model
for understanding natural language that
works incrementally (i.e., in real, shared
time) and is grounded (i.e., links to en-
tities in the shared space). We describe
our model with an example, then estab-
lish that our model works well on non-
situated, telephony application-type utter-
ances, show that it is effective in ground-
ing language in a situated environment,
and further show that it can make good use
of embodied cues such as gaze and point-
ing in a fully multi-modal setting.
