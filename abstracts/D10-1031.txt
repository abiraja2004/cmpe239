This paper presents a method for the auto-
matic discovery of MANNER relations from
text. An extended definition of MANNER is
proposed, including restrictions on the sorts
of concepts that can be part of its domain and
range. The connections with other relations
and the lexico-syntactic patterns that encode
MANNER are analyzed. A new feature set spe-
cialized on MANNER detection is depicted and
justified. Experimental results show improve-
ment over previous attempts to extract MAN-
NER. Combinations of MANNER with other
semantic relations are also discussed.
