In many text-to-text generation scenarios (for in-
stance, summarisation), we encounter human-
authored sentences that could be composed by re-
cycling portions of related sentences to form new
sentences. In this paper, we couch the generation
of such sentences as a search problem. We in-
vestigate a statistical sentence generation method
which recombines words to form new sentences.
We propose an extension to the Viterbi algorithm
designed to improve the grammaticality of gener-
ated sentences. Within a statistical framework, the
extension favours those partially generated strings
with a probable dependency tree structure. Our
preliminary evaluations show that our approach
generates less fragmented text than a bigram base-
line.
