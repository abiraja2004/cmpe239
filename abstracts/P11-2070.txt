We present an SCFG binarization algorithm
that combines the strengths of early termi-
nal matching on the source language side and
early language model integration on the tar-
get language side. We also examine how dif-
ferent strategies of target-side terminal attach-
ment during binarization can significantly af-
fect translation quality.
