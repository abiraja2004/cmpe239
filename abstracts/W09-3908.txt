We propose a framework for analyzing
episodic conversational activities in terms
of expressed relationships between the
participants and utterance content. We
test the hypothesis that linguistic features
which express such properties, e.g. tense,
aspect, and person deixis, are a useful ba-
sis for automatic intentional discourse seg-
mentation. We present a novel algorithm
and test our hypothesis on a set of inten-
tionally segmented conversational mono-
logues. Our algorithm performs better
than a simple baseline and as well as or
better than well-known lexical-semantic
segmentation methods.
