 
Conceptualising a domain has long been 
recognised as a prerequisite for 
understanding that  domain and processing 
information about it. Ontologies are 
explicit specifications of conceptualisations 
which are now recognised as important 
components of information systems and 
information processing. In this paper, we 
describe a project in which ontologies are 
part of the reasoning process used for 
information management and for the 
presentation of information.  Both 
accessing and  presenting information  are 
mediated via natural language and the 
ontologies are coupled with the lexicon 
used in the natural language component.
