This paper describes a novel approach for
the automatic generation and evaluation of
a trivial dialogue phrases database. A tri-
vial dialogue phrase is defined as an ex-
pression used by a chatbot program as the
answer of a user input. A transfer-like ge-
netic algorithm (GA) method is used to
generating the trivial dialogue phrases for
the creation of a natural language genera-
tion (NLG) knowledge base. The auto-
matic evaluation of a generated phrase is
performed by producing n-grams and re-
trieving their frequencies from the World
Wide Web (WWW). Preliminary experi-
ments show very positive results.
