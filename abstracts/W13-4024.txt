We summarize the status of an ongoing
project to develop and evaluate a compan-
ion for isolated older adults. Four key
scientific issues in the project are: em-
bodiment, interaction paradigm, engage-
ment and relationship. The system ar-
chitecture is extensible and handles real-
time behaviors. The system supports mul-
tiple activities, including discussing the
weather, playing cards, telling stories, ex-
ercise coaching and video conferencing. A
live, working demo system will be pre-
sented at the meeting.
