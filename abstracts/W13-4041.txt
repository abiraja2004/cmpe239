A fundamental problem in manual based
gesture semantics reconstruction is the
specification of preferred semantic con-
cepts for gesture trajectories. This issue
is complicated by problems human raters
have annotating fast-paced three dimen-
sional trajectories. Based on a detailed
example of a gesticulated circular trajec-
tory, we present a data-driven approach
that covers parts of the semantic recon-
struction by making use of motion captur-
ing (mocap) technology. In our FA3ME
framework we use a complex event pro-
cessing approach to analyse and annotate
multi-modal events. This framework pro-
vides grounds for a detailed description of
how to get at the semantic concept of cir-
cularity observed in the data.
