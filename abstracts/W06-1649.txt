Supervised and semi-supervised sense dis-
ambiguation methods will mis-tag the in-
stances of a target word if the senses of
these instances are not defined in sense in-
ventories or there are no tagged instances
for these senses in training data. Here we
used a model order identification method
to avoid the misclassification of the in-
stances with undefined senses by discov-
ering new senses from mixed data (tagged
and untagged corpora). This algorithm
tries to obtain a natural partition of the
mixed data by maximizing a stability cri-
terion defined on the classification result
from an extended label propagation al-
gorithm over all the possible values of
the number of senses (or sense number,
model order). Experimental results on
SENSEVAL-3 data indicate that it outper-
forms SVM, a one-class partially super-
vised classification algorithm, and a clus-
tering based model order identification al-
gorithm when the tagged data is incom-
plete.
