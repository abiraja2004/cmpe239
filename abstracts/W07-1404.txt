This paper reports on LCC?s participation
at the Third PASCAL Recognizing Textual
Entailment Challenge. First, we summarize
our semantic logical-based approach which
proved successful in the previous two chal-
lenges. Then we highlight this year?s inno-
vations which contributed to an overall accu-
racy of 72.25% for the RTE 3 test data. The
novelties include new resources, such as eX-
tended WordNet KB which provides a large
number of world knowledge axioms, event
and temporal information provided by the
TARSQI toolkit, logic form representations
of events, negation, coreference and context,
and new improvements of lexical chain ax-
iom generation. Finally, the system?s perfor-
mance and error analysis are discussed.
