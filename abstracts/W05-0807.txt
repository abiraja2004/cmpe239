This paper presents an original approach
to part-of-speech tagging of fine-grained
features (such as case, aspect, and adjec-
tive person/number) in languages such as
English where these properties are gener-
ally not morphologically marked.
The goals of such rich lexical tagging
in English are to provide additional fea-
tures for word alignment models in bilin-
gual corpora (for statistical machine trans-
lation), and to provide an information
source for part-of-speech tagger induction
in new languages via tag projection across
bilingual corpora.
First, we present a classifier-combination
approach to tagging English bitext with
very fine-grained part-of-speech tags nec-
essary for annotating morphologically
richer languages such as Czech and
French, combining the extracted fea-
tures of three major English parsers,
and achieve fine-grained-tag-level syntac-
tic analysis accuracy higher than any indi-
vidual parser.
Second, we present experimental results
for the cross-language projection of part-
of-speech taggers in Czech and French via
word-aligned bitext, achieving success-
ful fine-grained part-of-speech tagging of
these languages without any Czech or
French training data of any kind.
