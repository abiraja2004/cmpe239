 
The field of information retrieval still 
strives to develop models which allow 
semantic information to be integrated in 
the ranking process to improve perform-
ance in comparison to standard bag-of-
words based models. A conceptual 
model has been adopted in general-
purpose retrieval which can comprise a 
range of concepts, including linguistic 
terms, latent concepts and explicit 
knowledge concepts. One of the draw-
backs of this model is that the computa-
tional cost is significant and often in-
tractable in modern test collections. 
Therefore, approaches utilising concept-
based models for re-ranking initial re-
trieval results have attracted a consider-
able amount of study. This method en-
joys the benefits of reduced document 
corpora for semantic space construction 
and improved ranking results. However, 
fitting such a model to a smaller collec-
tion is less meaningful than fitting it into 
the whole corpus. This paper proposes a 
dual-space model which incorporates 
external knowledge to enhance the space 
produced by the latent concept method. 
This model is intended to produce 
global consistency across the semantic 
space: similar entries are likely to have 
the same re-ranking scores with respect 
to the latent and manifest concepts. To 
illustrate the effectiveness of the pro-
posed method, experiments were con-
ducted using test collections across dif-
ferent languages. The results demon-
strate that the method can comfortably 
achieve improvements in retrieval per-
formance.
