A new method for keyword extraction
from conversations is introduced, which
preserves the diversity of topics that are
mentioned. Inspired from summarization,
the method maximizes the coverage of
topics that are recognized automatically
in transcripts of conversation fragments.
The method is evaluated on excerpts of the
Fisher and AMI corpora, using a crowd-
sourcing platform to elicit comparative
relevance judgments. The results demon-
strate that the method outperforms two
competitive baselines.
