Most question answering and information
retrieval systems are insensitive to differ-
ent users? needs and preferences, as well
as their reading level. In (Quarteroni and
Manandhar, 2006), we introduce a hybrid
QA-IR system based on a a user model.
In this paper we focus on how the system
filters and re-ranks the search engine re-
sults for a query according to their reading
difficulty, providing user-tailored answers.
Keywords: question answering, informa-
tion retrieval, user modelling, readability.
