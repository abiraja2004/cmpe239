The aim of our software presentation is
to demonstrate that corpus-driven bilingual
dictionaries generated fully by automatic
means are suitable for human use. Pre-
vious experiments have proven that bilin-
gual lexicons can be created by applying
word alignment on parallel corpora. Such
an approach, especially the corpus-driven
nature of it, yields several advantages over
more traditional approaches. Most im-
portantly, automatically attained translation
probabilities are able to guarantee that the
most frequently used translations come first
within an entry. However, the proposed
technique have to face some difficulties, as
well. In particular, the scarce availability of
parallel texts for medium density languages
imposes limitations on the size of the result-
ing dictionary. Our objective is to design
and implement a dictionary building work-
flow and a query system that is apt to ex-
ploit the additional benefits of the method
and overcome the disadvantages of it.
