We consider the problem of learning
context-dependent mappings from sen-
tences to logical form. The training ex-
amples are sequences of sentences anno-
tated with lambda-calculus meaning rep-
resentations. We develop an algorithm that
maintains explicit, lambda-calculus repre-
sentations of salient discourse entities and
uses a context-dependent analysis pipeline
to recover logical forms. The method uses
a hidden-variable variant of the percep-
tion algorithm to learn a linear model used
to select the best analysis. Experiments
on context-dependent utterances from the
ATIS corpus show that the method recov-
ers fully correct logical forms with 83.7%
accuracy.
