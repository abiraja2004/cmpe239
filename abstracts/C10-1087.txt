Texts are commonly interpreted based on
the entire discourse in which they are sit-
uated. Discourse processing has been
shown useful for inference-based applica-
tion; yet, most systems for textual entail-
ment ? a generic paradigm for applied in-
ference ? have only addressed discourse
considerations via off-the-shelf corefer-
ence resolvers. In this paper we explore
various discourse aspects in entailment in-
ference, suggest initial solutions for them
and investigate their impact on entailment
performance. Our experiments suggest
that discourse provides useful informa-
tion, which significantly improves entail-
ment inference, and should be better ad-
dressed by future entailment systems.
