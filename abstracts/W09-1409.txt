 
The BioNLP?09 Shared Task on Event Extrac-
tion presented an evaluation on the extraction 
of biological events related to genes/proteins 
from the literature. We propose a system that 
uses the case-based reasoning (CBR) machine 
learning approach for the extraction of the enti-
ties (events, sites and location). The mapping 
of the proteins in the texts to the previously ex-
tracted entities is carried out by some simple 
manually developed rules for each of the argu-
ments under consideration (cause, theme, site 
or location). We have achieved an f-measure of 
24.15 and 21.15 for Task 1 and 2, respectively.
