We describe and evaluate the application of a
spectral clustering technique (Ng et al, 2002)
to the unsupervised clustering of German verbs.
Our previous work has shown that standard
clustering techniques succeed in inducing Levin-
style semantic classes from verb subcategorisa-
tion information. But clustering in the very
high dimensional spaces that we use is fraught
with technical and conceptual difficulties. Spec-
tral clustering performs a dimensionality reduc-
tion on the verb frame patterns, and provides a
robustness and efficiency that standard cluster-
ing methods do not display in direct use. The
clustering results are evaluated according to the
alignment (Christianini et al, 2002) between
the Gram matrix defined by the cluster output
and the corresponding matrix defined by a gold
standard.
