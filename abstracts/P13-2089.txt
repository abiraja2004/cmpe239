Recommendation dialog systems help
users navigate e-commerce listings by ask-
ing questions about users? preferences to-
ward relevant domain attributes. We
present a framework for generating and
ranking fine-grained, highly relevant ques-
tions from user-generated reviews. We
demonstrate our approach on a new dataset
just released by Yelp, and release a new
sentiment lexicon with 1329 adjectives for
the restaurant domain.
