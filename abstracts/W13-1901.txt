This research analyzed the clinical notes
of epilepsy patients using techniques from
corpus linguistics and machine learning
and predicted which patients are can-
didates for neurosurgery, i.e. have in-
tractable epilepsy, and which are not.
Information-theoretic and machine learn-
ing techniques are used to determine
whether and how sets of clinic notes
from patients with intractable and non-
intractable epilepsy are different. The re-
sults show that it is possible to predict
from an early stage of treatment which pa-
tients will fall into one of these two cate-
gories based only on text data. These re-
sults have broad implications for develop-
ing clinical decision support systems.
