Since the first Chinese Word Segmenta-
tion (CWS) Bakeoff on 2003, CWS has 
experienced a prominent flourish be-
cause Bakeoff provides a platform for 
the participants, which helps them rec-
ognize the merits and drawbacks of their 
segmenters. However, the evaluation 
metric of bakeoff is not sufficient 
enough to measure the performance tho-
roughly, sometimes even misleading.  
One typical example caused by this in-
sufficiency is that there is a popular be-
lief existing in the research field that 
segmentation based on word can yield a 
better result than character-based tag-
ging (CT) on in-vocabulary (IV) word 
segmentation even within closed tests of 
Bakeoff. Many efforts were paid to bal-
ance the performance on IV and out-of-
vocabulary (OOV) words by combining 
these two methods according to this be-
lief. In this paper, we provide a more de-
tailed evaluation metric of IV and OOV 
words than Bakeoff to analyze CT me-
thod and combination method, which is 
a typical way to seek such balance. Our 
evaluation metric shows that CT outper-
forms dictionary-based (or so called 
word-based in general) segmentation on 
both IV and OOV words within Bakeoff

closed tests. Furthermore, our analysis 
shows that using confidence measure to 
combine the two segmentation results 
should be under certain limitation.
