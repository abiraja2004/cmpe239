 
One of the challenging problems in Thai 
NLP is to manage a problem on a syn-
tactical analysis of a long sentence.  
This paper applies conditional random 
field and categorical grammar to devel-
op a chunking method, which can group 
words into larger unit. Based on the ex-
periment, we found the impressive re-
sults. We gain around 74.17% on sen-
tence level chunking. Furthermore we 
got a more correct parsed tree based on 
our technique. Around 50% of tree can 
be added. Finally, we solved the prob-
lem on implicit sentential NP which is 
one of the difficult Thai language pro-
cessing.  58.65% of sentential NP is cor-
rectly detected.
