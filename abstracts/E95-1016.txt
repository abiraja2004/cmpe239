 
We present some variations affecting the 
association measure and thresholding on 
a technique for learning Selectional Re- 
strictions from on-line corpora. It uses 
a wide-coverage noun taxonomy and a 
statistical measure to generalize the ap- 
propriate semantic classes. Evaluation 
measures for the Selectional Restrictions 
learning task are discussed. Finally, an 
experimental evaluation of these varia- 
tions is reported.
