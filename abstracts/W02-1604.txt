Abstract 
This presentation describes an example- 
based English-Japanese machine trans- 
lation system in which an abstract 
linguistic representation layer is used to 
extract and store bilingual translation 
knowledge, transfer patterns between 
languages, and generate output strings. 
Abstraction permits structural neutral-
izations that facilitate learning of trans-
lation examples across languages with 
radically different surface structure charac-
teristics, and allows MT development to 
proceed within a largely language- 
independent NLP architecture. Com-
parative evaluation indicates that after 
training in a domain the English-Japanese 
system is statistically indistinguishable 
from a non-customized commercially 
available MT system in the same domain.
