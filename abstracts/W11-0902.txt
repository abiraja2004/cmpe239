We introduce several ideas that improve the
performance of supervised information ex-
traction systems with a pipeline architecture,
when they are customized for new domains.
We show that: (a) a combination of a se-
quence tagger with a rule-based approach for
entity mention extraction yields better perfor-
mance for both entity and relation mention
extraction; (b) improving the identification of
syntactic heads of entity mentions helps rela-
tion extraction; and (c) a deterministic infer-
ence engine captures some of the joint domain
structure, even when introduced as a post-
processing step to a pipeline system. All in all,
our contributions yield a 20% relative increase
in F1 score in a domain significantly differ-
ent from the domains used during the devel-
opment of our information extraction system.
