In this paper we consider the problem of
analysing sentence-level discourse struc-
ture. We introduce discourse chunking
(i.e., the identification of intra-sentential
nucleus and satellite spans) as an al-
ternative to full-scale discourse parsing.
Our experiments show that the proposed
modelling approach yields results com-
parable to state-of-the-art while exploit-
ing knowledge-lean features and small
amounts of discourse annotations. We also
demonstrate how discourse chunking can
be successfully applied to a sentence com-
pression task.
