We present a novel method for build-
ing a large-scale Japanese ontology from
Wikipedia using one of the largest
Japanese thesauri, Nihongo Goi-Taikei
(referred to hereafter as ?Goi-Taikei?) as
an upper ontology. First, The leaf cat-
egories in the Goi-Taikei hierarchy are
semi-automatically aligned with seman-
tically equivalent Wikipedia categories.
Then, their subcategories are created au-
tomatically by detecting is-a links in the
Wikipedia category network below the
junction using the knowledge defined in
Goi-Taikei above the junction. The re-
sulting ontology has a well-defined taxon-
omy in the upper level and a fine-grained
taxonomy in the lower level with a large
number of up-to-date instances. A sam-
ple evaluation shows that the precisions of
the extracted categories and instances are
92.8% and 98.6%, respectively.
