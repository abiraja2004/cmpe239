We propose an approach to summarization
exploiting both lexical information and
the output of an automatic anaphoric re-
solver, and using Singular Value Decom-
position (SVD) to identify the main terms.
We demonstrate that adding anaphoric
information results in significant perfor-
mance improvements over a previously
developed system, in which only lexical
terms are used as the input to SVD. How-
ever, we also show that how anaphoric in-
formation is used is crucial: whereas using
this information to add new terms does re-
sult in improved performance, simple sub-
stitution makes the performance worse.
