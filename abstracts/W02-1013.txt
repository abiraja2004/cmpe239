This paper presents a technique for discover-
ing translationally equivalent texts. It is com-
prised of the application of a matching algo-
rithm at two different levels of analysis and a
well-founded similarity score. This approach
can be applied to any multilingual corpus us-
ing any kind of translation lexicon; it is there-
fore adaptable to varying levels of multilingual
resource availability. Experimental results are
shown on two tasks: a search for matching
thirty-word segments in a corpus where some
segments are mutual translations, and classifi-
cation of candidate pairs of web pages that may
or may not be translations of each other. The
latter results compare competitively with pre-
vious, document-structure-based approaches to
the same problem.
