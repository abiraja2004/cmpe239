We develop a general method to match un-
structured text reviews to a structured list
of objects. For this, we propose a lan-
guage model for generating reviews that
incorporates a description of objects and a
generic review language model. This mix-
ture model gives us a principled method to
find, given a review, the object most likely
to be the topic of the review. Extensive
experiments and analysis on reviews from
Yelp show that our language model-based
method vastly outperforms traditional tf-
idf-based methods.
