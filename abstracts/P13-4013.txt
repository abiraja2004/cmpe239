This paper describes the online tool Phon-
Matrix, which analyzes a word list with re-
spect to the co-occurrence of sounds in a
specified context within a word. The co-
occurrence counts from the user-specified
context are statistically analyzed accord-
ing to a number of association measures
that can be selected by the user. The
statistical values then serve as the input
for a matrix visualization where rows and
columns represent the relevant sounds un-
der investigation and the matrix cells indi-
cate whether the respective ordered pair of
sounds occurs more or less frequently than
expected. The usefulness of the tool is
demonstrated with three case studies that
deal with vowel harmony and similar place
avoidance patterns.
