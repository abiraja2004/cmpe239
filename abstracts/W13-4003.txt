This work proposes a generative model
to infer latent semantic structures on top
of manual speech transcriptions in a spo-
ken dialog reservation task. The proposed
model is akin to a standard semantic role
labeling system, except that it is unsuper-
vised, it does not rely on any syntactic in-
formation and it exploits concepts derived
from a domain-specific ontology. The
semantic structure is obtained with un-
supervised Bayesian inference, using the
Metropolis-Hastings sampling algorithm.
It is evaluated both in terms of attachment
accuracy and purity-collocation for clus-
tering, and compared with strong baselines
on the French MEDIA spoken-dialog cor-
pus.
