Document keywords are associated to
documents as summarized versions of the
documents? content. Considering that the
number of documents is quickly growing
every day, the availability of these key-
words is very important. Although, usu-
ally keywords are manually written. This
motivated us to work on an approach to
change this manual procedure for an auto-
matic one.
This paper presents a language indepen-
dent approach that extracts the most rel-
evant Multiword Expressions and single
words from documents and propose them
to describe the core content of each docu-
ment.
