The development of conversational multi-
domain spoken dialogue systems poses new
challenges for the reliable processing of less re-
stricted user utterances. Unlike in controlled
and restricted dialogue systems a simple one-
to-one mapping from words to meanings is no
longer feasible here. In this paper two different
approaches to the resolution of lexical ambigu-
ities are applied to a multi-domain corpus of
speech recognition output produced from spon-
taneous utterances in a spoken dialogue sys-
tem. The resulting evaluations show that all
approaches yield significant gains over the ma-
jority class baseline performance of .68, i.e. f-
measures of .79 for the knowledge-driven ap-
proach and .86 for the supervised learning ap-
proach.
