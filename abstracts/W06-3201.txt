 
This paper presents a fully automated lin-
guistic approach to measuring distance 
between phonemes across languages. In 
this approach, a phoneme is represented 
by a feature matrix where feature catego-
ries are fixed, hierarchically related and 
binary-valued; feature categorization ex-
plicitly addresses allophonic variation and 
feature values are weighted based on their 
relative prominence derived from lexical 
frequency measurements. The relative 
weight of feature values is factored into 
phonetic distance calculation. Two pho-
nological distances are statistically de-
rived from lexical frequency 
measurements. The phonetic distance is 
combined with the phonological distances 
to produce a single metric that quantifies 
cross-language phoneme distance. 
The performances of target-language 
phoneme HMMs constructed solely with 
source language HMMs, first selected by 
the combined phonetic and phonological 
metric and then by a data-driven, acous-
tics distance-based method, are compared 
in context-independent automatic speech 
recognition (ASR) experiments. Results 
show that this approach consistently per-
forms equivalently to the acoustics-based 
approach, confirming its effectiveness in  
estimating cross-language similarity be-
tween phonemes in an ASR environment.
