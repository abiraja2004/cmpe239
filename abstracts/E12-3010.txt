Null subjects are non overtly expressed
subject pronouns found in pro-drop lan-
guages such as Italian and Spanish. In
this study we quantify and compare the oc-
currence of this phenomenon in these two
languages. Next, we evaluate null sub-
jects? translation into French, a ?non pro-
drop? language. We use the Europarl cor-
pus to evaluate two MT systems on their
performance regarding null subject trans-
lation: Its-2, a rule-based system devel-
oped at LATL, and a statistical system
built using the Moses toolkit. Then we
add a rule-based preprocessor and a sta-
tistical post-editor to the Its-2 translation
pipeline. A second evaluation of the im-
proved Its-2 system shows an average in-
crease of 15.46% in correct pro-drop trans-
lations for Italian-French and 12.80% for
Spanish-French.
