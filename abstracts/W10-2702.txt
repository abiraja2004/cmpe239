 
We present a family of Embodied Conversa-tional Agents (ECAs) using Talking Head technology, along with a program of associ-ated research and user trials. Whilst antece-dents of our current ECAs include ?chatbots? desgined to pass the Turing Test (TT) or win a Loebner Prize (LP), our current agents are task-oriented Teaching Agents and Social Companions. The current focus for our re-search includes the role of emotion, expres-sion and gesture in our agents/companions, the explicit teaching of such social skills as recognizing and displaying appropriate ex-pressions/gestures, and the integration of template/database-based dialogue managers with more conversational TT/LP systems as well as with audio-visual speech/gesture rec-ognition/synthesis technologies. 1
