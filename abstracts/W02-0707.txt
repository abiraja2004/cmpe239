This paper evaluates a direct speech trans-
lation Method with waveforms using the
Inductive Learning method for short con-
versation. The method is able to work
without conventional speech recognition
and speech synthesis because syntactic ex-
pressions are not needed for translation in
the proposed method. We focus only on
acoustic characteristics of speech wave-
forms of source and target languages with-
out obtaining character strings from ut-
terances. This speech translation method
can be utilized for any language because
the system has no processing dependent
on an individual character of a specific
language. Therefore, we can utilize the
speech of a handicapped person who is
not able to be treated by conventional
speech recognition systems, because we
do not need to segment the speech into
phonemes, syllables, or words to realize
speech translation. Our method is real-
ized by learning translation rules that have
acoustic correspondence between two lan-
guages inductively. In this paper, we deal
with a translation between Japanese and
English.
