Human categorization is neither a binary nor
a context-free process. Rather, some con-
cepts are better examples of a category than
others, while the criteria for category mem-
bership may be satisfied to different degrees
by different concepts in different contexts.
In light of these empirical facts, WordNet?s
static category structure appears both exces-
sively rigid and unduly fragile for process-
ing real texts. In this paper we describe a
syntagmatic, corpus-based approach to re-
defining WordNet?s categories in a func-
tional, gradable and context-sensitive fash-
ion. We describe how the diagnostic prop-
erties for these definitions are automati-
cally acquired from the web, and how the
increased flexibility in categorization that
arises from these redefinitions offers a ro-
bust account of metaphor comprehension
in the mold of Glucksberg?s (2001) the-
ory of category-inclusion. Furthermore, we
demonstrate how this competence with figu-
rative categorization can effectively be gov-
erned by automatically-generated ontologi-
cal constraints, also acquired from the web.
