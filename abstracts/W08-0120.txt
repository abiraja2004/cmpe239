 
This paper proposes a probabilistic framework 
for spoken dialog management using dialog 
examples. To overcome the complexity prob-
lems of the classic partially observable Mar-
kov decision processes (POMDPs) based 
dialog manager, we use a frame-based belief 
state representation that reduces the complexi-
ty of belief update. We also used dialog ex-
amples to maintain a reasonable number of 
system actions to reduce the complexity of the 
optimizing policy. We developed weather in-
formation and car navigation dialog system 
that employed a frame-based probabilistic 
framework. This framework enables people to 
develop a spoken dialog system using a prob-
abilistic approach without complexity prob-
lem of POMDP.
