This paper presents a probabilistic model
both for generation and understanding of
referring expressions. This model intro-
duces the concept of parts of objects, mod-
elling the necessity to deal with the char-
acteristics of separate parts of an object in
the referring process. This was ignored or
implicit in previous literature. Integrating
this concept into a probabilistic formula-
tion, the model captures human character-
istics of visual perception and some type
of pragmatic implicature in referring ex-
pressions. Developing this kind of model
is critical to deal with more complex do-
mains in the future. As a first step in our
research, we validate the model with the
TUNA corpus to show that it includes con-
ventional domain modeling as a subset.
