 
This paper describes the UPM system for the 
Spanish-English translation task at the 
NAACL 2012 workshop on statistical ma-
chine translation. This system is based on Mo-
ses. We have used all available free corpora, 
cleaning and deleting some repetitions. In this 
paper, we also propose a technique for select-
ing the sentences for tuning the system. This 
technique is based on the similarity with the 
sentences to translate. With our approach, we 
improve the BLEU score from 28.37% to 
28.57%. And as a result of the WMT12 chal-
lenge we have obtained a 31.80% BLEU with 
the 2012 test set. Finally, we explain different 
experiments that we have carried out after the 
competition.
