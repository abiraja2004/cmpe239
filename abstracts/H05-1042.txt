A content selection component deter-
mines which information should be con-
veyed in the output of a natural language
generation system. We present an effi-
cient method for automatically learning
content selection rules from a corpus and
its related database. Our modeling frame-
work treats content selection as a col-
lective classification problem, thus allow-
ing us to capture contextual dependen-
cies between input items. Experiments
in a sports domain demonstrate that this
approach achieves a substantial improve-
ment over context-agnostic methods.
