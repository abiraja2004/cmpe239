We present the AAWD corpus, a collection
of 365 discussions drawn from Wikipedia talk
pages and annotated with labels capturing two
kinds of social acts: alignment moves and au-
thority claims. We describe these social acts
and our annotation process, and analyze the
resulting data set for interactions between par-
ticipant status and social acts and between the
social acts themselves.
