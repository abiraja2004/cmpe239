In this paper we apply lightly-supervised
training to a hierarchical phrase-based statis-
tical machine translation system. We employ
bitexts that have been built by automatically
translating large amounts of monolingual data
as additional parallel training corpora. We ex-
plore different ways of using this additional
data to improve our system.
Our results show that integrating a second
translation model with only non-hierarchical
phrases extracted from the automatically gen-
erated bitexts is a reasonable approach. The
translation performance matches the result we
achieve with a joint extraction on all train-
ing bitexts while the system is kept smaller
due to a considerably lower overall number of
phrases.
