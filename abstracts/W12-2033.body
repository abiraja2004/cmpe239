This paper describes the Nara Institute of Sci-
ence and Technology (NAIST) error correc-
tion system in the Helping Our Own (HOO)
2012 Shared Task. Our system targets prepo-
sition and determiner errors with spelling cor-
rection as a pre-processing step. The re-
sult shows that spelling correction improves
the Detection, Correction, and Recognition F-
scores for preposition errors. With regard to
preposition error correction, F-scores were not
improved when using the training set with cor-
rection of all but preposition errors. As for
determiner error correction, there was an im-
provement when the constituent parser was
trained with a concatenation of treebank and
modified treebank where all the articles ap-
pearing as the first word of an NP were re-
moved. Our system ranked third in preposi-
tion and fourth in determiner error corrections.
