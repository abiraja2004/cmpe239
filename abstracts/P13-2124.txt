We propose a verb suggestion method
which uses candidate sets and domain
adaptation to incorporate error patterns
produced by ESL learners. The candi-
date sets are constructed from a large scale
learner corpus to cover various error pat-
terns made by learners. Furthermore, the
model is trained using both a native cor-
pus and the learner corpus via a domain
adaptation technique. Experiments on two
learner corpora show that the candidate
sets increase the coverage of error patterns
and domain adaptation improves the per-
formance for verb suggestion.
