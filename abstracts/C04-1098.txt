 
Language model based IR system proposed in 
recent 5 years has introduced the language 
model approach in the speech recognition 
area into the IR community and improves the 
performance of the IR system effectively. 
However, the assumption that all the indexed 
words are irrelative behind the method is not 
the truth. Though statistical MT approach 
alleviates the situation by taking the 
synonymy factor into account, it never helps 
to judge the different meanings of the same 
word in varied context. In this paper we 
propose the trigger language model based IR 
system to resolve the problem. Firstly we 
compute the mutual information of the words 
from training corpus and then design the 
algorithm to get the triggered words of the 
query in order to fix down the topic of query 
more clearly. We introduce the relative 
parameters into the document language model 
to form the trigger language model based IR 
system. Experiments show that the 
performance of trigger language model based 
IR system has been improved greatly. The 
precision of trigger language model increased 
12% and recall increased nearly 10.8% 
compared with Ponte language model 
method.
