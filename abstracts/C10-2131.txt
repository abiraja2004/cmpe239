In this paper, we propose a method for
mediatory summarization, which is a
novel technique for facilitating users?
assessments of the credibility of infor-
mation on the Web. A mediatory sum-
mary is generated by extracting a pas-
sage from Web documents; this sum-
mary is generated on the basis of its
relevance to a given query, fairness,
and density of keywords, which are fea-
tures of the summaries constructed to
determine the credibility of informa-
tion on the Web. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of the generated me-
diatory summary in comparison with
the summaries of Web documents pro-
duced by Web search engines.
