 
We propose a method for compiling bi-
lingual terminologies of multi-word 
terms (MWTs) for given translation pairs 
of seed terms. Traditional methods for bi-
lingual terminology compilation exploit 
parallel texts, while the more recent ones 
have focused on comparable corpora. We 
use bilingual corpora collected from the 
web and tailor made for the seed terms. 
For each language, we extract from the 
corpus a set of MWTs pertaining to the 
seed?s semantic domain, and use a com-
positional method to align MWTs from 
both sets. We increase the coverage of 
our system by using thesauri and by ap-
plying a bootstrap method. Experimental 
results show high precision and indicate 
promising prospects for future develop-
ments.
