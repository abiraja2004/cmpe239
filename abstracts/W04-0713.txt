Abstract
This paper describes the dar-algorithm for re-
solving intersentential pronominal anaphors re-
ferring to individual and abstract entities in
Danish texts and dialogues. Individual enti-
ties are resolved combining models which iden-
tify high degree of salience with high degree of
givenness (topicality) of entities in the hearer?s
cognitive model, e.g. (Grosz et al, 1995), with
Hajic?ova? et al?s (1990) salience account which
assigns the highest degree of salience to entities
in the focal part of an utterance in Information
Structure terms. These focal entities often in-
troduce new information in discourse. Anaph-
ors referring to abstract entities are resolved
with an extension of the algorithm presented
by Eckert and Strube (2000). Manual tests of
the dar-algorithm and other well-known reso-
lution algorithms on the same data show that
dar performs significantly better on most types
of anaphor.
