We introduce an approach to optimize a ma-
chine translation (MT) system on multiple
metrics simultaneously. Different metrics
(e.g. BLEU, TER) focus on different aspects
of translation quality; our multi-objective ap-
proach leverages these diverse aspects to im-
prove overall quality.
Our approach is based on the theory of Pareto
Optimality. It is simple to implement on top of
existing single-objective optimization meth-
ods (e.g. MERT, PRO) and outperforms ad
hoc alternatives based on linear-combination
of metrics. We also discuss the issue of metric
tunability and show that our Pareto approach
is more effective in incorporating new metrics
from MT evaluation for MT optimization.
