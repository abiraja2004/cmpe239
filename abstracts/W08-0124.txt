An important task in automatic conversation
understanding is the inference of social struc-
ture governing participant behavior. We ex-
plore the dependence between several social
dimensions, including assigned role, gender,
and seniority, and a set of low-level features
descriptive of talkspurt deployment in a mul-
tiparticipant context. Experiments conducted
on two large, publicly available meeting cor-
pora suggest that our features are quite useful
in predicting these dimensions, excepting gen-
der. The classification experiments we present
exhibit a relative error rate reduction of 37% to
67% compared to choosing the majority class.
