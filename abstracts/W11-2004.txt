This paper describes a general and effective
domain selection framework for multi-domain
spoken dialogue systems that employ dis-
tributed domain experts. The framework con-
sists of two processes: deciding if the current
domain continues and estimating the probabil-
ities for selecting other domains. If the current
domain does not continue, the domain with
the highest activation probability is selected.
Since those processes for each domain expert
can be designed independently from other ex-
perts and can use a large variety of informa-
tion, the framework achieves both extensibil-
ity and robustness against speech recognition
errors. The results of an experiment using
a corpus of dialogues between humans and
a multi-domain dialogue system demonstrate
the viability of the proposed framework.
