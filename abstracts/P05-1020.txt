In this paper, we view coreference reso-
lution as a problem of ranking candidate
partitions generated by different coref-
erence systems. We propose a set of
partition-based features to learn a rank-
ing model for distinguishing good and bad
partitions. Our approach compares fa-
vorably to two state-of-the-art coreference
systems when evaluated on three standard
coreference data sets.
