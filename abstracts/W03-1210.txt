Causation relations are a pervasive fea-
ture of human language. Despite this, the
automatic acquisition of causal informa-
tion in text has proved to be a difficult
task in NLP. This paper provides a method
for the automatic detection and extraction
of causal relations. We also present an
inductive learning approach to the auto-
matic discovery of lexical and semantic
constraints necessary in the disambigua-
tion of causal relations that are then used
in question answering. We devised a clas-
sification of causal questions and tested
the procedure on a QA system.
