(Way and Gough, 2005) provide an in-
depth comparison of their Example-Based
Machine Translation (EBMT) system with
a Statistical Machine Translation (SMT)
system constructed from freely available
tools. According to a wide variety of au-
tomatic evaluation metrics, they demon-
strated that their EBMT system outper-
formed the SMT system by a factor of two
to one.
Nevertheless, they did not test their EBMT
system against a phrase-based SMT sys-
tem. Obtaining their training and test
data for English?French, we carry out a
number of experiments using the Pharaoh
SMT Decoder. While better results are
seen when Pharaoh is seeded with Giza++
word- and phrase-based data compared to
EBMT sub-sentential alignments, in gen-
eral better results are obtained when com-
binations of this ?hybrid? data is used
to construct the translation and probabil-
ity models. While for the most part the
EBMT system of (Gough & Way, 2004b)
outperforms any flavour of the phrase-
based SMT systems constructed in our
experiments, combining the data sets au-
tomatically induced by both Giza++ and
their EBMT system leads to a hybrid sys-
tem which improves on the EBMT system
per se for French?English.
