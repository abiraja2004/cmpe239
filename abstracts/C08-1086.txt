 
In this paper, we present a method for 
modeling joint information when gene-
rating n-best lists. We apply the method 
to a novel task of characterizing the simi-
larity of a group of terms where only a 
small set of many possible semantic 
properties may be displayed to a user. 
We demonstrate that considering the re-
sults jointly, by accounting for the infor-
mation overlap between results, generates 
better n-best lists than considering them 
independently. We propose an informa-
tion theoretic objective function for mod-
eling the joint information in an n-best 
list and show empirical evidence that 
humans prefer the result sets produced by 
our joint model. Our results show with 
95% confidence that the n-best lists gen-
erated by our joint ranking model are 
significantly different from a baseline in-
dependent model 50.0% ? 3.1% of the 
time, out of which they are preferred 
76.6% ? 5.2% of the time.
