Vector Space Models (VSM) have been
widely used in the language assessment field
to provide measurements of students? vocab-
ulary choices and content relevancy. How-
ever, training reference vectors (RV) in a VSM
requires a time-consuming and costly human
scoring process. To address this limitation, we
applied unsupervised learning methods to re-
duce or even eliminate the human scoring step
required for training RVs. Our experiments
conducted on data from a non-native English
speaking test suggest that the unsupervised
topic clustering is better at selecting responses
to train RVs than random selection. In addi-
tion, we conducted an experiment to totally
eliminate the need of human scoring. Instead
of using human rated scores to train RVs, we
used used the machine-predicted scores from
an automated speaking assessment system for
training RVs. We obtained VSM-derived fea-
tures that show promisingly high correlations
to human-holistic scores, indicating that the
costly human scoring process can be elimi-
nated.
