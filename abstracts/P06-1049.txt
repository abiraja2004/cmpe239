Ordering information is a difficult but
important task for applications generat-
ing natural-language text. We present
a bottom-up approach to arranging sen-
tences extracted for multi-document sum-
marization. To capture the association and
order of two textual segments (eg, sen-
tences), we define four criteria, chronol-
ogy, topical-closeness, precedence, and
succession. These criteria are integrated
into a criterion by a supervised learning
approach. We repeatedly concatenate two
textual segments into one segment based
on the criterion until we obtain the overall
segment with all sentences arranged. Our
experimental results show a significant im-
provement over existing sentence ordering
strategies.
