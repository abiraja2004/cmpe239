An intelligent thesaurus assists a writer
with alternative choices of words and or-
ders them by their suitability in the writ-
ing context. In this paper we focus on
methods for automatically choosing near-
synonyms by their semantic coherence
with the context. Our statistical method
uses the Web as a corpus to compute
mutual information scores. Evaluation
experiments show that this method per-
forms better than a previous method on
the same task. We also propose and evalu-
ate two more methods, one that uses anti-
collocations, and one that uses supervised
learning. To asses the difficulty of the
task, we present results obtained by hu-
man judges.
