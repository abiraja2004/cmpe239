 
The development of Human Language Technology 
(HLT) is one of the important by-products of the in-
formation revolution.  However, the level of knowl-
edge and skills in HLT for African languages remain 
unfortunately low as most scholars continue to work 
within the frameworks of knowledge production for 
an industrial society while the information age dawns. 
This paper reports the work of African Languages 
Technology Initiative (Alt-i) over a five-year period, 
and thereby presents a proposal for the acceleration of 
the development of knowledge and skills in HLT for 
African languages.
