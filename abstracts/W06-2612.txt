Names are important in many societies, 
even in technologically oriented ones 
which use ID systems or other ways to 
identify individual people. Names such 
as personal surnames are the most im-
portant as they are used in many proc-
esses, such as identifying of people, re-
cord linkage and for genealogical re-
search as well. For Thai names this 
situation is a bit different in that in Thai 
the first names are most important. 
Even phone books and directories are 
sorted according to the first names. 
Here we present a system for construct-
ing Thai names from basic syllables. 
Typically Thai names convey a mean-
ing. For this we use an ontology of 
names to capture the meaning of the 
variants which are based on the Thai 
naming methodology and rules.
