Broad-coverage semantic annotations for
training statistical learners are only available
for a handful of languages. Previous ap-
proaches to cross-lingual transfer of seman-
tic annotations have addressed this problem
with encouraging results on a small scale. In
this paper, we scale up previous efforts by us-
ing an automatic approach to semantic anno-
tation that does not rely on a semantic on-
tology for the target language. Moreover,
we improve the quality of the transferred se-
mantic annotations by using a joint syntactic-
semantic parser that learns the correlations be-
tween syntax and semantics of the target lan-
guage and smooths out the errors from auto-
matic transfer. We reach a labelled F-measure
for predicates and arguments of only 4% and
9% points, respectively, lower than the upper
bound from manual annotations.
