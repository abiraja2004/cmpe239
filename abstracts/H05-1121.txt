Query expansion techniques generally se-
lect new query terms from a set of top
ranked documents. Although a user?s
manual judgment of those documents
would much help to select good expansion
terms, it is difficult to get enough feedback
from users in practical situations. In this
paper we propose a query expansion tech-
nique which performs well even if a user
notifies just a relevant document and a
non-relevant document. In order to tackle
this specific condition, we introduce two
refinements to a well-known query expan-
sion technique. One is application of a
transductive learning technique in order to
increase relevant documents. The other is
a modified parameter estimation method
which laps the predictions by multiple
learning trials and try to differentiate the
importance of candidate terms for expan-
sion in relevant documents. Experimen-
tal results show that our technique outper-
forms some traditional query expansion
methods in several evaluation measures.
