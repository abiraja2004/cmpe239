We present a novel approach for translation
model (TM) adaptation using phrase train-
ing. The proposed adaptation procedure is ini-
tialized with a standard general-domain TM,
which is then used to perform phrase training
on a smaller in-domain set. This way, we bias
the probabilities of the general TM towards
the in-domain distribution. Experimental re-
sults on two different lectures translation tasks
show significant improvements of the adapted
systems over the general ones. Additionally,
we compare our results to mixture modeling,
where we report gains when using the sug-
gested phrase training adaptation method.
