We apply machine learning techniques to
study language transfer, a major topic in
the theory of Second Language Acquisition
(SLA). Using an SVM for the problem of
native language classification, we show that
a careful analysis of the effects of various
features can lead to scientific insights. In
particular, we demonstrate that character bi-
grams alone allow classification levels of
about 66% for a 5-class task, even when con-
tent and function word differences are ac-
counted for. This may show that native lan-
guage has a strong effect on the word choice
of people writing in a second language.
