 
It is shown that basic language processes such 
as the production of free word associations and 
the generation of synonyms can be simulated 
using statistical models that analyze the distri-
bution of words in large text corpora. Accord-
ing to the law of association by contiguity, the 
acquisition of word associations can be ex-
plained by Hebbian learning. The free word as-
sociations as produced by subjects on presenta-
tion of single stimulus words can thus be pre-
dicted by applying first-order statistics to the 
frequencies of word co-occurrences as observed 
in texts. The generation of synonyms can also 
be conducted on co-occurrence data but re-
quires second-order statistics. The reason is that 
synonyms rarely occur together but appear in 
similar lexical neighborhoods. Both approaches 
are systematically compared and are validated 
on empirical data. It turns out that for both 
tasks the performance of the statistical system is 
comparable to the performance of human sub-
jects.
