We introduce an extension to CCG that al-
lows form and function to be represented
simultaneously, reducing the proliferation
of modifier categories seen in standard
CCG analyses.
We can then remove the non-combinatory
rules CCGbank uses to address this prob-
lem, producing a grammar that is fully lex-
icalised and far less ambiguous.
There are intrinsic benefits to full lexi-
calisation, such as semantic transparency
and simpler domain adaptation. The clear-
est advantage is a 52-88% improvement
in parse speeds, which comes with only a
small reduction in accuracy.
