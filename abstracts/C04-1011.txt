We consider the problem of computing the
Kullback-Leibler distance, also called the
relative entropy, between a probabilistic
context-free grammar and a probabilistic fi-
nite automaton. We show that there is
a closed-form (analytical) solution for one
part of the Kullback-Leibler distance, viz.
the cross-entropy. We discuss several ap-
plications of the result to the problem of
distributional approximation of probabilis-
tic context-free grammars by means of prob-
abilistic finite automata.
