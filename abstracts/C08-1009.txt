We present an automatic method for sense-
labeling of text in an unsupervised manner.
The method makes use of distributionally
similar words to derive an automatically
labeled training set, which is then used to
train a standard supervised classifier for
distinguishing word senses. Experimental
results on the Senseval-2 and Senseval-3
datasets show that our approach yields sig-
nificant improvements over state-of-the-art
unsupervised methods, and is competitive
with supervised ones, while eliminating
the annotation cost.
