We present a Chinese Named Entity
Recognition (NER) system submitted to
the close track of Sighan Bakeoff2006.
We define some additional features via do-
ing statistics in training corpus. Our sys-
tem incorporates basic features and addi-
tional features based on Conditional Ran-
dom Fields (CRFs). In order to correct in-
consistently results, we perform the post-
processing procedure according to n-best
results given by the CRFs model. Our fi-
nal system achieved a F-score of 85.14 at
MSRA, 89.03 at CityU, and 76.27 at LDC.
