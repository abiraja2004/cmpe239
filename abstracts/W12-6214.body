In this work, we describe a methodology
based on the Stochastic Finite State Trans-
ducers paradigm for Spoken Language Under-
standing (SLU) for obtaining concept graphs
from word graphs. In the edges of these con-
cept graphs, both semantic and lexical infor-
mation are represented. This makes these
graphs a very useful representation of the in-
formation for SLU. The best path in these con-
cept graphs provides the best sequence of con-
cepts.
