In this paper, we highlight the problems of
polysemy in word space models of compo-
sitionality detection. Most models represent
each word as a single prototype-based vec-
tor without addressing polysemy. We propose
an exemplar-based model which is designed
to handle polysemy. This model is tested for
compositionality detection and it is found to
outperform existing prototype-based models.
We have participated in the shared task (Bie-
mann and Giesbrecht, 2011) and our best per-
forming exemplar-model is ranked first in two
types of evaluations and second in two other
evaluations.
