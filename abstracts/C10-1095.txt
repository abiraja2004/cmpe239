This paper proposes a co-training style
algorithm called Co-STAR that acquires
hyponymy relations simultaneously from
structured and unstructured text. In Co-
STAR, two independent processes for hy-
ponymy relation acquisition ? one han-
dling structured text and the other han-
dling unstructured text ? collaborate by re-
peatedly exchanging the knowledge they
acquired about hyponymy relations. Un-
like conventional co-training, the two pro-
cesses in Co-STAR are applied to dif-
ferent source texts and training data.
We show the effectiveness of this al-
gorithm through experiments on large-
scale hyponymy-relation acquisition from
Japanese Wikipedia and Web texts. We
also show that Co-STAR is robust against
noisy training data.
