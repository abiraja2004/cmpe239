In order to integrate heterogeneous clinical
information sources, semantically correlating
information entities have to be linked. Our
discussions with radiologists revealed that
anatomical entities with pathological findings
are of particular interest when linking radi-
ology text and images. Previous research to
identify pathological findings focused on sim-
plistic approaches that recognize diseases or
negated findings, but failed to establish a holis-
tic approach. In this paper, we introduce our
syntacto-semantic parsing approach to clas-
sify sentences in radiology reports as either
pathological or non-pathological based on the
findings they describe. Although we operate
with an incomplete, RadLex-based linguistic
resource, the obtained results show the effec-
tiveness of our approach by identifying a recall
value of 74.3% for the classification task.
