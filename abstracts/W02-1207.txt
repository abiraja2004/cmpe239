As electronic communications is now increasing, the term Natural Language Processing should be
considered in the broader aspect of Multi-Language processing system. Observation of the language
behavior will provide a good basis for design of computational language model and also creating cost-
effective solutions to the practical problems. In order to have a good language modeling, the language
resources are necessary for the language behavior analysis.
This paper intended to express what we have and what we have done by the desire to make a bridge
between the languages and to share and make maximal use of the existing lexica, corpus and the tools.
Three main topics are, then, focussed: A State of the Art of Thai language Resources, Thai language
behaviors and their computational models.
