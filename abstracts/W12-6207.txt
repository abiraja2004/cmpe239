This paper presents DAGGER, a toolkit for
finite-state automata that operate on directed
acyclic graphs (dags). The work is based on a
model introduced by (Kamimura and Slutzki,
1981; Kamimura and Slutzki, 1982), with a
few changes to make the automata more ap-
plicable to natural language processing. Avail-
able algorithms include membership checking
in bottom-up dag acceptors, transduction of
dags to trees (bottom-up dag-to-tree transduc-
ers), k-best generation and basic operations
such as union and intersection.
