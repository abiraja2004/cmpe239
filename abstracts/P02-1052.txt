We describe an approach to improve the
bilingual cooccurrence dictionary that is
used for word alignment, and evaluate the
improved dictionary using a version of
the Competitive Linking algorithm. We
demonstrate a problem faced by the Com-
petitive Linking algorithm and present an
approach to ameliorate it. In particular, we
rebuild the bilingual dictionary by cluster-
ing similar words in a language and as-
signing them a higher cooccurrence score
with a given word in the other language
than each single word would have other-
wise. Experimental results show a signifi-
cant improvement in precision and recall
for word alignment when the improved
dicitonary is used.
