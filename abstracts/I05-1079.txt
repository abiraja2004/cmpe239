. Lexical Conceptual Structure (LCS) represents verbs as semantic
structures with a limited number of semantic predicates. This paper attempts to
exploit how LCS can be used to explain the regularities underlying lexical and
syntactic paraphrases, such as verb alternation, compound word decomposition,
and lexical derivation. We propose a paraphrase generation model which trans-
forms LCSs of verbs, and then conduct an empirical experiment taking the para-
phrasing of Japanese light-verb constructions as an example. Experimental results
justify that syntactic and semantic properties of verbs encoded in LCS are useful
to semantically constrain the syntactic transformation in paraphrase generation.
