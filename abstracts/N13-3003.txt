TMTprime is a recommender system that fa-
cilitates the effective use of both transla-
tion memory (TM) and machine translation
(MT) technology within industrial language
service providers (LSPs) localization work-
flows. LSPs have long used Translation Mem-
ory (TM) technology to assist the translation
process. Recent research shows how MT sys-
tems can be combined with TMs in Computer
Aided Translation (CAT) systems, selecting
either TM or MT output based on sophis-
ticated translation quality estimation without
access to a reference. However, to date there
are no commercially available frameworks for
this. TMTprime takes confidence estimation
out of the lab and provides a commercially vi-
able platform that allows for the seamless inte-
gration of MT with legacy TM systems to pro-
vide the most effective (least effort/cost) trans-
lation options to human translators, based on
the TMTprime confidence score.
