This work shows how to construct
discourse-level opinion graphs to perform
a joint interpretation of opinions and dis-
course relations. Specifically, our opinion
graphs enable us to factor in discourse in-
formation for polarity classification, and
polarity information for discourse-link
classification. This inter-dependent frame-
work can be used to augment and im-
prove the performance of local polarity
and discourse-link classifiers.
