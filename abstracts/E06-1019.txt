This work is concerned with the space of
alignments searched by word alignment
systems. We focus on situations where
word re-ordering is limited by syntax. We
present two new alignment spaces that
limit an ITG according to a given depen-
dency parse. We provide D-ITG grammars
to search these spaces completely and
without redundancy. We conduct a care-
ful comparison of five alignment spaces,
and show that limiting search with an ITG
reduces error rate by 10%, while a D-ITG
produces a 31% reduction.
