This paper reports some experiments that com-
pare the accuracy and performance of two
stochastic parsing systems. The currently pop-
ular Collins parser is a shallow parser whose
output contains more detailed semantically-
relevant information than other such parsers.
The XLE parser is a deep-parsing system that
couples a Lexical Functional Grammar to a log-
linear disambiguation component and provides
much richer representations theory. We mea-
sured the accuracy of both systems against a
gold standard of the PARC 700 dependency
bank, and also measured their processing times.
We found the deep-parsing system to be more
accurate than the Collins parser with only a
slight reduction in parsing speed.1
