  
This paper briefly describes our system in the 
third SIGHAN bakeoff on Chinese word 
segmentation and named entity recognition. 
This is done via a word chunking strategy 
using a context-dependent Mutual 
Information Independence Model. 
Evaluation shows that our system performs 
well on all the word segmentation closed 
tracks and achieves very good scalability 
across different corpora. It also shows that 
the use of the same strategy in named entity 
recognition shows promising performance 
given the fact that we only spend less than 
three days in total on extending the system in 
word segmentation to incorporate named 
entity recognition, including training and 
formal testing.
