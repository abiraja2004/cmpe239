While extensive studies on relation ex-
traction have been conducted in the last
decade, statistical systems based on su-
pervised learning are still limited because
they require large amounts of training data
to achieve high performance. In this pa-
per, we develop a cross-lingual annota-
tion projection method that leverages par-
allel corpora to bootstrap a relation detec-
tor without significant annotation efforts
for a resource-poor language. In order to
make our method more reliable, we intro-
duce three simple projection noise reduc-
tion methods. The merit of our method is
demonstrated through a novel Korean re-
lation detection task.
