We propose a novel approach to crosslingual
language model (LM) adaptation based on
bilingual Latent Semantic Analysis (bLSA).
A bLSA model is introduced which enables
latent topic distributions to be efficiently
transferred across languages by enforcing
a one-to-one topic correspondence during
training. Using the proposed bLSA frame-
work crosslingual LM adaptation can be per-
formed by, first, inferring the topic poste-
rior distribution of the source text and then
applying the inferred distribution to the tar-
get language N-gram LM via marginal adap-
tation. The proposed framework also en-
ables rapid bootstrapping of LSA models
for new languages based on a source LSA
model from another language. On Chinese
to English speech and text translation the
proposed bLSA framework successfully re-
duced word perplexity of the English LM by
over 27% for a unigram LM and up to 13.6%
for a 4-gram LM. Furthermore, the pro-
posed approach consistently improved ma-
chine translation quality on both speech and
text based adaptation.
