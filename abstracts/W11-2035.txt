Within our ongoing effort to develop a com-
putational model to understand multi-modal
human dialogue in the field of elderly care,
this paper focuses on pronominal and deictic
co-reference resolution. After describing our
data collection effort, we discuss our anno-
tation scheme. We developed a co-reference
model that employs both a simple notion of
markable type, and multiple statistical mod-
els. Our results show that knowing the type
of the markable, and the presence of simulta-
neous pointing gestures improve co-reference
resolution for personal and deictic pronouns.
