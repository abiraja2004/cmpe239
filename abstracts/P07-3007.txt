This paper presents the results of experi-
ments in which we tested different kinds of
features for retrieval of Chinese opinionated
texts. We assume that the task of retrieval of
opinionated texts (OIR) can be regarded as
a subtask of general IR, but with some dis-
tinct features. The experiments showed that
the best results were obtained from the com-
bination of character-based processing, dic-
tionary look up (maximum matching) and a
negation check.
