We discuss data-driven morphological
segmentation, in which word forms are
segmented into morphs, the surface forms
of morphemes. Our focus is on a low-
resource learning setting, in which only a
small amount of annotated word forms are
available for model training, while unan-
notated word forms are available in abun-
dance. The current state-of-art methods
1) exploit both the annotated and unan-
notated data in a semi-supervised man-
ner, and 2) learn morph lexicons and sub-
sequently uncover segmentations by gen-
erating the most likely morph sequences.
In contrast, we discuss 1) employing only
the annotated data in a supervised man-
ner, while entirely ignoring the unanno-
tated data, and 2) directly learning to pre-
dict morph boundaries given their local
sub-string contexts instead of learning the
morph lexicons. Specifically, we em-
ploy conditional random fields, a popular
discriminative log-linear model for seg-
mentation. We present experiments on
two data sets comprising five diverse lan-
guages. We show that the fully super-
vised boundary prediction approach out-
performs the state-of-art semi-supervised
morph lexicon approaches on all lan-
guages when using the same annotated
data sets.
