This paper describes a system which gen-
erates animations for cooking actions in
recipes, to help people understand recipes
written in Japanese. The major goal of this
research is to increase the scalability of the
system, i.e., to develop a system which can
handle various kinds of cooking actions.
We designed and compiled the lexicon of
cooking actions required for the animation
generation system. The lexicon includes
the action plan used for animation genera-
tion, and the information about ingredients
upon which the cooking action is taken.
Preliminary evaluation shows that our lex-
icon contains most of the cooking actions
that appear in Japanese recipes. We also
discuss how to handle linguistic expres-
sions in recipes, which are not included
in the lexicon, in order to generate anima-
tions for them.
