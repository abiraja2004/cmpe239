This paper presents an analysis of an anno-
tator?s behaviour during her/his annotation
process for eliciting useful information for
natural language processing (NLP) tasks.
Text annotation is essential for machine
learning-based NLP where annotated texts
are used for both training and evaluat-
ing supervised systems. Since an annota-
tor?s behaviour during annotation can be
seen as reflecting her/his cognitive process
during her/his attempt to understand the
text for annotation, analysing the process
of text annotation has potential to reveal
useful information for NLP tasks, in par-
ticular semantic and discourse processing
that require deeper language understand-
ing. We conducted an experiment for col-
lecting annotator actions and eye gaze dur-
ing the annotation of predicate-argument
relations in Japanese texts. Our analysis
of the collected data suggests that obtained
insight into human annotation behaviour
is useful for exploring effective linguis-
tic features in machine learning-based ap-
proaches.
