When using a machine translation (MT)
model trained on OLD-domain parallel data to
translate NEW-domain text, one major chal-
lenge is the large number of out-of-vocabulary
(OOV) and new-translation-sense words. We
present a method to identify new translations
of both known and unknown source language
words that uses NEW-domain comparable doc-
ument pairs. Starting with a joint distribution
of source-target word pairs derived from the
OLD-domain parallel corpus, our method re-
covers a new joint distribution that matches
the marginal distributions of the NEW-domain
comparable document pairs, while minimiz-
ing the divergence from the OLD-domain dis-
tribution. Adding learned translations to our
French-English MT model results in gains of
about 2 BLEU points over strong baselines.
