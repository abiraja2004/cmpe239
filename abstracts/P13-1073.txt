We introduce the novel task of automati-
cally generating questions that are relevant
to a text but do not appear in it. One mo-
tivating example of its application is for
increasing user engagement around news
articles by suggesting relevant compara-
ble questions, such as ?is Beyonce a bet-
ter singer than Madonna??, for the user
to answer. We present the first algorithm
for the task, which consists of: (a) of-
fline construction of a comparable ques-
tion template database; (b) ranking of rel-
evant templates to a given article; and (c)
instantiation of templates only with enti-
ties in the article whose comparison un-
der the template?s relation makes sense.
We tested the suggestions generated by
our algorithm via a Mechanical Turk ex-
periment, which showed a significant im-
provement over the strongest baseline of
more than 45% in all metrics.
