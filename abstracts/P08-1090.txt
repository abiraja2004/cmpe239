Hand-coded scripts were used in the 1970-80s
as knowledge backbones that enabled infer-
ence and other NLP tasks requiring deep se-
mantic knowledge. We propose unsupervised
induction of similar schemata called narrative
event chains from raw newswire text.
A narrative event chain is a partially ordered
set of events related by a common protago-
nist. We describe a three step process to learn-
ing narrative event chains. The first uses unsu-
pervised distributional methods to learn narra-
tive relations between events sharing corefer-
ring arguments. The second applies a tempo-
ral classifier to partially order the connected
events. Finally, the third prunes and clusters
self-contained chains from the space of events.
We introduce two evaluations: the narrative
cloze to evaluate event relatedness, and an or-
der coherence task to evaluate narrative order.
We show a 36% improvement over baseline
for narrative prediction and 25% for temporal
coherence.
