We present a computational notion of Lexical 
Tightness that measures global cohesion of con-
tent words in a text. Lexical tightness represents 
the degree to which a text tends to use words 
that are highly inter-associated in the language. 
We demonstrate the utility of this measure for 
estimating text complexity as measured by US 
school grade level designations of texts. Lexical 
tightness strongly correlates with grade level in 
a collection of expertly rated reading materials. 
Lexical  tightness  captures  aspects  of  prose 
complexity that are not covered by classic read-
ability indexes, especially for literary texts. We 
also present initial findings on the utility of this 
measure for automated estimation of complex-
ity for poetry.
