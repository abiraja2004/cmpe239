We apply algorithms for the identification
of cognates and recurrent sound correspon-
dences proposed by Kondrak (2002) to the
Totonac-Tepehua family of indigenous lan-
guages in Mexico. We show that by combin-
ing expert linguistic knowledge with com-
putational analysis, it is possible to quickly
identify a large number of cognate sets
within the family. Our objective is to pro-
vide tools for rapid construction of com-
parative dictionaries for relatively unfamiliar
language families.
