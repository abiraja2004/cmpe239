Truecasing is the process of restoring
case information to badly-cased or non-
cased text. This paper explores truecas-
ing issues and proposes a statistical, lan-
guage modeling based truecaser which
achieves an accuracy of ?98% on news
articles. Task based evaluation shows a
26% F-measure improvement in named
entity recognition when using truecasing.
In the context of automatic content ex-
traction, mention detection on automatic
speech recognition text is also improved
by a factor of 8. Truecasing also en-
hances machine translation output legibil-
ity and yields a BLEU score improvement
of 80.2%. This paper argues for the use of
truecasing as a valuable component in text
processing applications.
