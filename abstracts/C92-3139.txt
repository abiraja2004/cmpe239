 
"l\]fis paper reports on a new statistical approach to 
machine aided translation of terminology bank. The text 
in the bank is hyphenated and then dissected into roots of 
1 to 3 syllables. Both hyphenation and dissection are 
done with a set of initial probabilities of syllables and 
roots. The probabilities are repeatedly revised using an 
EM algorithm. Alter each iteration of hyphenation or 
dissectioh, the resulting syllables and roots are counted 
subsequently to yield more precise estimation of 
probability. The set of roots rapidly converges to a set of 
most likely roots. Preliminary experhuents have shown 
promising results. From a terminology bank of more than 
4,000 terms, the algorithm extracts 223 general and 
chemical roots, of which 91% are actually roots. The 
algoritlun dissects a word into roots with aromld 86% hit 
rate. The set of roots and their "hand-translation are then 
used iu a compositional translation of the terminology 
bank. One can expect he translation of terminology bank 
using this approach to be more cost-effective, consistent, 
and with a better closure.
