We propose a novel approach to translating
from a morphologically complex language.
Unlike previous research, which has targeted
word inflections and concatenations, we fo-
cus on the pairwise relationship between mor-
phologically related words, which we treat as
potential paraphrases and handle using para-
phrasing techniques at the word, phrase, and
sentence level. An important advantage of
this framework is that it can cope with deriva-
tional morphology, which has so far remained
largely beyond the capabilities of statistical
machine translation systems. Our experiments
translating from Malay, whose morphology is
mostly derivational, into English show signif-
icant improvements over rivaling approaches
based on five automatic evaluation measures
(for 320,000 sentence pairs; 9.5 million En-
glish word tokens).
