An important task of opinion mining is 
to extract people?s opinions on features 
of an entity. For example, the sentence, 
?I love the GPS function of Motorola 
Droid? expresses a positive opinion on 
the ?GPS function? of the Motorola 
phone. ?GPS function? is the feature. 
This paper focuses on mining features. 
Double propagation is a state-of-the-art 
technique for solving the problem. It 
works well for medium-size corpora. 
However, for large and small corpora, it 
can result in low precision and low re-
call. To deal with these two problems, 
two improvements based on part-whole
and ?no? patterns are introduced to in-
crease the recall. Then feature ranking is 
applied to the extracted feature candi-
dates to improve the precision of the 
top-ranked candidates. We rank feature 
candidates by feature importance which 
is determined by two factors: feature re-
levance and feature frequency. The 
problem is formulated as a bipartite 
graph and the well-known web page 
ranking algorithm HITS is used to find 
important features and rank them high. 
Experiments on diverse real-life datasets 
show promising results.
