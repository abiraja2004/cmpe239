 
We describe two new strategies to automatic bracketing of parallel corpora, with particular appli- 
cation to languages where prior grammar resources are scarce: (1) coarse bilingual grammars, and (2) 
unsupervised training of such grammars via EM (expectation-maximization). Both methods build upon a 
formalism we recently introduced called stochastic inversion transduction grammars. The first approach 
borrows acoarse monolingual grammar into our bilingual formalism, in order to transfer knowledge of 
one language's constraints to the task of bracketing the texts in both languages. The second approach 
generalizes the inside-outside algorithm to adjust he grammar parameters so as to improve the likelihood 
of a training corpus. Preliminary experiments on parallel English-Chinese text are supportive of these 
strategies.
