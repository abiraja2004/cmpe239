This paper presents an argument against
modularizing linguistic information in nat-
ural language generation systems. We ar-
gue that complex linguistic constructions
require grammatical information to be lo-
cated in the same module, in order to
avoid over-complicating the system archi-
tecture. We demonstrate this point by
showing how parenthetical constructions
? which have only been generated in pre-
vious systems using an aggregation or re-
vision module ? can be generated by a
surface realizer when using an integrated
grammar.
