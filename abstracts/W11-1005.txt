Translation requires non-isomorphic
transformation from the source to the
target. However, non-isomorphism can
be reduced by learning multi-word units
(MWUs). We present a novel way of
representating sentence structure based
on MWUs, which are not necessarily
continuous word sequences. Our pro-
posed method builds a simpler structure
of MWUs than words using words
as vertices of a dependency structure.
Unlike previous studies, we collect
many alternative structures in a packed
forest. As an application of our proposed
method, we extract translation rules in
form of a source MWU-forest to the
target string, and verify the rule coverage
empirically. As a consequence, we
improve the rule coverage compare to a
previous work, while retaining the linear
asymptotic complexity.
