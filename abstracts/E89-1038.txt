 
In this paper we describe a framework for research 
into translation that draws on a combination of two 
existing and independently constructed technologies: 
an analysis component developed for German by the 
EUROTRA-D (ET-D) group of IAI and the genera- 
tion component developed for English by the Penman 
group at ISI. We present some of the linguistic impli- 
cations of the research and the promise it bears for 
furthering understanding of the translation process.
