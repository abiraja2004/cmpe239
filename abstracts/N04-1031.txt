There are a lot of differences between expres-
sions used in written language and spoken lan-
guage. It is one of the reasons why speech syn-
thesis applications are prone to produce unnat-
ural speech. This paper represents a method
of paraphrasing unsuitable expressions for spo-
ken language into suitable ones. Those two
expressions can be distinguished based on the
occurrence probability in written and spoken
language corpora which are automatically col-
lected from the Web. Experimental results indi-
cated the effectiveness of our method. The pre-
cision of the collected corpora was 94%, and
the accuracy of learning paraphrases was 76 %.
