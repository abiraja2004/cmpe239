 
As part of its description of lexico-semantic 
predicate frames or conceptual structures, the 
FrameNet project defines a set of semantic 
roles specific to the core predicate of a 
sentence.  Recently, researchers have tried to 
automatically produce semantic interpretations 
of sentences using this information.  Building 
on prior work, we describe a new method to 
perform such interpretations.  We define 
sentence segmentation first and show how 
Maximum Entropy re-ranking helps achieve a 
level of 76.2% F-score (answer among top-
five candidates) or 61.5% (correct answer).
