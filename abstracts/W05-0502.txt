Both Middle English and Old French had
a syntactic property called verb-second or
V2 that disappeared. In this paper de-
scribes a simulation being developed to
shed light on the question of why V2 is
stable in some languages, but not oth-
ers. The simulation, based on a Markov
chain, uses fuzzy grammars where speak-
ers can use an arbitrary mixture of ideal-
ized grammars. Thus, it can mimic the
variable syntax observed in Middle En-
glish manuscripts. The simulation sup-
ports the hypotheses that children use the
topic of a sentence for word order acqui-
sition, that acquisition takes into account
the ambiguity of grammatical information
available from sample sentences, and that
speakers prefer to speak with more regu-
larity than they observe in the primary lin-
guistic data.
