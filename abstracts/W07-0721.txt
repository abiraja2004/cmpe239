One main challenge of statistical machine trans-
lation (SMT) is dealing with word order. The
main idea of the statistical machine reordering
(SMR) approach is to use the powerful tech-
niques of SMT systems to generate a weighted
reordering graph for SMT systems. This tech-
nique supplies reordering constraints to an SMT
system, using statistical criteria.
In this paper, we experiment with different graph
pruning which guarantees the translation quality
improvement due to reordering at a very low in-
crease of computational cost.
The SMR approach is capable of generalizing re-
orderings, which have been learned during train-
ing, by using word classes instead of words
themselves. We experiment with statistical and
morphological classes in order to choose those
which capture the most probable reorderings.
Satisfactory results are reported in the WMT07
Es/En task. Our system outperforms in terms of
BLEU the WMT07 Official baseline system.
