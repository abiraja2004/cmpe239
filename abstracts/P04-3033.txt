Multimodal interfaces provide more flexible and
compelling interaction and can enable public infor-
mation kiosks to support more complex tasks for
a broader community of users. MATCHKiosk is
a multimodal interactive city guide which provides
users with the freedom to interact using speech,
pen, touch or multimodal inputs. The system re-
sponds by generating multimodal presentations that
synchronize synthetic speech with a life-like virtual
agent and dynamically generated graphics.
