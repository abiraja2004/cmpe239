Entailment pairs are sentence pairs of a premise and a hypothesis, where the premise textually
entails the hypothesis. Such sentence pairs are important for the development of Textual Entailment
systems. In this paper, we take a closer look at a prominent strategy for their automatic acquisition
from newspaper corpora, pairing first sentences of articles with their titles. We propose a simple
logistic regression model that incorporates and extends this heuristic and investigate its robustness
across three languages and three domains. We manage to identify two predictors which predict
entailment pairs with a fairly high accuracy across all languages. However, we find that robustness
across domains within a language is more difficult to achieve.
