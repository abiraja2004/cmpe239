We introduce DISSECT, a toolkit to
build and explore computational models
of word, phrase and sentence meaning
based on the principles of distributional
semantics. The toolkit focuses in partic-
ular on compositional meaning, and im-
plements a number of composition meth-
ods that have been proposed in the litera-
ture. Furthermore, DISSECT can be use-
ful to researchers and practitioners who
need models of word meaning (without
composition) as well, as it supports var-
ious methods to construct distributional
semantic spaces, assessing similarity and
even evaluating against benchmarks, that
are independent of the composition infras-
tructure.
