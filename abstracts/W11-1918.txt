In this paper, we discuss the application
of UBIU to the CONLL-2011 shared task
on ?Modeling Unrestricted Coreference? in
OntoNotes. The shared task concentrates on
the detection of coreference not only in noun
phrases but also involving verbs. The infor-
mation provided for the closed track included
WordNet as well as corpus generated number
and gender information. Our system shows
no improvement when using WordNet infor-
mation, and the number information proved
less reliable than the information in the part
of speech tags.
