To realize high quality machine transla-
tion, we proposed a Non-Compositional
Language Model, and developed a sen-
tence pattern dictionary of 226,800 pat-
tern pairs for Japanese compound and
complex sentences consisting of 2 or 3
clauses. In pattern generation from a par-
allel corpus, Compositional Constituents
that could be generalized were 74% of
independent words, 24% of phrases and
only 15% of clauses. This means that
in Japanese-to-English MT, most of the
translation results as shown in the parallel
corpus could not be obtained by methods
based on Compositional Semantics. This
dictionary achieved a syntactic coverage of
98% and a semantic coverage of 78%. It
will substantially improve translation qual-
ity.
