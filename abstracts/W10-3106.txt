plied to biological texts is the automatic de-
tection of speculative sentences. In this pa-
per, we test on a large scale BioExcom, a 
rule-based system which annotates and ca-
tegorizes automatically speculative sen-
tences (?prior? and ?new?). This work 
enables us to highlight a more restrictive 
way to consider speculations, viewed as a 
source of knowledge, and to discuss the cri-
teria used to determine if a sentence is spe-
culative or not. By doing so, we demonstrate 
the efficiency of BioExcom to extract these 
types of speculations and we argue the im-
portance of this tool for biologists, who are 
also interested in finding hypotheses.
