The paper aims at a deeper understanding of sev-
eral well-known algorithms and proposes ways to
optimize them. It describes and discusses factors
and strategies of factor interaction used in the algo-
rithms. The factors used in the algorithms and the
algorithms themselves are evaluated on a German
corpus annotated with syntactic and coreference in-
formation (Negra) (Skut et al, 1997). A common
format for pronoun resolution algorithms with sev-
eral open parameters is proposed, and the parameter
settings optimal on the evaluation data are given.
