In this paper we present a method for
greatly reducing parse times in LFG pars-
ing, while at the same time maintaining
parse accuracy. We evaluate the method-
ology on data from English, German and
Norwegian and show that the same pat-
terns hold across languages. We achieve
a speedup of 67% on the English data and
49% on the German data. On a small
amount of data for Norwegian, we achieve
a speedup of 40%, although with more
training data we expect this figure to in-
crease.
