When we write a report or an explanation
on a newly-developed technology for readers
including laypersons, it is very important to
compose a title that can stimulate their in-
terest in the technology. However, it is dif-
ficult for inexperienced authors to come up
with an appealing title.
In this research, we developed a support sys-
tem for revising titles. We call it ?title revi-
sion wizard?. The wizard provides a guid-
ance on revising draft title to compose a title
meeting three key points, and support tools
for coming up with and elaborating on com-
prehensible or appealing phrases.
In order to test the effect of our title revision
wizard, we conducted a questionnaire sur-
vey on the effect of the titles with or with-
out using the wizard on the interest of lay
readers. The survey showed that the wiz-
ard is effective and helpful for the authors
who cannot compose appealing titles for lay
readers by themselves.
