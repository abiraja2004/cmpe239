In this work, we propose a novel representa-
tion of text based on patterns derived from lin-
guistic annotation graphs. We use a subgraph
mining algorithm to automatically derive fea-
tures as frequent subgraphs from the annota-
tion graph. This process generates a very large
number of features, many of which are highly
correlated. We propose a genetic program-
ming based approach to feature construction
which creates a fixed number of strong classi-
fication predictors from these subgraphs. We
evaluate the benefit gained from evolved struc-
tured features, when used in addition to the
bag-of-words features, for a sentiment classi-
fication task.
