We use a set of enriched n-gram models to track
grammaticality judgements for different sorts of
passive sentences in English. We construct these
models by specifying scoring functions to map the
log probabilities (logprobs) of an n-gram model for
a test set of sentences onto scores which depend
on properties of the string related to the parame-
ters of the model. We test our models on classifica-
tion tasks for different kinds of passive sentences.
Our experiments indicate that our n-gram models
achieve high accuracy in identifying ill-formed pas-
sives in which ill-formedness depends on local rela-
tions within the n-gram frame, but they are far less
successful in detecting non-local relations that pro-
duce unacceptability in other types of passive con-
struction. We take these results to indicate some of
the strengths and the limitations of word and lexical
class n-gram models as candidate representations of
speakers? grammatical knowledge.
