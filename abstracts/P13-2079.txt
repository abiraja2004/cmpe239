 
This paper aims at understanding what hu-
man think in textual entailment (TE) recogni-
tion process and modeling their thinking pro-
cess to deal with this problem. We first ana-
lyze a labeled RTE-5 test set and find that the 
negative entailment phenomena are very ef-
fective features for TE recognition. Then, a 
method is proposed to extract this kind of 
phenomena from text-hypothesis pairs auto-
matically. We evaluate the performance of 
using the negative entailment phenomena on 
both the English RTE-5 dataset and Chinese 
NTCIR-9 RITE dataset, and conclude the 
same findings.
