Discriminative approaches for word align-
ment have gained popularity in recent
years because of the flexibility that they
offer for using a large variety of features
and combining information from various
sources. But, the models proposed in the
past have not been able to make much use
of features that capture the likelihood of an
alignment structure (the set of alignment
links) and the syntactic divergence be-
tween sentences in the parallel text. This is
primarily because of the limitation of their
search techniques. In this paper, we pro-
pose a generic discriminative re-ranking
approach for word alignment which allows
us to make use of structural features effec-
tively. These features are particularly use-
ful for language pairs with high structural
divergence (like English-Hindi, English-
Japanese). We have shown that by us-
ing the structural features, we have ob-
tained a decrease of 2.3% in the absolute
value of alignment error rate (AER). When
we add the cooccurence probabilities ob-
tained from IBM model-4 to our features,
we achieved the best AER (50.50) for the
English-Hindi parallel corpus.
