Dialog systems for mobile robots operat-
ing in the real world should enable mixed-
initiative dialog style, handle multi-modal
information involved in the communica-
tion and be relatively independent of the
domain knowledge. Most dialog systems
developed for mobile robots today, how-
ever, are often system-oriented and have
limited capabilities. We present an agent-
based dialog model that are specially de-
signed for human-robot interaction and
provide evidence for its efficiency with our
implemented system.
