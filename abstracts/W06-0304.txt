 
Recent advances in text analysis have led 
to finer-grained semantic analysis, in-
cluding automatic sentiment analysis?
the task of measuring documents, or 
chunks of text, based on emotive catego-
ries, such as positive or negative. How-
ever, considerably less progress has been 
made on efficient ways of exploring 
these measurements. This paper discusses 
approaches for visualizing the affective 
content of documents and describes an 
interactive capability for exploring emo-
tion in a large document collection.
