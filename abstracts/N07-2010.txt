 
Situated models of meaning ground words in the 
non-linguistic context, or situation, to which they 
refer.  Applying such models to sports video re-
trieval requires learning appropriate representa-
tions for complex events.  We propose a method 
that uses data mining to discover temporal pat-
terns in video, and pair these patterns with associ-
ated closed captioning text.  This paired corpus is 
used to train a situated model of meaning that sig-
nificantly improves video retrieval performance.
