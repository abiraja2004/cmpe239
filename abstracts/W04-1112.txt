 
In this paper, we propose an automatic term 
recognition system for Chinese. Our idea is 
based on the relation between a compound 
word and its constituents that are simple words 
or individual Chinese character. More 
precisely, we basically focus on how many 
words/characters adjoin the word/character in 
question to form compound words. We also 
take into account the frequency of term. We 
evaluated word based method and character 
based method with several Chinese Web pages, 
resulting in precision of 75% for top ten 
candidate terms.
