Mixture modelling is a standard technique
for density estimation, but its use in sta-
tistical machine translation (SMT) has just
started to be explored. One of the main
advantages of this technique is its capabil-
ity to learn specific probability distributions
that better fit subsets of the training dataset.
This feature is even more important in SMT
given the difficulties to translate polysemic
terms whose semantic depends on the con-
text in which that term appears. In this pa-
per, we describe a mixture extension of the
HMM alignment model and the derivation of
Viterbi alignments to feed a state-of-the-art
phrase-based system. Experiments carried
out on the Europarl and News Commentary
corpora show the potential interest and limi-
tations of mixture modelling.
