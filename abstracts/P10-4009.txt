In the EMIME project we have studied un-
supervised cross-lingual speaker adapta-
tion. We have employed an HMM statisti-
cal framework for both speech recognition
and synthesis which provides transfor-
mation mechanisms to adapt the synthe-
sized voice in TTS (text-to-speech) using
the recognized voice in ASR (automatic
speech recognition). An important ap-
plication for this research is personalised
speech-to-speech translation that will use
the voice of the speaker in the input lan-
guage to utter the translated sentences in
the output language. In mobile environ-
ments this enhances the users? interaction
across language barriers by making the
output speech sound more like the origi-
nal speaker?s way of speaking, even if she
or he could not speak the output language.
