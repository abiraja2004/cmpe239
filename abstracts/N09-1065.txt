Recent work has shown that explicitly iden-
tifying and filtering non-anaphoric mentions
prior to coreference resolution can improve
the performance of a coreference system.
We present a novel approach to this task of
anaphoricity determination based on graph
cuts, and demonstrate its superiority to com-
peting approaches by comparing their effec-
tiveness in improving a learning-based coref-
erence system on the ACE data sets.
