Understanding query ambiguity in web search
remains an important open problem. In this
paper we reexamine query ambiguity by ana-
lyzing the result clickthrough data. Previously
proposed clickthrough-based metrics of query
ambiguity tend to conflate informational and
ambiguous queries. To distinguish between
these query classes, we introduce novel met-
rics based on the entropy of the click distri-
butions of individual searchers. Our exper-
iments over a clickthrough log of commer-
cial search engine demonstrate the benefits of
our approach for distinguishing informational
from truly ambiguous queries.
