We exploit sketch techniques, especially the
Count-Min sketch, a memory, and time effi-
cient framework which approximates the fre-
quency of a word pair in the corpus without
explicitly storing the word pair itself. These
methods use hashing to deal with massive
amounts of streaming text. We apply Count-
Min sketch to approximate word pair counts
and exhibit their effectiveness on three im-
portant NLP tasks. Our experiments demon-
strate that on all of the three tasks, we get
performance comparable to Exact word pair
counts setting and state-of-the-art system. Our
method scales to 49 GB of unzipped web data
using bounded space of 2 billion counters (8
GB memory).
