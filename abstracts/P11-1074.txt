In this paper, we adopt an n-best rescoring
scheme using pitch-accent patterns to improve
automatic speech recognition (ASR) perfor-
mance. The pitch-accent model is decoupled
from the main ASR system, thus allowing us
to develop it independently. N-best hypothe-
ses from recognizers are rescored by addi-
tional scores that measure the correlation of
the pitch-accent patterns between the acoustic
signal and lexical cues. To test the robustness
of our algorithm, we use two different data
sets and recognition setups: the first one is En-
glish radio news data that has pitch accent la-
bels, but the recognizer is trained from a small
amount of data and has high error rate; the sec-
ond one is English broadcast news data using
a state-of-the-art SRI recognizer. Our experi-
mental results demonstrate that our approach
is able to reduce word error rate relatively by
about 3%. This gain is consistent across the
two different tests, showing promising future
directions of incorporating prosodic informa-
tion to improve speech recognition.
