Web search engines today typically show re-
sults as a list of titles and short snippets that
summarize how the retrieved documents are
related to the query. However, recent research
suggests that longer summaries can be prefer-
able for certain types of queries. This pa-
per presents empirical evidence that judges
can predict appropriate search result summary
lengths, and that perceptions of search result
quality can be affected by varying these result
lengths. These findings have important impli-
cations for search results presentation, espe-
cially for natural language queries.
