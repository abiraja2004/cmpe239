 
We present in this paper a novel, optimal 
semantic similarity approach based on 
word-to-word similarity metrics to solve 
the important task of assessing natural 
language student input in dialogue-based 
intelligent tutoring systems. The optimal 
matching is guaranteed using the sailor 
assignment problem, also known as the job 
assignment problem, a well-known 
combinatorial optimization problem. We 
compare the optimal matching method with 
a greedy method as well as with a baseline 
method on data sets from two intelligent 
tutoring systems, AutoTutor and iSTART.
