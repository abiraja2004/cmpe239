In this work, the problem of extracting phrase
translation is formulated as an information re-
trieval process implemented with a log-linear
model aiming for a balanced precision and re-
call. We present a generic phrase training al-
gorithm which is parameterized with feature
functions and can be optimized jointly with
the translation engine to directly maximize
the end-to-end system performance. Multiple
data-driven feature functions are proposed to
capture the quality and confidence of phrases
and phrase pairs. Experimental results demon-
strate consistent and significant improvement
over the widely used method that is based on
word alignment matrix only.
