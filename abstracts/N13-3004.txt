Anafora is a newly-developed open source
web-based text annotation tool built to be
lightweight, flexible, easy to use and capa-
ble of annotating with a variety of schemas,
simple and complex. Anafora allows se-
cure web-based annotation of any plaintext
file with both spanned (e.g. named entity or
markable) and relation annotations, as well
as adjudication for both types of annota-
tion. Anafora offers automatic set assignment
and progress-tracking, centralized and human-
editable XML annotation schemas, and file-
based storage and organization of data in a
human-readable single-file XML format.
