We describe an approach to text planning that uses
the XSLT template-processing engine to create log-
ical forms for an external surface realizer. Using a
realizer that can process logical forms with embed-
ded alternatives provides a substitute for backtrack-
ing in the text-planning process. This allows the text
planner to combine the strengths of the AI-planning
and template-based traditions in natural language
generation.
