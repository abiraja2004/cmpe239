 
This paper proposes a system of 97 verbal 
semantic attributes for Japanese verbs which 
considers both dynamic haracteristics and the 
relationship of verbs to cases. These attribute 
values are used to disambiguate he meanings of 
all Japanese and English pattern pairs in a 
Japanese to English transfer pattern dictionary 
consisting of 15,000 pairs of Japanese valence 
patterns and equivalent English syntactic 
structures.
