 
The present paper describes an approach to 
adapting a parser to a new language. 
Presumably the target language is much 
poorer in linguistic resources than the source 
language. The technique has been tested on 
two European languages due to test data 
availability; however, it is easily applicable 
to any pair of sufficiently related languages, 
including some of the Indic language group. 
Our adaptation technique using existing 
annotations in the source language achieves 
performance equivalent to that obtained by 
training on 1546 trees in the target language.
