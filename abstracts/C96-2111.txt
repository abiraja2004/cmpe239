 
Automatic ompilation of the linking relation 
employed in certain parsing algorithms for con- 
text-free languages is examined. Special pro- 
blems arise in the extension of these algorithms 
to the possibly infinite domain of feature struc- 
tures. A technique is proposed which is design- 
ed specifically for left-recursive categories and 
is based on the generalization ftheir occurren- 
ces in a derivation. Particular attention isdrawn 
to the top-down predictive character of the link- 
ing relation and to its significance not only as 
a filter for increasing the efficiency of syntactic 
analysis but as a device for the top-down in- 
stantiation of information, which then serves as 
a key to the directed analysis of inflected forms 
as well as "unknown" or "new" words.
