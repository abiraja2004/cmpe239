Modern unsupervised POS taggers usually
apply an optimization procedure to a non-
convex function, and tend to converge to
local maxima that are sensitive to start-
ing conditions. The quality of the tag-
ging induced by such algorithms is thus
highly variable, and researchers report av-
erage results over several random initial-
izations. Consequently, applications are
not guaranteed to use an induced tagging
of the quality reported for the algorithm.
In this paper we address this issue using
an unsupervised test for intrinsic cluster-
ing quality. We run a base tagger with
different random initializations, and select
the best tagging using the quality test. As
a base tagger, we modify a leading un-
supervised POS tagger (Clark, 2003) to
constrain the distributions of word types
across clusters to be Zipfian, allowing us
to utilize a perplexity-based quality test.
We show that the correlation between our
quality test and gold standard-based tag-
ging quality measures is high. Our re-
sults are better in most evaluation mea-
sures than all results reported in the liter-
ature for this task, and are always better
than the Clark average results.
