This paper describes our system for the task
of extracting frame semantic structures in
SemEval?2007. The system architecture
uses two types of learning models in each
part of the task: Support Vector Machines
(SVM) and Maximum Entropy (ME). De-
signed as a pipeline of classifiers, the seman-
tic parsing system obtained competitive pre-
cision scores on the test data.
