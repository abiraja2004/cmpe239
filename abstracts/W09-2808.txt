 
We propose a method of revising lead sentences in 
a news broadcast. Unlike many other methods pro-
posed so far, this method does not use the corefer-
ence relation of noun phrases (NPs) but rather, 
insertion and substitution of the phrases modifying 
the same head chunk in lead and other sentences. 
The method borrows an idea from the sentence 
fusion methods and is more general than those 
using NP coreferencing as ours includes them. We 
show in experiments the method was able to find 
semantically appropriate revisions thus demon-
strating its basic feasibility. We also show that that 
parsing errors mainly degraded the sentential com-
pleteness such as grammaticality and redundancy.
