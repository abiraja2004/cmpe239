This paper presents a series of efficient
dynamic-programming (DP) based algorithms
for phrase-based decoding and alignment
computation in statistical machine translation
(SMT). The DP-based decoding algorithms are
analyzed in terms of shortest path-finding al-
gorithms, where the similarity to DP-based
decoding algorithms in speech recognition is
demonstrated. The paper contains the follow-
ing original contributions: 1) the DP-based de-
coding algorithm in (Tillmann and Ney, 2003)
is extended in a formal way to handle phrases
and a novel pruning strategy with increased
translation speed is presented 2) a novel align-
ment algorithm is presented that computes a
phrase alignment efficiently in the case that it
is consistent with an underlying word align-
ment. Under certain restrictions, both algo-
rithms handle MT-related problems efficiently
that are generally NP complete (Knight, 1999).
