The second person pronoun you serves dif-
ferent functions in English. Each of these
different types often corresponds to a dif-
ferent term when translated into another
language. Correctly identifying different
types of you can be beneficial to machine
translation systems. To address this is-
sue, we investigate disambiguation of dif-
ferent types of you occurrences in multi-
party meetings with a new focus on the
role of hand gesture. Our empirical re-
sults have shown that incorporation of ges-
ture improves performance on differentiat-
ing between the generic use of you (e.g.,
refer to people in general) and the referen-
tial use of you (e.g., refer to a specific per-
son or a group of people). Incorporation
of gesture can also compensate for limi-
tations in automated language processing
(e.g., reliable recognition of dialogue acts)
and achieve comparable results.
