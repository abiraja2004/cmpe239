 
We are concerned with dependency- 
oriented morphosyntactic parsing of run- 
ning text. While a parsing grammar should 
avoid introducing structurally unresolvable 
distinctions in order to optimise on the ac- 
curacy of the parser, it also is beneficial 
for the grammarian to have as expressive a 
structural representation available as possi- 
ble. In a reductionistic parsing system this 
policy may result in considerable ambigu- 
ity in the input; however, even massive am- 
biguity can be tackled efficiently with an 
accurate parsing description and effective 
parsing technology.
