Currently there are several approaches to
machine translation (MT) based on differ-
ent paradigms; e.g., phrasal, hierarchical
and syntax-based. These three approaches
yield similar translation accuracy despite
using fairly different levels of linguistic
knowledge. The availability of such a
variety of systems has led to a growing
interest toward finding better translations
by combining outputs from multiple sys-
tems. This paper describes three differ-
ent approaches to MT system combina-
tion. These combination methods oper-
ate on sentence, phrase and word level
exploiting information from  -best lists,
system scores and target-to-source phrase
alignments. The word-level combination
provides the most robust gains but the
best results on the development test sets
(NIST MT05 and the newsgroup portion
of GALE 2006 dry-run) were achieved by
combining all three methods.
