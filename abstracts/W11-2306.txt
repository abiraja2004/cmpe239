This paper describes our work on improv-
ing access to the content of multimodal docu-
ments containing line graphs in popular media
for people with visual impairments. We pro-
vide an overview of our implemented system,
including our method for recognizing and con-
veying the intended message of a line graph.
The textual description of the graphic gener-
ated by our system is presented at the most rel-
evant point in the document. We also describe
ongoing work into obtaining additional propo-
sitions that elaborate on the intended message,
and examine the potential benefits of analyz-
ing the text and graphical content together in
order to extend our system to produce sum-
maries of entire multimodal documents.
