We present an overview of a compre-
hensive formal theory of the interpreta-
tion of sentential fragments, which has
as components an empirically validated
taxonomy, an analysis of the syntax and
compositional semantics of fragments,
and a formalisation of their contextual
interpretation. We also briefly describe
an implementation of this theory, and
quantify the potential practical use of
handling fragments in dialogue systems.
