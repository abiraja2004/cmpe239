The task of identifying the language of text
or utterances has a number of applications in
natural language processing. Language iden-
tification has traditionally been approached
with character-level language models. How-
ever, the language model approach crucially
depends on the length of the text in ques-
tion. In this paper, we consider the problem
of language identification of names. We show
that an approach based on SVMs with n-gram
counts as features performs much better than
language models. We also experiment with
applying the method to pre-process transliter-
ation data for the training of separate models.
