Traditional noun phrase coreference res-
olution systems represent features only
of pairs of noun phrases. In this paper,
we propose a machine learning method
that enables features over sets of noun
phrases, resulting in a first-order proba-
bilistic model for coreference. We out-
line a set of approximations that make this
approach practical, and apply our method
to the ACE coreference dataset, achiev-
ing a 45% error reduction over a com-
parable method that only considers fea-
tures of pairs of noun phrases. This result
demonstrates an example of how a first-
order logic representation can be incorpo-
rated into a probabilistic model and scaled
efficiently.
