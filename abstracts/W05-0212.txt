 
Native speakers of English who are good 
readers can ?sound out? words or names 
from printed text, even if they have never 
seen them before, although they may not 
be conscious of the strategies they use.  
No tools are available today that can con-
vey that knowledge to learners, showing 
them the rules that apply in English text.  
We have adapted the letter-to-phoneme 
component of a text-to-speech synthesizer 
to a web-based software system that can 
teach word decoding to non-native speak-
ers of English, English-speaking children, 
and adult learners.
