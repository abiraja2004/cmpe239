In this paper, we describe an empirical
study of Chinese chunking on a corpus,
which is extracted from UPENN Chinese
Treebank-4 (CTB4). First, we compare
the performance of the state-of-the-art ma-
chine learning models. Then we propose
two approaches in order to improve the
performance of Chinese chunking. 1) We
propose an approach to resolve the spe-
cial problems of Chinese chunking. This
approach extends the chunk tags for ev-
ery problem by a tag-extension function.
2) We propose two novel voting meth-
ods based on the characteristics of chunk-
ing task. Compared with traditional vot-
ing methods, the proposed voting methods
consider long distance information. The
experimental results show that the SVMs
model outperforms the other models and
that our proposed approaches can improve
performance significantly.
