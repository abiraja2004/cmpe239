This paper proposes a word spacing model using
a hidden Markov model (HMM) for rening Ko-
rean raw text corpora. Previous statistical ap-
proaches for automatic word spacing have used
models that make use of inaccurate probabilities
because they do not consider the previous spac-
ing state. We consider word spacing problem as
a classication problem such as Part-of-Speech
(POS) tagging and have experimented with var-
ious models considering extended context. Ex-
perimental result shows that the performance
of the model becomes better as the more con-
text considered. In case of the same number
of parameters are used with other method, it
is proved that our model is more eective by
showing the better results.
