 
Linguistic resources with domain-specific 
coverage are crucial for the development of 
concrete Natural Language Processing (NLP) 
systems. In this paper we give a global intro-
duction to the ongoing (since 2009) TermiNet 
project, whose aims are to instantiate a gener-
ic NLP methodology for the development of 
terminological wordnets and to apply the in-
stantiated methodology for building a termi-
nological wordnet in Brazilian Portuguese.
