 
An obstacle to research in automatic 
paraphrase identification and genera-
tion is the lack of large-scale, publicly-
available labeled corpora of sentential 
paraphrases. This paper describes the 
creation of the recently-released Micro-
soft Research Paraphrase Corpus, 
which contains 5801 sentence pairs, 
each hand-labeled with a binary judg-
ment as to whether the pair constitutes 
a paraphrase. The corpus was created 
using heuristic extraction techniques in 
conjunction with an SVM-based classi-
fier to select likely sentence-level para-
phrases from a large corpus of topic-
clustered news data. These pairs were 
then submitted to human judges, who 
confirmed that 67% were in fact se-
mantically equivalent. In addition to 
describing the corpus itself, we explore 
a number of issues that arose in defin-
ing guidelines for the human raters.
