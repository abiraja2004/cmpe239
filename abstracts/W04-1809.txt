This paper proposes a method to extract foreign
words, such as technical terms and proper nouns,
from Korean corpora and produce a Japanese-
Korean bilingual dictionary. Specific words have
been imported into multiple countries simultane-
ously, if they are influential across cultures. The
pronunciation of a source word is similar in different
languages. Our method extracts words in Korean
corpora that are phonetically similar to Katakana
words, which can easily be identified in Japanese cor-
pora. We also show the effectiveness of our method
by means of experiments.
