In this paper we present an unsupervised 
learning algorithm for incremental concept 
formation, based on an augmented version 
of COBWEB. The algorithm is applied to 
the task of acquiring a verb taxonomy 
through the systematic observation of verb 
usages in corpora. 
Using a Machine Learning methodology for 
a Natural language problem required 
adjustments on both sides. In fact, concept 
formation algorithms assume the input 
information as being stable, unambiguous 
and complete. At the opposite, linguistic 
data are ambiguous, incomplete, and 
possibly erroneous. 
A NL processor is used to extract semi- 
automatically from corpora the thematic 
roles of verbs and derive a feature-vector 
representation f verb instances. In order 
to account for multiple instances of the 
same verb, the measure of category utility, 
defined in COBWEB, has been augmented 
with the notion of memory inertia. Memory 
inertia models the influence that previously 
classified instances of a given verb have on 
the classification of subsequent instances of 
the same verb. Finally, a method is defined 
to identify the basic-level classes of an 
acquired hierarchy, i.e. those bringing the 
most predictive information about their 
members.
