WordNet is extensively used as a major lexical resource in NLP. However, its quality is far from
perfect, and this alters the results of applications using it. We propose here to complement previous
efforts for ?cleaning up? the top-level of its taxonomy with semi-automatic methods based on the
detection of errors at the lower levels. The methods we propose test the coherence of two sources of
knowledge, exploiting ontological principles and semantic constraints.
