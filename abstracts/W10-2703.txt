 I start from a perspective close to that of the EC COMPANIONS project, and set out its aim to model a new kind of human-computer relation-ship based on long-term interaction, with some tasks involved although a Companion should not be inherently task-based, since there need be no stopping point to its conversation. Some demon-stration of its functionality will be given but the main purpose here is an analysis of what it is people might want from such a relationship and what evidence we have for whatever we con-clude. Is politeness important? Is an attempt at emotional sympathy important or achievable? Does a user want a consistent personality in a Companion or a variety of personalities? Should we be talking more in terms of a "cognitive pros-thesis (or orthosis)?" ---something to extract, or-ganize, and locate the user's knowledge or per-sonal information---rather than attitudes? 1.
