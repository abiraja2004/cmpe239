String transformation, which maps a source
string s into its desirable form t?, is related
to various applications including stemming,
lemmatization, and spelling correction. The
essential and important step for string trans-
formation is to generate candidates to which
the given string s is likely to be transformed.
This paper presents a discriminative approach
for generating candidate strings. We use sub-
string substitution rules as features and score
them using an L1-regularized logistic regres-
sion model. We also propose a procedure to
generate negative instances that affect the de-
cision boundary of the model. The advantage
of this approach is that candidate strings can
be enumerated by an efficient algorithm be-
cause the processes of string transformation
are tractable in the model. We demonstrate
the remarkable performance of the proposed
method in normalizing inflected words and
spelling variations.
