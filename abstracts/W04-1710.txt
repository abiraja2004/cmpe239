This paper advocates the use of free and
easily accessible computer programs in
teaching. The motivating reasons for a par-
ticular program supporting the learning of
syntax are given, and a first version of the
program is presented and illustrated. Initial
evaluation results led to additional specifi-
cations and to the development of a new
version of the program that is introduced.
Finally, several perspectives for such a sup-
port tool are drawn.
