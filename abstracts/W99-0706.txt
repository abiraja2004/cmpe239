 
Grammatical relationships are an important level of 
natural language processing. We present a trainable 
approach to find these relationships through transfor- 
mation sequences and-error-driven learning. Our ap- 
proach finds grammatical relationships between core 
syntax groups and bypasses much of the parsing phase. 
On our training and test set, our procedure achieves 
63.6% recall and 77.3% precision (f-score = 69.8).
