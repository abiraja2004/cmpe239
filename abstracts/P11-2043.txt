In this paper, we address the problem of op-
timizing the style of textual content to make
it more suitable to being listened to by a user
as opposed to being read. We study the dif-
ferences between the written style and the au-
dio style by consulting the linguistics and jour-
nalism literatures. Guided by this study, we
suggest a number of linguistic features to dis-
tinguish between the two styles. We show
the correctness of our features and the impact
of style transformation on the user experience
through statistical analysis, a style classifica-
tion task, and a user study.
