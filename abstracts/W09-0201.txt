We propose an approach to corpus-based
semantics, inspired by cognitive science,
in which different semantic tasks are tack-
led using the same underlying reposi-
tory of distributional information, col-
lected once and for all from the source
corpus. Task-specific semantic spaces are
then built on demand from the repository.
A straightforward implementation of our
proposal achieves state-of-the-art perfor-
mance on a number of unrelated tasks.
