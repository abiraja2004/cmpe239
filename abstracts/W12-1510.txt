 
Linguist?s Assistant (LA) is a large scale se-
mantic analyzer and multi-lingual natural lan-
guage generator designed and developed 
entirely from a linguist?s perspective.  The 
system incorporates extensive typological, 
semantic, syntactic, and discourse research in-
to its semantic representational system and its 
transfer and synthesizing grammars.  LA has 
been tested with English, Korean, Kewa (Pa-
pua New Guinea), Jula (Cote d?Ivoure), and 
North Tanna (Vanuatu), and proof-of-concept 
lexicons and grammars have been developed 
for Spanish, Urdu, Tagalog, Chinantec (Mexi-
co), and Angas (Nigeria).  This paper will 
summarize the major components of the NLG 
system, and then present the results of exper-
iments that were performed to determine the 
quality of the generated texts.  The experi-
ments indicate that when experienced mother-
tongue translators use the drafts generated by 
LA, their productivity is typically quadrupled 
without any loss of quality.
