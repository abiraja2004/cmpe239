We describe TerrorCat, a submission to
this year?s metrics shared task. It is a ma-
chine learning-based metric that is trained
on manual ranking data from WMT shared
tasks 2008?2012. Input features are
generated by applying automatic transla-
tion error analysis to the translation hy-
potheses and calculating the error cate-
gory frequency differences. We addition-
ally experiment with adding quality es-
timation features in addition to the er-
ror analysis-based ones. When evaluated
against WMT?2012 rankings, the system-
level agreement is rather high for several
language pairs.
