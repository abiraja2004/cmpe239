, MULTEXT (Multilingual Text "Fools and 
Corpora) is the largest project funded in the Commission 
of European Communities Linguistic Research and 
Engineering Program. The project will contribute to the 
development of generally usable software tools to 
manipulate and analyse text corpora and to create multi- 
lingual text corpora with structural and linguistic 
markup. It will attempt o establish conventions for the 
encoding of such corpora, building on and contributing 
to the preliminary recommendations of the relevant 
international and European standardization i itiatives. 
MULTEXT will also work towards establishing a set of 
guidelines for text software development, which will be 
widely published in order to enable future development 
by others. All tools and data developed within the project 
will be made freely and publicly available. 
Keywords. multi-lingual corpora, text markup, text 
software, corpus annotation.
