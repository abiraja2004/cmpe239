This paper describes an incremental parser
and an unsupervised learning algorithm for
inducing this parser from plain text. The
parser uses a representation for syntactic
structure similar to dependency links which
is well-suited for incremental parsing. In
contrast to previous unsupervised parsers,
the parser does not use part-of-speech tags
and both learning and parsing are local
and fast, requiring no explicit clustering or
global optimization. The parser is evalu-
ated by converting its output into equivalent
bracketing and improves on previously pub-
lished results for unsupervised parsing from
plain text.
