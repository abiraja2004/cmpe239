 
This paper1 presents AutoLearn?s authoring 
tool: AutoTutor, a software solution that en-
ables teachers (content creators) to develop 
language learning activities including auto-
matic feedback generation without the need of 
being a programmer. The software has been 
designed and implemented on the basis of 
processing pipelines developed in previous 
work. A group of teachers has been trained to 
use the technology and the accompanying 
methodology, and has used materials created 
by them in their courses in real instruction set-
tings, which served as an initial evaluation. 
The paper is structured in four sections: Sec-
tion 1 introduces and contextualizes the re-
search work. Section 2 describes the solution, 
its architecture and its components, and spe-
cifically the way the NLP resources are cre-
ated automatically with teacher input. Section 
3 describes and analyses a case study using 
the tool to create and test a language learning 
activity. Finally Section 4 concludes with re-
marks on the work done and connections to 
related work, and with future work.
