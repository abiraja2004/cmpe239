Machine translation (MT) draws from several
different disciplines, making it a complex sub-
ject to teach. There are excellent pedagogical
texts, but problems in MT and current algo-
rithms for solving them are best learned by
doing. As a centerpiece of our MT course,
we devised a series of open-ended challenges
for students in which the goal was to im-
prove performance on carefully constrained
instances of four key MT tasks: alignment,
decoding, evaluation, and reranking. Students
brought a diverse set of techniques to the prob-
lems, including some novel solutions which
performed remarkably well. A surprising and
exciting outcome was that student solutions
or their combinations fared competitively on
some tasks, demonstrating that even newcom-
ers to the field can help improve the state-of-
the-art on hard NLP problems while simulta-
neously learning a great deal. The problems,
baseline code, and results are freely available.
