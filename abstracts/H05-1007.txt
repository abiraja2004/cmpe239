 
Browsing through large volumes of spoken 
audio is known to be a challenging task for 
end users. One way to alleviate this prob-
lem is to allow users to gist a spoken audio 
document by glancing over a transcript 
generated through Automatic Speech Rec-
ognition. Unfortunately, such transcripts 
typically contain many recognition errors 
which are highly distracting and make gist-
ing more difficult. In this paper we present 
an approach that detects recognition errors 
by identifying words which are semantic 
outliers with respect to other words in the 
transcript. We describe several variants of 
this approach. We investigate a wide range 
of evaluation measures and we show that 
we can significantly reduce the number of 
errors in content words, with the trade-off 
of losing some good content words.
