 
This paper explores joint syntactic and seman-
tic parsing of Chinese to further improve the 
performance of both syntactic and semantic 
parsing, in particular the performance of se-
mantic parsing (in this paper, semantic role 
labeling). This is done from two levels. Firstly, 
an integrated parsing approach is proposed to 
integrate semantic parsing into the syntactic 
parsing process. Secondly, semantic informa-
tion generated by semantic parsing is incorpo-
rated into the syntactic parsing model to better 
capture semantic information in syntactic 
parsing. Evaluation on Chinese TreeBank, 
Chinese PropBank, and Chinese NomBank 
shows that our integrated parsing approach 
outperforms the pipeline parsing approach on 
n-best parse trees, a natural extension of the 
widely used pipeline parsing approach on the 
top-best parse tree. Moreover, it shows that 
incorporating semantic role-related informa-
tion into the syntactic parsing model signifi-
cantly improves the performance of both syn-
tactic parsing and semantic parsing. To our 
best knowledge, this is the first research on 
exploring syntactic parsing and semantic role 
labeling for both verbal and nominal predi-
cates in an integrated way.
