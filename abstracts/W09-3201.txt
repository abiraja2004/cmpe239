We present ongoing work in a scalable,
distributed implementation of over 200
million individual language models, each
capturing a single user?s dialect in a given
language (multilingual users have several
models). These have a variety of prac-
tical applications, ranging from spam de-
tection to speech recognition, and dialec-
tometrical methods on the social graph.
Users should be able to view any content
in their language (even if it is spoken by
a small population), and to browse our site
with appropriately translated interface (au-
tomatically generated, for locales with lit-
tle crowd-sourced community effort).
