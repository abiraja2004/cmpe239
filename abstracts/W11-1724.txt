This paper presents two instance-level transfer
learning based algorithms for cross lingual
opinion analysis by transferring useful
translated opinion examples from other
languages as the supplementary training
data for improving the opinion classifier in
target language. Starting from the union of
small training data in target language and
large translated examples in other languages,
the Transfer AdaBoost algorithm is applied
to iteratively reduce the influence of low
quality translated examples. Alternatively,
starting only from the training data in target
language, the Transfer Self-training algorithm
is designed to iteratively select high quality
translated examples to enrich the training
data set. These two algorithms are applied to
sentence- and document-level cross lingual
opinion analysis tasks, respectively. The
evaluations show that these algorithms
effectively improve the opinion analysis by
exploiting small target language training data
and large cross lingual training data.
