 
We apply a PARADISE-style evaluation to a 
human-human dialogue corpus that was  col-
lected to support the design of a spoken dialo-
gue system for library transactions.  The book 
request dialogue task we investigate is infor-
mational in nature: a book request is consi-
dered successful if the librarian is able to 
identify a specific book for the patron. 
PARADISE assumes that user satisfaction can 
be modeled as a regression over task success 
and dialogue costs.  The PARADISE model 
we derive includes features that characterize 
two types of qualitative features. The first has 
to do with the specificity of the communica-
tive goals, given a request for an item.  The 
second has to do with the number and location 
of overlapping turns, which can sometimes 
signal rapport between the speakers.
