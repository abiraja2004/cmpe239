In this paper we present a profile of verb us-
age across ages in child-produced sentences
in English and Portuguese. We examine
in particular lexical and syntactic character-
istics of verbs and find common trends in
these languages as children?s ages increase,
such as the prominence of general and poly-
semic verbs, as well as divergences such as
the proportion of subject dropping. We also
find a correlation between the age of acqui-
sition and the number of complements of a
verb for English.
