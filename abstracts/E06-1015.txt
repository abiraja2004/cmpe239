In recent years tree kernels have been pro-
posed for the automatic learning of natural
language applications. Unfortunately, they
show (a) an inherent super linear complex-
ity and (b) a lower accuracy than tradi-
tional attribute/value methods.
In this paper, we show that tree kernels
are very helpful in the processing of nat-
ural language as (a) we provide a simple
algorithm to compute tree kernels in linear
average running time and (b) our study on
the classification properties of diverse tree
kernels show that kernel combinations al-
ways improve the traditional methods. Ex-
periments with Support Vector Machines
on the predicate argument classification
task provide empirical support to our the-
sis.
