Multiple sequence alignment techniques
have recently gained popularity in the Nat-
ural Language community, especially for
tasks such as machine translation, text
generation, and paraphrase identification.
Prior work falls into two categories, de-
pending on the type of input used: (a)
parallel corpora (e.g., multiple translations
of the same text) or (b) comparable texts
(non-parallel but on the same topic). So
far, only techniques based on parallel texts
have successfully used syntactic informa-
tion to guide alignments. In this paper,
we describe an algorithm for incorporat-
ing syntactic features in the alignment pro-
cess for non-parallel texts with the goal of
generating novel paraphrases of existing
texts. Our method uses dynamic program-
ming with alignment decision based on
the local syntactic similarity between two
sentences. Our results show that syntac-
tic alignment outrivals syntax-free meth-
ods by 20% in both grammaticality and fi-
delity when computed over the novel sen-
tences generated by alignment-induced fi-
nite state automata.
