We study the global topology of the syn-
tactic and semantic distributional similar-
ity networks for English through the tech-
nique of spectral analysis. We observe that
while the syntactic network has a hierar-
chical structure with strong communities
and their mixtures, the semantic network
has several tightly knit communities along
with a large core without any such well-
defined community structure.
