This paper describes the University of Syd-
ney?s WSD and Lexical Substitution sys-
tems for SemEval-2007. These systems are
principally based on evaluating the substi-
tutability of potential synonyms in the con-
text of the target word. Substitutability is
measured using Pointwise Mutual Informa-
tion as obtained from the Web1T corpus.
The WSD systems are supervised, while
the Lexical Substitution system is unsuper-
vised. The lexical sample sub-task also used
syntactic category information given from a
CCG-based parse to assist in verb disam-
biguation, while both WSD tasks also make
use of more traditional features.
These related systems participated in the
Coarse-Grained English All-Words WSD
task (task 7), the Lexical Substitution Task
(task 10) and the English Lexical Sample
WSD sub-task (task 17).
