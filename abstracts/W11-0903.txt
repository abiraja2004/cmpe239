 
Many recent studies have been dedicated to the 
extraction of semantic connections between 
words. Using such information at semantic 
level is likely to improve the performance of 
Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems, 
such as text categorization, question answering, 
information extraction, etc. The scarcity of such 
resources in Turkish, obstructs new 
improvements. There are many examples of 
semantic networks for English and other 
widely-used languages to lead the way for 
studies in Turkish. In this study, developing a 
semantic network for Turkish is aimed by using 
structural and string patterns in a dictionary. 
The results are promising, so that 
approximately two relations can be extracted 
from 3 definitions. The overall accuracy is 86% 
if we consider the correct sense assignment, 
94% without considering word sense 
disambiguation.
