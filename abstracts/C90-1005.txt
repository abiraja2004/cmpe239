 
Recent work in text analysis has suggested 
that data on words that frequently occur to- 
gether reveal important information about 
text content. Co-occurrence relations can 
serve two main purposes in language pro- 
cessing. First, the statistics of co-occurrence 
have been shown to produce accurate results 
in syntactic analysis. Second, the way that 
words appear together can help in assign- 
ing thematic roles in semantic interpreta- 
tion. This paper discusses a method for col- 
lecting co-occurrence data, ~quir ing lexical 
relations from the data, and applying these 
relations to semantic analysis.
