 
In this paper, we review Dale's \[1989\] algorithm 
for determining the content of a referring expres- 
sion. The algorithm, which only permits the use 
of one-place predicates, is revised and extended 
to deal with n-ary predicates. We investigate the 
problem of blocking 'recursion' in complex noun 
phrases and propose a solution in the context of 
our algorithm.
