Systems that interact with the user via natural
language are in their infancy. As these systems
mature and become more complex, it would be
desirable for a system developer if there were
an automatic method for creating natural lan-
guage generation components that can produce
quality output efficiently. We conduct experi-
ments that show that this goal appears to be
realizable. In particular we discuss a natural
language generation system that is composed of
SPoT, a trainable sentence planner, and FER-
GUS, a stochastic surface realizer. We show
how these stochastic NLG components can be
made to work together, that they can be ported
to new domains with apparent ease, and that
such NLG components can be integrated in a
real-time dialog system.
