Standard approaches to Chinese word seg-
mentation treat the problem as a tagging
task, assigning labels to the characters in
the sequence indicating whether the char-
acter marks a word boundary. Discrimina-
tively trained models based on local char-
acter features are used to make the tagging
decisions, with Viterbi decoding finding the
highest scoring segmentation. In this paper
we propose an alternative, word-based seg-
mentor, which uses features based on com-
plete words and word sequences. The gener-
alized perceptron algorithm is used for dis-
criminative training, and we use a beam-
search decoder. Closed tests on the first and
second SIGHAN bakeoffs show that our sys-
tem is competitive with the best in the litera-
ture, achieving the highest reported F-scores
for a number of corpora.
