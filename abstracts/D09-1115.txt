Current system combination methods usu-
ally use confusion networks to find consensus
translations among different systems. Requir-
ing one-to-one mappings between the words
in candidate translations, confusion networks
have difficulty in handling more general situa-
tions in which several words are connected to
another several words. Instead, we propose a
lattice-based system combination model that
allows for such phrase alignments and uses
lattices to encode all candidate translations.
Experiments show that our approach achieves
significant improvements over the state-of-
the-art baseline system on Chinese-to-English
translation test sets.
