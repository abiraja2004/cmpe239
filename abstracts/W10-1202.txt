In this paper, we propose a multiword-
enhanced author topic model that clusters au-
thors with similar interests and expertise, and
apply it to an information retrieval system that
returns a ranked list of authors related to a key-
word. For example, we can retrieve Eugene
Charniak via search for statistical parsing.
The existing works on author topic model-
ing assume a ?bag-of-words? representation.
However, many semantic atomic concepts are
represented by multiwords in text documents.
This paper presents a pre-computation step as
a way to discover these multiwords in the cor-
pus automatically and tags them in the term-
document matrix. The key advantage of this
method is that it retains the simplicity and
the computational efficiency of the unigram
model. In addition to a qualitative evaluation,
we evaluate the results by using the topic mod-
els as a component in a search engine. We ex-
hibit improved retrieval scores when the docu-
ments are represented via sets of latent topics
and authors.
