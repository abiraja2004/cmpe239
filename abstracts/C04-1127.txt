In this paper, we discuss the performance of cross-
lingual information extraction systems employing
an automatic pattern acquisition module. This mod-
ule, which creates extraction patterns starting from
a user?s narrative task description, allows rapid cus-
tomization to new extraction tasks. We compare two
approaches: (1) acquiring patterns in the source lan-
guage, performing source language extraction, and
then translating the resulting templates to the tar-
get language, and (2) translating the texts and per-
forming pattern discovery and extraction in the tar-
get language. We demonstrate an average of 8-10%
more recall using the first approach. We discuss
some of the problems with machine translation and
their effect on pattern discovery which lead to this
difference in performance.
