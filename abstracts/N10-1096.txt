In a corpus of expert tutoring dialogue, con-
versation that is considered to be ?off topic? 
(non-pedagogical) according to a previous 
coding scheme is explored for its value in tu-
toring dynamics. Using the Linguistic Inquiry 
and Word Count (LIWC) tool, phases of tutor-
ing categorized as ?off topic? were compared 
with interactive problem solving phases to ex-
plore how the two differ on the emotional, 
psychological, and topical dimensions ana-
lyzed by LIWC. The results suggest that con-
versation classified as ?off topic? serves as 
motivation and broad pedagogy in tutoring. 
These findings can be used to orient future re-
search on ?off topic? conversation, and help to 
make sense of both previous coding schemes 
and noisy data sets.
