 
Sentence retrieval plays a very important 
role in question answering system. In this 
paper, we present a novel cluster-based 
language model for sentence retrieval in 
Chinese question answering which is mo-
tivated in part by sentence clustering and 
language model. Sentence clustering is 
used to group sentences into clusters. 
Language model is used to properly rep-
resent sentences, which is combined with 
sentences model, cluster/topic model and 
collection model. For sentence clustering, 
we propose two approaches that are One-
Sentence-Multi-Topics and One-
Sentence-One-Topic respectively. From 
the experimental results on 807 Chinese 
testing questions, we can conclude that 
the proposed cluster-based language 
model outperforms over the standard lan-
guage model for sentence retrieval in 
Chinese question answering.
