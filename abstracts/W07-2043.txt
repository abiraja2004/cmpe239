 
This paper presents an Extended WordNet 
based word sense disambiguation system 
using a major modification to the Lesk al-
gorithm. The algorithm tries to disambigu-
ate nouns, verbs and adjectives. The algo-
rithm relies on the POS-sense tagged syn-
set glosses provided by the Extended 
WordNet. The basic unit of disambiguation 
of our algorithm is the entire sentence un-
der consideration. It takes a global ap-
proach where all the words in the target 
sentence are simultaneously disambigu-
ated. The context includes previous and 
next sentence. The system assigns the de-
fault WordNet first sense to a word when 
the algorithm fails to predict the sense of 
the word. The system produces a precision 
and recall of .402 on the SemEval-2007 
English All-Words test data.
