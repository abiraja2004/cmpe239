It would be useful to enable dialogue
agents to project, through linguistic
means, their individuality or personality.
Equally, each member of a pair of agents
ought to adjust its language (to a greater or
lesser extent) to match that of its interlocu-
tor. We describe CRAG, which generates
dialogues between pairs of agents, who are
linguistically distinguishable, but able to
align. CRAG-2 makes use of OPENCCG
and an over-generation and ranking ap-
proach, guided by a set of language mod-
els covering both personality and align-
ment. We illustrate with examples of out-
put, and briefly note results from user stud-
ies with the earlier CRAG-1, indicating
how CRAG-2 will be further evaluated.
Related work is discussed, along with cur-
rent limitations and future directions.
