We explore the intersection of rule-based and sta-
tistical approaches in machine translation, with a
particular focus on past and current work here at
Microsoft Research. Until about ten years ago,
the only machine translation systems worth using
were rule-based and linguistically-informed. Along
came statistical approaches, which use large cor-
pora to directly guide translations toward expres-
sions people would actually say. Rather than mak-
ing local decisions when writing and conditioning
rules, goodness of translation was modeled numer-
ically and free parameters were selected to opti-
mize that goodness. This led to huge improvements
in translation quality as more and more data was
consumed. By necessity, the pendulum is swing-
ing towards the inclusion of linguistic features in
MT systems. We describe some of our statistical
and non-statistical attempts to incorporate linguis-
tic insights into machine translation systems, show-
ing what is currently working well, and what isn?t.
We also look at trade-offs in using linguistic knowl-
edge (?rules?) in pre- or post-processing by lan-
guage pair, with a particular eye on the return on
investment as training data increases in size.
