Recent TREC results have demonstrated the
need for deeper text understanding methods.
This paper introduces the idea of automated
reasoning applied to question answering and
shows the feasibility of integrating a logic
prover into a Question Answering system. The
approach is to transform questions and answer
passages into logic representations. World
knowledge axioms as well as linguistic ax-
ioms are supplied to the prover which renders
a deep understanding of the relationship be-
tween question text and answer text. Moreover,
the trace of the proofs provide answer justifica-
tions. The results show that the prover boosts
the performance of the QA system on TREC
questions by 30%.
