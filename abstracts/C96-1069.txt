 
In this paper, we propose a statistical 
approach for clustering of artMes us- 
ing on-line dictionary definitions. One 
of the characteristics of our approach is 
that every sense of word in artMes is au- 
tomatically disambiguated using dictio- 
nary definitions. The other is that in or- 
der to cope with the problem of a phrasal 
lexicon, linking which links words with 
their semantically similar words in arti- 
cles is introduced in our method. The 
results of experiments demonstrate the 
effectiveness of the proposed method.
