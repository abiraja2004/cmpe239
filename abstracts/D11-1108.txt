Previous work has shown that high quality
phrasal paraphrases can be extracted from
bilingual parallel corpora. However, it is not
clear whether bitexts are an appropriate re-
source for extracting more sophisticated sen-
tential paraphrases, which are more obviously
learnable from monolingual parallel corpora.
We extend bilingual paraphrase extraction to
syntactic paraphrases and demonstrate its abil-
ity to learn a variety of general paraphrastic
transformations, including passivization, da-
tive shift, and topicalization. We discuss how
our model can be adapted to many text gener-
ation tasks by augmenting its feature set, de-
velopment data, and parameter estimation rou-
tine. We illustrate this adaptation by using
our paraphrase model for the task of sentence
compression and achieve results competitive
with state-of-the-art compression systems.
