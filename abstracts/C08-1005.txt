The state-of-the-art system combination
method for machine translation (MT) is
the word-based combination using confu-
sion networks. One of the crucial steps in
confusion network decoding is the align-
ment of different hypotheses to each other
when building a network. In this paper, we
present new methods to improve alignment
of hypotheses using word synonyms and a
two-pass alignment strategy. We demon-
strate that combination with the new align-
ment technique yields up to 2.9 BLEU
point improvement over the best input sys-
tem and up to 1.3 BLEU point improve-
ment over a state-of-the-art combination
method on two different language pairs.
