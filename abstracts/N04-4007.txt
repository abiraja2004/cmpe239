In this paper we present recent advances in 
acoustic and language modeling that improve 
recognition performance when children read 
out loud within digital books. First we extend 
previous work by incorporating cross-
utterance word history information and dy-
namic n-gram language modeling. By addi-
tionally incorporating Vocal Tract Length 
Normalization (VTLN), Speaker-Adaptive 
Training (SAT) and iterative unsupervised 
structural maximum a posteriori linear regres-
sion (SMAPLR) adaptation we demonstrate a 
54% reduction in word error rate.  Next, we 
show how data from children?s read-aloud 
sessions can be utilized to improve accuracy 
in a spontaneous story summarization task.  
An error reduction of 15% over previous pub-
lished results is shown.  Finally we describe a 
novel real-time implementation of our re-
search system that incorporates time-adaptive 
acoustic and language modeling.
