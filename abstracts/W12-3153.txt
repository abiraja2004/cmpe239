Microblogging services such as Twitter have
become popular media for real-time user-
created news reporting. Such communica-
tion often happens in parallel in different lan-
guages, e.g., microblog posts related to the
same events of the Arab spring were written
in Arabic and in English. The goal of this
paper is to exploit this parallelism in order
to eliminate the main bottleneck in automatic
Twitter translation, namely the lack of bilin-
gual sentence pairs for training SMT systems.
We show that translation-based cross-lingual
information retrieval can retrieve microblog
messages across languages that are similar
enough to be used to train a standard phrase-
based SMT pipeline. Our method outper-
forms other approaches to domain adaptation
for SMT such as language model adaptation,
meta-parameter tuning, or self-translation.
