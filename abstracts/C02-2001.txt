 
This paper presents an ongoing task that will 
construct a DAML+OIL-compliant Chinese 
Lexical Ontology. The ontology mainly 
comprises three components: a hierarchical 
taxonomy consisting of a set of concepts and 
a set of relations describing the relationships 
among the concepts, a set of lexical entries 
associated with the concepts and relations, 
and a set of axioms describing the 
constraints on the ontology. It currently 
contains 1,075 concepts, 65,961 lexical 
entries associated with the concepts, 299 
relations among the concepts excluding the 
hypernym and hyponym relations, 27,004 
relations between the lexical entries and the 
concepts, and 79,723 relations associating 
the lexical entries with the concepts.
