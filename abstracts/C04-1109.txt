 
Most traditional information extraction 
approaches are generative models that assume 
events exist in text in certain patterns and these 
patterns can be regenerated in various ways. 
These assumptions limited the syntactic clues 
being considered for finding an event and 
confined these approaches to a particular 
syntactic level. This paper presents a 
discriminative framework based on kernel SVMs 
that takes into account different levels of 
syntactic information and automatically 
identifies the appropriate clues. Kernels are used 
to represent certain levels of syntactic structure 
and can be combined in principled ways as input 
for an SVM. We will show that by combining a 
low level sequence kernel with a high level 
kernel on a GLARF dependency graph, the new 
approach outperformed a good rule-based 
system on slot filler detection for MUC-6.
