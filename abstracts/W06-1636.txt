In this work we learn clusters of contex-
tual annotations for non-terminals in the
Penn Treebank. Perhaps the best way
to think about this problem is to contrast
our work with that of Klein and Man-
ning (2003). That research used tree-
transformations to create various gram-
mars with different contextual annotations
on the non-terminals. These grammars
were then used in conjunction with a CKY
parser. The authors explored the space
of different annotation combinations by
hand. Here we try to automate the process
? to learn the ?right? combination auto-
matically. Our results are not quite as good
as those carefully created by hand, but they
are close (84.8 vs 85.7).
