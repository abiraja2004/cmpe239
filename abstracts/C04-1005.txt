 
The main problems of statistical word alignment 
lie in the facts that source words can only be 
aligned to one target word, and that the inappro-
priate target word is selected because of data 
sparseness problem. This paper proposes an ap-
proach to improve statistical word alignment 
with a rule-based translation system. This ap-
proach first uses IBM statistical translation 
model to perform alignment in both directions 
(source to target and target to source), and then 
uses the translation information in the rule-based 
machine translation system to improve the statis-
tical word alignment. The improved alignments 
allow the word(s) in the source language to be 
aligned to one or more words in the target lan-
guage. Experimental results show a significant 
improvement in precision and recall of word 
alignment.
