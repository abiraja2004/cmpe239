We provide a systematic study of previously
proposed features for implicit discourse re-
lation identification, identifying new feature
combinations that optimize F1-score. The re-
sulting classifiers achieve the best F1-scores
to date for the four top-level discourse rela-
tion classes of the Penn Discourse Tree Bank:
COMPARISON, CONTINGENCY, EXPAN-
SION, and TEMPORAL. We further identify
factors for feature extraction that can have a
major impact on performance and determine
that some features originally proposed for the
task no longer provide performance gains in
light of more powerful, recently discovered
features. Our results constitute a new set of
baselines for future studies of implicit dis-
course relation identification.
