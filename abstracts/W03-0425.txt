This paper presents a classifier-combination
experimental framework for named entity
recognition in which four diverse classi-
fiers (robust linear classifier, maximum en-
tropy, transformation-based learning, and hid-
den Markov model) are combined under differ-
ent conditions. When no gazetteer or other ad-
ditional training resources are used, the com-
bined system attains a performance of 91.6F
on the English development data; integrat-
ing name, location and person gazetteers, and
named entity systems trained on additional,
more general, data reduces the F-measure error
by a factor of 15 to 21% on the English data.
