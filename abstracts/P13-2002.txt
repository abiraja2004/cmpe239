The notion of fertility in word alignment
(the number of words emitted by a sin-
gle state) is useful but difficult to model.
Initial attempts at modeling fertility used
heuristic search methods. Recent ap-
proaches instead use more principled ap-
proximate inference techniques such as
Gibbs sampling for parameter estimation.
Yet in practice we also need the single best
alignment, which is difficult to find us-
ing Gibbs. Building on recent advances in
dual decomposition, this paper introduces
an exact algorithm for finding the sin-
gle best alignment with a fertility HMM.
Finding the best alignment appears impor-
tant, as this model leads to a substantial
improvement in alignment quality.
