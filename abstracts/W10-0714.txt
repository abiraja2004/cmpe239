 
This paper presents findings on using 
crowdsourcing via Amazon Mechanical 
Turk (MTurk) to obtain Arabic nicknames 
as a contribution to exiting Named Entity 
(NE) lexicons.   It demonstrates a strategy 
for increasing MTurk participation from 
Arab countries.  The researchers validate 
the nicknames using experts, MTurk 
workers, and Google search and then 
compare them against the Database of 
Arabic Names (DAN).  Additionally, the 
experiment looks at the effect of pay rate 
on speed of nickname collection and doc-
uments an advertising effect where 
MTurk workers respond to existing work 
batches, called Human Intelligence Tasks 
(HITs), more quickly once similar higher 
paying HITs are posted.
