Matching coreferent named entities with-
out prior knowledge requires good similar-
ity measures. Soft-TFIDF is a fine-grained
measure which performs well in this task.
We propose to enhance this kind of met-
rics, through a generic model in which
measures may be mixed, and show experi-
mentally the relevance of this approach.
