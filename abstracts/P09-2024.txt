One of the basic problems of efficiently
generating information-seeking dialogue
in interactive question answering is to find
the topic of an information-seeking ques-
tion with respect to the answer documents.
In this paper we propose an approach to
solving this problem using concept clus-
ters. Our empirical results on TREC col-
lections and our ambiguous question col-
lection shows that this approach can be
successfully employed to handle ambigu-
ous and list questions.
