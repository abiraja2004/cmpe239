The languages that are most commonly
subject to linguistic annotation on a large
scale tend to be those with the largest pop-
ulations or with recent histories of lin-
guistic scholarship. In this paper we dis-
cuss the problems associated with lower-
density languages in the context of the de-
velopment of linguistically annotated re-
sources. We frame our work with three
key questions regarding the definition of
lower-density languages; increasing avail-
able resources and reducing data require-
ments. A number of steps forward are
identified for increasing the number lower-
density language corpora with linguistic
annotations.
