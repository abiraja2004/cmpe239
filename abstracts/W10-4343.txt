We build a model for speech disfluency
detection based on conditional random
fields (CRFs) using the Switchboard cor-
pus. This model is then applied to a
new domain without any adaptation. We
show that a technique for detecting speech
disfluencies based on Integer Linear Pro-
gramming (ILP) (Georgila, 2009) signifi-
cantly outperforms CRFs. In particular, in
terms of F-score and NIST Error Rate the
absolute improvement of ILP over CRFs
exceeds 20% and 25% respectively. We
conclude that ILP is an approach with
great potential for speech disfluency detec-
tion when there is a lack or shortage of in-
domain data for training.
