This paper introduces an attribute selection
task as a way to characterize the inherent mea-
ning of property-denoting adjectives in adjec-
tive-noun phrases, such as e.g. hot in hot sum-
mer denoting the attribute TEMPERATURE,
rather than TASTE. We formulate this task
in a vector space model that represents adjec-
tives and nouns as vectors in a semantic space
defined over possible attributes. The vectors
incorporate latent semantic information ob-
tained from two variants of LDA topic mod-
els. Our LDA models outperform previous ap-
proaches on a small set of 10 attributes with
considerable gains on sparse representations,
which highlights the strong smoothing power
of LDA models. For the first time, we extend
the attribute selection task to a new data set
with more than 200 classes. We observe that
large-scale attribute selection is a hard prob-
lem, but a subset of attributes performs ro-
bustly on the large scale as well. Again, the
LDA models outperform the VSM baseline.
