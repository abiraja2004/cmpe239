Mapping documents into an interlingual rep-
resentation can help bridge the language bar-
rier of a cross-lingual corpus. Previous ap-
proaches use aligned documents as training
data to learn an interlingual representation,
making them sensitive to the domain of the
training data. In this paper, we learn an in-
terlingual representation in an unsupervised
manner using only a bilingual dictionary. We
first use the bilingual dictionary to find candi-
date document alignments and then use them
to find an interlingual representation. Since
the candidate alignments are noisy, we de-
velop a robust learning algorithm to learn
the interlingual representation. We show that
bilingual dictionaries generalize to different
domains better: our approach gives better per-
formance than either a word by word transla-
tion method or Canonical Correlation Analy-
sis (CCA) trained on a different domain.
