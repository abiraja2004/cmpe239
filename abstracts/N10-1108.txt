This paper addresses the problem of learning
phrase patterns for unsupervised speaker role
classification. Phrase patterns are automati-
cally extracted from large corpora, and redun-
dant patterns are removed via a graph prun-
ing algorithm. In experiments on English and
Mandarin talk shows, the use of phrase pat-
terns results in an increase of role classifi-
cation accuracy over n-gram lexical features,
and more compact phrase pattern lists are ob-
tained due to the redundancy removal.
