 
Both greedy and domain-oriented REG algo-
rithms have significant strengths but tend to 
perform poorly according to humanlikeness 
criteria as measured by, e.g., Dice scores. In 
this work we describe an attempt to combine 
both perspectives into a single attribute selec-
tion strategy to be used as part of the Dale & 
Reiter Incremental algorithm in the REG 
Challenge 2008, and the results in both Furni-
ture and People domains.
