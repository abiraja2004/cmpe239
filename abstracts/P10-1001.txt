We present algorithms for higher-order de-
pendency parsing that are ?third-order?
in the sense that they can evaluate sub-
structures containing three dependencies,
and ?efficient? in the sense that they re-
quire only O(n4) time. Importantly, our
new parsers can utilize both sibling-style
and grandchild-style interactions. We
evaluate our parsers on the Penn Tree-
bank and Prague Dependency Treebank,
achieving unlabeled attachment scores of
93.04% and 87.38%, respectively.
