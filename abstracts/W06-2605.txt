We report on our work to build a dis-
course parser (SemDP) that uses seman-
tic features of sentences. We use an In-
ductive Logic Programming (ILP) System
to exploit rich verb semantics of clauses
to induce rules for discourse parsing. We
demonstrate that ILP can be used to learn
from highly structured natural language
data and that the performance of a dis-
course parsing model that only uses se-
mantic information is comparable to that
of the state of the art syntactic discourse
parsers.
