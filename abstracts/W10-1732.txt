We describe our experiments with hier-
archical phrase-based machine translation
for WMT 2010 Shared Task. We provide
a detailed description of our configuration
and data so the results are replicable. For
English-to-Czech translation, we experi-
ment with several datasets of various sizes
and with various preprocessing sequences.
For the other 7 translation directions, we
just present the baseline results.
