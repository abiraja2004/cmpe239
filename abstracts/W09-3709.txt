In this paper, we propose a conceptual and operational model for
procedural texts, within Action theory. We propose some elements to
model the complexity and expliciteness of instructions, showing, how,
for a given execution of the procedure, the success of the goal can be
measured. Next, we show how a procedure can be enriched via textual
integration in order to improve the success rate of the goal.
