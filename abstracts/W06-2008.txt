This paper presents the first step to project
POS tags and dependencies from English
and French to Polish in aligned corpora.
Both the English and French parts of the
corpus are analysed with a POS tagger
and a robust parser. The English/Polish
bi-text and the French/Polish bi-text are
then aligned at the word level with the
GIZA++ package. The intersection of
IBM-4 Viterbi alignments for both trans-
lation directions is used to project the an-
notations from English and French to Pol-
ish. The results show that the precision
of direct projection vary according to the
type of induced annotations as well as the
source language. Moreover, the perfor-
mances are likely to be improved by defin-
ing regular conversion rules among POS
tags and dependencies.
