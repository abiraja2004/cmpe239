aspects of Arabic verb morphology. Some of 
them used patterns; others used patterns and 
affixes. But very few have discussed Arabic 
noun morphology particularly for nouns that 
are not derived from verbs. In this paper we 
describe a learning system that can analyze 
Arabic nouns to produce their 
morphological information and their 
paradigms with respect to both gender and 
number using a rule base that uses suffix 
analysis as well as pattern analysis. The 
system utilizes user-feedback to classify the 
noun and identify the group that it belongs 
to.
