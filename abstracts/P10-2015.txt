This paper introduces mNCD, a method
for automatic evaluation of machine trans-
lations. The measure is based on nor-
malized compression distance (NCD), a
general information theoretic measure of
string similarity, and flexible word match-
ing provided by stemming and synonyms.
The mNCD measure outperforms NCD in
system-level correlation to human judg-
ments in English.
