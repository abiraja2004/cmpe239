The English ?s possessive construction oc-
curs frequently in text and can encode
several different semantic relations; how-
ever, it has received limited attention from
the computational linguistics community.
This paper describes the creation of a se-
mantic relation inventory covering the use
of ?s, an inter-annotator agreement study
to calculate how well humans can agree
on the relations, a large collection of pos-
sessives annotated according to the rela-
tions, and an accurate automatic annota-
tion system for labeling new examples.
Our 21,938 example dataset is by far the
largest annotated possessives dataset we
are aware of, and both our automatic clas-
sification system, which achieves 87.4%
accuracy in our classification experiment,
and our annotation data are publicly avail-
able.
