The NLP systems often have low perfor-
mances because they rely on unreliable
and heterogeneous knowledge. We show
on the task of non-anaphoric it identifi-
cation how to overcome these handicaps
with the Bayesian Network (BN) formal-
ism. The first results are very encourag-
ing compared with the state-of-the-art sys-
tems.
