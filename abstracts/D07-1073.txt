We explore the use of Wikipedia as external
knowledge to improve named entity recog-
nition (NER). Our method retrieves the cor-
responding Wikipedia entry for each can-
didate word sequence and extracts a cate-
gory label from the first sentence of the en-
try, which can be thought of as a definition
part. These category labels are used as fea-
tures in a CRF-based NE tagger. We demon-
strate using the CoNLL 2003 dataset that the
Wikipedia category labels extracted by such
a simple method actually improve the accu-
racy of NER.
