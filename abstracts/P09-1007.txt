This paper proposes an approach to en-
hance dependency parsing in a language
by using a translated treebank from an-
other language. A simple statistical ma-
chine translation method, word-by-word
decoding, where not a parallel corpus but
a bilingual lexicon is necessary, is adopted
for the treebank translation. Using an en-
semble method, the key information ex-
tracted from word pairs with dependency
relations in the translated text is effectively
integrated into the parser for the target lan-
guage. The proposed method is evaluated
in English and Chinese treebanks. It is
shown that a translated English treebank
helps a Chinese parser obtain a state-of-
the-art result.
