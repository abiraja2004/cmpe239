In the recognition of words that are typical
of a specific language variety, the classic
keyword approach performs rather poorly.
We show how this keyword analysis can be
complemented with a word space model
constructed on the basis of two corpora:
one representative of the language variety
under investigation, and a reference cor-
pus. This combined approach is able to
recognize the markers of a language va-
riety as words that not only have a sig-
nificantly higher frequency as compared
to the reference corpus, but also a differ-
ent distribution. The application of word
space models moreover makes it possible
to automatically discover the lexical alter-
native to a specific marker in the reference
corpus.
