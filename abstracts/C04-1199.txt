 
We present a learning-based method to identify 
single-snippet answers to definition questions in 
question answering systems for document 
collections. Our method combines and extends two 
previous techniques that were based mostly on 
manually crafted lexical patterns and WordNet 
hypernyms. We train a Support Vector Machine 
(SVM) on vectors comprising the verdicts or 
attributes of the previous techniques, and additional 
phrasal attributes that we acquire automatically. 
The SVM is then used to identify and rank single 
250-character snippets that contain answers to 
definition questions. Experimental results indicate 
that our method clearly outperforms the techniques 
it builds upon.
