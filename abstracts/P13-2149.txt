 
Thwarting and sarcasm are two uncharted 
territories in sentiment analysis, the for-
mer because of the lack of training corpo-
ra and the latter because of the enormous 
amount of world knowledge it demands. 
In this paper, we propose a working defi-
nition of thwarting amenable to machine 
learning and create a system that detects if 
the document is thwarted or not. We focus 
on identifying thwarting in product re-
views, especially in the camera domain. 
An ontology of the camera domain is cre-
ated. Thwarting is looked upon as the 
phenomenon of polarity reversal at a 
higher level of ontology compared to the 
polarity expressed at the lower level.   
This notion of thwarting defined with re-
spect to an ontology is novel, to the best 
of our knowledge. A rule based imple-
mentation building upon this idea forms 
our baseline. We show that machine learn-
ing with annotated corpora (thwarted/non-
thwarted) is more effective than the rule 
based system. Because of the skewed dis-
tribution of thwarting, we adopt the Area-
under-the-Curve measure of performance. 
To the best of our knowledge, this is the 
first attempt at the difficult problem of 
thwarting detection, which we hope will at 
least provide a baseline system to compare 
against.
