 
This paper describes SYSTRAN submissions 
for the shared task of the third Workshop on 
Statistical Machine Translation at ACL. Our 
main contribution consists in a French-English 
statistical model trained without the use of any 
human-translated parallel corpus. In substitu-
tion, we translated a monolingual corpus with 
SYSTRAN rule-based translation engine to 
produce the parallel corpus. The results are 
provided herein, along with a measure of error 
analysis.
