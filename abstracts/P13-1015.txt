Binarization of grammars is crucial for im-
proving the complexity and performance
of parsing and translation. We present a
versatile binarization algorithm that can
be tailored to a number of grammar for-
malisms by simply varying a formal pa-
rameter. We apply our algorithm to bi-
narizing tree-to-string transducers used in
syntax-based machine translation.
