Parallel sentences are crucial for statistical
machine translation (SMT). However, they
are quite scarce for most language pairs,
such as Chinese?Japanese. Many studies
have been conducted on extracting parallel
sentences from noisy parallel or compara-
ble corpora. We extract Chinese?Japanese
parallel sentences from quasi?comparable
corpora, which are available in far larger
quantities. The task is significantly more
difficult than the extraction from noisy
parallel or comparable corpora. We ex-
tend a previous study that treats parallel
sentence identification as a binary classifi-
cation problem. Previous method of clas-
sifier training by the Cartesian product is
not practical, because it differs from the
real process of parallel sentence extrac-
tion. We propose a novel classifier train-
ing method that simulates the real sentence
extraction process. Furthermore, we use
linguistic knowledge of Chinese character
features. Experimental results on quasi?
comparable corpora indicate that our pro-
posed approach performs significantly bet-
ter than the previous study.
