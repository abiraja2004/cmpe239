In this paper we propose a novel algorithm
for opinion summarization that takes ac-
count of content and coherence, simulta-
neously. We consider a summary as a se-
quence of sentences and directly acquire
the optimum sequence from multiple re-
view documents by extracting and order-
ing the sentences. We achieve this with a
novel Integer Linear Programming (ILP)
formulation. Our proposed formulation is
a powerful mixture of the Maximum Cov-
erage Problem and the Traveling Sales-
man Problem, and is widely applicable to
text generation and summarization tasks.
We score each candidate sequence accord-
ing to its content and coherence. Since
our research goal is to summarize reviews,
the content score is defined by opinions
and the coherence score is developed in
training against the review document cor-
pus. We evaluate our method using the
reviews of commodities and restaurants.
Our method outperforms existing opinion
summarizers as indicated by its ROUGE
score. We also report the results of human
readability experiments.
