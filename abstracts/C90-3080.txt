 
QPATR is an MS-DOS Arity/PROLOG implemen- 
tation of the PATR-II formalism for unification grammar. 
The fbnnalism has been extended to include the constraints 
of LFG as well as negation and disjunction, which are 
implemented with the disjunction and negation-as-failure of 
PROLOG itself. A technique of constraint threading is 
employed to collect negative and constraining conditions in 
PROLOG difference lists. The parser of QPATR uses a 
left-corner algorithm for context-free grammars and 
includes a facility for identifying new lexical items in 
input on the basis of contextual information.
