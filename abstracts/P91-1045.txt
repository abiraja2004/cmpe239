ing away referen- 
tial properties gives the basic interactions ex- 
pressed by the predicate. Specifying those 
properties within a specific semantic field gives 
rise to the set of roles we are used to (e.g. within 
the spatial field, schematizations (1) and (2) 
express SOURCE and GOAL roles). 
With this model we were able to give an 
operational description of the difference between 
Max charge des briques dans le camion/Max 
loads bricks in the truck and Max charge le 
camion de briques/Max loads the truck with 
bricks. The schematization take into account 
which participant is responsible for each transi- 
tion firing and thus can lead us to the "final" 
place. As a first approximation of these continu- 
ous processes, (5) and (6) are proposed (the 
direct contribution of the instrument is also 
introduced). But recognition, as a participant of 
the quantity of bricks in (5) and the capacity of 
the truck in (6), results in the schematizations (7)
et (8) (both display a specialization of their 
direct object in order to complete the semantic 
interpretation).

By its simplicity, the model can thus give 
rise to "confusion" over some roles, in accor- 
dance with the general tendancy to observe 
"roles clusters". The resulting notation seems 
also an interesting way to explore the differences 
between static and dynamic processes, differ- 
ences that are not very '~,isual" if one is using a 
static notation. 
Our research is now directed toward the 
analysis of the system when more semantic 
content is used. We are testing if these adds-on 
have impacts on its behaviour, while analyzing if 
the partial semantic interpretation gives rise to 
the predicted syntactic forms (that is how does 
each potential participant is grammaticalized).
