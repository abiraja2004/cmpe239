CDG represents a sentence?s grammatical structure
as assignments of dependency relations to func-
tional variables associated with each word in the
sentence. In this paper, we describe a statistical
CDG (SCDG) parser that performs parsing incre-
mentally and evaluate it on the Wall Street Jour-
nal Penn Treebank. Using a tight integration of
multiple knowledge sources, together with distance
modeling and synergistic dependencies, this parser
achieves a parsing accuracy comparable to several
state-of-the-art context-free grammar (CFG) based
statistical parsers using a dependency-based eval-
uation metric. Factors contributing to the SCDG
parser?s performance are analyzed.
