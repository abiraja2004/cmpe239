We present results for a system designed to perform Open Knowledge
Extraction, based on a tradition of compositional language processing,
as applied to a large collection of text derived from the Web. Evaluation
through manual assessment shows that well-formed propositions of rea-
sonable quality, representing general world knowledge, given in a logical
form potentially usable for inference, may be extracted in high volume
from arbitrary input sentences. We compare these results with those ob-
tained in recent work on Open Information Extraction, indicating with
some examples the quite different kinds of output obtained by the two
approaches. Finally, we observe that portions of the extracted knowledge
are comparable to results of recent work on class attribute extraction.
