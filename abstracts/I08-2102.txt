Automatic summarization is an important
task as a form of human support technology.
We propose in this paper a new summariza-
tion method that is based on example-based
approach. Using example-based approach
for the summarization task has the following
three advantages: high modularity, absence
of the necessity to score importance for each
word, and high applicability to local con-
text. Experimental results have proven that
the summarization system attains approxi-
mately 60% accuracy by human judgment.
