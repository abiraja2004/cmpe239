Transition-based approaches have shown
competitive performance on constituent
and dependency parsing of Chinese. State-
of-the-art accuracies have been achieved
by a deterministic shift-reduce parsing
model on parsing the Chinese Treebank 2
data (Wang et al, 2006). In this paper,
we propose a global discriminative model
based on the shift-reduce parsing process,
combined with a beam-search decoder, ob-
taining competitive accuracies on CTB2.
We also report the performance of the
parser on CTB5 data, obtaining the highest
scores in the literature for a dependency-
based evaluation.
