We deal with syntactic identification of oc-
currences of multiword expression (MWE)
from an existing dictionary in a text corpus.
The MWEs we identify can be of arbitrary
length and can be interrupted in the surface
sentence. We analyse and compare three ap-
proaches based on linguistic analysis at a vary-
ing level, ranging from surface word order to
deep syntax. The evaluation is conducted us-
ing two corpora: the Prague Dependency Tree-
bank and Czech National Corpus. We use the
dictionary of multiword expressions SemLex,
that was compiled by annotating the Prague
Dependency Treebank and includes deep syn-
tactic dependency trees of all MWEs.
