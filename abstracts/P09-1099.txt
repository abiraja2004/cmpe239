We present a human-robot dialogue sys-
tem that enables a robot to work together
with a human user to build wooden con-
struction toys. We then describe a study in
which na??ve subjects interacted with this
system under a range of conditions and
then completed a user-satisfaction ques-
tionnaire. The results of this study pro-
vide a wide range of subjective and ob-
jective measures of the quality of the in-
teractions. To assess which aspects of the
interaction had the greatest impact on the
users? opinions of the system, we used a
method based on the PARADISE evalua-
tion framework (Walker et al, 1997) to de-
rive a performance function from our data.
The major contributors to user satisfac-
tion were the number of repetition requests
(which had a negative effect on satisfac-
tion), the dialogue length, and the users?
recall of the system instructions (both of
which contributed positively).
