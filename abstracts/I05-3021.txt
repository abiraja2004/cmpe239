This paper reports the example-based
segmentation system for our participa-
tion in the second Chinese Word Seg-
mentation Bakeoff (CWSB-2), present-
ing its basic ideas, technical details and
evaluation. It is a preliminary imple-
mentation. CWSB-2 valuation shows
that it performs very well in identify-
ing known words. Its unknown word
detection module also illustrates great
potential. However, proper facilities for
identifying time expressions, numbers
and other types of unknown words are
needed for improvement.
