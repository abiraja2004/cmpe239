We developed a multi-domain spoken dia-
logue system that can handle user requests
across multiple domains. Such systems
need to satisfy two requirements: extensi-
bility and robustness against speech recog-
nition errors. Extensibility is required to
allow for the modification and addition
of domains independent of other domains.
Robustness against speech recognition er-
rors is required because such errors are
inevitable in speech recognition. How-
ever, the systems should still behave ap-
propriately, even when their inputs are er-
roneous. Our system was constructed on
an extensible architecture and is equipped
with a robust and extensible domain selec-
tion method. Domain selection was based
on three choices: (I) the previous domain,
(II) the domain in which the speech recog-
nition result can be accepted with the high-
est recognition score, and (III) other do-
mains. With the third choice we newly
introduced, our system can prevent dia-
logues from continuously being stuck in
an erroneous domain. Our experimental
results, obtained with 10 subjects, showed
that our method reduced the domain selec-
tion errors by 18.3%, compared to a con-
ventional method.
