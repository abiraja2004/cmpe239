 
A desired property of a measure of 
connective strength in bigrams is that 
the measure should be insensitive to 
corpus size. This paper investigates 
the stability of three different measures 
over text genres and expansion of the 
corpus. The measures are (1) the 
commonly used mutual information, 
(2) the difference in mutual informa- 
tion, and (3) raw occurrence. Mutual 
information is further compared to 
using knowledge about genres to re- 
move overlap between genres. This 
last approach considers the difference 
between two products of the same 
process (human text-generation) con- 
strained by different genres. The can- 
cellation of overlap seems to provide 
the most specific word pairs for each 
genre.
