Cross Document Coreference (CDC) is
the task of constructing the coreference
chain for mentions of a person across a set
of documents. This work offers a holistic
view of using document-level categories,
sub-document level context and extracted
entities and relations for the CDC task.
We train a categorization component with
an efficient flat algorithm using thousands
of ODP categories and over a million web
documents. We propose to use ranked cat-
egories as coreference information, partic-
ularly suitable for web documents that are
widely different in style and content. An
ensemble composite coreference function,
amenable to inactive features, combines
these three levels of evidence for disam-
biguation.
A thorough feature importance study is
conducted to analyze how these three
components contribute to the coreference
results. The overall solution is evaluated
using the WePS benchmark data and
demonstrate superior performance.
