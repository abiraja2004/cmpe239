We describe a novel semantic search engine
for scientific literature. The Camtology sys-
tem allows for sentence-level searches of PDF
files and combines text and image searches,
thus facilitating the retrieval of information
present in tables and figures. It allows the user
to generate complex queries for search terms
that are related through particular grammati-
cal/semantic relations in an intuitive manner.
The system uses Grid processing to parallelise
the analysis of large numbers of papers.
