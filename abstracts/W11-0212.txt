 
We present a bootstrapping approach to infer 
new proteins, locations and protein-location 
pairs by combining UniProt seed protein-
location pairs with dependency paths from a 
large collection of text. Of the top 20 system 
proposed protein-location pairs, 18 were in 
UniProt or supported by online evidence. In-
terestingly, 3 of the top 20 locations identified 
by the system were in the UniProt description, 
but missing from the formal ontology.
