We propose a multiple-document summa-
rization system with user interaction. Our
system extracts keywords from sets of docu-
ments to be summarized and shows the key-
words to a user on the screen. Among them,
the user selects some keywords reflecting
his/her needs. Our system controls the pro-
duced summary by using these selected key-
words. For evaluation of our method, we
participated in TSC3 of NTCIR4 workshop
by letting our system select 12 best key-
words regarding scoring by the system. Our
participated system attained the best per-
formance in content evaluation among sys-
tems not using sets of questions. Moreover,
we evaluated effectiveness of user interac-
tion in our system. With user interaction,
our system attained both higher coverage
and precision than that without user inter-
action.
