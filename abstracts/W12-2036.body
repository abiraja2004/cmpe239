In this paper, we describe the UKP Lab system
participating in the HOO 2012 Shared Task on
preposition and determiner error correction.
Our focus was to implement a highly flexi-
ble and modular system which can be easily
augmented by other researchers. The system
might be used to provide a level playground
for subsequent shared tasks and enable further
progress in this important research field on top
of the state of the art identified by the shared
task.
