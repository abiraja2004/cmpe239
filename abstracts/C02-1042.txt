 
In order to answer factoid questions, the 
Webclopedia QA system employs a 
range of knowledge resources.  These 
include a QA Typology with answer 
patterns, WordNet, information about 
typical numerical answer ranges, and 
semantic relations identified by a robust 
parser, to filter out likely-looking but 
wrong candidate answers.  This paper 
describes the knowledge resources and 
their impact on system performance.
