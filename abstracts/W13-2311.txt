Unstructured Information Management
Architecture (UIMA) has been gaining
popularity in annotating text corpora. The
architecture defines common data struc-
tures and interfaces to support interoper-
ability of individual processing compo-
nents working together in a UIMA appli-
cation. The components exchange data by
sharing common type systems?schemata
of data type structures?which extend a
generic, top-level type system built into
UIMA. This flexibility in extending type
systems has resulted in the development of
repositories of components that share one
or several type systems; however, compo-
nents coming from different repositories,
and thus not sharing type systems, remain
incompatible. Commonly, this problem
has been solved programmatically by im-
plementing UIMA components that per-
form the alignment of two type systems,
an arduous task that is impractical with a
growing number of type systems. We al-
leviate this problem by introducing a con-
version mechanism based on SPARQL, a
query language for the data retrieval and
manipulation of RDF graphs. We pro-
vide a UIMA component that serialises
data coming from a source component
into RDF, executes a user-defined, type-
conversion query, and deserialises the up-
dated graph into a target component. The
proposed solution encourages ad hoc con-
versions, enables the usage of heteroge-
neous components, and facilitates highly
customised UIMA applications.
