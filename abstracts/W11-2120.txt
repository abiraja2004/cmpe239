This paper describes the UZH system that was
used for the WMT 2011 system combination
shared task submission. We participated in
the system combination task for the translation
directions DE?EN and EN?DE. The system
uses Moses as a backbone, with the outputs
of the 2?3 best individual systems being inte-
grated through additional phrase tables. The
system compares well to other system com-
bination submissions, with no other submis-
sion being significantly better. A BLEU-based
comparison to the individual systems, how-
ever, indicates that it achieves no significant
gains over the best individual system.
