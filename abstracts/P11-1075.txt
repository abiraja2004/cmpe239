The automatic coding of clinical documents
is an important task for today?s healthcare
providers. Though it can be viewed as
multi-label document classification, the cod-
ing problem has the interesting property that
most code assignments can be supported by
a single phrase found in the input docu-
ment. We propose a Lexically-Triggered Hid-
den Markov Model (LT-HMM) that leverages
these phrases to improve coding accuracy. The
LT-HMM works in two stages: first, a lexical
match is performed against a term dictionary
to collect a set of candidate codes for a docu-
ment. Next, a discriminative HMM selects the
best subset of codes to assign to the document
by tagging candidates as present or absent.
By confirming codes proposed by a dictio-
nary, the LT-HMM can share features across
codes, enabling strong performance even on
rare codes. In fact, we are able to recover
codes that do not occur in the training set at
all. Our approach achieves the best ever per-
formance on the 2007Medical NLP Challenge
test set, with an F-measure of 89.84.
