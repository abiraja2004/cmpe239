 
The paper describes a parser for Catego- 
rial Grammar which provides fully word 
by word incremental interpretation. The 
parser does not require fragments of sen- 
tences to form constituents, and thereby 
avoids problems of spurious ambiguity. 
The paper includes a brief discussion of 
the relationship between basic Catego- 
rial Grammar and other formalisms uch 
as HPSG, Dependency Grammar and 
the Lambek Calculus. It also includes 
a discussion of some of the issues which 
arise when parsing lexicalised grammars, 
and the possibilities for using statistical 
techniques for tuning to particular lan- 
guages.
