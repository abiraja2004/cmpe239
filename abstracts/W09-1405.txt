We describe our system for the BioNLP 2009
event detection task. It is designed to be as
domain-independent and unsupervised as pos-
sible. Nevertheless, the precisions achieved
for single theme event classes range from 75%
to 92%, while maintaining reasonable recall.
The overall F-scores achieved were 36.44%
and 30.80% on the development and the test
sets respectively.
