We tackle two major issues in automatic
keyphrase extraction using scientific arti-
cles: candidate selection and feature engi-
neering. To develop an efficient candidate
selection method, we analyze the nature
and variation of keyphrases and then se-
lect candidates using regular expressions.
Secondly, we re-examine the existing fea-
tures broadly used for the supervised ap-
proach, exploring different ways to en-
hance their performance. While most
other approaches are supervised, we also
study the optimal features for unsuper-
vised keyphrase extraction. Our research
has shown that effective candidate selec-
tion leads to better performance as evalua-
tion accounts for candidate coverage. Our
work also attests that many of existing fea-
tures are also usable in unsupervised ex-
traction.
