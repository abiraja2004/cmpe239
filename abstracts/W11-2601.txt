Recent research on multilingual statistical ma-
chine translation (SMT) focuses on the usage
of pivot languages in order to overcome re-
source limitations for certain language pairs.
This paper proposes a new method to translate
a dialect language into a foreign language by
integrating transliteration approaches based
on Bayesian co-segmentation (BCS) models
with pivot-based SMT approaches. The ad-
vantages of the proposed method with respect
to standard SMT approaches are three fold:
(1) it uses a standard language as the pivot lan-
guage and acquires knowledge about the re-
lation between dialects and the standard lan-
guage automatically, (2) it reduces the transla-
tion task complexity by using monotone de-
coding techniques, (3) it reduces the num-
ber of features in the log-linear model that
have to be estimated from bilingual data. Ex-
perimental results translating four Japanese
dialects (Kumamoto, Kyoto, Okinawa, Os-
aka) into four Indo-European languages (En-
glish, German, Russian, Hindi) and two Asian
languages (Chinese, Korean) revealed that
the proposed method improves the translation
quality of dialect translation tasks and outper-
forms standard pivot translation approaches
concatenating SMT engines for the majority
of the investigated language pairs.
