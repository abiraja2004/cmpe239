The implementation of collapsed Gibbs
samplers for non-parametric Bayesian
models is non-trivial, requiring con-
siderable book-keeping. Goldwater et
al. (2006a) presented an approximation
which significantly reduces the storage
and computation overhead, but we show
here that their formulation was incorrect
and, even after correction, is grossly inac-
curate. We present an alternative formula-
tion which is exact and can be computed
easily. However this approach does not
work for hierarchical models, for which
case we present an efficient data structure
which has a better space complexity than
the naive approach.
