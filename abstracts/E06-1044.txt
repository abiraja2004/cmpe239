We present the psycholinguistically moti-
vated task of predicting human plausibility
judgements for verb-role-argument triples
and introduce a probabilistic model that
solves it. We also evaluate our model on
the related role-labelling task, and com-
pare it with a standard role labeller. For
both tasks, our model benefits from class-
based smoothing, which allows it to make
correct argument-specific predictions de-
spite a severe sparse data problem. The
standard labeller suffers from sparse data
and a strong reliance on syntactic cues, es-
pecially in the prediction task.
