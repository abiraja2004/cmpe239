Our paper reports an attempt to apply an un-
supervised clustering algorithm to a Hun-
garian treebank in order to obtain seman-
tic verb classes. Starting from the hypo-
thesis that semantic metapredicates underlie
verbs? syntactic realization, we investigate
how one can obtain semantically motivated
verb classes by automatic means. The 150
most frequent Hungarian verbs were clus-
tered on the basis of their complementation
patterns, yielding a set of basic classes and
hints about the features that determine ver-
bal subcategorization. The resulting classes
serve as a basis for the subsequent analysis
of their alternation behavior.
