We introduce a novel coreference resolution
system that models entities and events jointly.
Our iterative method cautiously constructs
clusters of entity and event mentions using lin-
ear regression to model cluster merge opera-
tions. As clusters are built, information flows
between entity and event clusters through fea-
tures that model semantic role dependencies.
Our system handles nominal and verbal events
as well as entities, and our joint formulation
allows information from event coreference to
help entity coreference, and vice versa. In a
cross-document domain with comparable doc-
uments, joint coreference resolution performs
significantly better (over 3 CoNLL F1 points)
than two strong baselines that resolve entities
and events separately.
