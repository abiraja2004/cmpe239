In this paper we describe KnCe2013-CORE,
a system to compute the semantic similarity
of two short text snippets. The system com-
putes a number of features which are gath-
ered from different knowledge bases, namely
WordNet, Wikipedia and Wiktionary. The
similarity scores derived from these features
are then fed into several multilayer perceptron
neuronal networks. Depending on the size
of the text snippets different parameters for
the neural networks are used. The final out-
put of the neural networks is compared to hu-
man judged data. In the evaluation our system
performed sufficiently well for text snippets
of equal length, but the performance dropped
considerably once the pairs of text snippets
differ in size.
