In statistical machine translation, decod-
ing without any reordering constraint is
an NP-hard problem. Inversion Transduc-
tion Grammars (ITGs) exploit linguistic
structure and can well balance the needed
flexibility against complexity constraints.
Currently, translation models with ITG
constraints usually employs the cube-time
CYK algorithm. In this paper, we present
a shift-reduce decoding algorithm that can
generate ITG-legal translation from left to
right in linear time. This algorithm runs
in a reduce-eager style and is suited to
phrase-based models. Using the state-of-
the-art decoder Moses as the baseline, ex-
periment results show that the shift-reduce
algorithm can significantly improve both
the accuracy and the speed on different
test sets.
