Improvements in the quality, usability and ac-
ceptability of spoken dialog systems can be
facilitated by better evaluation methods. To
support early and efficient evaluation of dia-
log systems and their components, this paper
presents a tripartite framework describing the
evaluation problem. One part models the be-
havior of user and system during the interac-
tion, the second one the perception and judg-
ment processes taking place inside the user,
and the third part models what matters to sys-
tem designers and service providers. The pa-
per reviews available approaches for some of
the model parts, and indicates how anticipated
improvements may serve not only developers
and users but also researchers working on ad-
vanced dialog functions and features.
