We applied hierarchical clustering using
Rank distance, previously used in compu-
tational stylometry, on literary texts written
by Mateiu Caragiale and a number of dif-
ferent authors who attempted to imperson-
ate Caragiale after his death, or simply to
mimic his style. Their pastiches were con-
sistently clustered opposite to the original
work, thereby confirming the performance
of the method and proposing an extension
of the method from simple authorship attri-
bution to the more complicated problem of
pastiche detection.
The novelty of our work is the use of fre-
quency rankings of stopwords as features,
showing that this idea yields good results
for pastiche detection.
