We present a general model for PP attach-
ment resolution and NP analysis in French.
We make explicit the different assumptions
our model relies on, and show how it gener-
alizes previously proposed models. We then
present a series of experiments conducted
on a corpus of newspaper articles, and as-
sess the various components of the model,
as well as the different information sources
used.
