Many real-world systems for handling unstructured
text data are rule-based. Examples of such systems
are named entity annotators, information extraction
systems, and text classifiers. In each of these appli-
cations, ordering rules into a decision list is an im-
portant issue. In this paper, we assume that a set of
rules is given and study the problem (MaxDL) of or-
dering them into an optimal decision list with respect
to a given training set. We formalize this problem
and show that it is NP-Hard and cannot be approxi-
mated within any reasonable factors. We then propose
some heuristic algorithms and conduct exhaustive ex-
periments to evaluate their performance. In our ex-
periments we also observe performance improvement
over an existing decision list learning algorithm, by
merely re-ordering the rules output by it.
