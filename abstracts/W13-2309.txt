 
Discourse relation may entail sentiment in-formation. In this work, we annotate both discourse relation and sentiment information on a moderate-sized Chinese corpus extracted from the ClueWeb09. Based on the annota-tion, we investigate the association between the relation type and the sentiment polarity in Chinese and interpret the data from various aspects. Finally, we highlight some language phenomena and give some remarks. 1
