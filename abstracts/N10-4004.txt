Recent Advances in Dependency Parsing

   Data-driven (statistical) approaches have been playing an
increasingly prominent role in parsing since the 1990s. In recent
years, there has been a growing interest in dependency-based as
opposed to constituency-based approaches to syntactic parsing, with
application to a wide range of research areas and different languages.
Graph-based and transition-based methods are the two dominant
data-driven approaches to dependency parsing. In a graph-based model,
it defines a space of candidate dependency trees for a given sentence.
Each candidate tree is scored via a local or global scoring function.
The parser (usually uses dynamic programming) outputs the
highest-scored tree. In contrast, in a transition-based model, it
defines a transition system for mapping a sentence to its dependency
tree.  It induces a model for predicting the next state transition,
given the transition history. Given the induced model, the output
parse tree is built deterministically upon the construction of the
optimal transition sequence.
   Both Graph-based and transition-based approaches have been used to
achieve state-of-the-art dependency parsing results for a wide range
of languages. Some researchers have used the combination of the two
models and it shows the performance of the combined model is
significantly better than the individual models. Another recent trend
is to apply online training to shift-reduce parsing in the
transition-based models. In this tutorial, we first introduce the two
main-stream data-driven dependency parsing models--- graph-based and
transition-based models. After comparing the differences between them,
we show how these two models can be combined in various ways to
achieve better results.
