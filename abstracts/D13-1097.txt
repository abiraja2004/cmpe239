Explanatory sentences are employed to clarify
reasons, details, facts, and so on. High quality
online product reviews usually include not
only positive or negative opinions, but also a
variety of explanations of why these opinions
were given. These explanations can help
readers get easily comprehensible informa-
tion of the discussed products and aspect-
s. Moreover, explanatory relations can also
benefit sentiment analysis applications. In
this work, we focus on the task of identi-
fying subjective text segments and extracting
their corresponding explanations from prod-
uct reviews in discourse level. We propose
a novel joint extraction method using first-
order logic to model rich linguistic features
and long distance constraints. Experimental
results demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed method.
