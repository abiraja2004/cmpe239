In our paper, we present a computational
morphology for Old and Middle Hungar-
ian used in two research projects that aim
at creating morphologically annotated cor-
pora of Old and Middle Hungarian. In ad-
dition, we present the web-based disam-
biguation tool used in the semi-automatic
disambiguation of the annotations and the
structured corpus query tool that has a
unique but very useful feature of making
corrections to the annotation in the query
results possible.
