Many semantic parsing models use tree trans-
formations to map between natural language
and meaning representation. However, while
tree transformations are central to several
state-of-the-art approaches, little use has been
made of the rich literature on tree automata.
This paper makes the connection concrete
with a tree transducer based semantic parsing
model and suggests that other models can be
interpreted in a similar framework, increasing
the generality of their contributions. In par-
ticular, this paper further introduces a varia-
tional Bayesian inference algorithm that is ap-
plicable to a wide class of tree transducers,
producing state-of-the-art semantic parsing re-
sults while remaining applicable to any do-
main employing probabilistic tree transducers.
