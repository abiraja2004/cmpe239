In this paper we present a chunk based
keyphrase extraction method for scientific
articles. Different from most previous sys-
tems, supervised machine learning algo-
rithms are not used in our system. Instead,
document structure information is used to
remove unimportant contents; Chunk ex-
traction and filtering is used to reduce the
quantity of candidates; Keywords are used
to filter the candidates before generating
final keyphrases. Our experimental results
on test data show that the method works
better than the baseline systems and is
comparable with other known algorithms.
