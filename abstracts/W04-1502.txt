We present a comparative analysis of relative
clauses in Hindi and Arabic in the tradition
of the Paninian Grammar Framework (Bharati
et al, 1996b) which leads to deriving a com-
mon logical form for equivalent sentences. Par-
allels are drawn between the Hindi co-relative
construction and resumptive pronouns in Ara-
bic. The analysis arises from the development
of lexicalised dependency grammars for Hindi
and Arabic that have application for machine
translation.
