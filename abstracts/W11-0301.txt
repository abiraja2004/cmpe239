The connection between part-of-speech (POS)
categories and morphological properties is
well-documented in linguistics but underuti-
lized in text processing systems. This pa-
per proposes a novel model for morphologi-
cal segmentation that is driven by this connec-
tion. Our model learns that words with com-
mon affixes are likely to be in the same syn-
tactic category and uses learned syntactic cat-
egories to refine the segmentation boundaries
of words. Our results demonstrate that incor-
porating POS categorization yields substantial
performance gains on morphological segmen-
tation of Arabic. 1
