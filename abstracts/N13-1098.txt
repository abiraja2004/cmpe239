Wizard-of-Oz experimental setup in a dia-
logue system is commonly used to gather data
for informing an automated version of that
system. Previous work has exposed depen-
dencies between user behavior towards sys-
tems and user belief about whether the sys-
tem is automated or human-controlled. This
work examines whether user behavior changes
when user belief is held constant and the sys-
tem?s operator is varied. We perform a post-
hoc experiment using generalizable prosodic
and lexical features of user responses to a dia-
logue system backed with and without a hu-
man wizard. Our results suggest that user
responses are different when communicating
with a wizarded and an automated system, in-
dicating that wizard data may be less reliable
for informing automated systems than gener-
ally assumed.
