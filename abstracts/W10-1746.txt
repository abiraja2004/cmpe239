This paper describes the JHU system
combination scheme that was used in
the WMT 2010 submission. The in-
cremental alignment scheme of (Karakos
et.al, 2008) was used for confusion net-
work generation. The system order
in the alignment of each sentence was
learned using SVMs, following the work
of (Karakos et.al, 2010). Additionally,
web-scale n-grams from the Google cor-
pus were used to build language models
that improved the quality of the combi-
nation output. Experiments in Spanish-
English, French-English, German-English
and Czech-English language pairs were
conducted, and the results show approxi-
mately 1 BLEU point and 2 TER points
improvement over the best individual sys-
tem.
