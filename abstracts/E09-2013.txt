This paper describes Read-X, a system designed to
identify text that is appropriate for the reader given
his thematic choices and the reading ability asso-
ciated with his educational background. To our
knowledge, Read-X is the first web-based system
that performs real-time searches and returns results
classified thematically and by reading level within
seconds. To facilitate educators or students search-
ing for reading material at specific reading levels,
Read-X extracts the text from the html, pdf, doc,
or xml format and makes available a text editor for
viewing and editing the extracted text.
