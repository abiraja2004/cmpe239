This paper deals with the robust 
expansion of Domain Lexico- 
Taxonomy (DLT). DLT is a domain 
taxonomy enriched with domain lexica. 
DLT was proposed as an infrastructure 
for crossing domain barriers (Huang et 
al. 2004). The DLT proposal is based 
on the observation that domain lexica 
contain entries that are also part of a 
general lexicon. Hence, when entries of 
a general lexicon are marked with their 
associated domain attributes, this 
information can have two important 
applications. First, the DLT will serve 
as seeds for domain lexica. Second, the 
DLT offers the most reliable evidence 
for deciding the domain of a new text 
since these lexical clues belong to the 
general lexicon and do occur reliably in 
all texts. Hence general lexicon 
lemmas are extracted to populate 
domain lexica, which are situated in 
domain taxonomy. Based on this 
previous work, we show in this paper 
that the original DLT can be further 
expanded when a new language 
resource is introduced. We applied 
CiLin, a Chinese thesaurus, and added 
more than 1000 new entries for DLT 
and show with evaluation that the DLT 
approach is robust since the size and 
number of domain lexica increased 
effectively.
