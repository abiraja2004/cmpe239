This paper describes the IMS-SZEGED-CIS
contribution to the SPMRL 2013 Shared Task.
We participate in both the constituency and
dependency tracks, and achieve state-of-the-
art for all languages. For both tracks we make
significant improvements through high quality
preprocessing and (re)ranking on top of strong
baselines. Our system came out first for both
tracks.
