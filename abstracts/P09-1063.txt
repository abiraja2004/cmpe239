Current tree-to-tree models suffer from
parsing errors as they usually use only 1-
best parses for rule extraction and decod-
ing. We instead propose a forest-based
tree-to-tree model that uses packed forests.
The model is based on a probabilis-
tic synchronous tree substitution gram-
mar (STSG), which can be learned from
aligned forest pairs automatically. The de-
coder finds ways of decomposing trees in
the source forest into elementary trees us-
ing the source projection of STSG while
building target forest in parallel. Compa-
rable to the state-of-the-art phrase-based
system Moses, using packed forests in
tree-to-tree translation results in a signif-
icant absolute improvement of 3.6 BLEU
points over using 1-best trees.
