 
We propose an algorithm for the trausfer of packed linguistic 
structures, that is, finite collections of labelled graphs which 
share certain subparts. A labelled graph is seen as a word over 
a vocabulary of description elements (nodes, arcs, labels), and 
a collection of graphs as a set of such words, that is, as a hm- 
guage over description elements. A packed representation for 
the collection of graphs is then viewed as a context-free gram- 
mar which generates such a language. We present an algorithm 
that uses a conventional set of transfer ules but is capable of 
rewriting the CFG representing the source packed structure into 
a CFG representing the target packed structure that preserves 
the compaction properties of the source CFG.
