 
The task of aligning sentences in parallel corpora of 
two languages has been well studied using pure sta- 
tistical or linguistic models. We developed a linguis- 
tic method based on lexical matching with a bilin- 
gual dictionary and two statistical methods based 
on sentence length ratios and sentence offset prob- 
abilities. This paper seeks to further our knowl- 
edge of the alignment ask by comparing the per- 
formance of the alignment models when used sepa- 
rately and together, i.e. as a hybrid system. Our 
results show that for our English-Japanese corpus of 
newspaper articles, the hybrid system using lexical 
matching and sentence l ngth ratios outperforms the 
pure methods.
