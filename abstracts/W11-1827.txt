The second BioNLP Shared Task on Event
Extraction (BioNLP-ST?11) follows up the
previous shared task competition with a focus
on generalization with respect to text types,
event types and subject domains. In this spirit,
we re-engineered and extended our event ex-
traction system, emphasizing linguistic gener-
alizations and avoiding domain-, event type-
or text type-specific optimizations. Similar
to our earlier system, syntactic dependencies
form the basis of our approach. However, di-
verging from that system?s more pragmatic na-
ture, we more clearly distinguish the shared
task concerns from a general semantic com-
position scheme, that is based on the no-
tion of embedding. We apply our methodol-
ogy to core bio-event extraction and specu-
lation/negation detection tasks in three main
tracks. Our results demonstrate that such a
general approach is viable and pinpoint some
of its shortcomings.
