We present a method we used for the quality
estimation shared task of WMT 2012 involving
IBM1 and language model scores calculated
on morphemes and POS tags. The IBM1 scores
calculated on morphemes and POS-4grams of
the source sentence and obtained translation
output are shown to be competitive with the
classic evaluation metrics for ranking of trans-
lation systems. Since these scores do not re-
quire any reference translations, they can be
used as features for the quality estimation task
presenting a connection between the source
language and the obtained target language. In
addition, target language model scores of mor-
phemes and POS tags are investigated as esti-
mates for the obtained target language quality.
