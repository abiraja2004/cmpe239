Natural languages contain many multi-word
sequences that do not display the variety of
syntactic processes we would expect given
their phrase type, and consequently must be
included in the lexicon as multiword units.
This paper describes a method for identify-
ing such items in corpora, focussing on En-
glish verb-noun combinations. In an eval-
uation using a set of dictionary-published
MWEs we show that our method achieves
greater accuracy than existing MWE extrac-
tion methods based on lexical association.
