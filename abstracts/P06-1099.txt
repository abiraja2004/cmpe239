In the past years, a number of lexical
association measures have been studied
to help extract new scientific terminol-
ogy or general-language collocations. The
implicit assumption of this research was
that newly designed term measures involv-
ing more sophisticated statistical criteria
would outperform simple counts of co-
occurrence frequencies. We here explic-
itly test this assumption. By way of four
qualitative criteria, we show that purely
statistics-based measures reveal virtually
no difference compared with frequency
of occurrence counts, while linguistically
more informed metrics do reveal such a
marked difference.
