We explore how to improve machine trans-
lation systems by adding more translation
data in situations where we already have
substantial resources. The main challenge
is how to buck the trend of diminishing re-
turns that is commonly encountered. We
present an active learning-style data solic-
itation algorithm to meet this challenge.
We test it, gathering annotations via Ama-
zon Mechanical Turk, and find that we get
an order of magnitude increase in perfor-
mance rates of improvement.
