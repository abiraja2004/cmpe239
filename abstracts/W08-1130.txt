Selection of natural-sounding referring ex-
pressions is useful in text generation and in-
formation summarization (Kan et al, 2001).
We use discourse-level feature predicates in
a maximum entropy classifier (Berger et al,
1996) with binary and n-class classification to
select referring expressions from a list. We
find that while mention-type n-class classifi-
cation produces higher accuracy of type, bi-
nary classification of individual referring ex-
pressions helps to avoid use of awkward refer-
ring expressions.
