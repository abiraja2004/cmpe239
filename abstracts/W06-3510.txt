Fluid Construction Grammar (FCG) is a
new linguistic formalism designed to ex-
plore in how far a construction gram-
mar approach can be used for handling
open-ended grounded dialogue, i.e. dia-
logue between or with autonomous em-
bodied agents about the world as experi-
enced through their sensory-motor appa-
ratus. We seek scalable, open-ended lan-
guage systems by giving agents both the
ability to use existing conventions or on-
tologies, and to invent or learn new ones
as the needs arise. This paper contains a
brief introduction to the key ideas behind
FCG and its current status.
