This paper presents a novel method for ac-
quiring a set of query patterns to retrieve
documents containing important informa-
tion about an entity. Given an existing
Wikipedia category that contains the tar-
get entity, we extract and select a small
set of query patterns by presuming that
formulating search queries with these pat-
terns optimizes the overall precision and
coverage of the returned Web informa-
tion. We model this optimization prob-
lem as a weighted maximum satisfiabil-
ity (weighted Max-SAT) problem. The
experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed method outperforms other meth-
ods based on statistical measures such as
frequency and point-wise mutual informa-
tion (PMI), which are widely used in rela-
tion extraction.
