In this paper, we describe an integrated approach to-
wards dealing with various semantic and structural is-
sues associated with document management. We
provide motivations for using XML, RDF and OWL in
building a seamless architecture to serve not only as a
document exchange service but also to enable higher
level services such as annotations, metadata access and
querying. The key idea is to manifest differential treat-
ments for the actual document structure, semantic con-
tent of the document and ontological document
organization. The deployment of this architecture in the
PROTEUS project
1
 provides an industrial setting for
evaluation and further specification.
