 
This paper explores two classes of model adapta-
tion methods for Web search ranking: Model In-
terpolation and error-driven learning approaches 
based on a boosting algorithm.  The results show 
that model interpolation, though simple, achieves 
the best results on all the open test sets where the 
test data is very different from the training data. 
The tree-based boosting algorithm achieves the 
best performance on most of the closed test sets 
where the test data and the training data are sim-
ilar, but its performance drops significantly on 
the open test sets due to the instability of trees.  
Several methods are explored to improve the 
robustness of the algorithm, with limited success.
