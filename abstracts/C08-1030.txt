This paper presents a method of retriev-
ing bilingual collocations of a verb and
its objective noun from cross-lingual docu-
ments with similar contents. Relevant doc-
uments are obtained by integrating cross-
language hierarchies. The results showed a
15.1% improvement over the baseline non-
hierarchy model, and a 6.0% improvement
over use of relevant documents retrieved
from a single hierarchy. Moreover, we
found that some of the retrieved colloca-
tions were domain-specific.
