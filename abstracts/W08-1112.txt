We describe three PCFG-based models for
Chinese sentence realisation from Lexical-
Functional Grammar (LFG) f-structures. Both
the lexicalised model and the history-based
model improve on the accuracy of a simple
wide-coverage PCFG model by adding lexical
and contextual information to weaken inap-
propriate independence assumptions implicit
in the PCFG models. In addition, we pro-
vide techniques for lexical smoothing and rule
smoothing to increase the generation cover-
age. Trained on 15,663 automatically LFG f-
structure annotated sentences of the Penn Chi-
nese treebank and tested on 500 sentences ran-
domly selected from the treebank test set, the
lexicalised model achieves a BLEU score of
0.7265 at 100% coverage, while the history-
based model achieves a BLEU score of 0.7245
also at 100% coverage.
