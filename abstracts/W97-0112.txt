Faced with growing volume and accessibi l i ty of electronic textual 
information, information retrieval, and, in general, automatic 
documentat ion require updated terminological resources that are ever 
more voluminous. A current problem is the automated construction of 
these resources (e.g., terminologies, thesauri, glossaries, etd~ ~) from 
a corpus. Various linguistic and statistical methods to handle this 
problem are coming to light. One problem that has been less studied is 
that of updating these resources, in particular, of classifying a term 
extracted from a corpus in a subject field, discipl ine or branch of an 
exist ing thesaurus. This is the first step in posit ioning a term 
extracted from a corpus in the structure of a thesaurus (generic 
relations, synonymy relations ..). This is an important problem in 
certain disciplines in which knowledge, and, in particular, vocabulary 
is not very stable over time, especial ly because of neologisms. 
This experiment compares different models for representing a term 
from a corpus for its automatic classif ication in the subject fields 
of a thesaurus. The classif ication method used is linear 
discr iminatory analysis, based on a learning sample. The models 
evaluated here are: a term/document model where each term is a vector 
in document vector space, two term/term models where each term is a 
vector in term space, and the coordinates are either the co- 
occurrence, or the mutual information between terms. The most 
effective model is the one based on mutual information between terms, 
which typifies the fact that two terms often appear together in the 
corpus, but rarely apar t . .
