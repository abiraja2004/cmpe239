This paper describes a novel instance-
based sentence boundary determination
method for natural language generation
that optimizes a set of criteria based on
examples in a corpus. Compared to exist-
ing sentence boundary determination ap-
proaches, our work offers three signifi-
cant contributions. First, our approach
provides a general domain independent
framework that effectively addresses sen-
tence boundary determination by balanc-
ing a comprehensive set of sentence com-
plexity and quality related constraints.
Second, our approach can simulate the
characteristics and the style of naturally
occurring sentences in an application do-
main since our solutions are optimized
based on their similarities to examples
in a corpus. Third, our approach can
adapt easily to suit a natural language gen-
eration system?s capability by balancing
the strengths and weaknesses of its sub-
components (e.g. its aggregation and re-
ferring expression generation capability).
Our final evaluation shows that the pro-
posed method results in significantly bet-
ter sentence generation outcomes than a
widely adopted approach.
