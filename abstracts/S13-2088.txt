This paper describes an expression-level senti-
ment detection system that participated in the
subtask A of SemEval-2013 Task 2: Senti-
ment Analysis in Twitter. Our system uses a
supervised approach to learn the features from
the training data to classify expressions in new
tweets as positive, negative or neutral. The
proposed approach helps to understand the rel-
evant features that contribute most in this clas-
sification task.
