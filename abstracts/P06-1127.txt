 
A web search with double checking 
model is proposed to explore the web as 
a live corpus.  Five association measures 
including variants of Dice, Overlap Ratio, 
Jaccard, and Cosine, as well as Co-
Occurrence Double Check (CODC), are 
presented. In the experiments on Ruben-
stein-Goodenough?s benchmark data set, 
the CODC measure achieves correlation 
coefficient 0.8492, which competes with 
the performance (0.8914) of the model 
using WordNet.  The experiments on link 
detection of named entities using the 
strategies of direct association, associa-
tion matrix and scalar association matrix 
verify that the double-check frequencies 
are reliable.  Further study on named en-
tity clustering shows that the five meas-
ures are quite useful.  In particular, 
CODC measure is very stable on word-
word and name-name experiments.  The 
application of CODC measure to expand 
community chains for personal name dis-
ambiguation achieves 9.65% and 14.22% 
increase compared to the system without 
community expansion.  All the experi-
ments illustrate that the novel model of 
web search with double checking is fea-
sible for mining associations from the 
web.
