Word alignment models form an important
part of building statistical machine transla-
tion systems. Semi-supervised word align-
ment aims to improve the accuracy of auto-
matic word alignment by incorporating full
or partial alignments acquired from humans.
Such dedicated elicitation effort is often ex-
pensive and depends on availability of bilin-
gual speakers for the language-pair. In this
paper we study active learning query strate-
gies to carefully identify highly uncertain or
most informative alignment links that are pro-
posed under an unsupervised word alignment
model. Manual correction of such informative
links can then be applied to create a labeled
dataset used by a semi-supervised word align-
ment model. Our experiments show that using
active learning leads to maximal reduction of
alignment error rates with reduced human ef-
fort.
