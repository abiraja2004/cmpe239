 
In spite of their important quantitative role, 
discourse particles have so far been ne- 
glected in automatic speech processing for 
two reasons: Firstly it is not clear what 
they may contribute to the aims of auto- 
matic speech processing, and secondly their 
functions seem to vary so much that it 
seems difficult to identify the information 
relevant o such aims. The approach pre- 
sented here therefore attempts to provide au- 
tomatic means to distinguishing the different 
readings of discourse particles and to filter- 
ing out the information which can be use- 
ful for speech understanding systems, em- 
ploying positional information and their role 
within a dialogue model of the respective do- 
main, two types of information which are es- 
pecially easy to obtain. First results indicate 
that discourse particles can indeed be auto- 
matically disambiguated on the basis of the 
model proposed.
