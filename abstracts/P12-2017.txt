We present a novel extension to a recently pro-
posed incremental learning algorithm for the
word segmentation problem originally intro-
duced in Goldwater (2006). By adding rejuve-
nation to a particle filter, we are able to consid-
erably improve its performance, both in terms
of finding higher probability and higher accu-
racy solutions.
