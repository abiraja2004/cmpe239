The previous probabilistic part-of-speech tagging
models for agglutinative languages have consid-
ered only lexical forms of morphemes, not surface
forms of words. This causes an inaccurate cal-
culation of the probability. The proposed model
is based on the observation that when there exist
words (surface forms) that share the same lexical
forms, the probabilities to appear are different from
each other. Also, it is designed to consider lexi-
cal form of word. By experiments, we show that
the proposed model outperforms the bigram Hidden
Markov model (HMM)-based tagging model.
