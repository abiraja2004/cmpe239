Metaphor understanding in Computational
Linguistics has largely been focused on the
development of stand-alone prototypes for
which only small-scale evaluations are car-
ried out. This has made difficult the in-
clusion of metaphor in the development
of natural language processing applica-
tions. However, dealing with metaphor
properly is ultimately crucial for any au-
tomated language technology that is to be
truly human-friendly or able to properly
appreciate utterances by humans. This pa-
per proposes to bring metaphor into the
Recognizing Textual Entailment task. By
doing so, the coverage of textual entail-
ment systems would be broadened and
metaphor research would benefit from the
textual entailment evaluation framework.
