The cross-disciplinary MIME project aims
to develop a mobile medical monitoring
system that improves handover transac-
tions in rural pre-hospital scenarios be-
tween the first person on scene and am-
bulance clinicians. NLG is used to pro-
duce a textual handover report at any time,
summarising data from novel medical sen-
sors, as well as observations and actions
recorded by the carer. We describe the
MIME project with a focus on the NLG
algorithm and an initial evaluation of the
generated reports.
