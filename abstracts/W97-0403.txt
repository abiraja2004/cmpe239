 
This paper argues that stylistically and 
pragmatically high-quality spoken lan- 
guage translation requires the transfer of 
pragmatic information at an abstract level 
of "utterance strategies". A new cate- 
gorization of spoken language phenomena 
into essentially non-meaningful "speech 
errors", and purposeful "natural speech 
properties" is introduced, and the manner 
in which natural speech properties convey 
pragmatic information is described. Fi- 
nally, an extension of the analogical speech 
translation approach is proposed that ac- 
counts for such higher-level pragmatic in- 
formation.
