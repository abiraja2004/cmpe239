In this paper, we introduce a new base-
line for language-independent text diffi-
culty assessment applied to the Intera-
gency Language Roundtable (ILR) profi-
ciency scale. We demonstrate that reading
level assessment is a discriminative prob-
lem that is best-suited for regression. Our
baseline uses z-normalized shallow length
features and TF-LOG weighted vectors on
bag-of-words for Arabic, Dari, English,
and Pashto. We compare Support Vector
Machines and the Margin-Infused Relaxed
Algorithm measured by mean squared er-
ror. We provide an analysis of which fea-
tures are most predictive of a given level.1
