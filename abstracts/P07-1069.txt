This paper presents a method for the auto-
matic generation of a table-of-contents. This
type of summary could serve as an effec-
tive navigation tool for accessing informa-
tion in long texts, such as books. To gen-
erate a coherent table-of-contents, we need
to capture both global dependencies across
different titles in the table and local con-
straints within sections. Our algorithm ef-
fectively handles these complex dependen-
cies by factoring the model into local and
global components, and incrementally con-
structing the model?s output. The results of
automatic evaluation and manual assessment
confirm the benefits of this design: our sys-
tem is consistently ranked higher than non-
hierarchical baselines.
