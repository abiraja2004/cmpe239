 
This paper argues for a novel data structure for the 
representation f discourse referents. A so-called 
hashing list is employed to store discourse referents 
according to their grammatical features. The ac- 
count proposed combines insights from several the- 
odes of discourse comprehension. Segmented Dis- 
course Representation Theory (Asher, 1993) is en- 
riched by the ranking system developed in center- 
ing theory (Grosz et al, 1995). In addition, a tree 
logic is used to represent underspecification within 
the discourse structure (Schilder, 1998).
