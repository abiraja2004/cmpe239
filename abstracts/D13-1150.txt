This paper offers an approach for governments
to harness the information contained in social
media in order to make public inspections and
disclosure more efficient. As a case study, we
turn to restaurant hygiene inspections ? which
are done for restaurants throughout the United
States and in most of the world and are a fre-
quently cited example of public inspections
and disclosure. We present the first empiri-
cal study that shows the viability of statistical
models that learn the mapping between tex-
tual signals in restaurant reviews and the hy-
giene inspection records from the Department
of Public Health. The learned model achieves
over 82% accuracy in discriminating severe
offenders from places with no violation, and
provides insights into salient cues in reviews
that are indicative of the restaurant?s sanitary
conditions. Our study suggests that public
disclosure policy can be improved by mining
public opinions from social media to target in-
spections and to provide alternative forms of
disclosure to customers.
