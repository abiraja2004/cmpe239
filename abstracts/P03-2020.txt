This paper proposes a method of collect-
ing a dozen terms that are closely re-
lated to a given seed term. The proposed
method consists of three steps. The first
step, compiling corpus step, collects texts
that contain the given seed term by us-
ing search engines. The second step, au-
tomatic term recognition, extracts impor-
tant terms from the corpus by using Naka-
gawa?s method. These extracted terms be-
come the candidates for the final step. The
final step, filtering step, removes inappro-
priate terms from the candidates based on
search engine hits. An evaluation result
shows that the precision of the method is
85%.
