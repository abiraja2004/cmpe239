In this paper we investigate the use of lin-
guistic knowledge in passage retrieval as
part of an open-domain question answer-
ing system. We use annotation produced
by a deep syntactic dependency parser for
Dutch, Alpino, to extract various kinds of
linguistic features and syntactic units to
be included in a multi-layer index. Sim-
ilar annotation is produced for natural lan-
guage questions to be answered by the
system. From this we extract query terms
to be sent to the enriched retrieval index.
We use a genetic algorithm to optimize the
selection of features and syntactic units
to be included in a query. This algo-
rithm is also used to optimize further pa-
rameters such as keyword weights. The
system is trained on questions from the
competition on Dutch question answering
within the Cross-Language Evaluation Fo-
rum (CLEF). We could show an improve-
ment of about 15% in mean total recip-
rocal rank compared to traditional infor-
mation retrieval using plain text keywords
(including stemming and stop word re-
moval).
