 
A computational model for the acquisition 
of knowledge from encyclopedic texts is de- 
scribed. The model has been implemented 
in a program, called SNOWY, that reads 
unedited texts from The World Book En- 
cyclopedia, and acquires new concepts and 
conceptual relations about topics dealing 
with the dietary habits of animals, their 
classifications and habitats. The program 
is also able to answer an ample set of ques- 
tions about the knowledge that it has ac- 
quired. This paper describes the essential 
components of this model, namely seman- 
tic interpretation, inferences and represen- 
tation, and ends with an evaluation of the 
performance of the program, a sample of 
the questions that it is able to answer, and 
its relation to other programs of similar na- 
ture.
