This paper describes the English-Russian
and Russian-English statistical machine
translation (SMT) systems developed at
Yandex School of Data Analysis for the
shared translation task of the ACL 2013
Eighth Workshop on Statistical Machine
Translation. We adopted phrase-based
SMT approach and evaluated a number
of different techniques, including data fil-
tering, spelling correction, alignment of
lemmatized word forms and translitera-
tion. Altogether they yielded +2.0 and
+1.5 BLEU improvement for ru-en and en-
ru language pairs. We also report on the
experiments that did not have any positive
effect and provide an analysis of the prob-
lems we encountered during the develop-
ment of our systems.
