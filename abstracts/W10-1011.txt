 
This paper explores an issue of redundant errors 
reported while automatically scoring English 
learners? sentences. We use a human-computer 
collaboration approach to eliminate redundant er-
rors. The first step is to automatically select can-
didate redundant errors using PMI and RFC. 
Since those errors are detected with different IDs 
although they represent the same error, the can-
didacy cannot be confirmed automatically. The 
errors are then handed over to human experts to 
determine the candidacy. The final candidates 
are provided to the system and trained with a de-
cision tree. With those redundant errors eliminat-
ed, the system accuracy has been improved.
