In this paper, we argue that in it-clefts as
in It was Ohno who won, the cleft pronoun
(it) and the cleft clause (who won) form
a discontinuous syntactic constituent, and
a semantic unit as a definite description,
presenting arguments from Percus (1997)
and Hedberg (2000). We propose a syn-
tax of it-clefts using Tree-Local Multi-
Component Tree Adjoining Grammar and
a compositional semantics on the pro-
posed syntax using Synchronous Tree Ad-
joining Grammar.
