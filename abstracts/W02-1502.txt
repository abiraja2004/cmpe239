The grammar matrix is an open-source
starter-kit for the development of broad-
coverage HPSGs. By using a type hierar-
chy to represent cross-linguistic generaliza-
tions and providing compatibility with other
open-source tools for grammar engineering,
evaluation, parsing and generation, it facil-
itates not only quick start-up but also rapid
growth towards the wide coverage necessary
for robust natural language processing and
the precision parses and semantic represen-
tations necessary for natural language under-
standing.
