Frequency counts from very large corpora,
such as the Web 1T dataset, have recently be-
come available for language modeling. Omis-
sion of low frequency n-gram counts is a prac-
tical necessity for datasets of this size. Naive
implementations of standard smoothing meth-
ods do not realize the full potential of such
large datasets with missing counts. In this pa-
per I present a new smoothing algorithm that
combines the Dirichlet prior form of (Mackay
and Peto, 1995) with the modified back-off es-
timates of (Kneser and Ney, 1995) that leads to
a 31% perplexity reduction on the Brown cor-
pus compared to a baseline implementation of
Kneser-Ney discounting.
