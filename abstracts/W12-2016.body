 
This paper describes and evaluates DQGen, 
which automatically generates multiple choice 
cloze questions to test a child?s comprehen-
sion while reading a given text.  Unlike previ-
ous methods, it generates different types of 
distracters designed to diagnose different 
types of comprehension failure, and tests 
comprehension not only of an individual sen-
tence but of the context that precedes it.  We 
evaluate the quality of the overall questions 
and the individual distracters, according to 8 
human judges blind to the correct answers and 
intended distracter types.  The results, errors, 
and judges? comments reveal limitations and 
suggest how to address some of them.
