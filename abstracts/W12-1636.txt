 
Unlike in English, the sentence boundaries in Chinese are fuzzy and not well-defined. As a result, Chinese sentences tend to be long and consist of complex discourse relations. In this paper, we focus on two important relations, Contingency and Comparison, which occur often inside a sentence. We construct a moderate-sized corpus for the investigation of intra-sentential relations and propose models to label the relation structure. A learning based model is evaluated with various features. Experimental results show our model achieves accuracies of 81.63% in the task of relation labeling and 74.8% in the task of relation structure prediction.  1
