In this study we used bipartite spectral
graph partitioning to simultaneously clus-
ter varieties and sound correspondences
in Dutch dialect data. While cluster-
ing geographical varieties with respect to
their pronunciation is not new, the simul-
taneous identification of the sound corre-
spondences giving rise to the geographi-
cal clustering presents a novel opportunity
in dialectometry. Earlier methods aggre-
gated sound differences and clustered on
the basis of aggregate differences. The de-
termination of the significant sound corre-
spondences which co-varied with cluster
membership was carried out on a post hoc
basis. Bipartite spectral graph clustering
simultaneously seeks groups of individual
sound correspondences which are associ-
ated, even while seeking groups of sites
which share sound correspondences. We
show that the application of this method
results in clear and sensible geographi-
cal groupings and discuss the concomitant
sound correspondences.
