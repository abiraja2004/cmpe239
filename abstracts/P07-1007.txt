When a word sense disambiguation (WSD)
system is trained on one domain but ap-
plied to a different domain, a drop in ac-
curacy is frequently observed. This high-
lights the importance of domain adaptation
for word sense disambiguation. In this pa-
per, we first show that an active learning ap-
proach can be successfully used to perform
domain adaptation of WSD systems. Then,
by using the predominant sense predicted by
expectation-maximization (EM) and adopt-
ing a count-merging technique, we improve
the effectiveness of the original adaptation
process achieved by the basic active learn-
ing approach.
