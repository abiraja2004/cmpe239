 
In this paper, an augmented chart data structure 
with efficient word lattice parsing scheme in speech 
recognition applications i proposed. The augmented 
chart and the associated parsing, algorithm can 
represent and parse very efficiently a lattice of word 
hypotheses produced in speech recognition with high 
degree of lexical ambiguity .without changing the 
fundamental principles of chart parsing. Every word 
!attice can be mapped to the augmented chart with the 
ordering and connection relation among word 
hypotheses being well preserved in the augmented 
chart. A jump edge is defined to link edges 
representing word hypotheses physically separated but 
practically possible to be connected. Preliminary 
experimental results show that with the augmented 
chart parsing all possible constituents of the input 
word lattice can be constructed and no constituent 
needs to be built more than once. This will reduce the 
computation complexity significantly especially when 
serious lexical ambiguity exists in the input word 
lattice as in many speech recognition problems. This 
augmented chart parsing is thus a very useful and 
efficient approach to language processing problems in 
speech recognition applications.
