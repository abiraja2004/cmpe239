Term extraction systems are now an inte-
gral part of the compiling of specialized
dictionaries and updating of term banks.
In this paper, we present a term detection
approach that discovers, structures, and
infers conceptual relationships between
terms for French. Conceptual relation-
ships are deduced from specific types of
term variations, morphological and syn-
tagmatic, and are expressed through lexi-
cal functions. The linguistic precision of
the conceptual structuring through mor-
phological variations is of 95 %.
