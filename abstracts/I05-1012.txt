. In this paper, we first discuss a problem of developing a
knowledge base by using natural language documents: wrong informa-
tion in natural language documents. It is almost inevitable that natural
language documents, especially web documents, contain wrong informa-
tion. As a result, it is important to investigate a method of detecting
and correcting wrong information in natural language documents when
we develop a knowledge base by using them. In this paper, we report a
method of detecting wrong information in mails posted to a mailing list
and developing a knowledge base by using these mails. Then, we describe
a QA system which can answer how type questions based on the knowl-
edge base and show that question and answer mails posted to a mailing
list can be used as a knowledge base for a QA system.
