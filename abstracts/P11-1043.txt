Unsupervised word alignment is most often
modeled as a Markov process that generates a
sentence f conditioned on its translation e. A
similar model generating e from f will make
different alignment predictions. Statistical
machine translation systems combine the pre-
dictions of two directional models, typically
using heuristic combination procedures like
grow-diag-final. This paper presents a graph-
ical model that embeds two directional align-
ers into a single model. Inference can be per-
formed via dual decomposition, which reuses
the efficient inference algorithms of the direc-
tional models. Our bidirectional model en-
forces a one-to-one phrase constraint while ac-
counting for the uncertainty in the underlying
directional models. The resulting alignments
improve upon baseline combination heuristics
in word-level and phrase-level evaluations.
