 
In this paper, we describe the extension 
of an existing monolingual QA system 
for English-to-Chinese and English-to-
Japanese cross-lingual question answer-
ing (CLQA). We also attempt to charac-
terize the influence of translation on 
CLQA performance through experimen-
tal evaluation and analysis. The paper 
also describes some language-specific is-
sues for keyword translation in CLQA.
