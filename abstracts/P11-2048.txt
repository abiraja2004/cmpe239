In this paper, we extend distant supervision
(DS) based on Wikipedia for Relation Extrac-
tion (RE) by considering (i) relations defined
in external repositories, e.g. YAGO, and (ii)
any subset of Wikipedia documents. We show
that training data constituted by sentences
containing pairs of named entities in target re-
lations is enough to produce reliable supervi-
sion. Our experiments with state-of-the-art re-
lation extraction models, trained on the above
data, show a meaningful F1 of 74.29% on a
manually annotated test set: this highly im-
proves the state-of-art in RE using DS. Addi-
tionally, our end-to-end experiments demon-
strated that our extractors can be applied to
any general text document.
