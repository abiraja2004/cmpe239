In this paper, we present results from a
Broadcast News story segmentation sys-
tem developed for the SRI NIGHTIN-
GALE system operating on English, Ara-
bic and Mandarin news shows to provide
input to subsequent question-answering
processes. Using a rule-induction algo-
rithm with automatically extracted acous-
tic and lexical features, we report success
rates that are competitive with state-of-
the-art systems on each input language.
We further demonstrate that features use-
ful for English and Mandarin are not dis-
criminative for Arabic.
