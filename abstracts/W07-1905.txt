 
In this paper we explore the possibilities 
that conversational agent technology offers 
for the improvement of the quality of hu-
man-machine interaction in a concrete area 
of application: the multimodal biometric 
authentication system. Our approach looks 
at the user perception effects related to the 
system interface rather than to the perform-
ance of the biometric technology itself. For 
this purpose we have created a multibio-
metric user test environment with two dif-
ferent interfaces or interaction metaphors: 
one with an embodied conversational agent 
and the other with on-screen text messages 
only. We present the results of an explora-
tory experiment that reveals interesting ef-
fects, related to the presence of a conversa-
tional agent, on the user?s perception of pa-
rameters such as privacy, ease of use, inva-
siveness or system security.
