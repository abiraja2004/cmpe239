We conduct a pilot study for task-oriented
evaluation of Multiword Expression (MWE)
in Statistical Machine Translation (SMT). We
propose two different integration strategies for
MWE in SMT, which take advantage of differ-
ent degrees of MWE semantic compositional-
ity and yield complementary improvements in
SMT quality on a large-scale translation task.1
