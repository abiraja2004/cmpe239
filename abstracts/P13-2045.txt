In this paper, we study the problem of au-
tomatically annotating the factoids present
in collective discourse. Factoids are in-
formation units that are shared between
instances of collective discourse and may
have many different ways of being realized
in words. Our approach divides this prob-
lem into two steps, using a graph-based
approach for each step: (1) factoid dis-
covery, finding groups of words that corre-
spond to the same factoid, and (2) factoid
assignment, using these groups of words
to mark collective discourse units that con-
tain the respective factoids. We study this
on two novel data sets: the New Yorker
caption contest data set, and the crossword
clues data set.
