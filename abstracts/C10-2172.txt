Existing works indicate that the absence
of explicit discourse connectives makes
it difficult to recognize implicit discourse
relations. In this paper we attempt to
overcome this difficulty for implicit rela-
tion recognition by automatically insert-
ing discourse connectives between argu-
ments with the use of a language model.
Then we propose two algorithms to lever-
age the information of these predicted
connectives. One is to use these pre-
dicted implicit connectives as additional
features in a supervised model. The other
is to perform implicit relation recognition
based only on these predicted connectives.
Results on Penn Discourse Treebank 2.0
show that predicted discourse connectives
help implicit relation recognition and the
first algorithm can achieve an absolute av-
erage f-score improvement of 3% over a
state of the art baseline system.
