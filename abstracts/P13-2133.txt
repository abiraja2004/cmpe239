This paper presents an approach that ex-
tends the standard approach used for bilin-
gual lexicon extraction from comparable
corpora. We focus on the unresolved prob-
lem of polysemous words revealed by the
bilingual dictionary and introduce a use of
a Word Sense Disambiguation process that
aims at improving the adequacy of con-
text vectors. On two specialized French-
English comparable corpora, empirical ex-
perimental results show that our method
improves the results obtained by two state-
of-the-art approaches.
