With the increase in popularity of online re-
view sites comes a corresponding need for
tools capable of extracting the information
most important to the user from the plain text
data. Due to the diversity in products and ser-
vices being reviewed, supervised methods are
often not practical. We present an unsuper-
vised system for extracting aspects and deter-
mining sentiment in review text. The method
is simple and flexible with regard to domain
and language, and takes into account the in-
fluence of aspect on sentiment polarity, an is-
sue largely ignored in previous literature. We
demonstrate its effectiveness on both compo-
nent tasks, where it achieves similar results to
more complex semi-supervised methods that
are restricted by their reliance on manual an-
notation and extensive knowledge sources.
