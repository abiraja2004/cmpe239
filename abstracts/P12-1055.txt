Tweets represent a critical source of fresh in-
formation, in which named entities occur fre-
quently with rich variations. We study the
problem of named entity normalization (NEN)
for tweets. Two main challenges are the er-
rors propagated from named entity recogni-
tion (NER) and the dearth of information in
a single tweet. We propose a novel graphi-
cal model to simultaneously conduct NER and
NEN on multiple tweets to address these chal-
lenges. Particularly, our model introduces a
binary random variable for each pair of words
with the same lemma across similar tweets,
whose value indicates whether the two related
words are mentions of the same entity. We
evaluate our method on a manually annotated
data set, and show that our method outper-
forms the baseline that handles these two tasks
separately, boosting the F1 from 80.2% to
83.6% for NER, and the Accuracy from 79.4%
to 82.6% for NEN, respectively.
