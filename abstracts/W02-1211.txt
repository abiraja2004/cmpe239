large-scale (above 500,000 pair sentences) 
Chinese-English parallel corpus. The current 
status of Chinese corpora is overviewed with 
the emphasis on parallel corpus. The XML 
coding principles for Chinese?English 
parallel corpus are discussed. The sentence 
alignment algorithm used in this project is 
described with a computer-aided checking 
processing. Finally, we show the design of 
the concordance of the parallel corpus and 
the prospect to further development.
