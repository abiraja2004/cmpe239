Generic rule-based systems for Information
Extraction (IE) have been shown to work
reasonably well out-of-the-box, and achieve
state-of-the-art accuracy with further domain
customization. However, it is generally rec-
ognized that manually building and customiz-
ing rules is a complex and labor intensive pro-
cess. In this paper, we discuss an approach
that facilitates the process of building cus-
tomizable rules for Named-Entity Recognition
(NER) tasks via rule induction, in the Annota-
tion Query Language (AQL). Given a set of
basic features and an annotated document col-
lection, our goal is to generate an initial set
of rules with reasonable accuracy, that are in-
terpretable and thus can be easily refined by
a human developer. We present an efficient
rule induction process, modeled on a four-
stage manual rule development process and
present initial promising results with our sys-
tem. We also propose a simple notion of ex-
tractor complexity as a first step to quantify
the interpretability of an extractor, and study
the effect of induction bias and customization
of basic features on the accuracy and complex-
ity of induced rules. We demonstrate through
experiments that the induced rules have good
accuracy and low complexity according to our
complexity measure.
