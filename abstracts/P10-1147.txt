We present a discriminative model that di-
rectly predicts which set of phrasal transla-
tion rules should be extracted from a sen-
tence pair. Our model scores extraction
sets: nested collections of all the overlap-
ping phrase pairs consistent with an under-
lying word alignment. Extraction set mod-
els provide two principle advantages over
word-factored alignment models. First,
we can incorporate features on phrase
pairs, in addition to word links. Second,
we can optimize for an extraction-based
loss function that relates directly to the
end task of generating translations. Our
model gives improvements in alignment
quality relative to state-of-the-art unsuper-
vised and supervised baselines, as well
as providing up to a 1.4 improvement in
BLEU score in Chinese-to-English trans-
lation experiments.
