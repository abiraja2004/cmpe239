We describe a method for disambiguating Chi-
nese commas that is central to Chinese sen-
tence segmentation. Chinese sentence seg-
mentation is viewed as the detection of loosely
coordinated clauses separated by commas.
Trained and tested on data derived from the
Chinese Treebank, our model achieves a clas-
sification accuracy of close to 90% overall,
which translates to an F1 score of 70% for
detecting commas that signal sentence bound-
aries.
