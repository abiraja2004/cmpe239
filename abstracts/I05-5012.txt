Summary sentences are often para-
phrases of existing sentences. They
may be made up of recycled fragments
of text taken from important sentences
in an input document. We investigate
the use of a statistical sentence gener-
ation technique that recombines words
probabilistically in order to create new
sentences. Given a set of event-related
sentences, we use an extended version
of the Viterbi algorithm which employs
dependency relation and bigram proba-
bilities to find the most probable sum-
mary sentence. Using precision and
recall metrics for verb arguments as a
measure of grammaticality, we find that
our system performs better than a bi-
gram baseline, producing fewer spuri-
ous verb arguments.
