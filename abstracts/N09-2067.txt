In this paper, we propose a novel question
answering system that searches for responses
from spoken documents such as broadcast
news stories and conversations. We propose a
novel two-step approach, which we refer to as
anchored speech recognition, to improve the
speech recognition of the sentence that sup-
ports the answer. In the first step, the sen-
tence that is highly likely to contain the an-
swer is retrieved among the spoken data that
has been transcribed using a generic automatic
speech recognition (ASR) system. This candi-
date sentence is then re-recognized in the sec-
ond step by constraining the ASR search space
using the lexical information in the question.
Our analysis showed that ASR errors caused
a 35% degradation in the performance of the
question answering system. Experiments with
the proposed anchored recognition approach
indicated a significant improvement in the per-
formance of the question answering module,
recovering 30% of the answers erroneous due
to ASR.
