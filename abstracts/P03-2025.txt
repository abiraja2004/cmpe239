The present paper will seek to present
an approach to bilingual lexicon extrac-
tion from non-aligned comparable cor-
pora, phrasal translation as well as evalua-
tions on Cross-Language Information Re-
trieval. A two-stages translation model
is proposed for the acquisition of bilin-
gual terminology from comparable cor-
pora, disambiguation and selection of best
translation alternatives according to their
linguistics-based knowledge. Different re-
scoring techniques are proposed and eval-
uated in order to select best phrasal trans-
lation alternatives. Results demonstrate
that the proposed translation model yields
better translations and retrieval effective-
ness could be achieved across Japanese-
English language pair.
