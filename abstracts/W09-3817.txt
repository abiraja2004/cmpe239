We present a method for dependency and
case structure analysis that captures the
consistency between intra-clause relations
(i.e., case structures or predicate-argument
structures) and inter-clause relations. We
assess intra-clause relations on the basis
of case frames and inter-clause relations
on the basis of transition knowledge be-
tween case frames. Both knowledge bases
are automatically acquired from a mas-
sive amount of parses of a Web corpus.
The significance of this study is that the
proposed method selects the best depen-
dency and case structure that are con-
sistent within each clause and between
clauses. We confirm that this method con-
tributes to the improvement of dependency
parsing of Japanese.
