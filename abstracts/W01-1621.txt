In this paper we consider how ini-
tiative is managed in dialogue. We
propose that initiative is subordi-
nate to the intentional hierarchy of
discourse structure. In dialogues
from the TRAINS corpus we nd
that inside a segment initiated by
one speaker, the other speaker only
makes two types of contributions: a
special kind of acknowledgment we
call forward acknowledgments, and
short contributions that add content
to the segment. The proposal has
important implications for dialogue
management: a system only needs
to model intentional structure, from
which initiative follows.
