 
This paper presents a Chinese word 
segmentation system for CIPS-SIGHAN 
2010 Chinese language processing task. 
Firstly, based on Conditional Random 
Field (CRF) model, with local features 
and global features, the character-based 
tagging model is designed. Secondly, 
Hidden Markov Models (HMM) is used 
to revise the substrings with low marginal 
probability by CRF. Finally, confidence 
measure is used to regenerate the result 
and simple rules to deal with the strings 
within letters and numbers. As is well 
known that character-based approach has 
outstanding capability of discovering 
out-of-vocabulary (OOV) word, but ex-
ternal information of word lost. HMM 
makes use of word information to in-
crease in-vocabulary (IV) recall. We par-
ticipate in the simplified Chinese word 
segmentation both closed and open test 
on all four corpora, which belong to dif-
ferent domains. Our system achieves bet-
ter performance.
