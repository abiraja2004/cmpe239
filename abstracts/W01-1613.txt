  
Manually verified pitch data were compared 
with output from a commonly used pitch-
tracking algorithm. The manual pitch data 
made statistically significantly better ?final 
rise? predictions than the automatic pitch 
data, in spite of great similarity between the 
two sets of measurements. Pitch Tracking 
doubling/halving errors are described.
