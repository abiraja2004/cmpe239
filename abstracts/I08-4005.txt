 
This paper investigates a machine learning 
approach for identification of temporal re-
lation between events in Chinese text. We 
proposed a temporal relation annotation 
guideline (Cheng, 2007) and constructed 
temporal information annotated corpora. 
However, our previous criteria did not deal 
with various uses of Chinese verbs. For 
supplementing the previous version of our 
criteria, we introduce attributes of verbs 
that describe event types. We illustrate the 
attributes by the different examples of verb 
usages. We perform an experiment to 
evaluate the effect of our event type attrib-
utes in the temporal relation identification. 
As far as we know, this is the first work of 
temporal relation identification between 
verbs in Chinese texts. The result shows 
that the use of the attributes of verbs can 
improve the annotation accuracy.
