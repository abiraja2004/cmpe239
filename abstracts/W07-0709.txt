 
We propose a novel syntax-based model 
for statistical machine translation in which 
meta-structure (MS) and meta-structure se-
quence (SMS) of a parse tree are defined. 
In this framework, a parse tree is decom-
posed into SMS to deal with the structure 
divergence and the alignment can be recon-
structed at different levels of recombination 
of MS (RM). RM pairs extracted can per-
form the mapping between the sub-
structures across languages.  As a result, 
we have got not only the translation for the 
target language, but an SMS of its parse 
tree at the same time. Experiments with 
BLEU metric show that the model signifi-
cantly outperforms Pharaoh, a state-art-the-
art phrase-based system.
