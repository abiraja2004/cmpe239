In this paper, we present results of our ex-
periments with ASR for a highly inflected
Dravidian language, Telugu. First, we pro-
pose a new metric for evaluating ASR per-
formance for inflectional languages (Inflec-
tional Word Error Rate IWER) which takes
into account whether the incorrectly recog-
nized word corresponds to the same lexi-
con lemma or not. We also present results
achieved by applying a novel method ? er-
rgrams ? to ASR lattice. With respect to
confidence scores, the method tries to learn
typical error patterns, which are then used
for lattice correction, and applied just be-
fore standard lattice rescoring. Our confi-
dence measures are based on word posteri-
ors and were improved by applying antimod-
els trained on anti-examples generated by
the standard N-gram language model. For
Telugu language, we decreased the WER
from 45.2% to 40.4% (by 4.8% absolute),
and the IWER from 41.6% to 39.5% (2.1 %
absolute), with respect to the baseline per-
formance. All improvements are statistically
significant using all three standard NIST sig-
nificance tests for ASR.
