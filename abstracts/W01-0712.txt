This paper reports on the LEARNING
COMPUTATIONAL GRAMMARS (LCG)
project, a postdoc network devoted to
studying the application of machine
learning techniques to grammars suit-
able for computational use. We were in-
terested in a more systematic survey to
understand the relevance of many fac-
tors to the success of learning, esp. the
availability of annotated data, the kind
of dependencies in the data, and the
availability of knowledge bases (gram-
mars). We focused on syntax, esp. noun
phrase (NP) syntax.
