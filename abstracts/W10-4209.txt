The semantic web is a general vision
for supporting knowledge-based process-
ing across the WWW and its successors.
As such, semantic web technology has po-
tential to support the exchange and pro-
cessing of complex NLG data. This pa-
per discusses one particular approach to
data sharing and exchange that was de-
veloped for NLG ? the RAGS framework.
This was developed independently of the
semantic web. RAGS was relatively com-
plex and involved a number of idiosyn-
cratic features. However, we present a ra-
tional reconstruction of RAGS in terms of
semantic web concepts, which yields a rel-
atively simple approach that can exploit
semantic web technology directly. Given
that RAGS was motivated by the concerns
of the NLG community, it is perhaps re-
markable that its aspirations seem to fit so
well with semantic web technology.
