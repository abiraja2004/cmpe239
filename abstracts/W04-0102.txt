 
The paper reports on the behaviour of a Koho-
nen map of the mental lexicon, monitored 
through different phases of acquisition of the 
Italian verb system. Reported experiments ap-
pear to consistently reproduce emergent global 
ordering constraints on memory traces of in-
flected verb forms, developed through princi-
ples of local interactions between parallel 
processing neurons.
