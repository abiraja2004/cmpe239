This paper describes the system used by the
LIPN team in the Semantic Textual Similarity
task at *SEM 2013. It uses a support vector re-
gression model, combining different text sim-
ilarity measures that constitute the features.
These measures include simple distances like
Levenshtein edit distance, cosine, Named En-
tities overlap and more complex distances like
Explicit Semantic Analysis, WordNet-based
similarity, IR-based similarity, and a similar-
ity measure based on syntactic dependencies.
