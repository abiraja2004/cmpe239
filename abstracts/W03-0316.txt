 
Corpus-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) 
tasks for such popular languages as English, French, 
etc. have been well studied with satisfactory 
achievements. In contrast, corpus-based NLP tasks for 
unpopular languages (e.g. Vietnamese) are at a 
deadlock due to absence of annotated training data for 
these languages. Furthermore, hand-annotation of even 
reasonably well-determined features such as part-of-
speech (POS) tags has proved to be labor intensive and 
costly. In this paper, we suggest a solution to partially 
overcome the annotated resource shortage in 
Vietnamese by building a POS-tagger for an 
automatically word-aligned English-Vietnamese 
parallel Corpus (named EVC). This POS-tagger made 
use of the Transformation-Based Learning (or TBL) 
method to bootstrap the POS-annotation results of the 
English POS-tagger by exploiting the POS-information 
of the corresponding Vietnamese words via their word-
alignments in EVC. Then, we directly project POS-
annotations from English side to Vietnamese via 
available word alignments. This POS-annotated 
Vietnamese corpus will be manually corrected to 
become an annotated training data for Vietnamese NLP 
tasks such as POS-tagger, Phrase-Chunker, Parser, 
Word-Sense Disambiguator, etc.
