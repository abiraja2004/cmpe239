 
In this paper, we describe the Template Matcher, a sys- 
tem built at SRI to provide robust natural-language 
interpretation in the Air Travel Information System 
(ATIS) domain. The system appears to be robust to 
both speech recognition errors and unanticipated or dif- 
ficult locutions used by speakers. We explain the mo- 
tivation for the Template Matcher, describe in general 
terms how it works in comparison with similar systems, 
and examine its performance. We discuss some limita- 
tions of this approach, and sketch a plan for integrating 
the Template Matcher with an analytic parser, which we 
believe will combine the advantages of both.
