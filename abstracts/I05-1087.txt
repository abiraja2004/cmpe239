. Mining terminology translation from a large amount of Web data can 
be applied in many fields such as reading/writing assistant, machine translation 
and cross-language information retrieval. How to find more comprehensive re-
sults from the Web and obtain the boundary of candidate translations, and how 
to remove irrelevant noises and rank the remained candidates are the challeng-
ing issues. In this paper, after reviewing and analyzing all possible methods of 
acquiring translations, a feasible statistics-based method is proposed to mine 
terminology translation from the Web. In the proposed method, on the basis of 
an analysis of different forms of term translation distributions, character-based 
string frequency estimation is presented to construct term translation candidates 
for exploring more translations and their boundaries, and then sort-based subset 
deletion and mutual information methods are respectively proposed to deal with 
subset redundancy information and prefix/suffix redundancy information 
formed in the process of estimation. Extensive experiments on two test sets of 
401 and 3511 English terms validate that our system has better performance.
