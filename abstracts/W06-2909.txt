Recent work on Semantic Role Labeling
(SRL) has shown that to achieve high
accuracy a joint inference on the whole
predicate argument structure should be ap-
plied. In this paper, we used syntactic sub-
trees that span potential argument struc-
tures of the target predicate in tree ker-
nel functions. This allows Support Vec-
tor Machines to discern between correct
and incorrect predicate structures and to
re-rank them based on the joint probabil-
ity of their arguments. Experiments on the
PropBank data show that both classifica-
tion and re-ranking based on tree kernels
can improve SRL systems.
