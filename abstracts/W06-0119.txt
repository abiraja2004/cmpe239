 
This paper describes a Chinese word 
segmentor (CWS) for the third Inter-
national Chinese Language Processing 
Bakeoff (SIGHAN Bakeoff 2006). We 
participate in the word segmentation 
task at the Microsoft Research (MSR) 
closed testing track. Our CWS is based 
on backward maximum matching with 
word support model (WSM) and con-
textual-based Chinese unknown word 
identification. From the scored results 
and our experimental results, it shows 
WSM can improve our previous CWS, 
which was reported at the SIGHAN 
Bakeoff 2005, about 1% of F-measure.
