We describe a novel approach to detecting
empty categories (EC) as represented in de-
pendency trees as well as a new metric for
measuring EC detection accuracy. The new
metric takes into account not only the position
and type of an EC, but also the head it is a
dependent of in a dependency tree. We also
introduce a variety of new features that are
more suited for this approach. Tested on a sub-
set of the Chinese Treebank, our system im-
proved significantly over the best previously
reported results even when evaluated with this
more stringent metric.
