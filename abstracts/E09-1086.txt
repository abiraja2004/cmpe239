We propose an unsupervised method for
distinguishing literal and non-literal us-
ages of idiomatic expressions. Our
method determines how well a literal inter-
pretation is linked to the overall cohesive
structure of the discourse. If strong links
can be found, the expression is classified
as literal, otherwise as idiomatic. We show
that this method can help to tell apart lit-
eral and non-literal usages, even for id-
ioms which occur in canonical form.
