The Clinical E-Science Framework (CLEF)
project has built a system to extract clin-
ically significant information from the tex-
tual component of medical records, for clin-
ical research, evidence-based healthcare and
genotype-meets-phenotype informatics. One
part of this system is the identification of rela-
tionships between clinically important entities
in the text. Typical approaches to relationship
extraction in this domain have used full parses,
domain-specific grammars, and large knowl-
edge bases encoding domain knowledge. In
other areas of biomedical NLP, statistical ma-
chine learning approaches are now routinely
applied to relationship extraction. We report
on the novel application of these statistical
techniques to clinical relationships.
We describe a supervised machine learning
system, trained with a corpus of oncology nar-
ratives hand-annotated with clinically impor-
tant relationships. Various shallow features
are extracted from these texts, and used to
train statistical classifiers. We compare the
suitability of these features for clinical re-
lationship extraction, how extraction varies
between inter- and intra-sentential relation-
ships, and examine the amount of training data
needed to learn various relationships.
