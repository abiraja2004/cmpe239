Quotes are used in news articles as evi-
dence of a person?s opinion, and thus are
a useful target for opinion mining. How-
ever, labelling each quote with a polarity
score directed at a textually-anchored tar-
get can ignore the broader issue that the
speaker is commenting on. We address
this by instead labelling quotes as support-
ing or opposing a clear expression of a
point of view on a topic, called a position
statement. Using this we construct a cor-
pus covering 7 topics with 2,228 quotes.
