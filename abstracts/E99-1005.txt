 
This paper explores the determinants of 
adjective-noun plausibility by using cor- 
relation analysis to compare judgements 
elicited from human subjects with five 
corpus-based variables: co-occurrence fre- 
quency of the adjective-noun pair, noun fre- 
quency, conditional probability of the noun 
given the adjective, the log-likelihood ra- 
tio, and Resnik's (1993) selectional asso- 
ciation measure. The highest correlation is
obtained with the co-occurrence frequency, 
which points to the strongly lexicalist and 
collocational nature of adjective-noun com- 
binations.
