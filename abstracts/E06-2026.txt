In this paper, we present a formalization
of grammatical role labeling within the
framework of Integer Linear Programming
(ILP). We focus on the integration of sub-
categorization information into the deci-
sion making process. We present a first
empirical evaluation that achieves compet-
itive precision and recall rates.
