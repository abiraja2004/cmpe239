 
In this work we present the results of ex-
perimental work on the development of 
lexical class-based lexica by automatic 
means. Our purpose is to assess the use 
of linguistic lexical-class based informa-
tion as a feature selection methodology 
for the use of classifiers in quick lexical 
development. The results show that the 
approach can help reduce the human ef-
fort required in the development of lan-
guage resources significantly.
