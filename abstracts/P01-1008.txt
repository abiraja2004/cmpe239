While paraphrasing is critical both for
interpretation and generation of natu-
ral language, current systems use man-
ual or semi-automatic methods to col-
lect paraphrases. We present an un-
supervised learning algorithm for iden-
tification of paraphrases from a cor-
pus of multiple English translations of
the same source text. Our approach
yields phrasal and single word lexical
paraphrases as well as syntactic para-
phrases.
