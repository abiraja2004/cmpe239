In this paper, I will argue that the well-
known ambiguity of directional prepo-
sitions between the intrinsic and rela-
tive readings is not lexical, but can be
interpreted as a framework assignment
ambiguity of the type observed in the
temporal domain. A DRT semantics
will then be constructed around a uni-
fied model of framework assignment
which can be applied across the board
to all three universal frame types.
