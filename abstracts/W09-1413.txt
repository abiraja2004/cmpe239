In this paper, we present BioEve a fully auto-
mated event extraction system for bio-medical
text. It first semantically classifies each sen-
tence to the class type of the event mentioned
in the sentence, and then using high coverage
hand-crafted rules, it extracts the participants
of that event. We participated in Task 1 of
BioNLP 2009 Shared task, and the final eval-
uation results are described here. Our exper-
imentation with different approaches to clas-
sify a sentence to bio-interaction classes are
also shared.
