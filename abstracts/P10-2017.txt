This paper describes ongoing work on dis-
tributional models for word meaning in
context. We abandon the usual one-vector-
per-word paradigm in favor of an exemplar
model that activates only relevant occur-
rences. On a paraphrasing task, we find
that a simple exemplar model outperforms
more complex state-of-the-art models.
