In this paper we address the problem of ques-
tion recommendation from large archives of
community question answering data by ex-
ploiting the users? information needs. Our
experimental results indicate that questions
based on the same or similar information need
can provide excellent question recommenda-
tion. We show that translation model can be
effectively utilized to predict the information
need given only the user?s query question. Ex-
periments show that the proposed information
need prediction approach can improve the per-
formance of question recommendation.
