Applying statistical parsers developed for
English to languages with freer word-
order has turned out to be harder than
expected. This paper investigates the
adequacy of different statistical parsing
models for dealing with a (relatively)
free word-order language. We show
that the recently proposed Relational-
Realizational (RR) model consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art Head-Driven
(HD) models on the Hebrew Treebank.
Our analysis reveals a weakness of HD
models: their intrinsic focus on configu-
rational information. We conclude that the
form-function separation ingrained in RR
models makes them better suited for pars-
ing nonconfigurational phenomena.
