Morphological lexica are often imple-
mented on top of morphological paradigms,
corresponding to different ways of building
the full inflection table of a word. Compu-
tationally precise lexica may use hundreds
of paradigms, and it can be hard for a lex-
icographer to choose among them. To au-
tomate this task, this paper introduces the
notion of a smart paradigm. It is a meta-
paradigm, which inspects the base form and
tries to infer which low-level paradigm ap-
plies. If the result is uncertain, more forms
are given for discrimination. The number
of forms needed in average is a measure
of predictability of an inflection system.
The overall complexity of the system also
has to take into account the code size of
the paradigms definition itself. This pa-
per evaluates the smart paradigms imple-
mented in the open-source GF Resource
Grammar Library. Predictability and com-
plexity are estimated for four different lan-
guages: English, French, Swedish, and
Finnish. The main result is that predictabil-
ity does not decrease when the complex-
ity of morphology grows, which means that
smart paradigms provide an efficient tool
for the manual construction and/or auto-
matically bootstrapping of lexica.
