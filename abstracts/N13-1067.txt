Bibliometric measures are commonly used to
estimate the popularity and the impact of pub-
lished research. Existing bibliometric mea-
sures provide ?quantitative? indicators of how
good a published paper is. This does not nec-
essarily reflect the ?quality? of the work pre-
sented in the paper. For example, when h-
index is computed for a researcher, all incom-
ing citations are treated equally, ignoring the
fact that some of these citations might be neg-
ative. In this paper, we propose using NLP
to add a ?qualitative? aspect to biblometrics.
We analyze the text that accompanies citations
in scientific articles (which we term citation
context). We propose supervised methods for
identifying citation text and analyzing it to de-
termine the purpose (i.e. author intention) and
the polarity (i.e. author sentiment) of citation.
