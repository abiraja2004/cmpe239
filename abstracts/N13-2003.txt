In this paper we propose an automatic term
extraction approach that uses machine learn-
ing incorporating varied and rich features of
candidate terms. In our preliminary experi-
ments, we also tested different attribute se-
lection methods to verify which features are
more relevant for automatic term extraction.
We achieved state of the art results for uni-
gram extraction in Brazilian Portuguese.
