  
The treatment of factual data has been 
widely studied in different areas of Nat-
ural Language Processing (NLP). How-
ever, processing subjective information 
still poses important challenges. This 
paper presents research aimed at assess-
ing techniques that have been suggested 
as appropriate in the context of subjec-
tive - Opinion Question Answering 
(OQA). We evaluate the performance of 
an OQA with these new components 
and propose methods to optimally tackle 
the issues encountered. We assess the 
impact of including additional resources 
and processes with the purpose of im-
proving the system performance on two 
distinct blog datasets. The improve-
ments obtained for the different combi-
nation of tools are statistically signifi-
cant. We thus conclude that the pro-
posed approach is adequate for the OQA 
task, offering a good strategy to deal 
with opinionated questions.
