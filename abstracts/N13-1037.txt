The rise of social media has brought compu-
tational linguistics in ever-closer contact with
bad language: text that defies our expecta-
tions about vocabulary, spelling, and syntax.
This paper surveys the landscape of bad lan-
guage, and offers a critical review of the NLP
community?s response, which has largely fol-
lowed two paths: normalization and domain
adaptation. Each approach is evaluated in the
context of theoretical and empirical work on
computer-mediated communication. In addi-
tion, the paper presents a quantitative analy-
sis of the lexical diversity of social media text,
and its relationship to other corpora.
