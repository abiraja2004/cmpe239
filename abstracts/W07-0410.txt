 
This paper seeks to complement the cur-
rent trend of adding more structure to Sta-
tistical Machine Translation systems, by 
exploring the opposite direction: adding 
statistical components to a Transfer-Based 
MT system. Initial results on the BTEC 
data show significant improvement ac-
cording to three automatic evaluation 
metrics (BLEU, NIST and METEOR).
