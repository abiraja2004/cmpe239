We present an approach to grammatical er-
ror correction for the CoNLL 2013 shared
task based on a weighted tree-to-string
transducer. Rules for the transducer are
extracted from the NUCLE training data.
An n-gram language model is used to
rerank k-best sentence lists generated by
the transducer. Our system obtains a pre-
cision, recall and F1 score of 0.27, 0.1333
and 0.1785, respectively, on the official
test set. On the revised annotations, the
F1 score increases to 0.2505. Our system
ranked 6th out of the participating teams
on both the original and revised test set an-
notations.
