We present an approach to ontology popu-
lation based on a lexical substitution tech-
nique. It consists in estimating the plausi-
bility of sentences where the named entity
to be classified is substituted with the ones
contained in the training data, in our case,
a partially populated ontology. Plausibility
is estimated by using Web data, while the
classification algorithm is instance-based.
We evaluated our method on two different
ontology population tasks. Experiments
show that our solution is effective, out-
performing existing methods, and it can
be applied to practical ontology population
problems.
