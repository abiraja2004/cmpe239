While subjectivity related research in
other languages has increased, most of the
work focuses on single languages. This
paper explores the integration of features
originating from multiple languages into
a machine learning approach to subjectiv-
ity analysis, and aims to show that this
enriched feature set provides for more ef-
fective modeling for the source as well
as the target languages. We show not
only that we are able to achieve over
75% macro accuracy in all of the six lan-
guages we experiment with, but also that
by using features drawn from multiple
languages we can construct high-precision
meta-classifiers with a precision of over
83%.
