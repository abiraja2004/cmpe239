Computer users increasingly need to pro-
duce text written in multiple languages.
However, typical computer interfaces re-
quire the user to change the text entry soft-
ware each time a different language is used.
This is cumbersome, especially when lan-
guage changes are frequent.
To solve this problem, we propose TypeAny,
a novel front-end interface that detects the
language of the user?s key entry and au-
tomatically dispatches the input to the ap-
propriate text entry system. Unlike previ-
ously reported methods, TypeAny can han-
dle more than two languages, and can easily
support any new language even if the avail-
able corpus is small.
When evaluating this method, we obtained
language detection accuracy of 96.7% when
an appropriate language had to be chosen
from among three languages. The number of
control actions needed to switch languages
was decreased over 93% when using Ty-
peAny rather than a conventional method.
