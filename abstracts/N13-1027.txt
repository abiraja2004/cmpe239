We here present and compare two unsuper-
vised approaches for inducing the main con-
ceptual information in rather stereotypical
summaries in two different languages. We
evaluate the two approaches in two differ-
ent information extraction settings: mono-
lingual and cross-lingual information extrac-
tion. The extraction systems are trained on
auto-annotated summaries (containing the in-
duced concepts) and evaluated on human-
annotated documents. Extraction results are
promising, being close in performance to
those achieved when the system is trained on
human-annotated summaries.
