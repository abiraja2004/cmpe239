 
Many corpus-based machine translation 
systems require parallel corpora. In this 
paper, we present a word-for-word glossing 
algorithm that requires only a source 
language corpus. To gloss a word, we first 
identify its similar words that occurred in 
the same context in a large corpus. We then 
determine the gloss by maximizing the 
similarity between the set of contextually 
similar words and the different ranslations 
of the word in a bilingual thesaurus.
