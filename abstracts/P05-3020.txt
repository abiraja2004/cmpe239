 
The problem of part-of-speech induction 
from text involves two aspects: Firstly, a 
set of word classes is to be derived auto-
matically. Secondly, each word of a vo-
cabulary is to be assigned to one or sev-
eral of these word classes. In this paper 
we present a method that solves both 
problems with good accuracy. Our ap-
proach adopts a mixture of statistical me-
thods that have been successfully applied 
in word sense induction. Its main advan-
tage over previous attempts is that it re-
duces the syntactic space to only the most 
important dimensions, thereby almost eli-
minating the otherwise omnipresent prob-
lem of data sparseness.
