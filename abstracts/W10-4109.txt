This paper presents an unsupervised
Chinese Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging
model based on the first-order HMM.
Unlike the conventional HMM, the num-
ber of hidden states is not fixed and will
be increased to fit the training data. In
favor of sparse distribution, the Dirich-
let priors are introduced with variational
inference method. To reduce the emis-
sion variables, words are represented by
their contexts and clustered based on the
distributional similarities between con-
texts. Experiment results show the out-
put state sequence of HMM are highly
correlated to the latent annotations of
gold POS tags, in context of clustering
similarity measures. The other exper-
iments on a real application, unsuper-
vised dependency parsing, reveal that the
output sequence can replace the manu-
ally annotated tags without loss of accu-
racies.
