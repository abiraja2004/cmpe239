We present a system for the large scale in-
duction of cognate groups. Our model ex-
plains the evolution of cognates as a sequence
of mutations and innovations along a phy-
logeny. On the task of identifying cognates
from over 21,000 words in 218 different lan-
guages from the Oceanic language family, our
model achieves a cluster purity score over
91%, while maintaining pairwise recall over
62%.
