We present a system description of the
WINGNUS team work
1
for the SemEval-
2010 task #5 Automatic Keyphrase Ex-
traction from Scientific Articles. A key
feature of our system is that it utilizes an
inferred document logical structure in our
candidate identification process, to limit
the number of phrases in the candidate list,
while maintaining its coverage of impor-
tant phrases. Our top performing system
achieves an F
1
of 25.22% for the com-
bined keyphrases (author and reader as-
signed) in the final test data. We note that
the method we report here is novel and or-
thogonal from other systems, so it can be
combined with other techniques to poten-
tially achieve higher performance.
