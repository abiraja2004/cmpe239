We present a method for speeding up the
calculation of tree kernels during train-
ing. The calculation of tree kernels is still
heavy even with efficient dynamic pro-
gramming (DP) procedures. Our method
maps trees into a small feature space
where the inner product, which can be cal-
culated much faster, yields the same value
as the tree kernel for most tree pairs. The
training is sped up by using the DP pro-
cedure only for the exceptional pairs. We
describe an algorithm that detects such ex-
ceptional pairs and converts trees into vec-
tors in a feature space. We propose tree
kernels on marked labeled ordered trees
and show that the training of SVMs for
semantic role labeling using these kernels
can be sped up by a factor of several tens.
