In line with the growing interest in conver-
sational agents as companions, we are de-
veloping a toy companion for children that
is capable of engaging interactions and of
developing a long-term relationship with
them, and is extensible so as to evolve with
them. In this paper, we investigate the im-
portance of personalising interaction both
for engagement and for long-term relation-
ship development. In particular, we pro-
pose a framework for representing, gath-
ering and using personal knowledge about
the child during dialogue interaction. 1
