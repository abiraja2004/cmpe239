This paper describes the component models and
combination model built as a joint effort be-
tween Swarthmore College, Hong Kong PolyU, and
HKUST. Though other models described elsewhere
contributed to the final combination model, this pa-
per focuses solely on the joint contributions to the
?Swat-HK? effort.
