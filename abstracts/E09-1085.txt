 
This paper describes a fully incremental dia-
logue system that can engage in dialogues 
in a simple domain, number dictation. Be-
cause it uses incremental speech recognition 
and prosodic analysis, the system can give 
rapid feedback as the user is speaking, with 
a very short latency of around 200ms.  Be-
cause it uses incremental speech synthesis 
and self-monitoring, the system can react to 
feedback from the user as the system is 
speaking. A comparative evaluation shows 
that na?ve users preferred this system over a 
non-incremental version, and that it was 
perceived as more human-like. 1
