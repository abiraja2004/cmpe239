 
Computer softwares for processing 
Thai language are developed at National 
Museum of Ethnology,Osaka,Japan. We use 
a popular intell igent terminal TEKTRONIX 
4051 for inputting and edit ing,IBM 370 
model 138 for KWIC making and sorting, 
and CANON's laser beam printer for final 
output. 
Using these systems,"Kotmai Tra Sam 
Duang"(the Three Seals Law)which con- 
tains many kind of laws and ordinances 
proclaimed in Thai between 1350-1805 
A.D. is computerized. This text has 1700 
pages and about 1400000 letters. KWIC 
index becomes 200000 lines. 
Some statistical data for this text 
are obtained. They are occurrence fre- 
quency data of single letter,group vowel, 
and letter combination(digram),etc.
