This paper presents a method for identifying
non-English speech, with the aim of support-
ing an automated speech proficiency scoring
system for non-native speakers.
The method uses a popular technique from the
language identification domain, a single phone
recognizer followed by multiple language-
dependent language models. This method
determines the language of a speech sample
based on the phonotactic differences among
languages.
The method is intended for use with non-
native English speakers. Therefore, the
method must be able to distinguish non-
English responses from non-native speakers?
English responses. This makes the task more
challenging, as the frequent pronunciation er-
rors of non-native speakers may weaken the
phonetic and phonotactic distinction between
English responses and non-English responses.
In order to address this issue, the speaking
rate measure was used to complement the
language identification based features in the
model.
The accuracy of the method was 98%, and
there was 45% relative error reduction over
a system based on the conventional language
identification technique. The model using
both feature sets furthermore demonstrated an
improvement in accuracy for speakers at all
English proficiency levels.
