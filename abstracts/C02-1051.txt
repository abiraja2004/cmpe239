 
This paper presents the Natural Language 
Processing-based linguistic analysis tool that 
we have developed for Japanese as a Second 
Language teachers.  This program, Zero De-
tector (ZD), aims to promote effective instruc-
tion of zero anaphora, on the basis of a hy-
pothesis about ideal conditions for second 
language acquisition, by making invisible 
zeros visible.  ZD takes Japanese written 
narrative discourse as input and provides the 
zero-specified texts and their underlying 
structures as output.  We evaluated ZD?s 
performance in terms of its zero detecting 
accuracy.  We also present an experimental 
report of its validity for practical use.  As a 
result, ZD has proven to be pedagogically 
feasible in terms of its accuracy and its impact 
on effective instruction.
