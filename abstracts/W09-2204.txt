Support Vector Machines present an interest-
ing and effective approach to solve automated
classification tasks. Although it only han-
dles binary and supervised problems by na-
ture, it has been transformed into multiclass
and semi-supervised approaches in several
works. A previous study on supervised and
semi-supervised SVM classification over bi-
nary taxonomies showed how the latter clearly
outperforms the former, proving the suitability
of unlabeled data for the learning phase in this
kind of tasks. However, the suitability of un-
labeled data for multiclass tasks using SVM
has never been tested before. In this work,
we present a study on whether unlabeled data
could improve results for multiclass web page
classification tasks using Support Vector Ma-
chines. As a conclusion, we encourage to rely
only on labeled data, both for improving (or at
least equaling) performance and for reducing
the computational cost.
