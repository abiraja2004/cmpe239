We discuss the advantages of lexical-
ized tree-adjoining grammar as an al-
ternative to lexicalized PCFG for sta-
tistical parsing, describing the induction
of a probabilistic LTAG model from the
Penn Treebank and evaluating its pars-
ing performance. We nd that this in-
duction method is an improvement over
the EM-based method of (Hwa, 1998),
and that the induced model yields re-
sults comparable to lexicalized PCFG.
