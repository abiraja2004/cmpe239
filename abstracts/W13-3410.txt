 
We present in the paper our experience of 
involving the students of the department 
of theoretical and computational linguis-
tics of the Moscow State University into 
full-cycle activities of preparing and eval-
uating the results of the NLP Evaluation 
forums, held in 2010 and 2012 in Russia. 
The forum of 2010 started as a new initia-
tive and was the first independent evalua-
tion of morphology parsers for Russian in 
Russia. At the same time the forum cam-
paign has been a source of a successful 
academic course which resulted in a close-
knit student team, strong enough to im-
plement the two-year research for the sec-
ond forum on syntax, held in 2012. The 
new forum of anaphora (to be held in 
2014) is now prepared mostly by students.
