This paper introduces a formal view of
the semantics and pragmatics of corrective
feedback in dialogues between adults and
children. The goal of this research is to
give a formal account of language coor-
dination in dialogue, and semantic coor-
dination in particular. Accounting for se-
mantic coordination requires (1) a seman-
tics, i.e. an architecture allowing for dy-
namic meanings and meaning updates as
results of dialogue moves, and (2) a prag-
matics, describing the dialogue moves in-
volved in semantic coordination. We illus-
trate the general approach by applying it
to some examples from the literature on
corrective feedback, and provide a fairly
detailed discussion of one example using
TTR (Type Theory with Records) to for-
malize concepts. TTR provides an analy-
sis of linguistic content which is structured
in order to allow modification and similar-
ity metrics, and a framework for describ-
ing dialogue moves and resulting updates
to linguistic resources.
