Query expansion by pseudo-relevance
feedback is a well-established technique
in both mono- and cross- lingual informa-
tion retrieval, enriching and disambiguat-
ing the typically terse queries provided
by searchers. Comparable document-side
expansion is a relatively more recent de-
velopment motivated by error-prone tran-
scription and translation processes in spo-
ken document and cross-language re-
trieval. In the cross-language case, one
can perform expansion before translation,
after translation, and at both points. We
investigate the relative impact of pre- and
post- translation document expansion for
cross-language spoken document retrieval
in Mandarin Chinese. We find that post-
translation expansion yields a highly sig-
nificant improvement in retrieval effec-
tiveness, while improvements due to pre-
translation expansion alone or in combina-
tion do not reach significance. We identify
two key factors of segmentation and trans-
lation in Chinese orthography that limit
the effectiveness of pre-translation expan-
sion in the Chinese-English case, while
post-translation expansion yields its full
benefit.
