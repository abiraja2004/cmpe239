In this paper, we argue on the interest of an-
choring Dutch Cultural Heritage controlled
vocabularies to WordNet, and demonstrate
a reusable methodology for achieving this
anchoring. We test it on two controlled
vocabularies, namely the GTAA thesaurus,
used at the Netherlands Institute for Sound
and Vision (the Dutch radio and television
archives), and the GTT thesaurus, used to in-
dex books of the Dutch National Library. We
evaluate the two anchorings having in mind a
concrete use case, namely generic alignment
scenarios where concepts from one thesaurus
must be aligned to concepts from the other.
