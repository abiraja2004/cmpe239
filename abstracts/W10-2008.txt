This paper presents a data-driven model
of eye movement control in reading that
builds on earlier work using machine
learning methods to model saccade behav-
ior. We extend previous work by model-
ing the time course of eye movements, in
addition to where the eyes move. In this
model, the initiation of eye movements is
delayed as a function of on-line process-
ing difficulty, and the decision of where to
move the eyes is guided by past reading
experience, approximated using machine
learning methods. In benchmarking the
model against held-out previously unseen
data, we show that it can predict gaze dura-
tions and skipping probabilities with good
accuracy.
