Understanding, as opposed to reading is
vital for the extraction of opinions out
of a text. This is especially true, as
an author?s opinion is not always clearly
marked. Finding the overall opinion in
a text can be challenging to both hu-
man readers and computers alike. Me-

of extracting information out of a text, by
means of human coders. We describe the
difficulties humans have and the process
they use to extract opinions and offer a
formalization that could help to automate
opinion extraction within the Media Con-
tent Analysis framework.
