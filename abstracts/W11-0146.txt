The MultiModal Interface Language formalism (MMIL) has been selected as the High Level
Semantic (HLS) formalism for annotating the French MEDIA dialogue corpus. This corpus is com-
posed of human-machine dialogues in the domain of hotel reservation and tourist information. Utter-
ances in dialogues have been previously annotated with a concept-value flat semantics for studying
and evaluating spoken language understanding modules in dialogue systems. We are now interested
in investigating the use of more complex representations to improve the understanding capability.
The MMIL intermediate language is a high level semantic formalism that bears relevant linguistic
information, from syntax up to discourse. This representation should increase the expressivity of
the current annotation though at the expense of the annotation process complexity. In this paper we
present our first attempt in defining the annotation guidelines for the HLS annotation of the MEDIA
corpus and its effect on the annotation process itself, revealed by annotators? disagreements due to
the different levels of hierarchy and the granularity of the features defined in MMIL.
