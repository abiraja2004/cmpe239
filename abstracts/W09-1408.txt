In this paper we describe the memory-based ma-
chine learning system that we submitted to the
BioNLP Shared Task on Event Extraction. We mod-
eled the event extraction task using an approach that
has been previously applied to other natural lan-
guage processing tasks like semantic role labeling
or negation scope finding. The results obtained by
our system (30.58 F-score in Task 1 and 29.27 in
Task 2) suggest that the approach and the system
need further adaptation to the complexity involved
in extracting biomedical events.
