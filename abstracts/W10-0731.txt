Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) is a mar-
ketplace for so-called ?human intelligence
tasks? (HITs), or tasks that are easy for hu-
mans but currently difficult for automated pro-
cesses. Providers upload tasks to MTurk
which workers then complete. Natural lan-
guage annotation is one such human intelli-
gence task. In this paper, we investigate us-
ing MTurk to collect annotations for Subjec-
tivity Word Sense Disambiguation (SWSD),
a coarse-grained word sense disambiguation
task. We investigate whether we can use
MTurk to acquire good annotations with re-
spect to gold-standard data, whether we can
filter out low-quality workers (spammers), and
whether there is a learning effect associated
with repeatedly completing the same kind of
task. While our results with respect to spam-
mers are inconclusive, we are able to ob-
tain high-quality annotations for the SWSD
task. These results suggest a greater role for
MTurk with respect to constructing a large
scale SWSD system in the future, promising
substantial improvement in subjectivity and
sentiment analysis.
