Arabic presents an interesting challenge to
natural language processing, being a highly
inflected and agglutinative language. In
particular, this paper presents an in-depth
investigation of the entity detection and
recognition (EDR) task for Arabic. We
start by highlighting why segmentation is
a necessary prerequisite for EDR, continue
by presenting a finite-state statistical seg-
menter, and then examine how the result-
ing segments can be better included into
a mention detection system and an entity
recognition system; both systems are statis-
tical, build around the maximum entropy
principle. Experiments on a clearly stated
partition of the ACE 2004 data show that
stem-based features can significantly im-
prove the performance of the EDT system
by 2 absolute F-measure points. The sys-
tem presented here had a competitive per-
formance in the ACE 2004 evaluation.
