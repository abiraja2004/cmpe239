In this paper, we introduce TextRank ? a graph-based
ranking model for text processing, and show how this
model can be successfully used in natural language
applications. In particular, we propose two innova-
tive unsupervised methods for keyword and sentence
extraction, and show that the results obtained com-
pare favorably with previously published results on
established benchmarks.
