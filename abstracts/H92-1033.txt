 
In this paper, we are looking into the adaptation issues of 
vocabulary-independent (VI) systems. Just as with speaker- 
adaptation i  speaker-independent system, two vocabulary 
adaptation algorithms \[5\] are implemented in order to tailor 
the VI subword models to the target vocabulary. The first 
algorithm is to generate vocabulary-adapted clustering de- 
cision trees by focusing on relevant allophones during tree 
generation and reduces the VI error rate by 9%. The second 
algorithm, vocabulary-bias training, is to give the relevant 
allophones more prominence by assign more weight o them 
during Baum-Welch training of the generalized allophonic 
models and reduces the VI error ate by 15%. Finally, in order 
to overcome the degradation caused by the different acoustic 
environments u ed for VI training and testing, CDCN and 
ISDCN originally designed for microphone adaptation are in- 
corporated into our VI system and both reduce the degradation 
of VI cross-environment recognition by 50%.
