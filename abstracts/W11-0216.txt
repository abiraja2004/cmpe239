Kernel methods are considered the most ef-
fective techniques for various relation extrac-
tion (RE) tasks as they provide higher accu-
racy than other approaches. In this paper,
we introduce new dependency tree (DT) ker-
nels for RE by improving on previously pro-
posed dependency tree structures. These are
further enhanced to design more effective ap-
proaches that we call mildly extended depen-
dency tree (MEDT) kernels. The empirical re-
sults on the protein-protein interaction (PPI)
extraction task on the AIMed corpus show that
tree kernels based on our proposed DT struc-
tures achieve higher accuracy than previously
proposed DT and phrase structure tree (PST)
kernels.
