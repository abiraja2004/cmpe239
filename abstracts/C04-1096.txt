Past work of generating referring expressions
mainly utilized attributes of objects and bi-
nary relations between objects. However, such
an approach does not work well when there
is no distinctive attribute among objects. To
overcome this limitation, this paper proposes a
method utilizing the perceptual groups of ob-
jects and n-ary relations among them. The key
is to identify groups of objects that are natu-
rally recognized by humans. We conducted psy-
chological experiments with 42 subjects to col-
lect referring expressions in such situations, and
built a generation algorithm based on the re-
sults. The evaluation using another 23 subjects
showed that the proposed method could effec-
tively generate proper referring expressions.
