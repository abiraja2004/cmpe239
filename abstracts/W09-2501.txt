Multi-word expressions (MWE) have seen much at-
tention from the NLP community. In this paper, we
investigate their impact on the recognition of tex-
tual entailment (RTE). Using the manual Microsoft
Research annotations, we first manually count and
classify MWEs in RTE data. We find few, most
of which are arguably unlikely to cause processing
problems. We then consider the impact of MWEs on
a current RTE system. We are unable to confirm that
entailment recognition suffers from wrongly aligned
MWEs. In addition, MWE alignment is difficult
to improve, since MWEs are poorly represented in
state-of-the-art paraphrase resources, the only avail-
able sources for multi-word similarities. We con-
clude that RTE should concentrate on other phe-
nomena impacting entailment, and that paraphrase
knowledge is best understood as capturing general
lexico-syntactic variation.
