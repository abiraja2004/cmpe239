  
Syllable-to-word (STW) conversion is important 
in Chinese phonetic input methods and speech 
recognition. There are two major problems in 
the STW conversion: (1) resolving the ambigu-
ity caused by homonyms; (2) determining the 
word segmentation. This paper describes a 
noun-verb event-frame (NVEF) word identifier 
that can be used to solve these problems effec-
tively. Our approach includes (a) an NVEF 
word-pair identifier and (b) other word identifi-
ers for the non-NVEF portion.  
Our experiment showed that the NVEF 
word-pair identifier is able to achieve a 99.66% 
STW accuracy for the NVEF related portion, 
and by combining with other identifiers for the 
non-NVEF portion, the overall STW accuracy is 
96.50%.  
The result of this study indicates that the NVEF 
knowledge is very powerful for the STW con-
version. In fact, numerous cases requiring dis-
ambiguation in natural language processing fall 
into such ?chicken-and-egg? situation. The 
NVEF knowledge can be employed as a general 
tool in such systems for disambiguating the 
NVEF related portion independently (thus 
breaking the chicken-and-egg situation) and 
using that as a good fundamental basis to treat 
the remaining portion. This shows that the 
NVEF knowledge is likely to be important for 
general NLP. To further expand its coverage, we 
shall extend the study of NVEF to that of other 
co-occurrence restrictions such as noun-noun 
pairs, noun-adjective pairs and verb-adverb pairs. 
We believe the STW accuracy can be further 
improved with the additional knowledge.
