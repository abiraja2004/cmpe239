We present a joint model for biomedical event
extraction and apply it to four tracks of the
BioNLP 2011 Shared Task. Our model de-
composes into three sub-models that concern
(a) event triggers and outgoing arguments, (b)
event triggers and incoming arguments and
(c) protein-protein bindings. For efficient de-
coding we employ dual decomposition. Our
results are very competitive: With minimal
adaptation of our model we come in second
for two of the tasks?right behind a version
of the system presented here that includes pre-
dictions of the Stanford event extractor as fea-
tures. We also show that for the Infectious
Diseases task using data from the Genia track
is a very effective way to improve accuracy.
