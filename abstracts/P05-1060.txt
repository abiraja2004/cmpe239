In this paper, we examine the task of extracting a
set of biographic facts about target individuals from
a collection of Web pages. We automatically anno-
tate training text with positive and negative exam-
ples of fact extractions and train Rote, Na??ve Bayes,
and Conditional Random Field extraction models
for fact extraction from individual Web pages. We
then propose and evaluate methods for fusing the
extracted information across documents to return a
consensus answer. A novel cross-field bootstrapping
method leverages data interdependencies to yield
improved performance.
