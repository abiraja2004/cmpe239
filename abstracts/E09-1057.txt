We present a language-pair independent
terminology extraction module that is
based on a sub-sentential alignment sys-
tem that links linguistically motivated
phrases in parallel texts. Statistical filters
are applied on the bilingual list of candi-
date terms that is extracted from the align-
ment output.
We compare the performance of both
the alignment and terminology extrac-
tion module for three different language
pairs (French-English, French-Italian and
French-Dutch) and highlight language-
pair specific problems (e.g. different com-
pounding strategy in French and Dutch).
Comparisons with standard terminology
extraction programs show an improvement
of up to 20% for bilingual terminology ex-
traction and competitive results (85% to
90% accuracy) for monolingual terminol-
ogy extraction, and reveal that the linguis-
tically based alignment module is particu-
larly well suited for the extraction of com-
plex multiword terms.
