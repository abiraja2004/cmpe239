We present a technique for reading sentences
and producing sets of hypothetical relations
that the sentence may be expressing. The
technique uses large amounts of instance-level
background knowledge about the relations in
order to gather statistics on the various ways
the relation may be expressed in language, and
was inspired by the observation that half of the
linguistic forms used to express relations oc-
cur very infrequently and are simply not con-
sidered by systems that use too few seed ex-
amples. Some very early experiments are pre-
sented that show promising results.
