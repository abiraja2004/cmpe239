 
For Sinequa?s second participation to the 
Senseval evaluation, two systems using 
contextual semantic have been proposed. 
Based on different approaches, they both 
share the same data preprocessing and 
enrichment. The first system is a 
combined approach using semantic 
classification trees and information 
retrieval techniques. For the second 
system, the words from the context are 
considered as clues. The final sense is 
determined by summing the weight 
assigned to each clue for a given 
example.
