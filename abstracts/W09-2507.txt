This paper presents an approach for build-
ing a corpus for the domain of motion and
spatial inference using a specific class of
verbs. The approach creates a distribution
of inference features that maximize the
discriminatory power of a system trained
on the corpus. The paper addresses the is-
sue of using an existing textual inference
system for generating the examples. This
enables the corpus annotation method to
assert whether more data is necessary.
