 
In this paper, we introduce LiveTree, 
a core component of LIDAS, the Lin-
guistic Discourse Analysis System for 
automatic discourse parsing with the 
Unified Linguistic Discourse Model 
(U-LDM) (X et al 2004). LiveTree is 
an integrated workbench for super-
vised and unsupervised creation, stor-
age and manipulation of the discourse 
structure of text documents under the 
U-LDM. The LiveTree environment 
provides tools for manual and auto-
matic U-LDM segmentation and dis-
course parsing. Document manage-
ment, grammar testing, manipulation 
of discourse structures and creation 
and editing of discourse relations are 
also supported.
