The lack of internal information of Chinese
synthetic words has become a crucial prob-
lem for Chinese morphological analysis sys-
tems which will face various needs of seg-
mentation standards for upper NLP applica-
tions in the future. In this paper, we first
categorize Chinese synthetic words into sev-
eral types according to their inside semantic
and syntactic structure, and then propose a
method to represent these inside information
of word by applying a tree-based structure.
Then we try to automatically identify the in-
ner morphological structure of 3-character
synthetic words by using a large corpus and
try to add syntactic tags to their internal
structure. We believe that this tree-based
word internal information could be useful
in specifying a Chinese synthetic word seg-
mentation standard.
