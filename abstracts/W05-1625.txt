In this paper, we propose an approach for con-
tent determination and surface generation of an-
swers in a question-answering system on the web.
The content determination is based on a coherence
rate which takes into account coherence with other
potential answers. Answer generation is made
through the use of classical techniques and tem-
plates and is based on a certainty degree.
