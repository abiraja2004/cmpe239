Multiword expressions (MWEs) have
been proved useful for many natural lan-
guage processing tasks. However, how to
use them to improve performance of statis-
tical machine translation (SMT) is not well
studied. This paper presents a simple yet
effective strategy to extract domain bilin-
gual multiword expressions. In addition,
we implement three methods to integrate
bilingual MWEs to Moses, the state-of-
the-art phrase-based machine translation
system. Experiments show that bilingual
MWEs could improve translation perfor-
mance significantly.
