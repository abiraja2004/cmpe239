Ordering information is a critical task for
natural language generation applications.
In this paper we propose an approach to
information ordering that is particularly
suited for text-to-text generation. We de-
scribe a model that learns constraints on
sentence order from a corpus of domain-
specific texts and an algorithm that yields
the most likely order among several al-
ternatives. We evaluate the automatically
generated orderings against authored texts
from our corpus and against human sub-
jects that are asked to mimic the model?s
task. We also assess the appropriateness of
such a model for multidocument summa-
rization.
