 
In the Fourth SIGHAN Bakeoff, we took 
part in the closed tracks of the word 
segmentation, part of speech (POS)  
tagging and named entity recognition (NER) 
tasks. Particularly, we evaluated our word 
segmentation model on all the corpora, 
namely Academia Sinica (CKIP), City 
University of Hong Kong (CITYU), 
University of Colorado (CTB), State 
Language Commission of P.R.C. (NCC) 
and Shanxi University (SXU). For POS 
tagging and NER tasks, our models were 
evaluated on CITYU corpus only. Our 
models for the evaulation are based on the 
maximum entropy approach, we 
concentrated on the word segmentation 
task for the bakeoff and our best official 
results on all the corpora for this task are 
0.9083 F-score on CITYU, 0.8985 on 
CKIP, 0.9077 on CTB, 0.8995 on NCC and 
0.9146 on SXU.
