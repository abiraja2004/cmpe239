 
When humans communicate via natural lan-
guage, they frequently make use of metalan-
guage to clarify what they mean and promote 
a felicitous exchange of ideas. One key aspect 
of metalanguage is the mention of words and 
phrases, as distinguished from their use. This 
paper presents ongoing work on identifying 
and categorizing instances of language-
mention, with the goal of building a system 
capable of automatic recognition of the phe-
nomenon. A definition of language-mention 
and a corpus of instances gathered from Wiki-
pedia are discussed, and the future direction of 
the project is described.
