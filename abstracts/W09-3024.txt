We present a new method for automated
discovery of inconsistencies in a complex
manually annotated corpora. The pro-
posed technique is based on Apriori al-
gorithm for mining association rules from
datasets. By setting appropriate parame-
ters to the algorithm, we were able to au-
tomatically infer highly reliable rules of
annotation and subsequently we searched
for records for which the inferred rules
were violated. We show that the viola-
tions found by this simple technique are
often caused by an annotation error. We
present an evaluation of this technique on
a hand-annotated corpus PDT 2.0, present
the error analysis and show that in the first
100 detected nodes 20 of them contained
an annotation error.
