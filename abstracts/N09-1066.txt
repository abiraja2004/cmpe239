The number of research publications in var-
ious disciplines is growing exponentially.
Researchers and scientists are increasingly
finding themselves in the position of having
to quickly understand large amounts of tech-
nical material. In this paper we present the
first steps in producing an automatically gen-
erated, readily consumable, technical survey.
Specifically we explore the combination of
citation information and summarization tech-
niques. Even though prior work (Teufel et
al., 2006) argues that citation text is unsuitable
for summarization, we show that in the frame-
work of multi-document survey creation, cita-
tion texts can play a crucial role.
