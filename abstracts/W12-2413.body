The acquisition of semantic resources and re-
lations is an important task for several appli-
cations, such as query expansion, information
retrieval and extraction, machine translation.
However, their validity should also be com-
puted and indicated, especially for automatic
systems and applications. We exploit the com-
positionality based methods for the acquisi-
tion of synonymy relations and of indicators
of these synonyms. We then apply pager-
ank-derived algorithm to the obtained seman-
tic graph in order to filter out the acquired syn-
onyms. Evaluation performed with two inde-
pendent experts indicates that the quality of
synonyms is systematically improved by 10 to
15% after their filtering.
