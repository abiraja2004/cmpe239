Transliteration is the task of converting a
word from one alphabetic script to another.
We present a novel, substring-based ap-
proach to transliteration, inspired by phrase-
based models of machine translation. We in-
vestigate two implementations of substring-
based transliteration: a dynamic program-
ming algorithm, and a finite-state transducer.
We show that our substring-based transducer
not only outperforms a state-of-the-art letter-
based approach by a significant margin, but
is also orders of magnitude faster.
