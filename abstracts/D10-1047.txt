In this paper we address two key challenges
for extractive multi-document summarization:
the search problem of finding the best scoring
summary and the training problem of learn-
ing the best model parameters. We propose an
A* search algorithm to find the best extractive
summary up to a given length, which is both
optimal and efficient to run. Further, we pro-
pose a discriminative training algorithm which
directly maximises the quality of the best sum-
mary, rather than assuming a sentence-level
decomposition as in earlier work. Our ap-
proach leads to significantly better results than
earlier techniques across a number of evalua-
tion metrics.
