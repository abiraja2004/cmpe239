This paper presents the WordFrame model, a noise-
robust supervised algorithm capable of inducing
morphological analyses for languages which exhibit
prefixation, suffixation, and internal vowel shifts. In
combination with a na?ive approach to suffix-based
morphology, this algorithm is shown to be remark-
ably effective across a broad range of languages, in-
cluding those exhibiting infixation and partial redu-
plication. Results are presented for over 30 lan-
guages with a median accuracy of 97.5% on test
sets including both regular and irregular verbal in-
flections. Because the proposed method trains ex-
tremely well under conditions of high noise, it is an
ideal candidate for use in co-training with unsuper-
vised algorithms.
