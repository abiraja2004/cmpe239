In this paper, we present a study of a novel
summarization problem, i.e., summarizing the
impact of a scientific publication. Given a pa-
per and its citation context, we study how to
extract sentences that can represent the most
influential content of the paper. We propose
language modeling methods for solving this
problem, and study how to incorporate fea-
tures such as authority and proximity to ac-
curately estimate the impact language model.
Experiment results on a SIGIR publication
collection show that the proposed methods
are effective for generating impact-based sum-
maries.
