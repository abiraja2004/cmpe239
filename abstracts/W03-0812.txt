We present the system description language
SDL that offers a declarative way of specify-
ing new complex NLP systems from already
existing modules with the help of three oper-
ators: sequence, parallelism, and unrestricted
iteration. Given a system description and mod-
ules that implement a minimal interface, the
SDL compiler returns a running Java program
which realizes exactly the desired behavior of
the original speci?cation. The execution se-
mantics of SDL is complemented by a precise
formal semantics, de?ned in terms of concepts
of function theory. The SDL compiler is part
of the SProUT shallow language platform, a
system for the development and processing of
multilingual resources.
