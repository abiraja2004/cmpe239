In this paper we investigate a new problem
of identifying the perspective from which
a document is written. By perspective we
mean a point of view, for example, from
the perspective of Democrats or Repub-
licans. Can computers learn to identify
the perspective of a document? Not every
sentence is written strongly from a per-
spective. Can computers learn to identify
which sentences strongly convey a partic-
ular perspective? We develop statistical
models to capture how perspectives are
expressed at the document and sentence
levels, and evaluate the proposed mod-
els on articles about the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict. The results show that the pro-
posed models successfully learn how per-
spectives are reflected in word usage and
can identify the perspective of a document
with high accuracy.
