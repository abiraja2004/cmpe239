In this paper we motivate and describe
a dialogue manager which is able to in-
fer and negotiate causal implicatures. A
causal implicature is a type of Gricean re-
lation implicature, and the ability to infer
them is crucial in situated dialogue. Be-
cause situated dialogue interleaves conver-
sational acts and physical acts, the dia-
logue manager needs to have a grasp on
causal implicatures in order not only to de-
cide what physical acts to do next but also
to generate causally-aware clarifications.
