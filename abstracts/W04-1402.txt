 
CESTA, the first European Campaign 
dedicated to MT Evaluation, is a project 
labelled by the French Technolangue action. 
CESTA provides an evaluation of six 
commercial and academic MT systems using a 
protocol set by an international panel of 
experts. CESTA aims at producing reusable 
resources and information about reliability of 
the metrics. Two runs will be carried out: one 
using the system?s basic dictionary, another 
after terminological adaptation. Evaluation 
task, test material, resources, evaluation 
measures, metrics, will be detailed in the full 
paper. The protocol is the combination of a 
contrastive reference to: IBM ?BLEU? 
protocol (Papineni, K., S. Roukos, T. Ward 
and Z. Wei-Jing, 2001); ?BLANC? protocol 
derived from (Hartley, Rajman, 2002).; 
?ROUGE? protocol (Babych, Hartley, Atwell, 
2003). The results of the campaign will be 
published in a final report and be the object of 
two intermediary and final workshops.
