Previous research has conflicting conclu-
sions on whether word sense disambiguation
(WSD) systems can improve information re-
trieval (IR) performance. In this paper, we
propose a method to estimate sense distribu-
tions for short queries. Together with the
senses predicted for words in documents, we
propose a novel approach to incorporate word
senses into the language modeling approach
to IR and also exploit the integration of syn-
onym relations. Our experimental results on
standard TREC collections show that using the
word senses tagged by a supervised WSD sys-
tem, we obtain significant improvements over
a state-of-the-art IR system.
