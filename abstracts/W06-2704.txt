The NITE Query Language (NQL) has
been used successfully for analysis of a
number of heavily cross-annotated data
sets, and users especially value its ele-
gance and flexibility. However, when us-
ing the current implementation, many of
the more complicated queries that users
have formulated must be run in batch
mode. For a re-implementation, we re-
quire the query processor to be capable
of handling large amounts of data at once,
and work quickly enough for on-line data
analysis even when used on complete cor-
pora. Early results suggest that the most
promising implementation strategy is one
that involves the use of XQuery on a mul-
tiple file data representation that uses the
structure of individual XML files to mirror
tree structures in the data, with redundancy
where a data node has multiple parents in
the underlying data object model.
