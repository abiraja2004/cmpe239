This paper presents recent developments of an
indexing technique aimed at improving parsing
times. Although several methods exist today
that serve this purpose, most of them rely on
statistical data collected during lengthy train-
ing phases. Our goal is to obtain a reliable
method that exhibits an optimal efficiency/cost
ratio, without lengthy training processes. We
focus here on static analysis of the grammar,
a method that has unworthily received less at-
tention in the last few years in computational
linguistics. The paper is organized as follows:
first, the parsing and indexing problem are in-
troduced, followed by a description of the gen-
eral indexing strategy for chart parsing; sec-
ond, a detailed overview and performance anal-
ysis of the indexing technique used for typed-
feature structure grammars is presented; finally,
conclusions and future work are outlined.
