We address a dialogue framework that narrows
down the users query results obtained by an in
formation retrieval system The followup dia
logue to constrain query results is signicant es
pecially with the speech interfaces such as tele
phones because a lot of query results cannot be
presented to the user The proposed dialogue
framework generates guiding questions based on
an information theoretic criterion to eliminate
retrieved candidates by a spontaneous query
without assuming a semantic slot structure We
rst describe its concept on general information
query tasks and then deal with a query task
on the appliance manual where structured task
knowledge is available A hierarchical conrma
tion strategy is proposed by making use of a tree
structure of the manual and then three cost
functions for selecting optimal question nodes
are compared Experimental evaluation demon
strates that the proposed system helps users
nd their intended items more eciently
