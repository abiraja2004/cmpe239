 
A new chart-based technique for parsing ill-formed 
input is proposed. This can process sentences 
with unknown/misspelled words, omitted words 
or extraneous words. This generalized parsing 
strategy is, similar to Mellish's, based on an 
active chart parser, and shares the many 
advantages of Mellish's technique. It is based on 
pure syntactic knowledge, it is independent ofall 
grammars, and it does not slow down the original 
parsing operation if there is no ill-formedness. 
However, unlike Mellish's technique, it doesn't 
employ any complicated heuristic parameters. 
There are two key points. First, instead of using 
a unified or interleaved process for finding errors 
and correcting them, we separate the initial error 
detection stage from the other stages and adopt a 
version of bi-directional parsing. This effectively 
prunes the search space. Second, it employs 
normal top-down parsing, in which each parsing 
state reflects the global context, instead of top- 
down chart parsing. This enables the technique to 
determine the global plausibility of candidates 
easily, based on an admissible A* search. The 
proposed strategy could enumerate all possible 
minimal-penalty solutions in just 4 times the 
time taken to parse the correct sentences.
