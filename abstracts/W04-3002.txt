 
This article proposes a hybrid statistical and 
structural semantic model for multi-stage 
spoken language understanding (SLU). The 
first stage of this SLU utilizes a weighted fi-
nite-state transducer (WFST)-based parser, 
which encodes the regular grammar of con-
cepts to be extracted. The proposed method 
improves the regular grammar model by in-
corporating a well-known n-gram semantic 
tagger. This hybrid model thus enhances the 
syntax of n-gram outputs while providing 
robustness against speech-recognition errors. 
With applications to a Thai hotel reservation 
domain, it is shown to outperform both indi-
vidual models at every stage of the SLU sys-
tem. Under the probabilistic WFST 
framework, the use of N-best hypotheses 
from the speech recognizer instead of the 1-
best can further improve performance requir-
ing only a small additional processing time.
