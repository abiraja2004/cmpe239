We have aligned Japanese and English
news articles and sentences to make a
large parallel corpus. We first used a
method based on cross-language informa-
tion retrieval (CLIR) to align the Japanese
and English articles and then used a
method based on dynamic programming
(DP) matching to align the Japanese and
English sentences in these articles. How-
ever, the results included many incorrect
alignments. To remove these, we pro-
pose two measures (scores) that evaluate
the validity of alignments. The measure
for article alignment uses similarities in
sentences aligned by DP matching and
that for sentence alignment uses similar-
ities in articles aligned by CLIR. They
enhance each other to improve the accu-
racy of alignment. Using these measures,
we have successfully constructed a large-
scale article and sentence alignment cor-
pus available to the public.
