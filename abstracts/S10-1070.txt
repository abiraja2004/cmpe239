The system described in this paper has par-
ticipated in the Tempeval 2 competition,
specifically in the Task A, which aim is
to determine the extent of the time expres-
sions in a text as defined by the TimeML
TIMEX3 tag, and the value of the fea-
tures type and val. For this purpose, a
combination of TERSEO system and the
T2T3 Transducer was used. TERSEO sys-
tem is able to annotate text with TIDES
TIMEX2 tags, and T2T3 transducer per-
forms the translation from this TIMEX2
tags to TIMEX3 tags.
