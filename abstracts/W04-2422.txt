This paper presents our work on Semantic Role
Labeling using a Transformation-Based Error-
Driven approach in the style of Eric Brill (Brill,
1995). Our approach achieved an overall F1
score of 43.48 on non-verb annotations. We
believe our approach is noteworthy because of
its novelty in this area and because it produces
short lists of human-understandable transfor-
mation rules as its output.
