 
We propose an information extraction system 
that is designed for mobile devices with low 
hardware resources. The proposed system ex-
tracts temporal instances (dates and times) and 
named instances (locations and topics) from 
Korean short messages in an appointment 
management domain. To efficiently extract 
temporal instances with limited numbers of 
surface forms, the proposed system uses well-
refined finite state automata. To effectively 
extract various surface forms of named in-
stances with low hardware resources, the pro-
posed system uses a modified HMM based on 
syllable n-grams. In the experiment on in-
stance boundary labeling, the proposed system 
showed better performances than traditional 
classifiers.
