Traditional 1-best translation pipelines
suffer a major drawback: the errors of 1-
best outputs, inevitably introduced by each
module, will propagate and accumulate
along the pipeline. In order to alleviate
this problem, we use compact structures,
lattice and forest, in each module instead
of 1-best results. We integrate both lat-
tice and forest into a single tree-to-string
system, and explore the algorithms of lat-
tice parsing, lattice-forest-based rule ex-
traction and decoding. More importantly,
our model takes into account all the proba-
bilities of different steps, such as segmen-
tation, parsing, and translation. The main
advantage of our model is that we can
make global decision to search for the best
segmentation, parse-tree and translation in
one step. Medium-scale experiments show
an improvement of +0.9 BLEU points over
a state-of-the-art forest-based baseline.
