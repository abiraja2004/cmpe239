This paper describes the HKPolyU-HKUST sys-
tems which were entered into the Semantic Role La-
beling task in Senseval-3. Results show that these
systems, which are based upon common machine
learning algorithms, all manage to achieve good
performances on the non-restricted Semantic Role
Labeling task.
