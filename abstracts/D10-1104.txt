 
In this paper we develop an approach to tackle 
the problem of verb selection for learners of 
English as a second language (ESL) by using 
features from the output of Semantic Role La-
beling (SRL). Unlike existing approaches to 
verb selection that use local features such as 
n-grams, our approach exploits semantic fea-
tures which explicitly model the usage context 
of the verb. The verb choice highly depends 
on its usage context which is not consistently 
captured by local features. We then combine 
these semantic features with other local fea-
tures under the generalized perceptron learn-
ing framework. Experiments on both in-
domain and out-of-domain corpora show that 
our approach outperforms the baseline and 
achieves state-of-the-art performance.1
