In this paper we present implications
for development of dialogue systems,
based on an evaluation of the system
BIRDQUEST which combine dialogue in-
teraction with information extraction. A
number of issues detected during the
evaluation concerning primarily dialogue
management, and domain knowledge rep-
resentation and use are presented and dis-
cussed.
