Abstract
Semantic role labels are the representa-
tion of the grammatically relevant aspects
of a sentence meaning. Capturing the
nature and the number of semantic roles
in a sentence is therefore fundamental to
correctly describing the interface between
grammar and meaning. In this paper, we
compare two annotation schemes, Prop-
Bank and VerbNet, in a task-independent,
general way, analysing how well they fare
in capturing the linguistic generalisations
that are known to hold for semantic role
labels, and consequently how well they
grammaticalise aspects of meaning. We
show that VerbNet is more verb-specific
and better able to generalise to new seman-
tic role instances, while PropBank better
captures some of the structural constraints
among roles. We conclude that these two
resources should be used together, as they
are complementary.
