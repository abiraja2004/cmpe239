This paper describes T ?UB?ITAK-B?ILGEM
statistical machine translation (SMT) sys-
tems submitted to the Eighth Work-
shop on Statistical Machine Transla-
tion (WMT) shared translation task for
German-English language pair in both di-
rections. We implement phrase-based
SMT systems with standard parameters.
We present the results of using a big tun-
ing data and the effect of averaging tun-
ing weights of different seeds. Addition-
ally, we performed a linguistically moti-
vated compound splitting in the German-
to-English SMT system.
