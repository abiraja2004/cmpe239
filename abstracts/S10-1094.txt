We describe two approaches for All-words
Word Sense Disambiguation on a Spe-
cific Domain. The first approach is a
knowledge based approach which extracts
domain-specific largest connected com-
ponents from the Wordnet graph by ex-
ploiting the semantic relations between all
candidate synsets appearing in a domain-
specific untagged corpus. Given a test
word, disambiguation is performed by
considering only those candidate synsets
that belong to the top-k largest connected
components.
The second approach is a weakly super-
vised approach which relies on the ?One
Sense Per Domain? heuristic and uses a
few hand labeled examples for the most
frequently appearing words in the target
domain. Once the most frequent words
have been disambiguated they can pro-
vide strong clues for disambiguating other
words in the sentence using an iterative
disambiguation algorithm. Our weakly
supervised system gave the best perfor-
mance across all systems that participated
in the task even when it used as few as 100
hand labeled examples from the target do-
main.
