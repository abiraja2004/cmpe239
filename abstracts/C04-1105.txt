 
Two methods using comparable corpora to se-
lect translation equivalents appropriate to a do-
main were devised and evaluated. The first 
method ranks translation equivalents of a target 
word according to similarity of their contexts to 
that of the target word. The second method 
ranks translation equivalents according to the 
ratio of associated words that suggest them. An 
experiment using the EDR bilingual dictionary 
together with Wall Street Journal and Nihon 
Keizai Shimbun corpora proved that the method 
using the ratio of associated words outperforms 
the method based on contextual similarity. 
Namely, in a quantitative evaluation using 
pseudo words, the maximum F-measure of the 
former method was 86%, while that of the latter 
method was 82%.
