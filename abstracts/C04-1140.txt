We ran both Brill?s rule-based tagger and TNT,
a statistical tagger, with a default German
newspaper-language model on a medical text
corpus. Supplied with limited lexicon re-
sources, TNT outperforms the Brill tagger with
state-of-the-art performance figures (close to
97% accuracy). We then trained TNT on a large
annotated medical text corpus, with a slightly
extended tagset that captures certain medical
language particularities, and achieved 98% tag-
ging accuracy. Hence, statistical off-the-shelf
POS taggers cannot only be immediately reused
for medical NLP, but they also ? when trained
on medical corpora ? achieve a higher perfor-
mance level than for the newspaper genre.
