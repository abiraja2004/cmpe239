We demonstrate the use of default de-
fault inheritance hierarchies to represent
the morphology of Yoru`ba? verbs in the
KATR formalism, treating inflectional ex-
ponences as markings associated with the
application of rules by which complex
word forms are deduced from simpler
roots or stems. In particular, we sug-
gest a scheme of slots that together make
up a verb and show how each slot rep-
resents a subset of the morphosyntactic
properties associated with the verb. We
also show how we can account for the
tonal aspects of Yoru`ba?, in particular, the
tone associated with the emphatic end-
ing. Our approach allows linguists to gain
an appreciation for the structure of verbs,
gives teachers a foundation for organizing
lessons in morphology, and provides stu-
dents a technique for generating forms of
any verb.
