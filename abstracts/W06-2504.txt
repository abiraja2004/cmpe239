The correct identification of metonymies
is not normally a problem for most peo-
ple. For computers, things are different,
however. In Natural Language Processing,
metonymy recognition is therefore usu-
ally addressed with complex algorithms
that rely on hundreds of labelled train-
ing examples. This paper investigates two
approaches to metonymy recognition that
dispense with this complexity, albeit in
different ways. The first, an unsuper-
vised approach to Word Sense Discrimi-
nation, does not require any labelled train-
ing instances. The second, Memory-Based
Learning, replaces the complexity of cur-
rent algorithms by a ?lazy? learning phase.
While the first approach is often able to
identify a metonymical and a literal clus-
ter in the data, it is the second in particular
that produces state-of-the-art results.
