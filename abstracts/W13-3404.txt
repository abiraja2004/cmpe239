 
Multilinguality has been an essential feature of 
the International Linguistic Olympiad since its 
conception.  Although deemed most desirable, 
the production of a problem set in several par-
allel versions and the verification of their 
equivalence is a time-consuming and error-
prone task.  This paper tells about the efforts 
to develop tools and methods which increase 
its efficiency and reliability.
