Recent literature on text-tagging reported
successful results by applying Maximum
Entropy (ME) models. In general, ME
taggers rely on carefully selected binary
features, which try to capture discrimi-
nant information from the training data.
This paper introduces a standard setting
of binary features, inspired by the litera-
ture on named-entity recognition and text
chunking, and derives corresponding real-
valued features based on smoothed log-
probabilities. The resulting ME models
have orders of magnitude fewer parame-
ters. Effective use of training data to esti-
mate features and parameters is achieved
by integrating a leaving-one-out method
into the standard ME training algorithm.
Experimental results on two tagging tasks
show statistically significant performance
gains after augmenting standard binary-
feature models with real-valued features.
