We address the issue of consuming heteroge-
neous annotation data for Chinese word seg-
mentation and part-of-speech tagging. We em-
pirically analyze the diversity between two
representative corpora, i.e. Penn Chinese
Treebank (CTB) and PKU?s People?s Daily
(PPD), on manually mapped data, and show
that their linguistic annotations are systemat-
ically different and highly compatible. The
analysis is further exploited to improve pro-
cessing accuracy by (1) integrating systems
that are respectively trained on heterogeneous
annotations to reduce the approximation error,
and (2) re-training models with high quality
automatically converted data to reduce the es-
timation error. Evaluation on the CTB and
PPD data shows that our novel model achieves
a relative error reduction of 11% over the best
reported result in the literature.
