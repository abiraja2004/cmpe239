We describe the FAUST entry to the BioNLP
2011 shared task on biomolecular event ex-
traction. The FAUST system explores sev-
eral stacking models for combination using
as base models the UMass dual decomposi-
tion (Riedel and McCallum, 2011) and Stan-
ford event parsing (McClosky et al, 2011b)
approaches. We show that using stacking is
a straightforward way to improving perfor-
mance for event extraction and find that it is
most effective when using a small set of stack-
ing features and the base models use slightly
different representations of the input data. The
FAUST system obtained 1st place in three out
of four tasks: 1st place in Genia Task 1 (56.0%
f-score) and Task 2 (53.9%), 2nd place in the
Epigenetics and Post-translational Modifica-
tions track (35.0%), and 1st place in the In-
fectious Diseases track (55.6%).
