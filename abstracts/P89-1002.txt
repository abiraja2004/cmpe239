 
We present an algorithm for generating strings 
from logical form encodings that improves upon 
previous algorithms in that it places fewer restric- 
tions on the class of grammars to which it is ap- 
plicable. In particular, unlike an Earley deduction 
generator (Shieber, 1988), it allows use of seman- 
tically nonmonotonic grammars, yet unlike top- 
down methods, it also permits left-recursion. The 
enabling design feature of the algorithm is its im- 
plicit traversal of the analysis tree for the string 
being generated in a semantic-head-driven fashion.
