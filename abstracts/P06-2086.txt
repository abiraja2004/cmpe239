 
Most information extraction systems ei-
ther use hand written extraction patterns 
or use a machine learning algorithm that 
is trained on a manually annotated cor-
pus. Both of these approaches require 
massive human effort and hence prevent 
information extraction from becoming 
more widely applicable. In this paper we 
present URES (Unsupervised Relation 
Extraction System), which extracts rela-
tions from the Web in a totally unsuper-
vised way. It takes as input the 
descriptions of the target relations, which 
include the names of the predicates, the 
types of their attributes, and several seed 
instances of the relations. Then the sys-
tem downloads from the Web a large col-
lection of pages that are likely to contain 
instances of the target relations. From 
those pages, utilizing the known seed in-
stances, the system learns the relation 
patterns, which are then used for extrac-
tion. We present several experiments in 
which we learn patterns and extract in-
stances of a set of several common IE re-
lations, comparing several pattern 
learning and filtering setups. We demon-
strate that using simple noun phrase tag-
ger is sufficient as a base for accurate 
patterns. However, having a named en-
tity recognizer, which is able to recog-
nize the types of the relation attributes 
significantly, enhances the extraction 
performance. We also compare our ap-
proach with KnowItAll?s fixed generic 
patterns.
