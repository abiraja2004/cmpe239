In this paper, we present an approach to
statistical machine translation that com-
bines the power of a discriminative model
(for training a model for Machine Transla-
tion), and the standard beam-search based
decoding technique (for the translation of
an input sentence). A discriminative ap-
proach for learning lexical selection and
reordering utilizes a large set of feature
functions (thereby providing the power to
incorporate greater contextual and linguis-
tic information), which leads to an effec-
tive training of these models. This model
is then used by the standard state-of-art
Moses decoder (Koehn et al, 2007) for the
translation of an input sentence.
We conducted our experiments on
Spanish-English language pair. We used
maximum entropy model in our exper-
iments. We show that the performance
of our approach (using simple lexical
features) is comparable to that of the
state-of-art statistical MT system (Koehn
et al, 2007). When additional syntactic
features (POS tags in this paper) are used,
there is a boost in the performance which
is likely to improve when richer syntactic
features are incorporated in the model.
