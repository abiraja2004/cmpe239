Natural language questions have become pop-
ular in web search. However, various ques-
tions can be formulated to convey the same
information need, which poses a great chal-
lenge to search systems. In this paper, we au-
tomatically mined 5w1h question reformula-
tion patterns from large scale search log data.
The question reformulations generated from
these patterns are further incorporated into the
retrieval model. Experiments show that us-
ing question reformulation patterns can sig-
nificantly improve the search performance of
natural language questions.
