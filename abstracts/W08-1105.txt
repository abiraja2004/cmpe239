We present a novel unsupervised method for
sentence compression which relies on a de-
pendency tree representation and shortens sen-
tences by removing subtrees. An automatic
evaluation shows that our method obtains re-
sult comparable or superior to the state of the
art. We demonstrate that the choice of the
parser affects the performance of the system.
We also apply the method to German and re-
port the results of an evaluation with humans.
