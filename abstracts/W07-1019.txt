There has been much recent interest in the
extraction of PPIs (protein-protein interac-
tions) from biomedical texts, but in order
to assist with curation efforts, the PPIs must
be enriched with further information of bi-
ological interest. This paper describes the
implementation of a system to extract and
enrich PPIs, developed and tested using an
annotated corpus of biomedical texts, and
employing both machine-learning and rule-
based techniques.
