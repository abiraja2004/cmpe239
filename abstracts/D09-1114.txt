 
Recently system combination has been shown 
to be an effective way to improve translation 
quality over single machine translation sys-
tems. In this paper, we present a simple and ef-
fective method to systematically derive an en-
semble of SMT systems from one baseline li-
near SMT model for use in system combina-
tion. Each system in the resulting ensemble is 
based on a feature set derived from the fea-
tures of the baseline model (typically a subset 
of it). We will discuss the principles to deter-
mine the feature sets for derived systems, and 
present in detail the system combination mod-
el used in our work. Evaluation is performed 
on the data sets for NIST 2004 and NIST 2005 
Chinese-to-English machine translation tasks. 
Experimental results show that our method can 
bring significant improvements to baseline 
systems with state-of-the-art performance.
