This paper describes our WMT submis-
sions CU-BOJAR and CU-DEPFIX, the lat-
ter dubbed ?CHIMERA? because it com-
bines on three diverse approaches: Tec-
toMT, a system with transfer at the deep
syntactic level of representation, factored
phrase-based translation using Moses, and
finally automatic rule-based correction of
frequent grammatical and meaning errors.
We do not use any off-the-shelf system-
combination method.
