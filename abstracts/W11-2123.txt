We present KenLM, a library that imple-
ments two data structures for efficient lan-
guage model queries, reducing both time and
memory costs. The PROBING data structure
uses linear probing hash tables and is de-
signed for speed. Compared with the widely-
used SRILM, our PROBING model is 2.4
times as fast while using 57% of the mem-
ory. The TRIE data structure is a trie with
bit-level packing, sorted records, interpola-
tion search, and optional quantization aimed
at lower memory consumption. TRIE simul-
taneously uses less memory than the small-
est lossless baseline and less CPU than the
fastest baseline. Our code is open-source1,
thread-safe, and integrated into the Moses,
cdec, and Joshua translation systems. This
paper describes the several performance tech-
niques used and presents benchmarks against
alternative implementations.
