In this paper we present a tool that uses
comparable corpora to find appropriate
translation equivalents for expressions that
are considered by translators as difficult.
For a phrase in the source language the
tool identifies a range of possible expres-
sions used in similar contexts in target lan-
guage corpora and presents them to the
translator as a list of suggestions. In the
paper we discuss the method and present
results of human evaluation of the perfor-
mance of the tool, which highlight its use-
fulness when dictionary solutions are lack-
ing.
