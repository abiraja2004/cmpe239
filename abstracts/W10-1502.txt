Post-positional particles are a significant
source of errors for learners of Korean. Fol-
lowing methodology that has proven effective
in handling English preposition errors, we are
beginning the process of building a machine
learner for particle error detection in L2 Ko-
rean writing. As a first step, however, we must
acquire data, and thus we present a method-
ology for constructing large-scale corpora of
Korean from the Web, exploring the feasibil-
ity of building corpora appropriate for a given
topic and grammatical construction.
