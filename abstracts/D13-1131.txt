We propose a Laplacian structured sparsity
model to study computational branding ana-
lytics. To do this, we collected customer re-
views from Starbucks, Dunkin? Donuts, and
other coffee shops across 38 major cities
in the Midwest and Northeastern regions of
USA. We study the brand related language
use through these reviews, with focuses on
the brand satisfaction and gender factors. In
particular, we perform three tasks: auto-
matic brand identification from raw text, joint
brand-satisfaction prediction, and joint brand-
gender-satisfaction prediction. This work ex-
tends previous studies in text classification by
incorporating the dependency and interaction
among local features in the form of structured
sparsity in a log-linear model. Our quantita-
tive evaluation shows that our approach which
combines the advantages of graphical model-
ing and sparsity modeling techniques signifi-
cantly outperforms various standard and state-
of-the-art text classification algorithms. In ad-
dition, qualitative analysis of our model re-
veals important features of the language uses
associated with the specific brands.
