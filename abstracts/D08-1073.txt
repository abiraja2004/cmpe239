Previous work on ordering events in text has
typically focused on local pairwise decisions,
ignoring globally inconsistent labels. How-
ever, temporal ordering is the type of domain
in which global constraints should be rela-
tively easy to represent and reason over. This
paper presents a framework that informs lo-
cal decisions with two types of implicit global
constraints: transitivity (A before B and B be-
fore C implies A before C) and time expression
normalization (e.g. last month is before yes-
terday). We show how these constraints can
be used to create a more densely-connected
network of events, and how global consis-
tency can be enforced by incorporating these
constraints into an integer linear programming
framework. We present results on two event
ordering tasks, showing a 3.6% absolute in-
crease in the accuracy of before/after classifi-
cation over a pairwise model.
