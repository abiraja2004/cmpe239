Evaluation methods for Distributional Se-
mantic Models typically rely on behav-
iorally derived gold standards. These
methods are difficult to deploy in lan-
guages with scarce linguistic/behavioral
resources. We introduce a corpus-based
measure that evaluates the stability of the
lexical semantic similarity space using a
pseudo-synonym same-different detection
task and no external resources. We show
that it enables to predict two behavior-
based measures across a range of parame-
ters in a Latent Semantic Analysis model.
