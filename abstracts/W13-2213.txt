This paper describes Munich-Edinburgh-
Stuttgart?s submissions to the Eighth
Workshop on Statistical Machine Transla-
tion. We report results of the translation
tasks from German, Spanish, Czech and
Russian into English and from English to
German, Spanish, Czech, French and Rus-
sian. The systems described in this paper
use OSM (Operation Sequence Model).
We explain different pre-/post-processing
steps that we carried out for different
language pairs. For German-English we
used constituent parsing for reordering
and compound splitting as preprocessing
steps. For Russian-English we transliter-
ated the unknown words. The translitera-
tion system is learned with the help of an
unsupervised transliteration mining algo-
rithm.
