Most work on unsupervised entailment
rule acquisition focused on rules between
templates with two variables, ignoring
unary rules - entailment rules between
templates with a single variable. In this pa-
per we investigate two approaches for un-
supervised learning of such rules and com-
pare the proposed methods with a binary
rule learning method. The results show
that the learned unary rule-sets outperform
the binary rule-set. In addition, a novel
directional similarity measure for learning
entailment, termed Balanced-Inclusion, is
the best performing measure.
