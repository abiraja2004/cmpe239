There exist various different discourse an-
notation schemes that vary both in the
perspectives of discourse structure consid-
ered and the granularity of textual units
that are annotated. Comparison and inte-
gration of multiple schemes have the po-
tential to provide enhanced information.
However, the differing formats of cor-
pora and tools that contain or produce
such schemes can be a barrier to their
integration. U-Compare is a graphical,
UIMA-based workflow construction plat-
form for combining interoperable natu-
ral language processing (NLP) resources,
without the need for programming skills.
In this paper, we present an extension
of U-Compare that allows the easy com-
parison, integration and visualisation of
resources that contain or output annota-
tions based on multiple discourse anno-
tation schemes. The extension works by
allowing the construction of parallel sub-
workflows for each scheme within a single
U-Compare workflow. The different types
of discourse annotations produced by each
sub-workflow can be either merged or vi-
sualised side-by-side for comparison. We
demonstrate this new functionality by us-
ing it to compare annotations belonging
to two different approaches to discourse
analysis, namely discourse relations and
functional discourse annotations. Integrat-
ing these different annotation types within
an interoperable environment allows us to
study the correlations between different
types of discourse and report on the new
insights that this allows us to discover.
