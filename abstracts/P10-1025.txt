Current Semantic Role Labeling technolo-
gies are based on inductive algorithms
trained over large scale repositories of
annotated examples. Frame-based sys-
tems currently make use of the FrameNet
database but fail to show suitable general-
ization capabilities in out-of-domain sce-
narios. In this paper, a state-of-art system
for frame-based SRL is extended through
the encapsulation of a distributional model
of semantic similarity. The resulting argu-
ment classification model promotes a sim-
pler feature space that limits the potential
overfitting effects. The large scale em-
pirical study here discussed confirms that
state-of-art accuracy can be obtained for
out-of-domain evaluations.
