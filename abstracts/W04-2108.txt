This paper presents an original way to add new
data in a reference dictionary from several other
lexical resources, without loosing any consis-
tence. This operation is carried in order to get
lexical information classified by the sense of the
entry. This classification makes it possible to
enrich utterances (in QA: the queries) following
the meaning, and to reduce noise. An analysis
of the experienced problems shows the interest
of this method, and insists on the points that
have to be tackled.
