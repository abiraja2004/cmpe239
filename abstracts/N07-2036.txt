 
Texts exhibit subtle yet identifiable mo-
dality about writers? estimation of how 
true each statement is (e.g., definitely true 
or somewhat true). This study is an analy-
sis of such explicit certainty and doubt 
markers in epistemically modalized 
statements for a written news discourse. 
The study systematically accounts for five 
levels of writer?s certainty (ABSOLUTE, 
HIGH, MODERATE, LOW CERTAINTY and 
UNCERTAINTY) in three news pragmatic 
contexts: perspective, focus, and time. 
The study concludes that independent 
coders? perceptions of the boundaries be-
tween shades of certainty in epistemically 
modalized statements are highly subjec-
tive and present difficulties for manual 
annotation and consequent automation for 
opinion extraction and sentiment analysis. 
While stricter annotation instructions and 
longer coder training can improve inter-
coder agreement results, it is not entirely 
clear that a five-level distinction of cer-
tainty is preferable to a simplistic distinc-
tion between statements with certainty 
and statements with doubt.
