We describe a new scalable algorithm for
semi-supervised training of conditional ran-
dom fields (CRF) and its application to part-
of-speech (POS) tagging. The algorithm uses
a similarity graph to encourage similar n-
grams to have similar POS tags. We demon-
strate the efficacy of our approach on a do-
main adaptation task, where we assume that
we have access to large amounts of unlabeled
data from the target domain, but no additional
labeled data. The similarity graph is used dur-
ing training to smooth the state posteriors on
the target domain. Standard inference can be
used at test time. Our approach is able to scale
to very large problems and yields significantly
improved target domain accuracy.
