Chunk parsing is conceptually appealing
but its performance has not been satis-
factory for practical use. In this pa-
per we show that chunk parsing can
perform significantly better than previ-
ously reported by using a simple sliding-
window method and maximum entropy
classifiers for phrase recognition in each
level of chunking. Experimental results
with the Penn Treebank corpus show that
our chunk parser can give high-precision
parsing outputs with very high speed (14
msec/sentence). We also present a pars-
ing method for searching the best parse by
considering the probabilities output by the
maximum entropy classifiers, and show
that the search method can further im-
prove the parsing accuracy.
