Many emerging applications require doc-
uments to be repeatedly updated. Such
documents include newsfeeds, webpages,
and shared community resources such as
Wikipedia. In this paper we address the
task of inserting new information into exist-
ing texts. In particular, we wish to deter-
mine the best location in a text for a given
piece of new information. For this process
to succeed, the insertion algorithm should
be informed by the existing document struc-
ture. Lengthy real-world texts are often hier-
archically organized into chapters, sections,
and paragraphs. We present an online rank-
ing model which exploits this hierarchical
structure ? representationally in its features
and algorithmically in its learning proce-
dure. When tested on a corpus of Wikipedia
articles, our hierarchically informed model
predicts the correct insertion paragraph more
accurately than baseline methods.
