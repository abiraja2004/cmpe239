We present a simple method for language inde-
pendent and task independent text categoriza-
tion learning, based on character-level n-gram
language models. Our approach uses simple
information theoretic principles and achieves
effective performance across a variety of lan-
guages and tasks without requiring feature se-
lection or extensive pre-processing. To demon-
strate the language and task independence of
the proposed technique, we present experimen-
tal results on several languages?Greek, En-
glish, Chinese and Japanese?in several text
categorization problems?language identifica-
tion, authorship attribution, text genre classifi-
cation, and topic detection. Our experimental
results show that the simple approach achieves
state of the art performance in each case.
