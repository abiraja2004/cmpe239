 
This paper proposes a semi-supervised learn-
ing method for relation extraction. Given a 
small amount of labeled data and a large 
amount of unlabeled data, it first bootstraps a 
moderate number of weighted support vectors 
via SVM through a co-training procedure with 
random feature projection and then applies a 
label propagation (LP) algorithm via the boot-
strapped support vectors. Evaluation on the 
ACE RDC 2003 corpus shows that our method 
outperforms the normal LP algorithm via all 
the available labeled data without SVM boot-
strapping. Moreover, our method can largely 
reduce the computational burden. This sug-
gests that our proposed method can integrate 
the advantages of both SVM bootstrapping 
and label propagation.
