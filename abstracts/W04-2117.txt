In order to facilitate the use of a dictionary for lan-
guage production and language learning we propose
the construction of a new network-based electronic
dictionary along the lines of Zock (2002). How-
ever, contrary to Zock who proposes just a paradig-
matic network with information about the various
ways in which words are similar we would like to
present several existing language resources (LRs)
which will be integrated in such a network result-
ing in more linguistic levels than one with paradig-
matically associated words. We argue that just as
the mental lexicon exhibits various, possibly inter-
woven layers of networks, electronic LRs contain-
ing syntagmatic, morphological and phonological
information need to be integrated into an associa-
tive electronic dictionary.
