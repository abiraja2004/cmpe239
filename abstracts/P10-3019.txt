The aim of this work is to present some
preliminary results of an investigation in
course on the typology of the morphol-
ogy of the native South American lan-
guages from the point of view of the for-
mal language theory. With this object,
we give two contrasting examples of de-
scriptions of two Aboriginal languages fi-
nite verb forms morphology: Argentinean
Quechua (quichua santiaguen?o) and Toba.
The description of the morphology of the
finite verb forms of Argentinean quechua,
uses finite automata and finite transducers.
In this case the construction is straight-
forward using two level morphology and
then, describes in a very natural way the
Argentinean Quechua morphology using
a regular language. On the contrary, the
Toba verbs morphology, with a system that
simultaneously uses prefixes and suffixes,
has not a natural description as regular lan-
guage. Toba has a complex system of
causative suffixes, whose successive ap-
plications determinate the use of prefixes
belonging different person marking pre-
fix sets. We adopt the solution of Crei-
der et al (1995) to naturally deal with this
and other similar morphological processes
which involve interactions between pre-
fixes and suffixes and then we describe the
toba morphology using linear context-free
languages.1.
