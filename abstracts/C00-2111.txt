 
After 3 years of specifying the UNL (Universal Networking Language) language and 
prototyping deconverters I from more than 12 languages and enconverters for about 4, the 
UNL project has opened to the community by publishing the specifcations (v2.0) of the UNL 
language, intended to encode the meaning of NL utterances as semantic hypergraphs and to be 
used as a "pivot" representation in multilingual information and communication systems. 
A UNL document is an html document with special tags to delimit the utterances and their 
rendering in UNL and in all natural languages currently handled. UNL can be viewed as the 
future "html of the linguistic content". It is only an interface format, leading as well to the reuse 
of existing NLP components as to the development of original tools in a variety of possible 
applications, from automatic rough enconversion for information retrieval and information 
gathering translation to partially interactive nconversion or deconversion for higher quality. 
We illustrate these points by describing an UNL-French deconverter organized as a specific 
"localizer" followed by a classical MT transfer and an existing generator.
