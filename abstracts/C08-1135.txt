 
We describe and evaluate a new method 
of automatic seed word selection for un-
supervised  sentiment  classification  of 
product  reviews  in  Chinese.  The  whole 
method is unsupervised and does not re-
quire any annotated training data; it only 
requires information about commonly oc-
curring negations  and adverbials.  Unsu-
pervised  techniques  are  promising  for 
this task since they avoid problems of do-
main-dependency  typically  associated 
with supervised methods. The results ob-
tained  are  close  to  those  of  supervised 
classifiers and sometimes better, up to an 
F1 of 92%.
