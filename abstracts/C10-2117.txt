We go beyond simple propositional mean-
ing extraction and present experiments in
determining which propositions in text the
author believes. We show that deep syn-
tactic parsing helps for this task. Our
best feature combination achieves an F-
measure of 64%, a relative reduction in F-
measure error of 21% over not using syn-
tactic features.
