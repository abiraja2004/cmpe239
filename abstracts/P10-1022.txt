Once released, treebanks tend to remain
unchanged despite any shortcomings in
their depth of linguistic analysis or cover-
age of specific phenomena. Instead, sepa-
rate resources are created to address such
problems. In this paper we show how to
improve the quality of a treebank, by in-
tegrating resources and implementing im-
proved analyses for specific constructions.
We demonstrate this rebanking process
by creating an updated version of CCG-
bank that includes the predicate-argument
structure of both verbs and nouns, base-
NP brackets, verb-particle constructions,
and restrictive and non-restrictive nominal
modifiers; and evaluate the impact of these
changes on a statistical parser.
