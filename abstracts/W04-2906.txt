Automatic topic segmentation, separation of
a discourse stream into its constituent sto-
ries or topics, is a necessary preprocessing
step for applications such as information re-
trieval, anaphora resolution, and summariza-
tion. While significant progress has been made
in this area for text sources and for English au-
dio sources, little work has been done in au-
tomatic segmentation of other languages us-
ing both text and acoustic information. In
this paper, we focus on exploiting both textual
and prosodic features for topic segmentation of
Mandarin Chinese. As a tone language, Man-
darin presents special challenges for applica-
bility of intonation-based techniques, since the
pitch contour is also used to establish lexical
identity. However, intonational cues such as re-
duction in pitch and intensity at topic bound-
aries and increase in duration and pause still
provide significant contrasts in Mandarin Chi-
nese. We first build a decision tree classi-
fier that based only on prosodic information
achieves boundary classification accuracy of
89-95.8% on a large standard test set. We
then contrast these results with a simple text
similarity-based classification scheme. Finally
we build a merged classifier, finding the best
effectiveness for systems integrating text and
prosodic cues.
