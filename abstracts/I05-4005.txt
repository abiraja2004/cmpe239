Preservation of an endangered language is an 
important and difficult task. The preservation 
project should include documentation, archiv-
ing and development of shared resources for the 
endangered language. In addition, the project 
will consider how to revitalize this endangered 
language among the younger generation. In this 
paper, we propose an integrated framework that 
will connect the three different tasks: language 
archiving, language processing and creating 
learning materials. We are using this framework 
to document one Taiwanese aboriginal lan-
guage: Yami.  The proposed framework should 
be an effective tool for documenting other en-
dangered languages in Asia.
