Hidden properties of social media users, such
as their ethnicity, gender, and location, are of-
ten reflected in their observed attributes, such
as their first and last names. Furthermore,
users who communicate with each other of-
ten have similar hidden properties. We pro-
pose an algorithm that exploits these insights
to cluster the observed attributes of hundreds
of millions of Twitter users. Attributes such
as user names are grouped together if users
with those names communicate with other
similar users. We separately cluster millions
of unique first names, last names, and user-
provided locations. The efficacy of these clus-
ters is then evaluated on a diverse set of clas-
sification tasks that predict hidden users prop-
erties such as ethnicity, geographic location,
gender, language, and race, using only pro-
file names and locations when appropriate.
Our readily-replicable approach and publicly-
released clusters are shown to be remarkably
effective and versatile, substantially outper-
forming state-of-the-art approaches and hu-
man accuracy on each of the tasks studied.
