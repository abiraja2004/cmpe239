 
In this paper, we describe in brief our 
system for the Second International 
Chinese Word Segmentation Bakeoff 
sponsored by the ACL-SIGHAN. We 
participated in all tracks at the bakeoff. 
The evaluation results show our system 
can achieve an F measure of 0.940-
0.967 for different testing corpora.
