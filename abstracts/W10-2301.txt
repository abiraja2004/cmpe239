tering and its applications in computational 
linguistics. We summarize graph-based clus-
tering as a five-part story: hypothesis, model-
ing, measure, algorithm and evaluation. We 
then survey three typical NLP problems in 
which graph-based clustering approaches 
have been successfully applied.  Finally, we 
comment on the strengths and weaknesses of 
graph-based clustering and envision that 
graph-based clustering is a promising solu-
tion for some emerging NLP problems.
