With ever-increasing demands on the diver-
sity of annotations of language data, the
need arises to reduce the amount of efforts
involved in generating such value-added lan-
guage resources. We introduce here the Jena
ANnotation Environment (JANE), a platform
that supports the complete annotation life-
cycle and allows for ?focused? annotation
based on active learning. The focus we pro-
vide yields significant savings in annotation
efforts by presenting only informative items
to the annotator. We report on our experi-
ence with this approach through simulated
and real-world annotations in the domain of
immunogenetics for NE annotations.
