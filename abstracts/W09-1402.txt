We describe a system for extracting com-
plex events among genes and proteins from
biomedical literature, developed in context of
the BioNLP?09 Shared Task on Event Extrac-
tion. For each event, its text trigger, class, and
arguments are extracted. In contrast to the pre-
vailing approaches in the domain, events can
be arguments of other events, resulting in a
nested structure that better captures the under-
lying biological statements. We divide the task
into independent steps which we approach as
machine learning problems. We define a wide
array of features and in particular make ex-
tensive use of dependency parse graphs. A
rule-based post-processing step is used to re-
fine the output in accordance with the restric-
tions of the extraction task. In the shared task
evaluation, the system achieved an F-score of
51.95% on the primary task, the best perfor-
mance among the participants.
