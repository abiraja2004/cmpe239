Understanding the decoding algorithm for
hidden Markov models is a difficult task
for many students. A comprehensive un-
derstanding is difficult to gain from static
state transition diagrams and tables of ob-
servation production probabilities. We
have built a number of visualizations de-
picting a hidden Markov model for part-
of-speech tagging and the operation of the
Viterbi algorithm. The visualizations are
designed to help students grasp the oper-
ation of the HMM. In addition, we have
found that the displays are useful as de-
bugging tools for experienced researchers.
