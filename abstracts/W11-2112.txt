We describe TINE, a new automatic evalua-
tion metric for Machine Translation that aims
at assessing segment-level adequacy. Lexical
similarity and shallow-semantics are used as
indicators of adequacy between machine and
reference translations. The metric is based on
the combination of a lexical matching com-
ponent and an adequacy component. Lexi-
cal matching is performed comparing bags-
of-words without any linguistic annotation.
The adequacy component consists in: i) us-
ing ontologies to align predicates (verbs), ii)
using semantic roles to align predicate argu-
ments (core arguments and modifiers), and
iii) matching predicate arguments using dis-
tributional semantics. TINE?s performance
is comparable to that of previous metrics
at segment level for several language pairs,
with average Kendall?s tau correlation from
0.26 to 0.29. We show that the addition of
the shallow-semantic component improves the
performance of simple lexical matching strate-
gies and metrics such as BLEU.
