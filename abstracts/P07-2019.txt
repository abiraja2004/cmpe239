 
On a multi-dimensional text categorization 
task, we compare the effectiveness of a fea-
ture based approach with the use of a state-
of-the-art sequential learning technique that 
has proven successful for tasks such as 
?email act classification?.  Our evaluation 
demonstrates for the three separate dimen-
sions of a well established annotation 
scheme that novel thread based features 
have a greater and more consistent impact 
on classification performance.
