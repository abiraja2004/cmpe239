We propose an unsupervised method for au-
tomatically calculating word usage similar-
ity in social media data based on topic mod-
elling, which we contrast with a baseline dis-
tributional method and Weighted Textual Ma-
trix Factorization. We evaluate these meth-
ods against a novel dataset made up of human
ratings over 550 Twitter message pairs anno-
tated for usage similarity for a set of 10 nouns.
The results show that our topic modelling ap-
proach outperforms the other two methods.
