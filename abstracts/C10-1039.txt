Abstract
We present a novel graph-based summa-
rization framework (Opinosis) that generates
concise abstractive summaries of highly re-
dundant opinions. Evaluation results on sum-
marizing user reviews show that Opinosis
summaries have better agreement with hu-
man summaries compared to the baseline ex-
tractive method. The summaries are readable,
reasonably well-formed and are informative
enough to convey the major opinions.
