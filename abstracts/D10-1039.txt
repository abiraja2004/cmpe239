Several recent discourse parsers have em-
ployed fully-supervised machine learning ap-
proaches. These methods require human an-
notators to beforehand create an extensive
training corpus, which is a time-consuming
and costly process. On the other hand, un-
labeled data is abundant and cheap to col-
lect. In this paper, we propose a novel
semi-supervised method for discourse rela-
tion classification based on the analysis of co-
occurring features in unlabeled data, which is
then taken into account for extending the fea-
ture vectors given to a classifier. Our exper-
imental results on the RST Discourse Tree-
bank corpus and Penn Discourse Treebank in-
dicate that the proposed method brings a sig-
nificant improvement in classification accu-
racy and macro-average F-score when small
training datasets are used. For instance, with
training sets of c.a. 1000 labeled instances, the
proposed method brings improvements in ac-
curacy and macro-average F-score up to 50%
compared to a baseline classifier. We believe
that the proposed method is a first step towards
detecting low-occurrence relations, which is
useful for domains with a lack of annotated
data.
