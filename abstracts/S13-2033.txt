We present our system WSD2 which partic-
ipated in the Cross-Lingual Word-Sense Dis-
ambiguation task for SemEval 2013 (Lefever
and Hoste, 2013). The system closely resem-
bles our winning system for the same task in
SemEval 2010. It is based on k-nearest neigh-
bour classifiers which map words with local
and global context features onto their transla-
tion, i.e. their cross-lingual sense. The sys-
tem participated in the task for all five lan-
guages and obtained winning scores for four
of them when asked to predict the best trans-
lation(s). We tested various configurations of
our system, focusing on various levels of hy-
perparameter optimisation and feature selec-
tion. Our final results indicate that hyperpa-
rameter optimisation did not lead to the best
results, indicating overfitting by our optimisa-
tion method in this aspect. Feature selection
does have a modest positive impact.
