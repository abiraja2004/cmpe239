We present a portable translator that rec-
ognizes and translates phrases on sign-
boards and menus as captured by a built-
in camera. This system can be used on
PDAs or mobile phones and resolves the
difficulty of inputting some character sets
such as Japanese and Chinese if the user
doesn?t know their readings. Through the
high speed mobile network, small images
of signboards can be quickly sent to the
recognition and translation server. Since
the server runs state of the art recogni-
tion and translation technology and huge
dictionaries, the proposed system offers
more accurate character recognition and
machine translation.
