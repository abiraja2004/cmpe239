 
Wikipedia is the largest organized knowledge 
repository on the Web, increasingly employed 
by natural language processing and search tools. 
In this paper, we investigate the task of labeling 
Wikipedia pages with standard named entity 
tags, which can be used further by a range of in-
formation extraction and language processing 
tools. To train the classifiers, we manually anno-
tated a small set of Wikipedia pages and then ex-
trapolated the annotations using the Wikipedia 
category information to a much larger training 
set. We employed several distinct features for 
each page: bag-of-words, page structure, ab-
stract, titles, and entity mentions. We report high 
accuracies for several of the classifiers built. As 
a result of this work, a Web service that classi-
fies any Wikipedia page has been made available 
to the academic community.
