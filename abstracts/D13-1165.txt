Pronunciation dictionaries provide a readily
available parallel corpus for learning to trans-
duce between character strings and phoneme
strings or vice versa. Translation models can
be used to derive character-level paraphrases
on either side of this transduction, allowing
for the automatic derivation of alternative pro-
nunciations or spellings. We examine finite-
state and SMT-based methods for these related
tasks, and demonstrate that the tasks have
different characteristics ? finding alternative
spellings is harder than alternative pronunci-
ations and benefits from round-trip algorithms
when the other does not. We also show that
we can increase accuracy by modeling sylla-
ble stress.
