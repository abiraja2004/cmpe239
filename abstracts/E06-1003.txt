We present a weakly supervised approach
to automatic Ontology Population from
text and compare it with other two unsu-
pervised approaches. In our experiments
we populate a part of our ontology of
Named Entities. We considered two high
level categories - geographical locations
and person names and ten sub-classes for
each category. For each sub-class, from
a list of training examples and a syntac-
tically parsed corpus, we automatically
learn a syntactic model - a set of weighted
syntactic features, i.e. words which typ-
ically co-occur in certain syntactic posi-
tions with the members of that class. The
model is then used to classify the unknown
Named Entities in the test set. The method
is weakly supervised, since no annotated
corpus is used in the learning process. We
achieved promising results, i.e. 65% accu-
racy, outperforming significantly previous
unsupervised approaches.
