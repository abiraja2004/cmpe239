Traditional approaches to Information Ex-
traction (IE) from speech input simply
consist in applying text based methods to
the output of an Automatic Speech Recog-
nition (ASR) system. If it gives satis-
faction with low Word Error Rate (WER)
transcripts, we believe that a tighter inte-
gration of the IE and ASR modules can
increase the IE performance in more dif-
ficult conditions. More specifically this
paper focuses on the robust extraction of
Named Entities from speech input where
a temporal mismatch between training and
test corpora occurs. We describe a Named
Entity Recognition (NER) system, de-
veloped within the French Rich Broad-
cast News Transcription program ESTER,
which is specifically optimized to pro-
cess ASR transcripts and can be integrated
into the search process of the ASR mod-
ules. Finally we show how some meta-
data information can be collected in or-
der to adapt NER and ASR models to new
conditions and how they can be used in a
task of Named Entity indexation of spoken
archives.
