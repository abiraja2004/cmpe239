 
News tweets that report what is happen-
ing have become an important real-time 
information source. We raise the prob-
lem of Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) 
for news tweets, which is meaningful for 
fine grained information extraction and 
retrieval. We present a self-supervised 
learning approach to train a domain spe-
cific SRL system to resolve the problem. 
A large volume of training data is auto-
matically labeled, by leveraging the ex-
isting SRL system on news domain and 
content similarity between news and 
news tweets. On a human annotated test 
set, our system achieves  state-of-the-art 
performance, outperforming the SRL 
system trained on news.
