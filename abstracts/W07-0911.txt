The linguistic features of material in Cul-
tural Heritage (CH) archives may be in var-
ious languages requiring a facility for ef-
fective multilingual search. The specialised
language often associated with CH content
introduces problems for automatic transla-
tion to support search applications. The
MultiMatch project is focused on enabling
users to interact with CH content across
different media types and languages. We
present results from a MultiMatch study ex-
ploring various translation techniques for
the CH domain. Our experiments ex-
amine translation techniques for the En-
glish language CLEF 2006 Cross-Language
Speech Retrieval (CL-SR) task using Span-
ish, French and German queries. Re-
sults compare effectiveness of our query
translation against a monolingual baseline
and show improvement when combining a
domain-specific translation lexicon with a
standard machine translation system.
