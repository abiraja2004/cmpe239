The large combined search space of joint word
segmentation and Part-of-Speech (POS) tag-
ging makes efficient decoding very hard. As a
result, effective high order features represent-
ing rich contexts are inconvenient to use. In
this work, we propose a novel stacked sub-
word model for this task, concerning both ef-
ficiency and effectiveness. Our solution is
a two step process. First, one word-based
segmenter, one character-based segmenter and
one local character classifier are trained to pro-
duce coarse segmentation and POS informa-
tion. Second, the outputs of the three pre-
dictors are merged into sub-word sequences,
which are further bracketed and labeled with
POS tags by a fine-grained sub-word tag-
ger. The coarse-to-fine search scheme is effi-
cient, while in the sub-word tagging step rich
contextual features can be approximately de-
rived. Evaluation on the Penn Chinese Tree-
bank shows that our model yields improve-
ments over the best system reported in the lit-
erature.
