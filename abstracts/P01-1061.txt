The standard pipeline approach to se-
mantic processing, in which sentences
are morphologically and syntactically
resolved to a single tree before they
are interpreted, is a poor fit for ap-
plications such as natural language in-
terfaces. This is because the environ-
ment information, in the form of the ob-
jects and events in the application?s run-
time environment, cannot be used to in-
form parsing decisions unless the in-
put sentence is semantically analyzed,
but this does not occur until after pars-
ing in the single-tree semantic architec-
ture. This paper describes the compu-
tational properties of an alternative ar-
chitecture, in which semantic analysis
is performed on all possible interpre-
tations during parsing, in polynomial
time.
