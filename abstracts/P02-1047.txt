We present an unsupervised approach to
recognizing discourse relations of CON-
TRAST, EXPLANATION-EVIDENCE, CON-
DITION and ELABORATION that hold be-
tween arbitrary spans of texts. We show
that discourse relation classifiers trained
on examples that are automatically ex-
tracted from massive amounts of text can
be used to distinguish between some of
these relations with accuracies as high as
93%, even when the relations are not ex-
plicitly marked by cue phrases.
