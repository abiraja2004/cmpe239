This article presents an original lexical
unit extraction system for Chinese. The
method is based on an incremental pro-
cess driven by an association score featur-
ing a minimal resources statistically aided
linguistic approach. We also introduce
a linguistics-based lexical unit definition
and use it to describe an evaluation pro-
tocol dedicated to the task. The experi-
mental results on a domain specific cor-
pus show that the method performs better
than other approaches. The extraction re-
sults, evaluated on a random sample of the
working corpus, show a recall of 68.4 %
and precision of 37.1 %.
