 
The stack decoder is an attractive algorithm for con- 
trolling the acoustic and language model matching in a 
continuous speech recognizer. It implements a best-first 
tree search of the language to find the best match to 
both the language model and the observed speech. This 
paper describes a method for performing the optimal A* 
search which guarantees tofind the most likely path (rec- 
ognized sentence) while extending the minimum number 
of stack entries. A tree search, however, is exponential 
in the number of words. A second algorithm is presented 
which linearizes the search at the cost of approximating 
some of the path likelihoods.
