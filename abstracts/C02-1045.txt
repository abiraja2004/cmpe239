This paper presents a framework for cluster-
ing in text-based information retrieval systems.
The prominent feature of the proposed method
is that documents, terms, and other related el-
ements of textual information are clustered si-
multaneously into small overlapping clusters. In
the paper, the mathematical formulation and
implementation of the clustering method are
briefly introduced, together with some experi-
mental results.
