We present the Pathway Curation (PC)
task, a main event extraction task of
the BioNLP shared task (ST) 2013.
The PC task concerns the automatic ex-
traction of biomolecular reactions from
text. The task setting, representation
and semantics are defined with respect
to pathway model standards and ontolo-
gies (SBML, BioPAX, SBO) and docu-
ments selected by relevance to specific
model reactions. Two BioNLP ST 2013
participants successfully completed the
PC task. The highest achieved F-
score, 52.8%, indicates that event extrac-
tion is a promising approach to support-
ing pathway curation efforts. The PC
task continues as an open challenge with
data, resources and tools available from
