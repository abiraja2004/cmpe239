Automated grammar correction techniques
have seen improvement over the years, but
there is still much room for increased perfor-
mance. Current correction techniques mainly
focus on identifying and correcting a specific
type of error, such as verb form misuse or
preposition misuse, which restricts the correc-
tions to a limited scope. We introduce a novel
technique, based on a noisy channel model,
which can utilize the whole sentence context
to determine proper corrections. We show
how to use the EM algorithm to learn the pa-
rameters of the noise model, using only a data
set of erroneous sentences, given the proper
language model. This frees us from the bur-
den of acquiring a large corpora of corrected
sentences. We also present a cheap and effi-
cient way to provide automated evaluation re-
sults for grammar corrections by using BLEU
and METEOR, in contrast to the commonly
used manual evaluations.
