Bloggers, professional reviewers, and con-
sumers continuously create opinion?rich web
reviews about products and services, with the
result that textual reviews are now abundant on
the web and often convey a useful overall rat-
ing (number of stars). However, an overall rat-
ing cannot express the multiple or conflicting
opinions that might be contained in the text,
or explicitly rate the different aspects of the
evaluated entity. This work addresses the task
of automatically predicting ratings, for given
aspects of a textual review, by assigning a nu-
merical score to each evaluated aspect in the
reviews. We handle this task as both a re-
gression and a classification modeling prob-
lem and explore several combinations of syn-
tactic and semantic features. Our results sug-
gest that classification techniques perform bet-
ter than ranking modeling when handling eval-
uative text.
