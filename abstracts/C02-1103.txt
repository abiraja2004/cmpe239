Automatic text categorization is a problem
of automatically assigning text documents to
predefined categories. In order to classify
text documents, we must extract good
features from them. In previous research, a
text document is commonly represented by
the term frequency and the inverted
document frequency of each feature. Since
there is a difference between important
sentences and unimportant sentences in a
document, the features from more important
sentences should be considered more than
other features. In this paper, we measure the
importance of sentences using text
summarization techniques. Then a document
is represented as a vector of features with
different weights according to the
importance of each sentence. To verify our
new method, we conducted experiments on
two language newsgroup data sets: one
written by English and the other written by
Korean. Four kinds of classifiers were used
in our experiments: Na?ve Bayes, Rocchio,
k-NN, and SVM. We observed that our new
method made a significant improvement in
all classifiers and both data sets.
