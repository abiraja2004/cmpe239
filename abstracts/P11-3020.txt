In my thesis, I propose to build a system that
would enable extraction of social interactions
from texts. To date I have defined a compre-
hensive set of social events and built a prelim-
inary system that extracts social events from
news articles. I plan to improve the perfor-
mance of my current system by incorporating
semantic information. Using domain adapta-
tion techniques, I propose to apply my sys-
tem to a wide range of genres. By extracting
linguistic constructs relevant to social interac-
tions, I will be able to empirically analyze dif-
ferent kinds of linguistic constructs that peo-
ple use to express social interactions. Lastly, I
will attempt to make convolution kernels more
scalable and interpretable.
