This paper presents the end-to-end evalu-
ation of an automatic simultaneous trans-
lation system, built with state-of-the-art
components. It shows whether, and for
which situations, such a system might be
advantageous when compared to a human
interpreter. Using speeches in English
translated into Spanish, we present the
evaluation procedure and we discuss the
results both for the recognition and trans-
lation components as well as for the over-
all system. Even if the translation process
remains the Achilles? heel of the system,
the results show that the system can keep
at least half of the information, becoming
potentially useful for final users.
