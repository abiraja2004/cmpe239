We introduce a scheme for optimally al-
locating a variable number of bits per
LSH hyperplane. Previous approaches as-
sign a constant number of bits per hyper-
plane. This neglects the fact that a subset
of hyperplanes may be more informative
than others. Our method, dubbed Variable
Bit Quantisation (VBQ), provides a data-
driven non-uniform bit allocation across
hyperplanes. Despite only using a fraction
of the available hyperplanes, VBQ outper-
forms uniform quantisation by up to 168%
for retrieval across standard text and image
datasets.
