In this paper we study spectral learning
methods for non-deterministic split head-
automata grammars, a powerful hidden-
state formalism for dependency parsing.
We present a learning algorithm that, like
other spectral methods, is efficient and non-
susceptible to local minima. We show
how this algorithm can be formulated as
a technique for inducing hidden structure
from distributions computed by forward-
backward recursions. Furthermore, we
also present an inside-outside algorithm
for the parsing model that runs in cubic
time, hence maintaining the standard pars-
ing costs for context-free grammars.
