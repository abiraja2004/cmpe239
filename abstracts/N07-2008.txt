We present a fast method to identify
homogeneous parallel documents. The
method is based on collecting counts of
identical low-frequency words between
possibly parallel documents. The candi-
date with the most shared low-frequency
words is selected as the parallel document.
The method achieved 99.96% accuracy
when tested on the EUROPARL corpus
of parliamentary proceedings, failing only
in anomalous cases of truncated or oth-
erwise distorted documents. While other
work has shown similar performance on
this type of dataset, our approach pre-
sented here is faster and does not require
training. Apart from proposing an effi-
cient method for parallel document iden-
tification in a restricted domain, this pa-
per furnishes evidence that parliamentary
proceedings may be inappropriate for test-
ing parallel document identification sys-
tems in general.
