This paper addressees the problem of eliminat-
ing unsatisfactory outputs from machine trans-
lation (MT) systems. The authors intend to
eliminate unsatisfactory MT outputs by using
confidence measures. Confidence measures for
MT outputs include the rank-sum-based confi-
dence measure (RSCM) for statistical machine
translation (SMT) systems. RSCM can be ap-
plied to non-SMT systems but does not always
work well on them. This paper proposes an
alternative RSCM that adopts a mixture of the
N-best lists from multiple MT systems instead
of a single-system?s N-best list in the exist-
ing RSCM. In most cases, the proposed RSCM
proved to work better than the existing RSCM
on two non-SMT systems and to work as well
as the existing RSCM on an SMT system.
