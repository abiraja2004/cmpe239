We present a novel algorithm for the acqui-
sition of multilingual lexical taxonomies (in-
cluding hyponymy/hypernymy, meronymy
and taxonomic cousinhood), from monolin-
gual corpora with minimal supervision in the
form of seed exemplars using discriminative
learning across the major WordNet seman-
tic relationships. This capability is also ex-
tended robustly and effectively to a second
language (Hindi) via cross-language projec-
tion of the various seed exemplars. We also
present a novel model of translation dic-
tionary induction via multilingual transitive
models of hypernymy and hyponymy, us-
ing these induced taxonomies. Candidate
lexical translation probabilities are based on
the probability that their induced hyponyms
and/or hypernyms are translations of one an-
other. We evaluate all of the above models
on English and Hindi.
