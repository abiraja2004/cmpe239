 
In this paper we study the effectiveness of 
applying sentence compression on an ex-
traction based multi-document summari-
zation system. Our results show that pure 
syntactic-based compression does not im-
prove system performance. Topic signa-
ture-based reranking of compressed 
sentences does not help much either.  
However reranking using an oracle 
showed a significant improvement re-
mains possible.  
Keywords: Text Summarization, Sentence 
Extraction, Sentence Compression,
