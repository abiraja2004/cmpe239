Standard pairwise coreference resolution
systems are subject to errors resulting
from their performing anaphora identifi-
cation as an implicit part of coreference
resolution. In this paper, we propose
an integer linear programming (ILP) for-
mulation for coreference resolution which
models anaphoricity and coreference as a
joint task, such that each local model in-
forms the other for the final assignments.
This joint ILP formulation provides f -
score improvements of 3.7-5.3% over a
base coreference classifier on the ACE
datasets.
