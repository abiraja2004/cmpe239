 
This paper describes our effort to mark and 
annotate read Cantonese speech for both citation 
pronunciation and reading aloud 
sentences/phrases. Four signals are recorded 
simultaneously to assist marking and annotation: 
acoustic, laryngograph, nasal and air burst 
signals. A coarse match between voiced 
segments of speech and voiced segments of the 
phonetic spelling of the utterance is executed by 
dynamic programming asfor approximate string 
matching. Finally, we discuss general issues in 
the design of our softxvare for annotation. (a)
