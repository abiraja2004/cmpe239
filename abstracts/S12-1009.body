 
Corpus-based thesaurus construction for Mor-
phologically Rich Languages (MRL) is a com-
plex task, due to the morphological variability 
of MRL. In this paper we explore alternative 
term representations, complemented by cluster-
ing of morphological variants. We introduce a 
generic algorithmic scheme for thesaurus con-
struction in MRL, and demonstrate the empiri-
cal benefit of our methodology for a Hebrew 
thesaurus.
