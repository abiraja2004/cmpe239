This work performs some basic research upon
topical poetry segmentation in a pilot study
designed to test some initial assumptions and
methodologies. Nine segmentations of the
poem titled Kubla Khan (Coleridge, 1816,
pp. 55-58) are collected and analysed, pro-
ducing low but comparable inter-coder agree-
ment. Analyses and discussions of these cod-
ings focus upon how to improve agreement
and outline some initial results on the nature
of topics in this poem.
