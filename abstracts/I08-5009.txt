 
In this paper, we present a domain focused 
Tamil Named Entity Recognizer for 
tourism domain. This method takes care of 
morphological inflections of named entities 
(NE). It handles nested tagging of named 
entities with a hierarchical tagset 
containing 106 tags. The tagset is designed 
with focus to tourism domain. We have 
experimented building Conditional 
Random Field (CRF) models by training 
the noun phrases of the training data and it 
gives encouraging results.
