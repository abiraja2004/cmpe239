The ability to generate or to recognize
paraphrases is key to the vast majority of
NLP applications. As correctly exploit-
ing context during translation has been
shown to be successful, using context in-
formation for paraphrasing could also lead
to improved performance. In this arti-
cle, we adopt the pivot approach based
on parallel multilingual corpora proposed
by (Bannard and Callison-Burch, 2005),
which finds short paraphrases by finding
appropriate pivot phrases in one or several
auxiliary languages and back-translating
these pivot phrases into the original lan-
guage. We show how context can be ex-
ploited both when attempting to find pivot
phrases, and when looking for the most
appropriate paraphrase in the original sub-
sentential ?envelope?. This framework al-
lows the use of paraphrasing units ranging
from words to large sub-sentential frag-
ments for which context information from
the sentence can be successfully exploited.
We report experiments on a text revision
task, and show that in these experiments
our contextual sub-sentential paraphrasing
system outperforms a strong baseline sys-
tem.
