We present for the first time a compu-
tational model for the reduplication of
the Vietnamese language. Reduplication
is a popular phenomenon of Vietnamese
in which reduplicative words are created
by the combination of multiple syllables
whose phonics are similar. We first give
a systematical study of Vietnamese redu-
plicative words, bringing into focus clear
principles for the formation of a large class
of bi-syllabic reduplicative words. We then
make use of optimal finite-state devices,
in particular minimal sequential string-to
string transducers to build a computational
model for very efficient recognition and
production of those words. Finally, sev-
eral nice applications of this computa-
tional model are discussed.
