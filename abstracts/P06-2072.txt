 
In this paper we propose a small set of 
lexical conceptual relations which allow 
to encode adjectives in computational re-
lational lexica in a principled and inte-
grated way. Our main motivation comes 
from the fact that adjectives and certain 
classes of verbs, related in a way or an-
other with adjectives, do not have a satis-
factory representation in this kind of 
lexica. This is due to a great extent to the 
heterogeneity of their semantic and syn-
tactic properties. We sustain that such 
properties are mostly derived from the 
relations holding between adjectives and 
other POS. Accordingly, our proposal is 
mainly concerned with the specification 
of appropriate cross-POS relations to en-
code adjectives in lexica of the type con-
sidered here.
