In situated dialogue, because humans and
agents have mismatched capabilities of
perceiving the shared physical world, ref-
erential grounding becomes difficult. Hu-
mans and agents will need to make ex-
tra efforts by collaborating with each other
to mediate a shared perceptual basis and
to come to a mutual understanding of in-
tended referents in the environment. In
this paper, we have extended our previous
graph-matching based approach to explic-
itly incorporate collaborative referring be-
haviors into the referential grounding al-
gorithm. In addition, hypergraph-based
representations have been used to account
for group descriptions that are likely to oc-
cur in spatial communications. Our empir-
ical results have shown that incorporating
the most prevalent pattern of collaboration
with our hypergraph-based approach sig-
nificantly improves reference resolution in
situated dialogue by an absolute gain of
over 18%.
