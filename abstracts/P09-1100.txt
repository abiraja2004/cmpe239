User simulations are shown to be useful in
spoken dialog system development. Since
most current user simulations deploy prob-
ability models to mimic human user be-
haviors, how to set up user action proba-
bilities in these models is a key problem
to solve. One generally used approach is
to estimate these probabilities from human
user data. However, when building a new
dialog system, usually no data or only a
small amount of data is available. In this
study, we compare estimating user proba-
bilities from a small user data set versus
handcrafting the probabilities. We discuss
the pros and cons of both solutions for dif-
ferent dialog system development tasks.
