This paper presents a word segmenta-
tion system in France Telecom R&D 
Beijing, which uses a unified approach 
to word breaking and OOV identifica-
tion. The output can be customized to 
meet different segmentation standards 
through the application of an ordered 
list of transformation. The system par-
ticipated in all the tracks of the seg-
mentation bakeoff -- PK-open, PK-
closed, AS-open, AS-closed, HK-open, 
HK-closed, MSR-open and MSR-
closed -- and achieved the state-of-the-
art performance in MSR-open, MSR-
close and PK-open tracks. Analysis of 
the results shows that each component 
of the system contributed to the scores.
