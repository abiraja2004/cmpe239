An open problem in dependency parsing
is the accurate and efficient treatment of
non-projective structures. We propose to
attack this problem using chart-parsing
algorithms developed for mildly context-
sensitive grammar formalisms. In this pa-
per, we provide two key tools for this ap-
proach. First, we show how to reduce non-
projective dependency parsing to parsing
with Linear Context-Free Rewriting Sys-
tems (LCFRS), by presenting a technique
for extracting LCFRS from dependency
treebanks. For efficient parsing, the ex-
tracted grammars need to be transformed
in order to minimize the number of nonter-
minal symbols per production. Our second
contribution is an algorithm that computes
this transformation for a large, empirically
relevant class of grammars.
