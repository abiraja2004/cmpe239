 
SMS dictation by voice is becoming a viable al-
ternative providing a convenient method for 
texting in a variety of environments. Contextual 
knowledge should be used to improve perfor-
mance. We propose to add topic knowledge as 
part of the contextual awareness of both texting 
partners during SMS conversations. Topics can 
be used for speech applications, if the relation 
between the conversed topics and the choice of 
words in SMS dialogs is measurable. In this 
study, we collected an SMS corpus, developed 
a topic annotation scheme, and built a topic hie-
rarchy in a tree structure. We validated our top-
ic assignments and tree structure by the 
Agglomerative Information Bottleneck method, 
which also proved the measurability of the in-
terrelation between topics and wording. To 
quantify this relation we propose a na?ve classi-
fication method based on the calculation of top-
ic distinctive word lists and compare the 
classifiers? topic recognition capabilities for 
SMS dialogs with unigram language models. 
The results demonstrate that the relation be-
tween topic and wording is significant and can 
be integrated into SMS dictation.
