The extensive use of Multiword Expressions
(MWE) in natural language texts prompts
more detailed studies that aim for a more ade-
quate treatment of these expressions. A MWE
typically expresses concepts and ideas that
usually cannot be expressed by a single word.
Intuitively, with the appropriate treatment of
MWEs, the results of an Information Retrieval
(IR) system could be improved. The aim of
this paper is to apply techniques for the au-
tomatic extraction of MWEs from corpora to
index them as a single unit. Experimental re-
sults show improvements on the retrieval of
relevant documents when identifying MWEs
and treating them as a single indexing unit.
