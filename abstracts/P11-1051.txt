In citation-based summarization, text written
by several researchers is leveraged to identify
the important aspects of a target paper. Previ-
ous work on this problem focused almost ex-
clusively on its extraction aspect (i.e. selecting
a representative set of citation sentences that
highlight the contribution of the target paper).
Meanwhile, the fluency of the produced sum-
maries has been mostly ignored. For exam-
ple, diversity, readability, cohesion, and order-
ing of the sentences included in the summary
have not been thoroughly considered. This re-
sulted in noisy and confusing summaries. In
this work, we present an approach for produc-
ing readable and cohesive citation-based sum-
maries. Our experiments show that the pro-
posed approach outperforms several baselines
in terms of both extraction quality and fluency.
