This paper describes a system that jointly
parses syntactic and semantic dependen-
cies, presented at the CoNLL-2008 shared
task (Surdeanu et al, 2008). It combines
online Peceptron learning (Collins, 2002)
with a parsing model based on the Eisner
algorithm (Eisner, 1996), extended so as
to jointly assign syntactic and semantic la-
bels. Overall results are 78.11 global F
1
,
85.84 LAS, 70.35 semantic F
1
. Official re-
sults for the shared task (63.29 global F
1
;
71.95 LAS; 54.52 semantic F
1
) were sig-
nificantly lower due to bugs present at sub-
mission time.
