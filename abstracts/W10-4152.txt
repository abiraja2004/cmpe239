 
Personal name disambiguation becomes hot as it 
provides a way to incorporate semantic under-
standing into information retrieval. In this cam-
paign, we explore Chinese personal name 
disambiguation in news. In order to examine how 
well disambiguation technologies work, we con-
centrate on news articles, which is well-formatted 
and whose genre is well-studied. We then design a 
diagnosis test to explore the impact of Chinese 
word segmentation to personal name disambigua-
tion.
