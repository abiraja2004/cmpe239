This paper reports on a study of inter-
annotator agreement (IAA) for a dependency
annotation scheme designed for learner En-
glish. Reliably-annotated learner corpora are
a necessary step for the development of POS
tagging and parsing of learner language. In
our study, three annotators marked several
layers of annotation over different levels of
learner texts, and they were able to obtain
generally high agreement, especially after dis-
cussing the disagreements among themselves,
without researcher intervention, illustrating
the feasibility of the scheme. We pinpoint
some of the problems in obtaining full agree-
ment, including annotation scheme vagueness
for certain learner innovations, interface de-
sign issues, and difficult syntactic construc-
tions. In the process, we also develop ways to
calculate agreements for sets of dependencies.
