This paper presents an approach to detec-
tion of the semantic types of relation argu-
ments employing the WordNet hierarchy. Us-
ing the SemEval-2007 data, we show that
the method allows to generalize relation ar-
guments with high precision for such generic
relations as Origin-Entity, Content-Container,
Instrument-Agency and some other.
