We directly investigate a subject of much
recent debate: do word sense disambiga-
tion models help statistical machine trans-
lation quality? We present empirical re-
sults casting doubt on this common, but
unproved, assumption. Using a state-of-
the-art Chinese word sense disambigua-
tion model to choose translation candi-
dates for a typical IBM statistical MT
system, we find that word sense disam-
biguation does not yield significantly bet-
ter translation quality than the statistical
machine translation system alone. Error
analysis suggests several key factors be-
hind this surprising finding, including in-
herent limitations of current statistical MT
architectures.
