 
This paper proposes a new algorithm 
that simultaneously identifies the cod- 
ing system and language of a code string 
fetched from the Internet, especially 
World-Wide Web. The algorithm uses 
statistic language models to select the 
correctly decoded string as well as to de- 
termine the language. The proposed al- 
gorithm covers 9 languages and 11 cod- 
ing systems used in Eastern Asia and 
Western Europe. Experimental results 
show that the level of accuracy of our al- 
gorithm is over 95% for 640 on-line doc- 
uments.
