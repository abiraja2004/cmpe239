 
This paper approaches the scope learning 
problem via simplified shallow semantic pars-
ing. This is done by regarding the cue as the 
predicate and mapping its scope into several 
constituents as the arguments of the cue. 
Evaluation on the BioScope corpus shows that 
the structural information plays a critical role 
in capturing the relationship between a cue 
and its dominated arguments. It also shows 
that our parsing approach significantly outper-
forms the state-of-the-art chunking ones. Al-
though our parsing approach is only evaluated 
on negation and speculation scope learning 
here, it is portable to other kinds of scope 
learning.
