Understanding the connotation of words
plays an important role in interpreting sub-
tle shades of sentiment beyond denotative
or surface meaning of text, as seemingly
objective statements often allude nuanced
sentiment of the writer, and even purpose-
fully conjure emotion from the readers?
minds. The focus of this paper is draw-
ing nuanced, connotative sentiments from
even those words that are objective on the
surface, such as ?intelligence?, ?human?,
and ?cheesecake?. We propose induction
algorithms encoding a diverse set of lin-
guistic insights (semantic prosody, distri-
butional similarity, semantic parallelism of
coordination) and prior knowledge drawn
from lexical resources, resulting in the first
broad-coverage connotation lexicon.
