  
This paper describes a Question Answer-
ing system which retrieves answers from 
structured data regarding cinemas and 
movies. The system represents the first 
prototype of a multilingual and multi-
modal QA system for the domain of tour-
ism. Based on specially designed domain 
ontology and using Textual Entailment as 
a means for semantic inference, the sys-
tem can be used in both monolingual and 
cross-language settings with slight ad-
justments for new input languages.
