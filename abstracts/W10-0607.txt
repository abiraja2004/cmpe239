 
This work investigates lexical organizat ion of 
verbs looking at the influence of some linguis-
tic factors on the process of lexical acquisition  
and use. Among the factors that may play a 
role in acquisition, in this paper we investigate 
the influence of polysemy. We examine data 
obtained from psycholinguistic action naming  
tasks performed by children and adults 
(speakers of Brazilian Portuguese), and ana-
lyze some characteristics of the verbs used by 
each group in terms of similarity of content, 
using Jaccard?s coefficient, and of topology, 
using graph theory. The experiments suggest 
that younger children tend to use more poly-
semic verbs than adults to describe events in 
the world.
