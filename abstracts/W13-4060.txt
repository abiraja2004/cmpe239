We demonstrate a robotic agent in a 3D
virtual environment that understands hu-
man navigational instructions. Such an
agent needs to select actions based on not
only instructions but also situations. It
is also expected to immediately react to
the instructions. Our agent incrementally
understands spoken instructions and im-
mediately controls a mobile robot based
on the incremental understanding results
and situation information such as the lo-
cations of obstacles and moving history. It
can be used as an experimental system for
collecting human-robot interactions in dy-
namically changing situations.
