 
The goal of text categorization is to classify 
documents into a certain number of pre- 
defined categories. The previous works in 
this area have used a large number of 
labeled training doculnents for supervised 
learning. One problem is that it is difficult to 
create the labeled training documents. While 
it is easy to collect the unlabeled ocuments, 
it is not so easy to manually categorize them 
for creating traiuing documents. In this 
paper, we propose an unsupervised learning 
method to overcome these difficulties. The 
proposed lnethod divides the documents into 
sentences, and categorizes each sentence 
using keyword lists of each category and 
sentence simihuity measure. And then, it 
uses the categorized sentences for refining. 
The proposed method shows a similar 
degree of performance, compared with the 
traditional supervised learning inethods. 
Therefore, this method can be used in areas 
where low-cost ext categorization is needed. 
It also can be used for creating training 
documents.
