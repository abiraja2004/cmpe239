This paper presents a comparative study
of probabilistic treebank parsing of Ger-
man, using the Negra and Tu?Ba-D/Z tree-
banks. Experiments with the Stanford
parser, which uses a factored PCFG and
dependency model, show that, contrary to
previous claims for other parsers, lexical-
ization of PCFG models boosts parsing
performance for both treebanks. The ex-
periments also show that there is a big
difference in parsing performance, when
trained on the Negra and on the Tu?Ba-
D/Z treebanks. Parser performance for the
models trained on Tu?Ba-D/Z are compara-
ble to parsing results for English with the
Stanford parser, when trained on the Penn
treebank. This comparison at least sug-
gests that German is not harder to parse
than its West-Germanic neighbor language
English.
