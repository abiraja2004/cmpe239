We present a novel computational formula-
tion of speaker authority in discourse. This
notion, which focuses on how speakers posi-
tion themselves relative to each other in dis-
course, is first developed into a reliable cod-
ing scheme (0.71 agreement between human
annotators). We also provide a computational
model for automatically annotating text using
this coding scheme, using supervised learning
enhanced by constraints implemented with In-
teger Linear Programming. We show that this
constrained model?s analyses of speaker au-
thority correlates very strongly with expert hu-
man judgments (r2 coefficient of 0.947).
