 
This paper introduces a new dialogue man-
agement framework for goal-directed conver-
sations. A declarative specification defines the 
domain-specific elements and guides the di-
alogue manager, which communicates with the 
knowledge sources to complete the specified 
goal. The user is viewed as another knowledge 
source. The dialogue manager finds the next 
action by a mixture of rule-based reasoning 
and a simple statistical model. Implementation 
in the flight-reservation domain demonstrates 
that the framework enables the developer to 
easily build a conversational dialogue system.
