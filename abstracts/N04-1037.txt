State-of-the-art pronoun interpretation sys-
tems rely predominantly on morphosyntac-
tic contextual features. While the use of
deep knowledge and inference to improve
these models would appear technically in-
feasible, previous work has suggested that
predicate-argument statistics mined from
naturally-occurring data could provide a
useful approximation to such knowledge.
We test this idea in several system configu-
rations, and conclude from our results and
subsequent error analysis that such statis-
tics offer little or no predictive information
above that provided by morphosyntax.
