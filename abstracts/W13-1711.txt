This paper describes the system developed
for the NLI 2013 Shared Task, requiring
to identify a writer?s native language by
some text written in English. I explore the
given manually annotated data using word
features such as the length, endings and
character trigrams. Furthermore, I em-
ploy k-NN classification. Modified TFIDF
is used to generate a stop-word list auto-
matically. The distance between two docu-
ments is calculated combining n-grams of
word lengths and endings, and character
trigrams.
