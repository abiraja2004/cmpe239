We present an unsupervised word seg-
mentation model for machine translation.
The model uses existing monolingual seg-
mentation techniques and models the joint
distribution over source sentence segmen-
tations and alignments to the target sen-
tence. During inference, the monolin-
gual segmentation model and the bilin-
gual word alignment model are coupled
so that the alignments to the target sen-
tence guide the segmentation of the source
sentence. The experiments show improve-
ments on Arabic-English and Chinese-
English translation tasks.
