 
To rapidly port speech applications to 
new languages one of the most difficult 
tasks is the initial collection of sufficient 
speech corpora. State-of-the-art automatic 
speech recognition systems are typical 
trained on hundreds of hours of speech 
data. While pre-existing corpora do exist 
for major languages, a sufficient amount 
of quality speech data is not available for 
most world languages. While previous 
works have focused on the collection of 
translations and the transcription of audio 
via Mechanical-Turk mechanisms, in this 
paper we introduce two tools which ena-
ble the collection of speech data remotely. 
We then compare the quality of audio col-
lected from paid part-time staff and unsu-
pervised volunteers, and determine that 
basic user training is critical to obtain us-
able data.
