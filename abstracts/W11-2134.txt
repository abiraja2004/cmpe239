 This paper presents the Linguatec submission to the WMT 2011 sixth workshop on statistical machine translation. It describes the architecture of our machine translation system ?Personal Translator? (hereinafter also referred to as PT), developed by Linguatec, which is a rule-based translation system, enriched by statistical approaches. We participate for the German-English translation direction. For the current submission we have chosen the latest commercial version of the system, PT14. The translation quality improvement for the submission was done mainly by lexicon tuning:  detection of unknown words, extracting of possible translations, partly from the wmt11 training corpora, and enlarging the lexicon by manually coding the chosen transfer candidates. 1
