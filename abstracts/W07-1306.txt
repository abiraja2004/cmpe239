Quantitative measurement of inter-language
distance is a useful technique for studying
diachronic and synchronic relations between
languages. Such measures have been used
successfully for purposes like deriving lan-
guage taxonomies and language reconstruc-
tion, but they have mostly been applied to
handcrafted word lists. Can we instead
use corpus based measures for comparative
study of languages? In this paper we try to
answer this question. We use three corpus
based measures and present the results ob-
tained from them and show how these results
relate to linguistic and historical knowledge.
We argue that the answer is yes and that such
studies can provide or validate linguistic and
computational insights.
