The effectiveness of parsers based on man-
ually created resources, namely a grammar
and a lexicon, rely mostly on the quality
of these resources. Thus, increasing the
parser coverage and precision usually im-
plies improving these two resources. Their
manual improvement is a time consuming
and complex task : identifying which re-
source is the true culprit for a given mis-
take is not always obvious, as well as find-
ing the mistake and correcting it.
Some techniques, like van Noord (2004)
or Sagot and Villemonte de La Clergerie
(2006), bring a convenient way to automat-
ically identify forms having potentially er-
roneous entries in a lexicon. We have in-
tegrated and extended such techniques in a
wider process which, thanks to the gram-
mar ability to tell how these forms could
be used as part of correct parses, is able to
propose lexical corrections for the identi-
fied entries.
We present in this paper an implementa-
tion of this process and discuss the main re-
sults we have obtained on a syntactic wide-
coverage French lexicon.
