 
This paper is concerned with the problem of 
question search. In question search, given a 
question as query, we are to return questions 
semantically equivalent or close to the queried 
question. In this paper, we propose to conduct 
question search by identifying question topic 
and question focus. More specifically, we first 
summarize questions in a data structure con-
sisting of question topic and question focus. 
Then we model question topic and question 
focus in a language modeling framework for 
search. We also propose to use the MDL-
based tree cut model for identifying question 
topic and question focus automatically. Expe-
rimental results indicate that our approach of 
identifying question topic and question focus 
for search significantly outperforms the base-
line methods such as Vector Space Model 
(VSM) and Language Model for Information 
Retrieval (LMIR).
