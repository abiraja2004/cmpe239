It has long been realized that sublanguages
are relevant to natural language process-
ing and text mining. However, practical
methods for recognizing or characterizing
them have been lacking. This paper de-
scribes a publicly available set of tools for
sublanguage recognition. Closure proper-
ties are used to assess the goodness of fit
of two biomedical corpora to the sublan-
guage model. Scientific journal articles
are compared to general English text, and
it is shown that the journal articles fit the
sublanguage model, while the general En-
glish text does not. A number of examples
of implications of the sublanguage char-
acteristics for natural language processing
are pointed out. The software is made pub-
licly available at [edited for anonymiza-
tion].
