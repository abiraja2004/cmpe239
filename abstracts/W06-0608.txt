Semantic information is important for
precise word sense disambiguation system
and the kind of semantic analysis used in
sophisticated natural language processing
such as machine translation, question
answering, etc. There are at least two
kinds of semantic information: lexical
semantics for words and phrases and
structural semantics for phrases and
sentences.
We have built a Japanese corpus of over
three million words with both lexical
and structural semantic information. In
this paper, we focus on our method of
annotating the lexical semantics, that is
building a word sense tagged corpus and
its properties.
