We present a syntax-based statistical
translation model. Our model trans-
forms a source-language parse tree
into a target-language string by apply-
ing stochastic operations at each node.
These operations capture linguistic dif-
ferences such as word order and case
marking. Model parameters are esti-
mated in polynomial time using an EM
algorithm. The model produces word
alignments that are better than those
produced by IBM Model 5.
