This paper describes and compares two al-
gorithms that take as input a shared PCFG
parse forest and produce shared forests
that contain exactly the n most likely trees
of the initial forest. Such forests are
suitable for subsequent processing, such
as (some types of) reranking or LFG f-
structure computation, that can be per-
formed ontop of a shared forest, but that
may have a high (e.g., exponential) com-
plexity w.r.t. the number of trees contained
in the forest. We evaluate the perfor-
mances of both algorithms on real-scale
NLP forests generated with a PCFG ex-
tracted from the Penn Treebank.
