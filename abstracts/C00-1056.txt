  
Automatic transliteration problem 1s to 
transcribe foreign words in one's own alphabet. 
Machine generated transliteration can be useful 
in various applications uch as indexing in an 
information retrieval system and pronunciation 
synthesis in a text-to-speech system. In this 
paper we present a model for statistical English- 
to-Korean transliteration that generates 
transliteration candidates with probability. The 
model is designed to utilize various information 
sources by extending a conventional Markov 
window. Also, an efficient and accurate method 
for alignment and syllabification of 
pronunciation units is described. The 
experimental results show a recall of 0.939 for 
trained words and 0.875 for untrained words 
when the best 10 candidates are considered.
