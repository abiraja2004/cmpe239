Manually annotating the rhetorical struc-
ture of texts is very labour-intensive. At the
same time, high-quality automatic analysis
is currently out of reach. We thus propose to
split the manual annotation in two phases:
the simpler marking of lexical connectives
and their relations, and the more difficult
decisions on overall tree structure. To this
end, we developed an environment of two
analysis tools and XML-based declarative
resources. Our ConAno tool allows for effi-
cient, interactive annotation of connectives,
scopes and relations. This intermediate re-
sult is exported to O?Donnell?s ?RST Tool?,
which facilitates completing the tree struc-
ture.
