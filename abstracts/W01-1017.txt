We describe in this paper the MU-
MIS Project (Multimedia Indexing and
Searching Environment)1 , which is
concerned with the development and in-
tegration of base technologies, demon-
strated within a laboratory prototype, to
support automated multimedia index-
ing and to facilitate search and retrieval
from multimedia databases. We stress
the role linguistically motivated annota-
tions, coupled with domain-specific in-
formation, can play within this environ-
ment. The project will demonstrate that
innovative technology components can
operate on multilingual, multisource,
and multimedia information and create
a meaningful and queryable database.
