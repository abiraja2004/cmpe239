 
Machine-learning based entity extraction re-
quires a large corpus of annotated training to 
achieve acceptable results.  However, the cost 
of expert annotation of relevant data, coupled 
with issues of inter-annotator variability, 
makes it expensive and time-consuming to 
create the necessary corpora. We report here 
on a simple method for the automatic creation 
of large quantities of imperfect training data 
for a biological entity (gene or protein) extrac-
tion system. We used resources available in 
the FlyBase model organism database; these 
resources include a curated lists of genes and 
the articles from which the entries were 
drawn, together a synonym lexicon.  We ap-
plied simple pattern matching to identify gene 
names in the associated abstracts and filtered 
these entities using the list of curated entries 
for the article.  This process created a data set 
that could be used to train a simple Hidden 
Markov Model (HMM) entity tagger. The re-
sults from the HMM tagger were comparable 
to those reported by other groups (F-measure 
of 0.75). This method has the advantage of be-
ing rapidly transferable to new domains that 
have similar existing resources.
