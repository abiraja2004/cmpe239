This paper describes how we use the arrows
properties from the 5P Paradigm to generate
a dependency structure from a surface analy-
sis. Besides the arrows properties, two mod-
ules, Algas and Ogre, are presented. Moreover,
we show how we express linguistic descriptions
away from parsing decisions.
