We define a data model for storing geographic
information from multiple sources that en-
ables the efficient production of customizable
gazetteers. The GazDB separates names from
features while storing the relationships be-
tween them. Geographic names are stored in
a variety of resolutions to allow for i18n and
for multiplicity of naming. Geographic fea-
tures are categorized along several axes to fa-
cilitate selection and filtering.
