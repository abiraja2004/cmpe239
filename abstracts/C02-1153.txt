We discuss a grammar development process used to
generate the trees of the wide-coverage Lexicalized
Tree Adjoining Grammar (LTAG) for English of the
XTAG Project. Result of the coupling of Becker?s
metarules and a simple yet principled hierarchy of
rule application, the approach has been successful to
generate the large set of verb trees in the grammar,
from a very small initial set of trees.
