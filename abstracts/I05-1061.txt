. Temporal information is useful in many NLP applications, such as 
information extraction, question answering and summarization. In this paper, 
we present a temporal parser for extracting and normalizing temporal expres-
sions from Chinese texts. An integrated temporal framework is proposed, which 
includes basic temporal concepts and the classification of temporal expressions. 
The identification of temporal expressions is fulfilled by powerful chart-parsing 
based on grammar rules and constraint rules. We evaluated the system on a sub-
stantial corpus and obtained promising results.
