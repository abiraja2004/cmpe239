A lightweight extraction method derives text
snippets associated to dates from the Web.
The snippets are organized dynamically into
answers to definition questions. Experi-
ments on standard test question sets show
that temporally-anchored text snippets allow
for efficiently answering definition ques-
tions at accuracy levels comparable to the
best systems, without any need for complex
lexical resources, or specialized processing
modules dedicated to finding definitions.
