This paper introduces xfst2fsa, a compiler
which translates grammars expressed in
the syntax of the XFST finite-state tool-
box to grammars in the language of the
FSA Utilities package. Compilation to
FSA facilitates the use of grammars de-
veloped with the proprietary XFST tool-
box on a publicly available platform. The
paper describes the non-trivial issues of
the compilation process, highlighting sev-
eral shortcomings of some published algo-
rithms, especially where replace rules are
concerned. The compiler augments FSA
with most of the operators supported by
XFST. Furthermore, it provides a means
for comparing the two systems on compa-
rable grammars. The paper presents the
results of such a comparison.
