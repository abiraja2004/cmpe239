 
We provide a rather informal presentation of a 
prototype system for word alignment based on 
our previous translation equivalence approach, 
discuss the problems encountered in the 
shared-task on word-aligning of a parallel 
Romanian-English text, present the preliminary 
evaluation results and suggest further ways of 
improving the alignment accuracy.
