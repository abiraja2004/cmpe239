This paper describes the evolution of a statis-
tical NLP course, which I have been teaching
every year for the past three years. The pa-
per will focus on major changes made to the
course (including the course design, assign-
ments, and the use of discussion board) and
highlight the lessons learned from this experi-
ence.
