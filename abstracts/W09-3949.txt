Segmentation of utterances and annotation
as dialogue acts can be helpful for sev-
eral modules of dialogue systems. In this
work, we study a statistical machine learn-
ing model to perform these tasks simulta-
neously using lexical features and incorpo-
rating deterministic syntactic restrictions.
There is a slight improvement in both seg-
mentation and labelling due to these re-
strictions.
