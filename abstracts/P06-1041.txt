In this paper we investigate the benefit
of stochastic predictor components for the
parsing quality which can be obtained with
a rule-based dependency grammar. By in-
cluding a chunker, a supertagger, a PP at-
tacher, and a fast probabilistic parser we
were able to improve upon the baseline by
3.2%, bringing the overall labelled accu-
racy to 91.1% on the German NEGRA cor-
pus. We attribute the successful integra-
tion to the ability of the underlying gram-
mar model to combine uncertain evidence
in a soft manner, thus avoiding the prob-
lem of error propagation.
