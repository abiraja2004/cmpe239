We present UBIU, a language indepen-
dent system for detecting full coreference
chains, composed of named entities, pro-
nouns, and full noun phrases which makes
use of memory based learning and a fea-
ture model following Rahman and Ng
(2009). UBIU is evaluated on the task
?Coreference Resolution in Multiple Lan-
guages? (SemEval Task 1 (Recasens et al,
2010)) in the context of the 5th Interna-
tional Workshop on Semantic Evaluation.
