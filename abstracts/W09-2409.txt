This paper investigates methods for using lexical pat-
terns in a corpus to deduce the semantic relation that 
holds between two nouns in a noun-noun compound 
phrase such as ?flu virus? or ?morning exercise?. Much 
of the previous work in this area has used automated 
queries to commercial web search engines. In our exper-
iments we use the Google Web 1T corpus. This corpus 
contains every 2,3, 4 and 5 gram occurring more
than 40 times in Google's index of the web, but has the
advantage of being available to researchers directly
rather than through a web interface. This paper evalu-
ates the performance of the Web 1T corpus on the task 
compared to similar systems in the literature, and also 
investigates what kind of lexical patterns are most in-
formative when trying to identify a semantic relation
between two nouns.
