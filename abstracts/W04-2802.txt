In this paper we present a discussion of existing
metrics for evaluation the performance of indi-
vidual natural language understanding systems
and components as well as the commonly em-
ployed metrics for measuring the specific task
difficulties. We extend and generalize the com-
mon majority class baseline metric and intro-
duce an general entropy-based metric for mea-
suring the task difficulty of arbitrary language
understanding tasks. Finally, we show an em-
pirical study evaluating this metric followed by
a discussion of its role in measuring the scal-
ability of language understanding systems and
components.
