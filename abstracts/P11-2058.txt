In many computational linguistic scenarios,
training labels are subjectives making it nec-
essary to acquire the opinions of multiple an-
notators/experts, which is referred to as ?wis-
dom of crowds?. In this paper, we propose a
new approach for modeling wisdom of crowds
based on the Latent Mixture of Discrimina-
tive Experts (LMDE) model that can automat-
ically learn the prototypical patterns and hid-
den dynamic among different experts. Experi-
ments show improvement over state-of-the-art
approaches on the task of listener backchannel
prediction in dyadic conversations.
