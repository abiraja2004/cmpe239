Computing the semantic similarity between
terms relies on existence and usage of seman-
tic resources. However, these resources, often
composed of equivalent units, or synonyms,
must be first analyzed and weighted in or-
der to define within them the reliability zones
where the semantic cohesiveness is stronger.
We propose an original method for acquisition
of elementary synonyms based on exploitation
of structured terminologies, analysis of syn-
tactic structure of complex (multi-unit) terms
and their compositionality. The acquired syn-
onyms are then profiled thanks to endogenous
lexical and linguistic indicators (other types
of relations, lexical inclusions, productivity),
which are automatically inferred within the
same terminologies. Additionally, synonymy
relations are observed within graph, and its
structure is analyzed. Particularly, we ex-
plore the usefulness of the graph theory no-
tions such as connected component, clique,
density, bridge, articulation vertex, and cen-
trality of vertices.
