BART (Versley et al, 2008) is a highly mod-
ular toolkit for coreference resolution that
supports state-of-the-art statistical approaches
and enables efficient feature engineering. For
the SemEval task 1 on Coreference Resolu-
tion, BART runs have been submitted for Ger-
man, English, and Italian.
BART relies on a maximum entropy-based
classifier for pairs of mentions. A novel entity-
mention approach based on Semantic Trees is
at the moment only supported for English.
