 
In this paper, we propose a machine    
learning approach to rhetorical role       
identification from legal documents. In our 
approach, we annotate roles in sample 
documents with the help of legal experts 
and take them as training data.  Conditional 
random field model has been trained with 
the data to perform rhetorical role         
identification with reinforcement of rich 
feature sets. The understanding of structure 
of a legal document and the application of 
mathematical model can brings out an     
effective summary in the final stage. Other 
important new findings in this work         
include that the training of a model for one 
sub-domain can be extended to another 
sub-domains with very limited augmenta-
tion of feature sets. Moreover, we can     
significantly improve extraction-based 
summarization results by modifying the 
ranking of sentences with the importance 
of specific roles.
