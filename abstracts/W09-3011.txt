We present the annotation architecture of 
the National Corpus of Polish and discuss 
problems identified in the TEI stand-off 
annotation system,  which,  in  its  current 
version, is still very much unfinished and 
untested,  due  to  both  technical  reasons 
(lack  of  tools  implementing  the  TEI-
defined  XPointer  schemes)  and  certain 
problems concerning data representation. 
We  concentrate  on  two  features  that  a 
stand-off system should possess and that 
are conspicuously missing in the current 
TEI Guidelines.
