This paper describes the experimental com-
bination of traditional Natural Language
Processing (NLP) technology with the Se-
mantic Web building stack in order to ex-
tend the expert knowledge required for a
Machine Translation (MT) task. Therefore,
we first give a short introduction in the state
of the art of MT and the Semantic Web
and discuss the problem of disambiguation
being one of the common challenges in
MT which can only be solved using world
knowledge during the disambiguation pro-
cess. In the following, we construct a sam-
ple sentence which demonstrates the need
for world knowledge and design a proto-
typical program as a successful solution for
the outlined translation problem. We con-
clude with a critical view on the developed
approach.
