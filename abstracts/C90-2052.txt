 
\[n this paper it will be shown how unification grammars 
can be used to build a reversible machine translation 
system. 
Unification grammars are often used to define the re- 
lation between strings and meaning representations in 
a declarative way. Such grammars are sometimes used 
in a bidirecLional way, thus the same grammar is used 
for both parsing and generation, in this paper 1 will 
show how ~.o use bidirectional unification grammars to 
dethle reversible relations between language dependent 
meaning representations. Furthermore it is shown how 
to obtain a completely reversible MT system using a 
series of (bidirectional) unification grammars.
