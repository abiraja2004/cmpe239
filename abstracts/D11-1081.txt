Although discriminative training guarantees to
improve statistical machine translation by in-
corporating a large amount of overlapping fea-
tures, it is hard to scale up to large data due to
decoding complexity. We propose a new al-
gorithm to generate translation forest of train-
ing data in linear time with the help of word
alignment. Our algorithm also alleviates the
oracle selection problem by ensuring that a
forest always contains derivations that exactly
yield the reference translation. With millions
of features trained on 519K sentences in 0.03
second per sentence, our system achieves sig-
nificant improvement by 0.84 BLEU over the
baseline system on the NIST Chinese-English
test sets.
