This paper presents a new algorithm for lin-
ear text segmentation. It is an adaptation of
Affinity Propagation, a state-of-the-art clus-
tering algorithm in the framework of factor
graphs. Affinity Propagation for Segmenta-
tion, or APS, receives a set of pairwise simi-
larities between data points and produces seg-
ment boundaries and segment centres ? data
points which best describe all other data points
within the segment. APS iteratively passes
messages in a cyclic factor graph, until conver-
gence. Each iteration works with information
on all available similarities, resulting in high-
quality results. APS scales linearly for realistic
segmentation tasks. We derive the algorithm
from the original Affinity Propagation formu-
lation, and evaluate its performance on topi-
cal text segmentation in comparison with two
state-of-the art segmenters. The results sug-
gest that APS performs on par with or outper-
forms these two very competitive baselines.
