This paper proposes a method for incre-
mentally translating English spoken lan-
guage into Japanese. To realize simulta-
neous translation between languages with
different word order, such as English and
Japanese, our method utilizes the feature
that the word order of a target language
is flexible. To resolve the problem of
generating a grammatically incorrect sen-
tence, our method uses dependency struc-
tures and Japanese dependency constraints
to determine the word order of a transla-
tion. Moreover, by considering the fact
that the inversion of predicate expressions
occurs more frequently in Japanese spo-
ken language, our method takes advan-
tage of a predicate inversion to resolve the
problem that Japanese has the predicate at
the end of a sentence. Furthermore, our
method includes the function of canceling
an inversion by restating a predicate when
the translation is incomprehensible due to
the inversion. We implement a prototype
translation system and conduct an exper-
iment with all 578 sentences in the ATIS
corpus. The results indicate improvements
in comparison to two other methods.
