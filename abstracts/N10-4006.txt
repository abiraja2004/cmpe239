Distributional Semantic Models
Stefan Evert, University of Osnabr?ck
1. DESCRIPTION
Distributional semantic models (DSM) -- also known as "word space" or "distributional 
similarity" models -- are based on the assumption that the meaning of a word can (at 
least to a certain extent) be inferred from its usage, i.e. its distribution in text.  Therefore, 
these models dynamically build semantic representations -- in the form of high-
dimensional vector spaces -- through a statistical analysis of the contexts in which 
words occur.  DSMs are a promising technique for solving the lexical acquisition 
bottleneck by unsupervised learning, and their distributed representation provides a 
cognitively plausible, robust and flexible architecture for the organisation and processing 
of semantic information.
Since the seminal papers of Landauer & Dumais (1997) and Sch?tze (1998), DSMs 
have been an active area of research in computational linguistics.  Amongst many other 
tasks, they have been applied to solving the TOEFL synonym test (Landauer & Dumais 
1997, Rapp 2004), automatic thesaurus construction (Lin 1998), identification of 
translation equivalents (Rapp 1999), word sense induction and discrimination (Sch?tze 
1998), POS induction (Sch?tze 1995), identification of analogical relations (Turney 
2006), PP attachment disambiguation (Pantel & Lin 2000), semantic classification 
(Versley 2008), as well as the prediction of fMRI (Mitchell et al 2008) and EEG (Murphy 
et al 2009) data.  Recent years have seen renewed and rapidly growing interest in 
distributional approaches, as shown by the series of workshops on DSM held at Context 
2007 [1], ESSLLI 2008 [2], EACL 2009 [3], CogSci 2009 [4], NAACL-HLT 2010 [5], ACL 
2010 [6] and ESSLLI 2010 [7].
The proposed tutorial aims to 
- introduce the most common DSM architectures and their parameters, as well as 
prototypical applications;
- equip participants with the mathematical techniques needed for the implementation of 
DSMs, in particular those of matrix algebra;
- illustrate visualisation techniques and mathematical arguments that help in 
understanding the high-dimensional DSM vector spaces and making sense of key 
operations such as SVD dimensionality reduction; and
- provide an overview of current research on DSMs, available software, evaluation tasks 
and future trends.
The tutorial is targeted both at participants who are new to the field and need a 
comprehensive overview of DSM techniques and applications, and at experienced 
scientists who want to get up to speed on current directions in DSM research.

An implementation of all methods presented in the tutorial will be provided as 
supplementary material, using the open-source statistical programming language R [8].  
This implementation, which is based on the code and data sets available at [9], is 
intended as a "toy laboratory" for participants, but can also form a sound basis for 
practical applications and further DSM research.
