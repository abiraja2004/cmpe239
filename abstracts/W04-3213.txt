We present an unsupervised method for labelling
the arguments of verbs with their semantic roles.
Our bootstrapping algorithm makes initial unam-
biguous role assignments, and then iteratively up-
dates the probability model on which future assign-
ments are based. A novel aspect of our approach
is the use of verb, slot, and noun class informa-
tion as the basis for backing off in our probability
model. We achieve 50?65% reduction in the error
rate over an informed baseline, indicating the po-
tential of our approach for a task that has heretofore
relied on large amounts of manually generated train-
ing data.
