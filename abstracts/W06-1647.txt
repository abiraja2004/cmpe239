We investigate the problem of learn-
ing a part-of-speech (POS) lexicon for a
resource-poor language, dialectal Arabic.
Developing a high-quality lexicon is often
the first step towards building a POS tag-
ger, which is in turn the front-end to many
NLP systems. We frame the lexicon ac-
quisition problem as a transductive learn-
ing problem, and perform comparisons
on three transductive algorithms: Trans-
ductive SVMs, Spectral Graph Transduc-
ers, and a novel Transductive Clustering
method. We demonstrate that lexicon
learning is an important task in resource-
poor domains and leads to significant im-
provements in tagging accuracy for dialec-
tal Arabic.
