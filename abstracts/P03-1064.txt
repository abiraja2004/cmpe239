Supertagging is the tagging process of
assigning the correct elementary tree of
LTAG, or the correct supertag, to each
word of an input sentence1 . In this pa-
per we propose to use supertags to expose
syntactic dependencies which are unavail-
able with POS tags. We first propose a
novel method of applying Sparse Network
of Winnow (SNoW) to sequential models.
Then we use it to construct a supertagger
that uses long distance syntactical depen-
dencies, and the supertagger achieves an
accuracy of 
	 . We apply the su-
pertagger to NP chunking. The use of su-
pertags in NP chunking gives rise to al-
most 	 absolute increase (from 
to  ) in F-score under Transforma-
tion Based Learning(TBL) frame. The
surpertagger described here provides an
effective and efficient way to exploit syn-
tactic information.
