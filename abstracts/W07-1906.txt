 
We investigate the role of increasing 
friendship in dialogue, and propose a first 
step towards a computational model of the 
role of long-term relationships in language 
use between humans and embodied conver-
sational agents. Data came from a study of 
friends and strangers, who either could or 
could not see one another, and who were 
asked to give directions to one-another, 
three subsequent times. Analysis focused 
on differences in the use of dialogue acts 
and non-verbal behaviors, as well as co-
occurrences of dialogue acts, eye gaze and 
head nods, and found a pattern of verbal 
and nonverbal behavior that differentiates 
the dialogue of friends from that of strang-
ers, and differentiates early acquaintances 
from those who have worked together be-
fore. Based on these results, we present a 
model of deepening rapport which would 
enable an ECA to begin to model patterns 
of human relationships.
