B??? is the de facto standard for evaluation
and development of statistical machine trans-
lation systems. We describe three real-world
situations involving comparisons between dif-
ferent versions of the same systems where one
can obtain improvements in B??? scores that
are questionable or even absurd. These situ-
ations arise because B??? lacks the property
of decomposability, a property which is also
computationally convenient for various appli-
cations. We propose a very conservative modi-
fication to B??? and a cross between B??? and
word error rate that address these issues while
improving correlation with human judgments.
