 
We have studied how context specific web 
corpus can be automatically created and 
mined for discovering semantic similarity 
relationships between terms (words or 
phrases) from a given collection of 
documents (target collection). These 
relationships between terms can be used to 
adjust the standard vectors space 
representation so as to improve the 
accuracy of similarity computation between 
text documents in the target collection. Our 
experiments with a standard test collection 
(Reuters) have revealed the reduction of 
similarity errors by up to 50%, twice as 
much as the improvement by using other 
known techniques.
