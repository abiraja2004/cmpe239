This paper describes a new approach
to the generation of referring expres-
sions. We propose to formalize a scene
as a labeled directed graph and describe
content selection as a subgraph con-
struction problem. Cost functions are
used to guide the search process and
to give preference to some solutions
over others. The resulting graph al-
gorithm can be seen as a meta-algorithm
in the sense that defining cost functions
in different ways allows us to mimic ?
and even improve? a number of well-
known algorithms.
