Supervised estimation methods are widely seen
as being superior to semi and fully unsuper-
vised methods. However, supervised methods
crucially rely upon training sets that need to
be manually annotated. This can be very ex-
pensive, especially when skilled annotators are
required. Active learning (AL) promises to
help reduce this annotation cost. Within the
complex domain of HPSG parse selection, we
show that ideas from ensemble learning can
help further reduce the cost of annotation. Our
main results show that at times, an ensemble
model trained with randomly sampled exam-
ples can outperform a single model trained us-
ing AL. However, converting the single-model
AL method into an ensemble-based AL method
shows that even this much stronger baseline
model can be improved upon. Our best results
show a  reduction in annotation cost com-
pared with single-model random sampling.
