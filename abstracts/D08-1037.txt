This paper introduces a new method for iden-
tifying named-entity (NE) transliterations in
bilingual corpora. Recent works have shown
the advantage of discriminative approaches to
transliteration: given two strings (ws, wt) in
the source and target language, a classifier is
trained to determine if wt is the translitera-
tion of ws. This paper shows that the translit-
eration problem can be formulated as a con-
strained optimization problem and thus take
into account contextual dependencies and con-
straints among character bi-grams in the two
strings. We further explore several methods
for learning the objective function of the opti-
mization problem and show the advantage of
learning it discriminately. Our experiments
show that the new framework results in over
50% improvement in translating English NEs
to Hebrew.
