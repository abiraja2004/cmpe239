 
In this paper, we describe an empirical evaluation of an 
adaptive mixed initiative spoken dialogue system. We 
conducted two sets of experiments toevaluate the mixed 
initiative and automatic adaptation aspects of the system, 
and analyzed the resulting dialogues along three dimen- 
sions: performance factors, discourse features, and ini- 
tiative distribution. Our results show that 1) both the 
mixed initiative and automatic adaptation aspects led 
to better system performance in terms of user satisfac- 
tion and dialogue fficiency, and 2) the system's adap- 
tation behavior better matched user expectations, more 
efficiently resolved ialogue anomalies, and resulted in 
higher overall dialogue quality.
