 
Parsing spontaneous speech is a difficult task 
because of the ungrammatical nature of most 
spoken utterances. To overpass this problem, we 
propose in this paper to handle the spoken 
language without considering syntax. We 
describe thus a microsemantic parser which is 
uniquely based on an associative network of 
semantic priming. Experimental results on 
spontaneous speech show that this parser stands 
for a robust alternative to standard ones.
