This paper reports on attempts at Aberdeen1
to measure the effects on readers? emotions of
positively and negatively ?slanted? texts with
the same basic message. The ?slanting? meth-
ods could be implemented in an (NLG) sys-
tem. We discuss a number of possible reasons
why the studies were unable to show clear, sta-
tistically significant differences between the
effects of the different texts.
