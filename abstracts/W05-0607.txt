This paper proposes a model for term re-
occurrence in a text collection based on
the gaps between successive occurrences
of a term. These gaps are modeled using
a mixture of exponential distributions. Pa-
rameter estimation is based on a Bayesian
framework that allows us to fit a flexi-
ble model. The model provides measures
of a term?s re-occurrence rate and within-
document burstiness. The model works
for all kinds of terms, be it rare content
word, medium frequency term or frequent
function word. A measure is proposed to
account for the term?s importance based
on its distribution pattern in the corpus.
