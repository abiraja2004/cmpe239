 
Recently confusion network decoding shows 
the best performance in combining outputs 
from multiple machine translation (MT) sys-
tems. However, overcoming different word 
orders presented in multiple MT systems dur-
ing hypothesis alignment still remains the 
biggest challenge to confusion network-based 
MT system combination. In this paper, we 
compare four commonly used word align-
ment methods, namely GIZA++, TER, CLA 
and IHMM, for hypothesis alignment. Then 
we propose a method to build the confusion 
network from intersection word alignment, 
which utilizes both direct and inverse word 
alignment between the backbone and hypo-
thesis to improve the reliability of hypothesis 
alignment. Experimental results demonstrate 
that the intersection word alignment yields 
consistent performance improvement for all 
four word alignment methods on both Chi-
nese-to-English spoken and written language 
tasks.
