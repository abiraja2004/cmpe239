 
Cross-language document summarization is de-
fined as the task of producing a summary in a 
target language (e.g. Chinese) for a set of 
documents in a source language (e.g. English). 
Existing methods for addressing this task make 
use of either the information from the original 
documents in the source language or the infor-
mation from the translated documents in the 
target language. In this study, we propose to use 
the bilingual information from both the source 
and translated documents for this task. Two 
summarization methods (SimFusion and 
CoRank) are proposed to leverage the bilingual 
information in the graph-based ranking frame-
work for cross-language summary extraction. 
Experimental results on the DUC2001 dataset 
with manually translated reference Chinese 
summaries show the effectiveness of the pro-
posed methods.
