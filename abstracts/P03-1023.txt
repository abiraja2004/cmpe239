 
In this paper we propose a competition 
learning approach to coreference resolu-
tion. Traditionally, supervised machine 
learning approaches adopt the single-
candidate model. Nevertheless the prefer-
ence relationship between the antecedent 
candidates cannot be determined accu-
rately in this model. By contrast, our ap-
proach adopts a twin-candidate learning 
model. Such a model can present the 
competition criterion for antecedent can-
didates reliably, and ensure that the most 
preferred candidate is selected. Further-
more, our approach applies a candidate 
filter to reduce the computational cost and 
data noises during training and resolution. 
The experimental results on MUC-6 and 
MUC-7 data set show that our approach 
can outperform those based on the single-
candidate model.
