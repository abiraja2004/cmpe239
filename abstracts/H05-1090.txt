We demonstrate the value of using con-
text in a new-information detection sys-
tem that achieved the highest precision
scores at the Text Retrieval Conference?s
Novelty Track in 2004. In order to de-
termine whether information within a sen-
tence has been seen in material read pre-
viously, our system integrates information
about the context of the sentence with
novel words and named entities within the
sentence, and uses a specialized learning
algorithm to tune the system parameters.
