We present a system for automated pho-
netic clustering analysis of cognitive tests
of phonemic verbal fluency, on which one
must name words starting with a specific
letter (e.g., ?F?) for one minute. Test re-
sponses are typically subjected to man-
ual phonetic clustering analysis that is
labor-intensive and subject to inter-rater
variability. Our system provides an au-
tomated alternative. In a pilot study,
we applied this system to tests of 55
novice and experienced professional fight-
ers (boxers and mixed martial artists) and
found that experienced fighters produced
significantly longer chains of phonetically
similar words, while no differences were
found in the total number of words pro-
duced. These findings are preliminary, but
strongly suggest that our system can be
used to detect subtle signs of brain damage
due to repetitive head trauma in individu-
als that are otherwise unimpaired.
