In interpreting multilingual queries
to databases whose domain informa-
tion is described in a particular lan-
guage, we must address the problem
of word sense disambiguation. Since
full-fledged semantic classification in-
formation is difficult to construct ei-
ther automatically or manually for this
purpose, we propose to disambiguate
the senses of the source lexical items
by automatically augmenting a simple
translation dictionary with database
terminologies and describe an imple-
mented multilingual query interpreta-
tion system in a combinatory catego-
rial grammar framework.1
