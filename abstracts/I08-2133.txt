In this article we address the task of auto-
matic text structuring into linear and non-
overlapping thematic episodes at a coarse
level of granularity. In particular, we
deal with topic segmentation on multi-party
meeting recording transcripts, which pose
specific challenges for topic segmentation
models. We present a comparative study
of two probabilistic mixture models. Based
on lexical features, we use these models in
parallel in order to generate a low dimen-
sional input representation for topic segmen-
tation. Our experiments demonstrate that in
this manner important information is cap-
tured from the data through less features.
