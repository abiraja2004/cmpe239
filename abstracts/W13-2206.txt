We use feature decay algorithms (FDA)
for fast deployment of accurate statistical
machine translation systems taking only
about half a day for each translation direc-
tion. We develop parallel FDA for solving
computational scalability problems caused
by the abundance of training data for SMT
models and LM models and still achieve
SMT performance that is on par with us-
ing all of the training data or better. Par-
allel FDA runs separate FDA models on
randomized subsets of the training data
and combines the instance selections later.
Parallel FDA can also be used for selecting
the LM corpus based on the training set
selected by parallel FDA. The high qual-
ity of the selected training data allows us
to obtain very accurate translation outputs
close to the top performing SMT systems.
The relevancy of the selected LM corpus
can reach up to 86% reduction in the num-
ber of OOV tokens and up to 74% reduc-
tion in the perplexity. We perform SMT
experiments in all language pairs in the
WMT13 translation task and obtain SMT
performance close to the top systems us-
ing significantly less resources for training
and development.
