The Third International Chinese Language
Processing Bakeoff was held in Spring
2006 to assess the state of the art in two
important tasks: word segmentation and
named entity recognition. Twenty-nine
groups submitted result sets in the two
tasks across two tracks and a total of five
corpora. We found strong results in both
tasks as well as continuing challenges.
