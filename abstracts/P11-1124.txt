We present a discriminative learning method
to improve the consistency of translations in
phrase-based Statistical Machine Translation
(SMT) systems. Our method is inspired by
Translation Memory (TM) systems which are
widely used by human translators in industrial
settings. We constrain the translation of an in-
put sentence using the most similar ?transla-
tion example? retrieved from the TM. Differ-
ently from previous research which used sim-
ple fuzzy match thresholds, these constraints
are imposed using discriminative learning to
optimise the translation performance. We ob-
serve that using this method can benefit the
SMT system by not only producing consis-
tent translations, but also improved translation
outputs. We report a 0.9 point improvement
in terms of BLEU score on English?Chinese
technical documents.
