 
Detecting speculative assertions is essential 
to distinguish the facts from uncertain 
information for biomedical text. This paper 
describes a system to detect hedge cues and 
their scope using CRF model. HCDic feature 
is presented to improve the system perfor-
mance of detecting hedge cues on BioScope 
corpus. The feature can make use of cross-
domain resources.
