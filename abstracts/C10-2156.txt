We describe a Chinese temporal annota-
tion experiment that produced a sizable
data set for the TempEval-2 evaluation
campaign. We show that while we have
achieved high inter-annotator agreement
for simpler tasks such as identification of
events and time expressions, temporal re-
lation annotation proves to be much more
challenging. We show that in order to im-
prove the inter-annotator agreement it is
important to strategically select the anno-
tation targets, and the selection of annota-
tion targets should be subject to syntactic,
semantic and discourse constraints.
