This paper deals with the problem of predict-
ing structures in the context of NLP. Typically,
in structured prediction, an inference proce-
dure is applied to each example independently
of the others. In this paper, we seek to op-
timize the time complexity of inference over
entire datasets, rather than individual exam-
ples. By considering the general inference
representation provided by integer linear pro-
grams, we propose three exact inference the-
orems which allow us to re-use earlier solu-
tions for certain instances, thereby completely
avoiding possibly expensive calls to the infer-
ence procedure. We also identify several ap-
proximation schemes which can provide fur-
ther speedup. We instantiate these ideas to the
structured prediction task of semantic role la-
beling and show that we can achieve a speedup
of over 2.5 using our approach while retain-
ing the guarantees of exactness and a further
speedup of over 3 using approximations that
do not degrade performance.
