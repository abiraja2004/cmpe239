Most research on automated categorization of doc-
uments has concentrated on the assignment of one
or many categories to a whole text. However, new
applications, e.g. in the area of the Semantic Web,
require a richer and more fine-grained annotation
of documents, such as detailed thematic informa-
tion about the parts of a document. Hence we in-
vestigate the automatic categorization of text seg-
ments of scientific articles with XML markup into
16 topic types from a text type structure schema. A
corpus of 47 linguistic articles was provided with
XML markup on different annotation layers repre-
senting text type structure, logical document struc-
ture, and grammatical categories. Six different fea-
ture extraction strategies were applied to this corpus
and combined in various parametrizations in differ-
ent classifiers. The aim was to explore the contribu-
tion of each type of information, in particular the
logical structure features, to the classification ac-
curacy. The results suggest that some of the topic
types of our hierarchy are successfully learnable,
while the features from the logical structure layer
had no particular impact on the results.
