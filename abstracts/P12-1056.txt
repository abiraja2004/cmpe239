Microblogs such as Twitter reflect the general
public?s reactions to major events. Bursty top-
ics from microblogs reveal what events have
attracted the most online attention. Although
bursty event detection from text streams has
been studied before, previous work may not
be suitable for microblogs because compared
with other text streams such as news articles
and scientific publications, microblog posts
are particularly diverse and noisy. To find top-
ics that have bursty patterns on microblogs,
we propose a topic model that simultaneous-
ly captures two observations: (1) posts pub-
lished around the same time are more like-
ly to have the same topic, and (2) posts pub-
lished by the same user are more likely to have
the same topic. The former helps find event-
driven posts while the latter helps identify and
filter out ?personal? posts. Our experiments
on a large Twitter dataset show that there are
more meaningful and unique bursty topics in
the top-ranked results returned by our mod-
el than an LDA baseline and two degenerate
variations of our model. We also show some
case studies that demonstrate the importance
of considering both the temporal information
and users? personal interests for bursty topic
detection from microblogs.
