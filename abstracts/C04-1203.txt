 
We built an open-source software platform in-
tended to serve as a common infrastructure that 
can be of use in the development of new applica-
tions involving the processing of Turkish. The 
platform incorporates a lexicon, a morphological 
analyzer/generator, and a DCG parser/generator 
that translates Turkish sentences to predicate 
logic formulas, and a knowledge base frame-
work. Several developers have already utilized 
the platform for a variety of applications, includ-
ing conversation programs and an artificial per-
sonal assistant, tools for automatic analysis of 
rhyme and meter in Turkish folk poems, a proto-
type sentence-level translator between Albanian, 
Turkish, and English, natural language interfaces 
for generating SQL queries and JAVA code, as 
well as a text tagger used for collecting statistics 
about Turkish morpheme order for a speech rec-
ognition algorithm. The results indicate the 
adaptability of the infrastructure to different 
kinds of applications and how it facilitates im-
provements and modifications.
