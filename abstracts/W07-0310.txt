 
Statistical classification techniques for 
natural-language call routing systems 
have matured to the point where it is pos-
sible to distinguish between several hun-
dreds of semantic categories with an 
accuracy that is sufficient for commercial 
deployments. For category sets of this 
size, the problem of maintaining consis-
tency among manually tagged utterances 
becomes limiting, as lack of consistency 
in the training data will degrade perform-
ance of the classifier. It is thus essential 
that the set of categories be structured in a 
way that alleviates this problem, and en-
ables consistency to be preserved as the 
domain keeps changing. In this paper, we 
describe our experiences of using a two-
level multi-slot semantics as a way of 
meeting this problem. Furthermore, we 
explore the ramifications of the approach 
with respect to classification, evaluation 
and dialogue design for call routing sys-
tems.
