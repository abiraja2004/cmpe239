Dynamic Programming (DP) is an important class of algorithms
widely used in many areas of speech and language processing. Recently
there have been a series of work trying to formalize many instances of
DP algorithms under algebraic and graph-theoretic frameworks. This
tutorial surveys two such frameworks, namely semirings and directed
hypergraphs, and draws connections between them. We formalize two
particular types of DP algorithms under each of these frameworks: the
Viterbi-style topological algorithms and the Dijkstra-style best-first
algorithms. Wherever relevant, we also discuss typical applications of
these algorithms in Natural Language Processing.
