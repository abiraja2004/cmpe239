This paper explores methods to allevi-
ate the effect of lexical sparseness in the
classification of verbal arguments. We
show how automatically generated selec-
tional preferences are able to generalize
and perform better than lexical features in
a large dataset for semantic role classifi-
cation. The best results are obtained with
a novel second-order distributional simi-
larity measure, and the positive effect is
specially relevant for out-of-domain data.
Our findings suggest that selectional pref-
erences have potential for improving a full
system for Semantic Role Labeling.
