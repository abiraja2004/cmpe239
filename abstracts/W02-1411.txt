Automatic acquisition of paraphrase knowledge
for content words is proposed. Using only a
non-parallel text corpus, we compute the para-
phrasability metrics between two words from
their similarity in context. We then filter words
such as proper nouns from external knowledge.
Finally, we use a heuristic in further filtering to
improve the accuracy of the automatic acqui-
sition. In this paper, we report the results of
acquisition experiments.
