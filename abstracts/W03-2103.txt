This paper describes the results of cor-
pus and experimental investigation into
the factors that affect the way clarifica-
tion questions in dialogue are interpreted,
and the way they are responded to. We
present some results from an investigation
using the BNC which show some general
correlations between clarification request
type, likelihood of answering, answer type
and distance between question and an-
swer. We then describe a new experi-
mental technique for integrating manip-
ulations into text-based synchronous dia-
logue, and give more specific results con-
cerning the effect of word category and
level of grounding on interpretation and
response type.
