This paper presents three methods that can
be used to recognize paraphrases. They
all employ string similarity measures ap-
plied to shallow abstractions of the input
sentences, and a Maximum Entropy clas-
sifier to learn how to combine the result-
ing features. Two of the methods also ex-
ploit WordNet to detect synonyms and one
of them also exploits a dependency parser.
We experiment on two datasets, the MSR
paraphrasing corpus and a dataset that we
automatically created from the MTC cor-
pus. Our system achieves state of the art
or better results.
