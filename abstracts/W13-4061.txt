The tool, called Roundtable, em-powers many different types of authors and varying team sizes to create flexible interac-tions by automating many editing workflows while limiting complexity and hiding architec-tural concerns. Finished characters can be pub-lished directly to web servers, enabling highly interactive applications.  1
