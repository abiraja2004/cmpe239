Reduplication, the remaining problem in
computational morphology is a morpholog-
ical process that involves copying the base
form wholly or partially. Reduplication can
also be classified as either bounded or un-
bounded reduplication. Some solutions have
been proposed for bounded reduplication.
Some of the proposed solutions use ordered
replace rules while others use simultaneous
two-level rules. In our attempt to solve both
bounded and unbounded reduplication we
used a combination of two-level rules and
replace rules. All our experiments were
are carried out on Kinyarwanda an under-
resourced language with complex agglutina-
tive morphology.
