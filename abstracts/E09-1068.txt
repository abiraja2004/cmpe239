We present a novel graph-based algo-
rithm for the automated disambiguation
of glosses in lexical knowledge resources.
A dictionary graph is built starting from
senses (vertices) and explicit or implicit
relations in the dictionary (edges). The
approach is based on the identification of
edge sequences which constitute cycles in
the dictionary graph (possibly with one
edge reversed) and relate a source to a
target word sense. Experiments are per-
formed on the disambiguation of ambigu-
ous words in the glosses of WordNet and
two machine-readable dictionaries.
