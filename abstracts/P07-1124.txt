Text is not unadulterated fact. A text can
make you laugh or cry but can it also make
you short sell your stocks in company A and
buy up options in company B? Research in
the domain of finance strongly suggests that
it can. Studies have shown that both the
informational and affective aspects of news
text affect the markets in profound ways, im-
pacting on volumes of trades, stock prices,
volatility and even future firm earnings. This
paper aims to explore a computable metric
of positive or negative polarity in financial
news text which is consistent with human
judgments and can be used in a quantita-
tive analysis of news sentiment impact on fi-
nancial markets. Results from a preliminary
evaluation are presented and discussed.
