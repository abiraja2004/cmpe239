This paper considers the problem of auto-
matically inducing role-semantic annota-
tions in the FrameNet paradigm for new
languages. We introduce a general frame-
work for semantic projection which ex-
ploits parallel texts, is relatively inexpen-
sive and can potentially reduce the amount
of effort involved in creating semantic re-
sources. We propose projection models
that exploit lexical and syntactic informa-
tion. Experimental results on an English-
German parallel corpus demonstrate the
advantages of this approach.
