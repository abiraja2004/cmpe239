Event detection and recognition is a com-
plex task consisting of multiple sub-tasks
of varying difficulty. In this paper, we
present a simple, modular approach to
event extraction that allows us to exper-
iment with a variety of machine learning
methods for these sub-tasks, as well as to
evaluate the impact on performance these
sub-tasks have on the overall task.
