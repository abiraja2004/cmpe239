This paper describes the design of a back-
channel feedback corpus and its evalua-
tion, aiming at realizing in-car spoken di-
alogue systems with high responsiveness.
We constructed our corpus by annotating
the existing in-car spoken dialogue data
with back-channel feedback timing infor-
mation in an off-line environment. Our
corpus can be practically used in devel-
oping dialogue systems which can pro-
vide verbal back-channel feedbacks. As
the results of our evaluation, we confirmed
that our proposed design enabled the con-
struction of back-channel feedback cor-
pora with high coherency and naturalness.
