  
We present a machine-learning approach to 
modeling the distribution of noun phrases 
(NPs) within clauses with respect o a fine- 
grained taxonomy of grammatical relations. We 
demonstrate that a cluster of superficial 
linguistic features can function as a proxy for 
more abstract discourse features that are not 
observable using state-of-the-art natural 
language processing. The models constructed 
for actual texts can be used to select among 
alternative linguistic expressions of the same 
propositional content when generating 
discourse.
