Link detection has been regarded as a core
technology for the Topic Detection and
Tracking tasks of new event detection. In
this paper we formulate story link detec-
tion and new event detection as informa-
tion retrieval task and hypothesize on the
impact of precision and recall on both sys-
tems. Motivated by these arguments, we
introduce a number of new performance
enhancing techniques including part of
speech tagging, new similarity measures
and expanded stop lists. Experimental re-
sults validate our hypothesis.
