 
In this paper, we will describe ODIE, the 
On-Demand Information Extraction system. 
Given a user?s query, the system will pro-
duce tables of the salient information about 
the topic in structured form. It produces the 
tables in less than one minute without any 
knowledge engineering by hand, i.e. pat-
tern creation or paraphrase knowledge 
creation, which was the largest obstacle in 
traditional IE. This demonstration is based 
on the idea and technologies reported in 
(Sekine 06). A substantial speed-up over 
the previous system (which required about 
15 minutes to analyze one year of newspa-
per) was achieved through a new approach 
to handling pattern candidates; now less 
than one minute is required when using 11 
years of newspaper corpus. In addition, 
functionality was added to facilitate inves-
tigation of the extracted information.
