We adapt a semantic role parser to the do-
main of goal-directed speech by creating an
artificial treebank from an existing text tree-
bank. We use a three-component model that
includes distributional models from both tar-
get and source domains. We show that we im-
prove the parser?s performance on utterances
collected from human-machine dialogues by
training on the artificially created data without
loss of performance on the text treebank.
