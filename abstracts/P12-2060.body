Bayesian approaches have been shown to re-
duce the amount of overfitting that occurs
when running the EM algorithm, by placing
prior probabilities on the model parameters.
We apply one such Bayesian technique, vari-
ational Bayes, to the IBM models of word
alignment for statistical machine translation.
We show that using variational Bayes im-
proves the performance of the widely used
GIZA++ software, as well as improving the
overall performance of the Moses machine
translation system in terms of BLEU score.
