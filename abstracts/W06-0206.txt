 
We present two semi-supervised learning 
techniques to improve a state-of-the-art 
multi-lingual name tagger. For English 
and Chinese, the overall system obtains 
1.7% - 2.1% improvement in F-measure, 
representing a 13.5% - 17.4% relative re-
duction in the spurious, missing, and in-
correct tags. We also conclude that 
simply relying upon large corpora is not 
in itself sufficient: we must pay attention 
to unlabeled data selection too. We de-
scribe effective measures to automatically 
select documents and sentences.
