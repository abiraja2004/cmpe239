We evaluate measures of contextual fitness
on the task of detecting real-word spelling
errors. For that purpose, we extract nat-
urally occurring errors and their contexts
from the Wikipedia revision history. We
show that such natural errors are better
suited for evaluation than the previously
used artificially created errors. In partic-
ular, the precision of statistical methods
has been largely over-estimated, while the
precision of knowledge-based approaches
has been under-estimated. Additionally, we
show that knowledge-based approaches can
be improved by using semantic relatedness
measures that make use of knowledge be-
yond classical taxonomic relations. Finally,
we show that statistical and knowledge-
based methods can be combined for in-
creased performance.
