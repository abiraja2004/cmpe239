. Research on linear text segmentation has been an on-going focus in 
NLP for the last decade, and it has great potential for a wide range of 
applications such as document summarization, information retrieval and text 
understanding. However, for linear text segmentation, there are two critical 
problems involving automatic boundary detection and automatic determination 
of the number of segments in a document. In this paper, we propose a new 
domain-independent statistical model for linear text segmentation. In our 
model, Multiple Discriminant Analysis (MDA) criterion function is used to 
achieve global optimization in finding the best segmentation by means of the 
largest word similarity within a segment and the smallest word similarity 
between segments. To alleviate the high computational complexity problem 
introduced by the model, genetic algorithms (GAs) are used. Comparative 
experimental results show that our method based on MDA criterion functions 
has achieved higher Pk measure (Beeferman) than that of the baseline system 
using TextTiling algorithm.
