This task tries to establish the relative qual-
ity of available semantic resources (derived
by manual or automatic means). The qual-
ity of each large-scale knowledge resource
is indirectly evaluated on a Word Sense Dis-
ambiguation task. In particular, we use
Senseval-3 and SemEval-2007 English Lex-
ical Sample tasks as evaluation bechmarks
to evaluate the relative quality of each re-
source. Furthermore, trying to be as neu-
tral as possible with respect the knowledge
bases studied, we apply systematically the
same disambiguation method to all the re-
sources. A completely different behaviour is
observed on both lexical data sets (Senseval-
3 and SemEval-2007).
