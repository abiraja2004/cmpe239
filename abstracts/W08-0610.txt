An important task in information extraction
(IE) from biomedical articles is term iden-
tification (TI), which concerns linking en-
tity mentions (e.g., terms denoting proteins)
in text to unambiguous identifiers in stan-
dard databases (e.g., RefSeq). Previous work
on TI has focused on species-specific docu-
ments. However, biomedical documents, es-
pecially full-length articles, often talk about
entities across a number of species, in which
case resolving species ambiguity becomes an
indispensable part of TI. This paper de-
scribes our rule-based and machine-learning
based approaches to species disambiguation
and demonstrates that performance of TI can
be improved by over 20% if the correct species
are known. We also show that using the
species predicted by the automatic species tag-
gers can improve TI by a large margin.
