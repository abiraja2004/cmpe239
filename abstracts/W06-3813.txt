We present a graph-matching algorithm
for semantic relation assignment. The al-
gorithm is part of an interactive text analy-
sis system. The system automatically ex-
tracts pairs of syntactic units from a text
and assigns a semantic relation to each
pair. This is an incremental learning algo-
rithm, in which previously processed pairs
and user feedback guide the process. Af-
ter each assignment, the system adds to its
database a syntactic-semantic graph cen-
tered on the main element of each pair of
units. A graph consists of the main unit
and all syntactic units with which it is syn-
tactically connected. An edge contains in-
formation both about syntax and about se-
mantic relations for use in further process-
ing. Syntactic-semantic graph matching is
used to produce a list of candidate assign-
ments for 63.75% of the pairs analysed,
and in 57% of situations the correct rela-
tions is one of the system?s suggestions;
in 19.6% of situations it suggests only the
correct relation.
