 
Binarization of Synchronous Context Free 
Grammars (SCFG) is essential for achieving 
polynomial time complexity of decoding for 
SCFG parsing based machine translation sys-
tems. In this paper, we first investigate the 
excess edge competition issue caused by a left-
heavy binary SCFG derived with the method 
of Zhang et al (2006). Then we propose a new 
binarization method to mitigate the problem 
by exploring other alternative equivalent bi-
nary SCFGs. We present an algorithm that ite-
ratively improves the resulting binary SCFG, 
and empirically show that our method can im-
prove a string-to-tree statistical machine trans-
lations system based on the synchronous bina-
rization method in Zhang et al (2006) on the 
NIST machine translation evaluation tasks.
