We present a novel approach for (written) di-
alect identification based on the discrimina-
tive potential of entire words. We generate
Swiss German dialect words from a Standard
German lexicon with the help of hand-crafted
phonetic/graphemic rules that are associated
with occurrence maps extracted from a linguis-
tic atlas created through extensive empirical
fieldwork. In comparison with a character-
n-gram approach to dialect identification, our
model is more robust to individual spelling dif-
ferences, which are frequently encountered in
non-standardized dialect writing. Moreover, it
covers the whole Swiss German dialect contin-
uum, which trained models struggle to achieve
due to sparsity of training data.
