While alignment of texts on the sentential level
is often seen as being too coarse, and word align-
ment as being too fine-grained, bi- or multi-
lingual texts which are aligned on a level in-
between are a useful resource for many pur-
poses. Starting from a number of examples of
non-literal translations, which tend to make
alignment difficult, we describe an alignment
model which copes with these cases by explicitly
coding them. The model is based on predicate-
argument structures and thus covers the middle
ground between sentence and word alignment.
The model is currently used in a recently initi-
ated project of a parallel English-German tree-
bank (FuSe), which can in principle be extended
with additional languages.
