In this paper, the system submitted by
the PRHLT group for the Fifth Work-
shop on Statistical Machine Translation of
ACL2010 is presented. On this evalua-
tion campaign, we have worked on the
English?Spanish language pair, putting
special emphasis on two problems derived
from the large amount of data available.
The first one, how to optimize the use of
the monolingual data within the language
model, and the second one, how to make
good use of all the bilingual data provided
without making use of unnecessary com-
putational resources.
