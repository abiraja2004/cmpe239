 
This paper addresses the issue of "algorithm 
vs. representation" for case-based learning of lin- 
guistic knowledge. We first present empirical 
evidence that the success of case-based learning 
methods for natural anguage processing tasks de- 
pends to a large degree on the feature set used to 
describe the training instances. Next, we present 
a technique for automating feature set selection 
for case-based learning of linguistic knowledge. 
Given as input a baseline case representation, the 
method modifies the representation i response 
to a number of predefined linguistic biases by 
adding, deleting, and weighting features appro- 
priately. We apply the linguistic bias approach 
to feature set selection to the problem of relative 
pronoun disambiguation and show that the case- 
based learning algorithm improves as relevant bi- 
asses are incorporated into the underlying instance 
representation. Finally, we argue that the linguis- 
tic bias approach to feature set selection offers new 
possibilities for case-based learning of natural an- 
guage: it simplifies the process of instance repre- 
sentation design and, in theory, obviates the need 
for separate instance representations for each lin- 
guistic knowledge acquisition task. More impor- 
tantly, the approach offers a mechanism for explic- 
itly combining the frequency information available 
from corpus-based techniques with linguistic bias 
information employed in traditional linguistic and 
knowledge-based approaches to natural language 
processing.
