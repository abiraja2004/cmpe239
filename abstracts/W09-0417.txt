This paper describes our Statistical Ma-
chine Translation systems for the WMT09
(en:fr) shared task. For this evaluation, we
have developed four systems, using two
different MT Toolkits: our primary sub-
mission, in both directions, is based on
Moses, boosted with contextual informa-
tion on phrases, and is contrasted with a
conventional Moses-based system. Addi-
tional contrasts are based on the Ncode
toolkit, one of which uses (part of) the En-
glish/French GigaWord parallel corpus.
