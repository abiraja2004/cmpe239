We propose a semantic similarity learning
method based on Random Indexing (RI) and
ranking with boosting. Unlike classical RI, we
use only those context vector features that are
informative for the semantics modeled. De-
spite ignoring text preprocessing and dispens-
ing with semantic resources, the approach was
ranked as high as 22nd among 89 participants
in the SemEval-2012 Task6: Semantic Textual
Similarity.
