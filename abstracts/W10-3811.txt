 
The present work reports the develop-
ment of Manipuri-English bidirectional 
statistical machine translation systems. In 
the English-Manipuri statistical machine 
translation system, the role of the suffixes 
and dependency relations on the source 
side and case markers on the target side 
are identified as important translation 
factors. A parallel corpus of 10350 sen-
tences from news domain is used for 
training and the system is tested with 500 
sentences. Using the proposed translation 
factors, the output of the translation qual-
ity is improved as indicated by baseline 
BLEU score of 13.045 and factored 
BLEU score of 16.873 respectively. Si-
milarly, for the Manipuri English system, 
the role of case markers and POS tags in-
formation at the source side and suffixes 
and dependency relations at the target 
side are identified as useful translation 
factors. The case markers and suffixes 
are not only responsible to determine the 
word classes but also to determine the 
dependency relations. Using these trans-
lation factors, the output of the transla-
tion quality is improved as indicated by 
baseline BLEU score of 13.452 and fac-
tored BLEU score of 17.573 respectively. 
Further, the subjective evaluation indi-
cates the improvement in the fluency and 
adequacy of both the factored SMT out-
puts over the respective baseline systems.
