Extracting sentiment and topic lexicons is im-
portant for opinion mining. Previous works
have showed that supervised learning methods
are superior for this task. However, the perfor-
mance of supervised methods highly relies on
manually labeled training data. In this paper,
we propose a domain adaptation framework
for sentiment- and topic- lexicon co-extraction
in a domain of interest where we do not re-
quire any labeled data, but have lots of labeled
data in another related domain. The frame-
work is twofold. In the first step, we gener-
ate a few high-confidence sentiment and topic
seeds in the target domain. In the second
step, we propose a novel Relational Adaptive
bootstraPping (RAP) algorithm to expand the
seeds in the target domain by exploiting the
labeled source domain data and the relation-
ships between topic and sentiment words. Ex-
perimental results show that our domain adap-
tation framework can extract precise lexicons
in the target domain without any annotation.
