Academic collaboration has often been at
the forefront of scientific progress, whether
amongst prominent established researchers, or
between students and advisors. We suggest a
theory of the different types of academic col-
laboration, and use topic models to computa-
tionally identify these in Computational Lin-
guistics literature. A set of author-specific
topics are learnt over the ACL corpus, which
ranges from 1965 to 2009. The models are
trained on a per year basis, whereby only pa-
pers published up until a given year are used
to learn that year?s author topics. To determine
the collaborative properties of papers, we use,
as a metric, a function of the cosine similarity
score between a paper?s term vector and each
author?s topic signature in the year preceding
the paper?s publication. We apply this metric
to examine questions on the nature of collabo-
rations in Computational Linguistics research,
finding that significant variations exist in the
way people collaborate within different sub-
fields.
