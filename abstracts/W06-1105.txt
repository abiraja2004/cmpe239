We present results on the relation discov-
ery task, which addresses some of the
shortcomings of supervised relation ex-
traction by applying minimally supervised
methods. We describe a detailed experi-
mental design that compares various con-
figurations of conceptual representations
and similarity measures across six differ-
ent subsets of the ACE relation extraction
data. Previous work on relation discovery
used a semantic space based on a term-by-
document matrix. We find that represen-
tations based on term co-occurrence per-
form significantly better. We also observe
further improvements when reducing the
dimensionality of the term co-occurrence
matrix using probabilistic topic models,
though these are not significant.
