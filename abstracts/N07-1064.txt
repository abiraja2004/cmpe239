We propose to use a statistical phrase-
based machine translation system in a
post-editing task: the system takes as in-
put raw machine translation output (from
a commercial rule-based MT system), and
produces post-edited target-language text.
We report on experiments that were per-
formed on data collected in precisely such
a setting: pairs of raw MT output and
their manually post-edited versions. In our
evaluation, the output of our automatic
post-editing (APE) system is not only bet-
ter quality than the rule-based MT (both
in terms of the BLEU and TER metrics),
it is also better than the output of a state-
of-the-art phrase-based MT system used
in standalone translation mode. These re-
sults indicate that automatic post-editing
constitutes a simple and efficient way of
combining rule-based and statistical MT
technologies.
