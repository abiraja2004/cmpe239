For extractive meeting summarization, previ-
ous studies have shown performance degrada-
tion when using speech recognition transcripts
because of the relatively high speech recogni-
tion errors on meeting recordings. In this pa-
per we investigated using confusion networks
to improve the summarization performance
on the ASR condition under an unsupervised
framework by considering more word candi-
dates and their confidence scores. Our ex-
perimental results showed improved summa-
rization performance using our proposed ap-
proach, with more contribution from leverag-
ing the confidence scores. We also observed
that using these rich speech recognition re-
sults can extract similar or even better sum-
mary segments than using human transcripts.
