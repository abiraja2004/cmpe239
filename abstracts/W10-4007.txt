This paper presents an iterative algorithm
for bilingual lexicon extraction from com-
parable corpora. It is based on a bag-
of-words model generated at the level of
sentences. We present our results of ex-
perimentation on corpora of multiple de-
grees of comparability derived from the
FIRE 2010 dataset. Evaluation results on
100 nouns shows that this method outper-
forms the standard context-vector based
approaches.
