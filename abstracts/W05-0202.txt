 
Our aim is to investigate computational lin-
guistics (CL) techniques in marking short free 
text responses automatically. Successful auto-
matic marking of free text answers would seem 
to presuppose an advanced level of perform-
ance in automated natural language under-
standing.  However, recent advances in CL 
techniques have opened up the possibility of 
being able to automate the marking of free text 
responses typed into a computer without hav-
ing to create systems that fully understand the 
answers. This paper describes  some of the 
techniques we have tried so far vis-?-vis this 
problem with results, discussion and descrip-
tion of the main issues encountered.1
