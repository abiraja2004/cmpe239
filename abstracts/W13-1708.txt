We developed an approach to predict the pro-
ficiency level of Estonian language learners
based on the CEFR guidelines. We performed
learner classification by studying morpho-
syntactic variation and lexical richness in texts
produced by learners of Estonian as a sec-
ond language. We show that our features
which exploit the rich morphology of Esto-
nian by focusing on the nominal case and ver-
bal mood are useful predictors for this task.
We also show that re-formulating the classifi-
cation problem as a multi-stage cascaded clas-
sification improves the classification accuracy.
Finally, we also studied the effect of training
data size on classification accuracy and found
that more training data is beneficial in only
some of the cases.
