A simple and accurate method for assigning
broad semantic classes to text strings is pre-
sented. The method is to map text strings
to terms in ontologies based on a pipeline of
exact matches, normalized strings, headword
matching, and stemming headwords. The
results of three experiments evaluating the
technique are given. Five semantic classes
are evaluated against the CRAFT corpus of
full-text journal articles. Twenty semantic
classes are evaluated against the correspond-
ing full ontologies, i.e. by reflexive match-
ing. One semantic class is evaluated against
a structured test suite. Precision, recall,
and F-measure on the corpus when evaluat-
ing against only the ontologies in the cor-
pus is micro-averaged 67.06/78.49/72.32 and
macro-averaged 69.84/83.12/75.31. Accuracy
on the corpus when evaluating against all
twenty semantic classes ranges from 77.12%
to 95.73%. Reflexive matching is generally
successful, but reveals a small number of er-
rors in the implementation. Evaluation with
the structured test suite reveals a number of
characteristics of the performance of the ap-
proach.
