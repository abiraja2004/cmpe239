This paper describes the system submit-
ted by the Laboratory of Informatics of
Grenoble (LIG) for the fifth Workshop
on Statistical Machine Translation. We
participated to the news shared transla-
tion task for the French-English language
pair. We investigated differents techniques
to simply deal with Out-Of-Vocabulary
words in a statistical phrase-based ma-
chine translation system and analyze their
impact on translation quality. The final
submission is a combination between a
standard phrase-based system using the
Moses decoder, with appropriate setups
and pre-processing, and a lemmatized sys-
tem to deal with Out-Of-Vocabulary con-
jugated verbs.
