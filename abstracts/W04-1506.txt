 
We present the Dependency Parser, 
called Maxuxta, for the linguistic 
processing of Basque, which can serve 
as a representative of agglutinative 
languages that are also characterized by 
the free order of its constituents. The 
Dependency syntactic model is applied 
to establish the dependency-based 
grammatical relations between the 
components within the clause. Such a 
deep analysis is used to improve the 
output of the shallow parsing where 
syntactic structure ambiguity is not fully 
and explicitly resolved. Previous to the 
completion of the grammar for the 
dependency parsing, the design of the 
Dependency Structure-based Scheme 
had to be accomplished; we concentrated 
on issues that must be resolved by any 
practical system that uses such models. 
This scheme was used both to the 
manual tagging of the corpus and to 
develop the parser. The manually tagged 
corpus has been used to evaluate the 
accuracy of the parser. We have 
evaluated the application of the grammar 
to corpus, measuring the linking of the 
verb with its dependents, with 
satisfactory results.
