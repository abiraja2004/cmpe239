Training statistical models to detect non-
native sentences requires a large corpus
of non-native writing samples, which is
often not readily available. This paper
examines the extent to which machine-
translated (MT) sentences can substitute
as training data.
Two tasks are examined. For the na-
tive vs non-native classication task, non-
native training data yields better perfor-
mance; for the ranking task, however,
models trained with a large, publicly avail-
able set of MT data perform as well as
those trained with non-native data.
