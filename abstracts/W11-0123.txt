In the Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE) task, sentence pairs are classified into one of three se-
mantic relations: ENTAILMENT, CONTRADICTION or UNKNOWN. While we find some sentence pairs
hold full entailments or contradictions, there are a number of pairs that partially entail or contradict one
another depending on a specific situation. These partial contradiction sentence pairs contain useful infor-
mation for opinion mining and other such tasks, but it is difficult for Internet users to access this knowledge
because current frameworks do not differentiate between full contradictions and partial contradictions. In
this paper, under current approaches to semantic relation recognition, we define a new semantic relation
known as CONFINEMENT in order to recognize this useful information. This information is classified as
either CONTRADICTION or ENTAILMENT. We provide a series of semantic templates to recognize CON-
FINEMENT relations in Web texts, and then implement a system for recognizing CONFINEMENT between
sentence pairs. We show that our proposed system can obtains a F-score of 61% for recognizing CON-
FINEMENT in Japanese-language Web texts, and it outperforms a baseline which does not use a manually
compiled list of lexico-syntactic patterns to instantiate the semantic templates.
