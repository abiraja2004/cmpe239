We describe a method for creating a non-
English subjectivity lexicon based on an
English lexicon, an online translation ser-
vice and a general purpose thesaurus:
Wordnet. We use a PageRank-like algo-
rithm to bootstrap from the translation of
the English lexicon and rank the words
in the thesaurus by polarity using the net-
work of lexical relations in Wordnet. We
apply our method to the Dutch language.
The best results are achieved when using
synonymy and antonymy relations only,
and ranking positive and negative words
simultaneously. Our method achieves an
accuracy of 0.82 at the top 3,000 negative
words, and 0.62 at the top 3,000 positive
words.
