This paper presents a method for classify-
ing Japanese polysemous verbs using an
algorithm to identify overlapping nodes
with more than one cluster. The algo-
rithm is a graph-based unsupervised clus-
tering algorithm, which combines a gener-
alized modularity function, spectral map-
ping, and fuzzy clustering technique. The
modularity function for measuring cluster
structure is calculated based on the fre-
quency distributions over verb frames with
selectional preferences. Evaluations are
made on two sets of verbs including pol-
ysemies.
