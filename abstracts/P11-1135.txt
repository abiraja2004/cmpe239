Resolving coordination ambiguity is a clas-
sic hard problem. This paper looks at co-
ordination disambiguation in complex noun
phrases (NPs). Parsers trained on the Penn
Treebank are reporting impressive numbers
these days, but they don?t do very well on this
problem (79%). We explore systems trained
using three types of corpora: (1) annotated
(e.g. the Penn Treebank), (2) bitexts (e.g. Eu-
roparl), and (3) unannotated monolingual (e.g.
Google N-grams). Size matters: (1) is a mil-
lion words, (2) is potentially billions of words
and (3) is potentially trillions of words. The
unannotated monolingual data is helpful when
the ambiguity can be resolved through associ-
ations among the lexical items. The bilingual
data is helpful when the ambiguity can be re-
solved by the order of words in the translation.
We train separate classifiers with monolingual
and bilingual features and iteratively improve
them via co-training. The co-trained classifier
achieves close to 96% accuracy on Treebank
data and makes 20% fewer errors than a su-
pervised system trained with Treebank anno-
tations.
