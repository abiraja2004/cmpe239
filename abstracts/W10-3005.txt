In this paper, we proposed a hedge de-
tection method with average perceptron,
which was used in the closed challenge
in CoNLL-2010 Shared Task. There are
two subtasks: (1) detecting uncertain sen-
tences and (2) identifying the in-sentence
scopes of hedge cues. We use the unified
learning algorithm for both subtasks since
that the hedge score of sentence can be de-
composed into scores of the words, espe-
cially the hedge words. On the biomedical
corpus, our methods achieved F-measure
with 77.86% in detecting in-domain un-
certain sentences, 77.44% in recognizing
hedge cues, and 19.27% in identifying the
scopes.
