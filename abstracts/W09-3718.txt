This paper proposes an extension of Dependency Tree Semantics (DTS),
an underspecified logic originally proposed in [20], that uniformily im-
plements constraints on Nested Quantification, Island Constraints and
logical Redundancy. Unfortunately, this extension makes the complex-
ity exponential in the number of NPs, in the worst cases. Nevertheless,
we conducted an experiment on the Turin University Treebank [6], a
Treebank of italian sentences annotated in a syntactic dependency for-
mat, whose results seem to indicate that these cases are very rare in
real sentences.
