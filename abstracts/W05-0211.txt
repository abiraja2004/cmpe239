This paper evaluates a series of freely
available, state-of-the-art parsers on a
standard benchmark as well as with
respect to a set of data relevant for
measuring text cohesion. We outline
advantages and disadvantages of exist-
ing technologies and make recommen-
dations. Our performance report uses
traditional measures based on a gold
standard as well as novel dimensions
for parsing evaluation. To our knowl-
edge this is the first attempt to eval-
uate parsers accross genres and grade
levels for the implementation in learn-
ing technology.
