Roget?s Thesaurus has gone through many re-
visions since it was first published 150 years
ago. But how do these revisions affect Ro-
get?s usefulness for NLP? We examine the
differences in content between the 1911 and
1987 versions of Roget?s, and we test both ver-
sions with each other and WordNet on prob-
lems such as synonym identification and word
relatedness. We also present a novel method
for measuring sentence relatedness that can be
implemented in either version of Roget?s or in
WordNet. Although the 1987 version of the
Thesaurus is better, we show that the 1911 ver-
sion performs surprisingly well and that often
the differences between the versions of Ro-
get?s and WordNet are not statistically signif-
icant. We hope that this work will encourage
others to use the 1911 Roget?s Thesaurus in
NLP tasks.
