 
This paper describes an exploration of the 
implicit synonymy relationship expressed by 
synonym lists in an on-line thesaurus. A series 
of automatic steps was taken to properly con- 
strain this relationship. The resulting roupings 
of semantically related word senses are believed 
to constitute a useful tool for natural language 
processing and for work in lexicography.
