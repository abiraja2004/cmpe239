We describe the second installment of the
Challenge on Generating Instructions in
Virtual Environments (GIVE-2), a shared
task for the NLG community which took
place in 2009-10. We evaluated seven
NLG systems by connecting them to 1825
users over the Internet, and report the re-
sults of this evaluation in terms of objec-
tive and subjective measures.
