Syntactic priming effects, modelled as in-
crease in repetition probability shortly af-
ter a use of a syntactic rule, have the
potential to improve language processing
components. We model priming of syn-
tactic rules in annotated corpora of spo-
ken dialogue, extending previous work
that was confined to selected construc-
tions. We find that speakers are more re-
ceptive to priming from their interlocutor
in task-oriented dialogue than in spona-
neous conversation. Low-frequency rules
are more likely to show priming.
