 
The Clarity project is devoted to automatic de- 
tection and classification of discourse structures in 
casual, non-task-oriented conversation using shal- 
low, corpus-based methods of analysis. For the 
Clarity project, we have tagged speech acts and 
dialogue games in the Call Home Spanish corpus. 
We have done preliminary cross-level experiments 
on the relationship of word and speech act n-grams 
to dialogue games. Our results show that the la- 
bel of a game cannot be predicted from n-grams 
of words it contains. We get better than base- 
line results for predicting the label of a game from 
the sequence of speech acts it contains, but only 
when the speech acts are hand tagged, and not 
when they are automatically detected. Our fu- 
ture research will focus on finding linguistic cues 
that are more predictive of game labels. The au- 
tomatic classification of speech acts and games is 
carried out in a multi-level architecture that in- 
tegrates classification at multiple discourse levels 
instead of performing them sequentially.
