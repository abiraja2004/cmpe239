 
The purpose of this paper is to auto-
matically generate Chinese chunk 
bracketing by a bottom-to-top map-
ping (BTM) model with a BTM data-
set. The BTM model is designed as a 
supporting model with parsers. We de-
fine a word-layer matrix to generate 
the BTM dataset from Chinese Tree-
bank. Our model matches auto-learned 
patterns and templates against seg-
mented and POS-tagged Chinese sen-
tences. A sentence that can be matched 
with some patterns or templates is 
called a matching sentence. The ex-
perimental results have shown that the 
chunk bracketing of the BTM model 
on the matching sentences is high and 
stable. By applying the BTM model to 
the matching sentences and the N-
gram model to the non-matching sen-
tences, the experiment results show 
the F-measure of an N-gram model 
can be improved.
