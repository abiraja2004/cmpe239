This paper proposes a simple metric of di-
alect distance, based on the ratio between
identical word pairs and cognate word pairs
occurring in two texts. Different variations
of this metric are tested on a corpus contain-
ing comparable texts from different Swiss
German dialects and evaluated on the basis
of spatial autocorrelation measures. The vi-
sualization of the results as cluster dendro-
grams shows that closely related dialects
are reliably clustered together, while mul-
tidimensional scaling produces graphs that
show high agreement with the geographic
localization of the original texts.
