Surface realisation from flat semantic for-
mulae is known to be exponential in the
length of the input. In this paper, we argue
that TAG naturally supports the integration
of three main ways of reducing complex-
ity: polarity filtering, delayed adjunction
and empty semantic items elimination. We
support these claims by presenting some
preliminary results of the TAG-based sur-
face realiser GenI.
