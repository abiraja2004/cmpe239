 
This paper presents the design of a discourse 
generator that plans the content and organi-
zation of lay-oriented genetic counseling 
documents containing arguments, and an 
experiment to evaluate the arguments. Due 
to the separation of domain, argument, and 
genre-specific concerns and the methodol-
ogy used for acquiring a domain model, this 
approach should be applicable to argument 
generation in other domains.
