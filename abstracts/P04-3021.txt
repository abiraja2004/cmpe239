A number of NLP tasks have been effectively mod-
eled as classification tasks using a variety of classi-
fication techniques. Most of these tasks have been
pursued in isolation with the classifier assuming un-
ambiguous input. In order for these techniques to be
more broadly applicable, they need to be extended
to apply on weighted packed representations of am-
biguous input. One approach for achieving this is
to represent the classification model as a weighted
finite-state transducer (WFST). In this paper, we
present a compilation procedure to convert the rules
resulting from an AdaBoost classifier into an WFST.
We validate the compilation technique by applying
the resulting WFST on a call-routing application.
