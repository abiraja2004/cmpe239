This paper presents our preliminary work on
adaptation of parsing technology toward natu-
ral language query processing for biomedical
domain. We built a small treebank of natu-
ral language queries, and tested a state-of-the-
art parser, the results of which revealed that
a parser trained on Wall-Street-Journal arti-
cles and Medline abstracts did not work well
on query sentences. We then experimented
an adaptive learning technique, to seek the
chance to improve the parsing performance on
query sentences. Despite the small scale of the
experiments, the results are encouraging, en-
lightening the direction for effective improve-
ment.
