 
Applications using automatically indexed 
clinical conditions must account for con-
textual features such as whether a condition 
is negated, historical or hypothetical, or 
experienced by someone other than the pa-
tient. We developed and evaluated an algo-
rithm called ConText, an extension of the 
NegEx negation algorithm, which relies on 
trigger terms, pseudo-trigger terms, and 
termination terms for identifying the values 
of three contextual features. In spite of its 
simplicity, ConText performed well at 
identifying negation and hypothetical status. 
ConText performed moderately at identify-
ing whether a condition was experienced 
by someone other than the patient and 
whether the condition occurred historically.
