 
This paper presents an iterative model of 
knowledge acquisition of gender infor-
mation associated with word endings in 
French. Gender knowledge is represented 
as a set of rules containing exceptions. 
Our model takes noun-gender pairs as in-
put and constantly maintains a list of 
rules and exceptions which is both coher-
ent with the input data and minimal with 
respect to a minimum description length 
criterion. This model was compared to 
human data at various ages and showed a 
good fit. We also compared the kind of 
rules discovered by the model with rules 
usually extracted by linguists and found 
interesting discrepancies.
