This paper addresses the problem of deal-
ing with a collection of labeled training
documents, especially annotating negative
training documents and presents a method
of text classification from positive and un-
labeled data. We applied an error detec-
tion and correction technique to the re-
sults of positive and negative documents
classified by the Support Vector Machines
(SVM). The results using Reuters docu-
ments showed that the method was compa-
rable to the current state-of-the-art biased-
SVM method as the F-score obtained by
our method was 0.627 and biased-SVM
was 0.614.
