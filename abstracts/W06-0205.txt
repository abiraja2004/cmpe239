Lexical Chains are powerful representa-
tions of documents. In particular, they
have successfully been used in the field
of Automatic Text Summarization. How-
ever, until now, Lexical Chaining algo-
rithms have only been proposed for Eng-
lish. In this paper, we propose a greedy
Language-Independent algorithm that au-
tomatically extracts Lexical Chains from
texts. For that purpose, we build a hier-
archical lexico-semantic knowledge base
from a collection of texts by using the
Pole-Based Overlapping Clustering Algo-
rithm. As a consequence, our method-
ology can be applied to any language
and proposes a solution to language-
dependent Lexical Chainers.
