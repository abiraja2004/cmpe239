 
ARBITER is a Prolog program that extracts 
assertions about macromolecular binding 
relationships from biomedical text. We de- 
scribe the domain knowledge and the under- 
specified linguistic analyses that support he 
identification of these predications. After 
discussing a formal evaluation of 
ARBITER, we report on its application to 
491,000 MEDLINE ~ abstracts, during 
which almost 25,000 binding relationships 
suitable for entry into a database of macro- 
molecular function were extracted.
