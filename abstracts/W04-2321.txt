This paper describes an interpretation and deci-
sion strategy that minimizes interpretation er-
rors and perform dialogue actions which may
not depend on the hypothesized concepts only,
but also on confidence of what has been rec-
ognized. The concepts introduced here are ap-
plied in a system which integrates language
and interpretation models into Stochastic Finite
State Transducers (SFST). Furthermore, acous-
tic, linguistic and semantic confidence mea-
sures on the hypothesized word sequences are
made available to the dialogue strategy. By
evaluating predicates related to these confi-
dence measures, a decision tree automatically
learn a decision strategy for rescoring a n-best
list of candidates representing a user?s utter-
ance. The different actions that can be then per-
formed are chosen according to the confidence
scores given by the tree.
