 
We address the problem of detecting Eng-
lish language learner errors by using a dis-
criminative high-order sequence model. 
Unlike most work in error-detection, this 
method is agnostic as to specific error 
types, thus potentially allowing for higher 
recall across different error types.  The ap-
proach integrates features from many 
sources into the error-detection model, 
ranging from language model-based fea-
tures to linguistic analysis features. Evalua-
tion results on a large annotated corpus of 
learner writing indicate the feasibility of 
our approach on a realistic, noisy and in-
herently skewed set of data. High-order 
models consistently outperform low-order 
models in our experiments. Error analysis 
on the output shows that the calculation of 
precision on the test set represents a lower 
bound on the real system performance.
