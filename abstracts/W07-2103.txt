Although researchers have shown increas-
ing interest in extracting/classifying seman-
tic relations, most previous studies have ba-
sically relied on lexical patterns between
terms. This paper proposes a novel way to
accomplish the task: a system that captures
a physical size of an entity. Experimental
results revealed that our proposed method is
feasible and prevents the problems inherent
in other methods.
