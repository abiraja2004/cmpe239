The paper proposes and empirically moti-
vates an integration of supervised learning
with unsupervised learning to deal with
human biases in summarization. In par-
ticular, we explore the use of probabilistic
decision tree within the clustering frame-
work to account for the variation as well
as regularity in human created summaries.
The corpus of human created extracts is
created from a newspaper corpus and used
as a test set. We build probabilistic de-
cision trees of different flavors and in-
tegrate each of them with the clustering
framework. Experiments with the cor-
pus demonstrate that the mixture of the
two paradigms generally gives a signif-
icant boost in performance compared to
cases where either of the two is considered
alone.
