This paper uses an unsupervised model of
grounded language acquisition to study the
role that social cues play in language acqui-
sition. The input to the model consists of (or-
thographically transcribed) child-directed ut-
terances accompanied by the set of objects
present in the non-linguistic context. Each
object is annotated by social cues, indicating
e.g., whether the caregiver is looking at or
touching the object. We show how to model
the task of inferring which objects are be-
ing talked about (and which words refer to
which objects) as standard grammatical in-
ference, and describe PCFG-based unigram
models and adaptor grammar-based colloca-
tion models for the task. Exploiting social
cues improves the performance of all mod-
els. Our models learn the relative importance
of each social cue jointly with word-object
mappings and collocation structure, consis-
tent with the idea that children could discover
the importance of particular social informa-
tion sources during word learning.
