This paper provides a specification of re-
quirements for collocation extraction sys-
tems, taking as an example the extraction
of noun + verb collocations from German
texts. A hybrid approach to the extrac-
tion of habitual collocations and idioms
is presented, aiming at a detailed descrip-
tion of collocations and their morphosyn-
tax for natural language generation sys-
tems as well as to support learner lexicog-
raphy.
