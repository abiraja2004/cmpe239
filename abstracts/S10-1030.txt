The DERI UNLP team participated in the
SemEval 2010 Task #5 with an unsuper-
vised system that automatically extracts
keyphrases from scientific articles. Our
approach does not only consider a general
description of a term to select keyphrase
candidates but also context information in
the form of ?skill types?. Even though
our system analyses only a limited set of
candidates, it is still able to outperform
baseline unsupervised and supervised ap-
proaches.
