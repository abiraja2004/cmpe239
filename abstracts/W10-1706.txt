This paper describes a statistical machine
translation system for our participation
for the WMT10 shared task. Based on
MOSES, our system is capable of translat-
ing German, French and Spanish into En-
glish. Our main contribution in this work
is about effective parameter tuning. We
discover that there is a significant perfor-
mance gap as different development sets
are adopted. Finally, ten groups of devel-
opment sets are used to optimize the model
weights, and this does help us obtain a sta-
ble evaluation result.
