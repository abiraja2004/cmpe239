This paper presents the English valency
lexicon EngValLex, built within the Func-
tional Generative Description framework.
The form of the lexicon, as well as the
process of its semi-automatic creation is
described. The lexicon describes valency
for verbs and also includes links to other
lexical sources, namely PropBank. Basic
statistics about the lexicon are given.
The lexicon will be later used for anno-
tation of the Wall Street Journal section
of the Penn Treebank in Praguian for-
malisms.
