Coordinations in noun phrases often pose
the problem that elliptified parts have to
be reconstructed for proper semantic inter-
pretation. Unfortunately, the detection of
coordinated heads and identification of el-
liptified elements notoriously lead to am-
biguous reconstruction alternatives. While
linguistic intuition suggests that semantic
criteria might play an important, if not su-
perior, role in disambiguating resolution
alternatives, our experiments on the re-
annotated WSJ part of the Penn Treebank
indicate that solely morpho-syntactic crite-
ria are more predictive than solely lexico-
semantic ones. We also found that the
combination of both criteria does not yield
any substantial improvement.
