This paper addresses two related top-
ics: Firstly, it presents building-blocks
for flexible multimodal dialog inter-
faces based on standardized compo-
nents (VoiceXML, XML) to indicate
that thanks to well-supported standard-
izations, mobile multimodal interfaces
to heterogeneous data sources are be-
coming ready for mass-market deploy-
ment, provided that adequate modular-
ization is respected. Secondly, this is
put in the perspective of a discussion of
knowledge management in firms, and
the paper argues that multimodal dia-
log systems and the naturalized mobile
access to company data they offer will
trigger a new knowledge management
practice of importance for knowledge-
intensive companies.
