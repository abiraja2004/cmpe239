Morphological processes in Semitic languages
deliver space-delimited words which intro-
duce multiple, distinct, syntactic units into the
structure of the input sentence. These words
are in turn highly ambiguous, breaking the
assumption underlying most parsers that the
yield of a tree for a given sentence is known in
advance. Here we propose a single joint model
for performing both morphological segmenta-
tion and syntactic disambiguation which by-
passes the associated circularity. Using a tree-
bank grammar, a data-driven lexicon, and a
linguistically motivated unknown-tokens han-
dling technique our model outperforms previ-
ous pipelined, integrated or factorized systems
for Hebrew morphological and syntactic pro-
cessing, yielding an error reduction of 12%
over the best published results so far.
