 
Understanding the event structure of sentences 
and whole documents is an important step in 
being able to extract meaningful information 
from the text. Our task is the identification of 
phenotypes, specifically, pneumonia, from 
clinical narratives. In this paper, we consider 
the importance of identifying the change of 
state for events, in particular, events that 
measure and compare multiple states across 
time. Change of state is important to the clini-
cal diagnosis of pneumonia; in the example 
?there are bibasilar opacities that are un-
changed?, the presence of bibasilar opacities 
alone may suggest pneumonia, but not when 
they are unchanged, which suggests the need 
to modify events with change of state infor-
mation. Our corpus is comprised of chest X-
ray reports, where we find many descriptions 
of change of state comparing the volume and 
density of the lungs and surrounding areas. 
We propose an annotation schema to capture 
this information as a tuple of <location, attrib-
ute, value, change-of-state, time-reference>.
