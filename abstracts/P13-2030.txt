We study the mathematical properties of
a recently proposed MDL-based unsuper-
vised word segmentation algorithm, called
regularized compression. Our analysis
shows that its objective function can be
efficiently approximated using the nega-
tive empirical pointwise mutual informa-
tion. The proposed extension improves the
baseline performance in both efficiency
and accuracy on a standard benchmark.
