This paper applies machine learning techniques to
acquiring aspects of the meaning of discourse mark-
ers. Three subtasks of acquiring the meaning of a
discourse marker are considered: learning its polar-
ity, veridicality, and type (i.e. causal, temporal or
additive). Accuracy of over 90% is achieved for all
three tasks, well above the baselines.
