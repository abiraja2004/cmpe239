Some phrases can be interpreted either id-
iomatically (figuratively) or literally in con-
text, and the precise identification of idioms
is indispensable for full-fledged natural lan-
guage processing (NLP). To this end, we have
constructed an idiom corpus for Japanese.
This paper reports on the corpus and the re-
sults of an idiom identification experiment us-
ing the corpus. The corpus targets 146 am-
biguous idioms, and consists of 102,846 sen-
tences, each of which is annotated with a lit-
eral/idiom label. For idiom identification, we
targeted 90 out of the 146 idioms and adopted
a word sense disambiguation (WSD) method
using both common WSD features and idiom-
specific features. The corpus and the experi-
ment are the largest of their kind, as far as we
know. As a result, we found that a standard
supervised WSD method works well for the
idiom identification and achieved an accuracy
of 89.25% and 88.86% with/without idiom-
specific features and that the most effective
idiom-specific feature is the one involving the
adjacency of idiom constituents.
