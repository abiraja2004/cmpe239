This paper describes an incremental ap-
proach to parsing transcribed spontaneous
speech containing disfluencies with a Hier-
archical Hidden Markov Model (HHMM).
This model makes use of the right-corner
transform, which has been shown to in-
crease non-incremental parsing accuracy
on transcribed spontaneous speech (Miller
and Schuler, 2008), using trees trans-
formed in this manner to train the HHMM
parser. Not only do the representations
used in this model align with structure in
speech repairs, but as an HMM-like time-
series model, it can be directly integrated
into conventional speech recognition sys-
tems run on continuous streams of audio.
A system implementing this model is eval-
uated on the standard task of parsing the
Switchboard corpus, and achieves an im-
provement over the standard baseline prob-
abilistic CYK parser.
