Word clustering is important for automatic
thesaurus construction, text classification,
and word sense disambiguation. Recently,
several studies have reported using the
web as a corpus. This paper proposes
an unsupervised algorithm for word clus-
tering based on a word similarity mea-
sure by web counts. Each pair of words
is queried to a search engine, which pro-
duces a co-occurrence matrix. By calcu-
lating the similarity of words, a word co-
occurrence graph is obtained. A new kind
of graph clustering algorithm called New-
man clustering is applied for efficiently
identifying word clusters. Evaluations are
made on two sets of word groups derived
from a web directory and WordNet.
