We extended language modeling ap-
proaches in information retrieval (IR) to
combine collaborative filtering (CF) and
content-based filtering (CBF). Our ap-
proach is based on the analogy between
IR and CF, especially between CF and rel-
evance feedback (RF). Both CF and RF
exploit users? preference/relevance judg-
ments to recommend items. We first in-
troduce a multinomial model that com-
bines CF and CBF in a language modeling
framework. We then generalize the model
to another multinomial model that approx-
imates the Polya distribution. This gener-
alized model outperforms the multinomial
model by 3.4% for CBF and 17.4% for
CF in recommending English Wikipedia
articles. The performance of the gener-
alized model for three different datasets
was comparable to that of a state-of-the-
art item-based CF method.
