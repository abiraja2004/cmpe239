The identification of the key concepts in a set of
documents is a useful source of information for
several information access applications. We are
interested in its application to multi-document
summarization, both for the automatic genera-
tion of summaries and for interactive summa-
rization systems.
In this paper, we study whether the syntactic po-
sition of terms in the texts can be used to predict
which terms are good candidates as key con-
cepts. Our experiments show that a) distance
to the verb is highly correlated with the proba-
bility of a term being part of a key concept; b)
subject modifiers are the best syntactic locations
to find relevant terms; and c) in the task of auto-
matically finding key terms, the combination of
statistical term weights with shallow syntactic
information gives better results than statistical
measures alone.
