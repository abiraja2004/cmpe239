 
This paper describes a semantically rich, 
human-aided machine annotation system 
created within the Ontological Semantics 
(OntoSem) environment using the 
DEKADE toolset. In contrast to main-
stream annotation efforts, this method of 
annotation provides more information at a 
lower cost and, for the most part, shifts 
the maintenance of consistency to the sys-
tem itself. In addition, each tagging effort 
not only produces knowledge resources 
for that corpus, but also leads to im-
provements in the knowledge environ-
ment that will better support subsequent 
tagging efforts.
