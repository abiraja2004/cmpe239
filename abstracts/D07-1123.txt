We describe an incremental parser that
was trained to minimize cost over sen-
tences rather than over individual parsing ac-
tions. This is an attempt to use the advan-
tages of the two top-scoring systems in the
CoNLL-X shared task.
In the evaluation, we present the perfor-
mance of the parser in the Multilingual task,
as well as an evaluation of the contribution
of bidirectional parsing and beam search to
the parsing performance.
