In this paper, we describe a new, publicly
available corpus intended to stimulate re-
search into language modeling techniques
which are sensitive to overall sentence coher-
ence. The task uses the Scholastic Aptitude
Test?s sentence completion format. The test
set consists of 1040 sentences, each of which
is missing a content word. The goal is to select
the correct replacement from amongst five al-
ternates. In general, all of the options are syn-
tactically valid, and reasonable with respect to
local N-gram statistics. The set was gener-
ated by using an N-gram language model to
generate a long list of likely words, given the
immediate context. These options were then
hand-groomed, to identify four decoys which
are globally incoherent, yet syntactically cor-
rect. To ensure the right to public distribution,
all the data is derived from out-of-copyright
materials from Project Gutenberg. The test
sentences were derived from five of Conan
Doyle?s Sherlock Holmes novels, and we pro-
vide a large set of Nineteenth and early Twen-
tieth Century texts as training material.
