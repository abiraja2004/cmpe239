In this paper we investigate a structured
model for jointly classifying the sentiment
of text at varying levels of granularity. Infer-
ence in the model is based on standard se-
quence classification techniques using con-
strained Viterbi to ensure consistent solu-
tions. The primary advantage of such a
model is that it allows classification deci-
sions from one level in the text to influence
decisions at another. Experiments show that
this method can significantly reduce classifi-
cation error relative to models trained in iso-
lation.
