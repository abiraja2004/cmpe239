psychology and computational linguistics have 
much to offer the science of language by 
adopting the research strategy that Donald 
Stokes called Pasteur?s quadrant--starting and 
testing success with important real world 
problems--and that education offers an ideal 
venue. Some putative examples from 
applications of Latent Semantic Analysis 
(LSA) are presented, as well as some detail on 
how LSA works, what it is and is not, and 
what it does and doesn?t do. For example, LSA 
is used successfully in automatic essay grading 
with content coverage feedback, computing 
optimal sequences of study materials, and 
partially automating metadata tagging, but is 
insufficient for scoring mathematical and short 
textual answers, for revealing reasons. It is 
explained that LSA is not construable as 
measuring co-occurrence, but rather measure 
the similarity of words in their effect on 
passage meaning,
