We present a novel approach to word re-
ordering which successfully integrates syn-
tactic structural knowledge with phrase-based
SMT. This is done by constructing a lattice
of alternatives based on automatically learned
probabilistic syntactic rules. In decoding, the
alternatives are scored based on the output
word order, not the order of the input. Un-
like previous approaches, this makes it possi-
ble to successfully integrate syntactic reorder-
ing with phrase-based SMT. On an English-
Danish task, we achieve an absolute improve-
ment in translation quality of 1.1 % BLEU.
Manual evaluation supports the claim that the
present approach is significantly superior to
previous approaches.
