 
The #u-TBL system represents an attempt o use the 
search and database capabilities of the Prolog pro- 
gramming language to implement a generalized form 
of transformation-based learning. In the true spirit 
of logic-programming, the implementation is 'derived' 
from a declarative, logical interpretation f transforma- 
tion rules. The #-TBL system recognizes four kinds 
of rules, that can be used to implement various kinds 
of disambiguators, including Constraint Grammar dis- 
ambiguators a  well as more traditional 'Brill-taggers'. 
Results from a number of experiments and benchmarks 
are presented which show that the system is both flex- 
" ible and efficient.
