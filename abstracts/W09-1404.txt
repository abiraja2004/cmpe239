We describe a biological event detection
method implemented for the BioNLP 2009
Shared Task 1. The method relies entirely on
the chunk and syntactic dependency relations
provided by a general NLP pipeline which was
not adapted in any way for the purposes of
the shared task. The method maps the syn-
tactic relations to event structures while be-
ing guided by the probabilities of the syntactic
features of events which were automatically
learned from the training data. Our method
achieved a recall of 26% and a precision of
44% in the official test run, under ?strict equal-
ity? of events.
