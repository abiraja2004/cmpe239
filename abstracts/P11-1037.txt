The challenges of Named Entities Recogni-
tion (NER) for tweets lie in the insufficient
information in a tweet and the unavailabil-
ity of training data. We propose to com-
bine a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classi-
fier with a linear Conditional Random Fields
(CRF) model under a semi-supervised learn-
ing framework to tackle these challenges. The
KNN based classifier conducts pre-labeling to
collect global coarse evidence across tweets
while the CRF model conducts sequential la-
beling to capture fine-grained information en-
coded in a tweet. The semi-supervised learn-
ing plus the gazetteers alleviate the lack of
training data. Extensive experiments show the
advantages of our method over the baselines
as well as the effectiveness of KNN and semi-
supervised learning.
