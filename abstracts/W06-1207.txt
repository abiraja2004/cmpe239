Previous computational work on learning
the semantic properties of verb-particle
constructions (VPCs) has focused on their
compositionality, and has left unaddressed
the issue of which meaning of the compo-
nent words is being used in a given VPC.
We develop a feature space for use in clas-
sification of the sense contributed by the
particle in a VPC, and test this on VPCs
using the particle up. The features that
capture linguistic properties of VPCs that
are relevant to the semantics of the par-
ticle outperform linguistically uninformed
word co-occurrence features in our exper-
iments on unseen test VPCs.
