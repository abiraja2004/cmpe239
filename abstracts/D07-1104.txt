A major engineering challenge in statistical
machine translation systems is the efficient
representation of extremely large translation
rulesets. In phrase-based models, this prob-
lem can be addressed by storing the training
data in memory and using a suffix array as
an efficient index to quickly lookup and ex-
tract rules on the fly. Hierarchical phrase-
based translation introduces the added wrin-
kle of source phrases with gaps. Lookup
algorithms used for contiguous phrases no
longer apply and the best approximate pat-
tern matching algorithms are much too slow,
taking several minutes per sentence. We
describe new lookup algorithms for hierar-
chical phrase-based translation that reduce
the empirical computation time by nearly
two orders of magnitude, making on-the-fly
lookup feasible for source phrases with gaps.
