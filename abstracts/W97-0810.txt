 
We describe and evaluate an approach for fast 
automatic recognition and extraction of subject 
and object dependency relations from large 
French corpora, using a sequence of finite-state 
transducers. The extraction is performed in two 
major steps: incremental finite-state parsing and 
extraction of subject/verb and object/verb rela- 
tions. Our incremental and cautious approach 
during the first phase allows the system to deal 
successfully with complex phenomena such as 
embeddings, coordination of VPs and NPs or 
non-standard word order. The extraction re- 
quires no subcategorisation nformation. It relies 
on POS information only. After describing the 
two steps, we give the results of an evaluation 
on various types of unrestricted corpora. Preci- 
sion is around 90-97% for subjects (84-88% for 
objects) and recall around 86-92% for subjects 
(80-90% for objects). We also provide some er- 
ror analysis; in particular, we evaluate the im- 
pact of POS tagging errors on subject/object de- 
pendency extraction.
