This paper presents an approach that uses
structural information for Japanese named
entity recognition (NER). Our NER system
is based on Support Vector Machine (SVM),
and utilizes four types of structural informa-
tion: cache features, coreference relations,
syntactic features and caseframe features,
which are obtained from structural analyses.
We evaluated our approach on CRL NE data
and obtained a higher F-measure than exist-
ing approaches that do not use structural in-
formation. We also conducted experiments
on IREX NE data and an NE-annotated web
corpus and confirmed that structural infor-
mation improves the performance of NER.
