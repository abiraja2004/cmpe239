 
This paper studies three techniques that 
improve the quality of N-best hypotheses 
through additional regeneration process. 
Unlike the multi-system consensus ap-
proach where multiple translation sys-
tems are used, our improvement is 
achieved through the expansion of the N-
best hypotheses from a single system. We 
explore three different methods to im-
plement the regeneration process: re-
decoding, n-gram expansion, and confu-
sion network-based regeneration. Ex-
periments on Chinese-to-English NIST 
and IWSLT tasks show that all three 
methods obtain consistent improvements. 
Moreover, the combination of the three 
strategies achieves further improvements 
and outperforms the baseline by 0.81 
BLEU-score on IWSLT?06, 0.57 on 
NIST?03, 0.61 on NIST?05 test set re-
spectively.
