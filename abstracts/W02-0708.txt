In this paper we compare two interlin-
gua representations for speech transla-
tion. The basis of this paper is a distri-
butional analysis of the C-star II and
Nespole databases tagged with inter-
lingua representations. The C-star II
database has been partially re-tagged
with the Nespole interlingua, which
enables us to make comparisons on the
same data with two types of interlin-
guas and on two types of data (C-
star II and Nespole) with the same
interlingua. The distributional infor-
mation presented in this paper show
that the Nespole interlingua main-
tains the language-independence and
simplicity of the C-star II speech-act-
based approach, while increasing se-
mantic expressiveness and scalability.
