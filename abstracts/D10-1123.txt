Determining whether a textual phrase denotes
a functional relation (i.e., a relation that maps
each domain element to a unique range el-
ement) is useful for numerous NLP tasks
such as synonym resolution and contradic-
tion detection. Previous work on this prob-
lem has relied on either counting methods or
lexico-syntactic patterns. However, determin-
ing whether a relation is functional, by ana-
lyzing mentions of the relation in a corpus,
is challenging due to ambiguity, synonymy,
anaphora, and other linguistic phenomena.
We present the LEIBNIZ system that over-
comes these challenges by exploiting the syn-
ergy between the Web corpus and freely-
available knowledge resources such as Free-
base. It first computes multiple typed function-
ality scores, representing functionality of the
relation phrase when its arguments are con-
strained to specific types. It then aggregates
these scores to predict the global functionality
for the phrase. LEIBNIZ outperforms previ-
ous work, increasing area under the precision-
recall curve from 0.61 to 0.88. We utilize
LEIBNIZ to generate the first public reposi-
tory of automatically-identified functional re-
lations.
