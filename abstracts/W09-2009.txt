 The design and content of the planning library of a story generation system dictates the con-tent quality of the story it produces. This paper presents the story planner component of Pic-ture Books, a system that generates stories for children aged 4 to 6 years based on a set of picture elements selected by the user. The planning library separates the design for the story patterns from the design of the semantic ontology that supplies the story?s domain knowledge. An evaluation of the system shows that the coherency and completeness of the plot is attributed to the story pattern design structure while the appropriateness of the con-tent is attributed to the semantic ontology. 1
