PLASER is a multimedia tool with instant
feedback designed to teach English pronunci-
ation for high-school students of Hong Kong
whose mother tongue is Cantonese Chinese.
The objective is to teach correct pronunciation
and not to assess a student?s overall pronuncia-
tion quality. Major challenges related to speech
recognition technology include: allowance for
non-native accent, reliable and corrective feed-
backs, and visualization of errors.
PLASER employs hidden Markov models
to represent position-dependent English
phonemes. They are discriminatively trained
using the standard American English TIMIT
corpus together with a set of TIMIT utterances
collected from ?good? local English speakers.
There are two kinds of speaking exercises:
minimal-pair exercises and word exercises.
In the word exercises, PLASER computes
a confidence-based score for each phoneme
of the given word, and paints each vowel or
consonant segment in the word using a novel
3-color scheme to indicate their pronunciation
accuracy. PLASER was used by 900 students
of grade 7 and 8 over a period of 2?3 months.
About 80% of the students said that they pre-
ferred using PLASER over traditional English
classes to learn pronunciation. A pronunciation
test was also conducted before and after they
used PLASER. The result from 210 students
shows that the students? pronunciation skill
was improved. (The statistics is significant at
the 99% confidence level.)
