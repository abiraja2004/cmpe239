 
This paper presents a new approach to 
automatic word categorization which im- 
proves both the efficiency of the algorithm 
and the quality of the formed clusters. The 
unigram and the bigram statistics of a cor- 
pus of about two million words are used 
with an efficient distance function to mea- 
sure the similarities of words, and a greedy 
algorithm to put the words into clusters. 
The notions of fuzzy clustering like cluster 
prototypes, degree of membership are used 
to form up the clusters. The algorithm is of 
unsupervised type and the number of clus- 
ters are determined at run-time.
