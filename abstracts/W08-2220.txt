Seven groups participated in the STEP 2008 shared task on comparing
semantic representations as output by practical wide-coverage NLP sys-
tems. Each of this groups developed their own system for producing se-
mantic representations for texts, each in their own semantic formalism.
Each group was requested to provide a short sample text, producing a
shared task set of seven texts, allowing participants to challenge each
other. Following this, each group was asked to provide the raw system
output for all texts, which are made available on http://www.sigsem.
org. Two groups were extremely inspired by the shared task and also
provided gold-standard semantic representations for the seven texts, to-
gether with evaluation measures. The STEP 2008 workshop itself will
continue the discussion, focusing on the feasibility of a theory-neutral
gold standard for deep semantic representations.
