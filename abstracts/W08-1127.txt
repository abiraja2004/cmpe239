The GREC Task at REG?08 required partici-
pating systems to select coreference chains to
the main subject of short encyclopaedic texts
collected from Wikipedia. Three teams sub-
mitted a total of 6 systems, and we addition-
ally created four baseline systems. Systems
were tested automatically using a range of ex-
isting intrinsic metrics. We also evaluated
systems extrinsically by applying coreference
resolution tools to the outputs and measuring
the success of the tools. In addition, systems
were tested in a reading/comprehension exper-
iment involving human subjects. This report
describes the GREC Task and the evaluation
methods, gives brief descriptions of the par-
ticipating systems, and presents the evaluation
results.
