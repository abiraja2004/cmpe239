We explored a simple, fast and effective
learning algorithm, the uneven margins
Perceptron, for Chinese word segmen-
tation. We adopted the character-based
classification framework and trans-
formed the task into several binary clas-
sification problems. We participated
the close and open tests for all the four
corpora. For the open test we only used
the utf-8 code knowledge for discrimi-
nation among Latin characters, Arabic
numbers and all other characters. Our
system performed well on the as, cityu
and msr corpora but was clearly worse
than the best result on the pku corpus.
