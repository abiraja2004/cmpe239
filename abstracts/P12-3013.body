This paper introduces BIUTEE1, an open-
source system for recognizing textual entail-
ment. Its main advantages are its ability to uti-
lize various types of knowledge resources, and
its extensibility by which new knowledge re-
sources and inference components can be eas-
ily integrated. These abilities make BIUTEE
an appealing RTE system for two research
communities: (1) researchers of end applica-
tions, that can benefit from generic textual in-
ference, and (2) RTE researchers, who can in-
tegrate their novel algorithms and knowledge
resources into our system, saving the time and
effort of developing a complete RTE system
from scratch. Notable assistance for these re-
searchers is provided by a visual tracing tool,
by which researchers can refine and ?debug?
their knowledge resources and inference com-
ponents.
