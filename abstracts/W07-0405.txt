Binarization is essential for achieving
polynomial time complexities in pars-
ing and syntax-based machine transla-
tion. This paper presents a new binariza-
tion scheme, target-side binarization, and
compares it with source-side and syn-
chronous binarizations on both string-
based and tree-based systems using syn-
chronous grammars. In particular, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of target-
side binarization on a large-scale tree-to-
string translation system.
