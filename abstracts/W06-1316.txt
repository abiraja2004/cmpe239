 
In this paper, we explain a rapid devel-
opment method of multimodal dialogue 
sys-tem using MIML (Multimodal Inter-
action Markup Language), which defines 
dialogue patterns between human and 
various types of interactive agents. The 
feature of this language is three-layered 
description of agent-based interactive 
systems which separates task level de-
scription, interaction description and de-
vice dependent realization. MIML has 
advantages in high-level interaction de-
scription, modality extensibility and 
compatibility with standardized tech-
nologies.
