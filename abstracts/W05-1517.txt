We present a novel approach for applying
the Inside-Outside Algorithm to a packed
parse forest produced by a unification-
based parser. The approach allows a node
in the forest to be assigned multiple inside
and outside probabilities, enabling a set of
?weighted GRs? to be computed directly
from the forest. The approach improves
on previous work which either loses effi-
ciency by unpacking the parse forest be-
fore extracting weighted GRs, or places
extra constraints on which nodes can be
packed, leading to less compact forests.
Our experiments demonstrate substantial
increases in parser accuracy and through-
put for weighted GR output.
