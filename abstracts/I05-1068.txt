. We propose a method for labelling prepositional phrases ac-
cording to two different semantic role classifications, as contained in the
Penn treebank and the CoNLL 2004 Semantic Role Labelling data set.
Our results illustrate the difficulties in determining preposition seman-
tics, but also demonstrate the potential for PP semantic role labelling to
improve the performance of a holistic semantic role labelling system.
