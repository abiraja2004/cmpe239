Active learning is a machine learning ap-
proach to achieving high-accuracy with a
small amount of labels by letting the learn-
ing algorithm choose instances to be labeled.
Most of previous approaches based on dis-
criminative learning use the margin for choos-
ing instances. We present a method for in-
corporating confidence into the margin by us-
ing a newly introduced online learning algo-
rithm and show empirically that confidence
improves active learning.
