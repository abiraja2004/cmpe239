This paper presents a reordering algorithm for
generating multiple stories from different per-
spectives based on a single baseball game. We
take a description of a game and a neutral sum-
mary, reorder the content of the neutral sum-
mary based on event features, and produce two
summaries that the users rated as showing per-
spectives of each of the two teams. We de-
scribe the results from an initial user survey
that revealed the power of reordering on the
users? perception of perspective. Then we de-
scribe our reordering algorithm which was de-
rived from analyzing the corpus of local news-
paper articles of teams involved in the games
as well as a neutral corpus for the respective
games. The resulting reordering algorithm is
successful at turning a neutral article into two
different summary articles that express the two
teams? perspectives.
