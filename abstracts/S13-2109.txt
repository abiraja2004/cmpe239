For participating in the SemEval 2013 chal-
lenge of recognition and classification of
drug names, we adapted our chemical en-
tity recognition approach consisting in Condi-
tional Random Fields for recognizing chemi-
cal terms and lexical similarity for entity res-
olution to the ChEBI ontology. We obtained
promising results, with a best F-measure of
0.81 for the partial matching task when us-
ing post-processing. Using only Conditional
Random Fields the results are slightly lower,
achieving still a good result in terms of F-
measure. Using the ChEBI ontology allowed
a significant improvement in precision (best
precision of 0.93 in partial matching task),
which indicates that taking advantage of an
ontology can be extremely useful for enhanc-
ing chemical entity recognition.
