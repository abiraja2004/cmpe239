 
Availability of source information for se- 
mantic tagging (or disambignating) words 
in corpora is problematic. A framework to 
produce a semantically tagged corpus in a 
domain specific perspective using as source 
a general purpose taxonomy (i.e. Word- 
Net) is here proposed. The tag set is de- 
rived from higher level Wordnet synsets. A 
methodology aiming to support semantic 
bootstrapping in a NLP application is de- 
fined. Results from large scale experiments 
are reported 1.
