. This paper reports on a study of semantic role tagging in Chinese, in 
the absence of a parser.  We investigated the effect of using only lexical infor-
mation in statistical training; and proposed to identify the relevant headwords in 
a sentence as a first step to partially locate the corresponding constituents to be 
labelled.  Experiments were done on a textbook corpus and a news corpus, rep-
resenting simple data and complex data respectively.  Results suggested that in 
Chinese, simple lexical features are useful enough when constituent boundaries 
are known, while parse information might be more important for complicated 
sentences than simple ones. Several ways to improve the headword identifica-
tion results were suggested, and we also plan to explore some class-based tech-
niques for the task, with reference to existing semantic lexicons.
