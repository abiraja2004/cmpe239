We report results on predicting the sense
of implicit discourse relations between ad-
jacent sentences in text. Our investigation
concentrates on the association between
discourse relations and properties of the
referring expressions that appear in the re-
lated sentences. The properties of inter-
est include coreference information, gram-
matical role, information status and syn-
tactic form of referring expressions. Pre-
dicting the sense of implicit discourse re-
lations based on these features is consid-
erably better than a random baseline and
several of the most discriminative features
conform with linguistic intuitions. How-
ever, these features do not perform as well
as lexical features traditionally used for
sense prediction.
