We augment an existing TAG-based in-
cremental syntactic formalism, PLTAG,
with a semantic component designed to
support the simultaneous modeling ef-
fects of thematic fit as well as syntactic
and semantic predictions. PLTAG is a
psycholinguistically-motivated formalism
which extends the standard TAG opera-
tions with a prediction and verification
mechanism and has experimental support
as a model of syntactic processing diffi-
culty. We focus on the problem of for-
mally modelling semantic role prediction
in the context of an incremental parse
and describe a flexible neo-Davidsonian
formalism and composition procedure to
accompany a PLTAG parse. To this
end, we also provide a means of aug-
menting the PLTAG lexicon with seman-
tic annotation. To illustrate this, we run
through an experimentally-relevant model
case, wherein the resolution of semantic
role ambiguities influences the resolution
of syntactic ambiguities and vice versa.
