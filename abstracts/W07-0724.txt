We present the PORTAGE statistical
machine translation system which par-
ticipated in the shared task of the ACL
2007 Second Workshop on Statistical
Machine Translation. The focus of this
description is on improvements which
were incorporated into the system over
the last year. These include adapted lan-
guage models, phrase table pruning, an
IBM1-based decoder feature, and rescor-
ing with posterior probabilities.
