The two principal areas of natural language processing 
research in pragmatics are belief modelling and speech 
act processing. Belief modelling is the development of 
techniques to represent the mental attitudes of a dia- 
logue participant. The latter approach, speech act 
processing, based on speech act theory, involves view- 
ing dialogue in planning terms. Utterances in a dia- 
logue are modelled as steps in a plan where 
understanding an utterance involves deriving the com- 
plete plan a speaker is attempting to achieve. How- 
ever, previous peech act ba~sed approaches have been 
limited by a reliance upon relatively simplistic belief 
modelling techniques and their relationship to plan- 
ning and plan recognition. In particular, such tech- 
niques assume precomputed nested belief structures. 
In this paper, we will present an approach to speech 
act processing based on novel belief modelling tech- 
niques where nested beliefs are propagated on 
demand.
