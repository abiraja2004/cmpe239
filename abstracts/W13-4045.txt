This study explores laughter distribution
around topic changes in multiparty conver-
sations. The distribution of shared and solo
laughter around topic changes was examined
in corpora containing two types of spoken in-
teraction; meetings and informal conversation.
Shared laughter was significantly more fre-
quent in the 15 seconds leading up to topic
change in the informal conversations. A sam-
ple of informal conversations was then anal-
ysed by hand to gain further insight into links
between laughter and topic change.
