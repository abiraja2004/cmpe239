The availability of learner corpora, especially
those which have been manually error-tagged
or shallow-parsed, is still limited. This means
that researchers do not have a common devel-
opment and test set for natural language pro-
cessing of learner English such as for gram-
matical error detection. Given this back-
ground, we created a novel learner corpus
that was manually error-tagged and shallow-
parsed. This corpus is available for research
and educational purposes on the web. In
this paper, we describe it in detail together
with its data-collection method and annota-
tion schemes. Another contribution of this
paper is that we take the first step toward
evaluating the performance of existing POS-
tagging/chunking techniques on learner cor-
pora using the created corpus. These contribu-
tions will facilitate further research in related
areas such as grammatical error detection and
automated essay scoring.
