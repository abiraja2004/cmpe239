Semitic languages pose a problem to
Natural Language Processing since
most of the vowels are omitted from
written prose, resulting in consider-
able ambiguity at the word level.
However, while reading text, native
speakers can generally vocalize each
word based on their familiarity with
the lexicon and the context of the
word. Methods for vowel restoration
in previous work involving morpho-
logical analysis concentrated on a sin-
gle language and relied on a parsed
corpus that is difficult to create for
many Semitic languages. We show
that Hidden Markov Models are a use-
ful tool for the task of vowel restora-
tion in Semitic languages. Our tech-
nique is simple to implement, does
not require any language specific
knowledge to be embedded in the
model and generalizes well to both
Hebrew and Arabic. Using a publicly
available version of the Bible and the
Qur?an as corpora, we achieve a suc-
cess rate of 86% for restoring the ex-
act vowel pattern in Arabic and 81%
in Hebrew. For Hebrew, we also re-
port on 87% success rate for restoring
the correct phonetic value of the
words.
