 
The field of language testing has long led 
the way in integrative, performance-based 
assessment. However, the use of technology 
in language testing has often meant limiting 
assessment options. We believe computer- 
mediated language assessment can enrich 
opportunities for language learners to 
demonstrate what they are able to do with 
their second language. In this paper, we 
describe the rationale and operation of the 
Computerized Oral Proficiency Instrument 
(COPI), a multimedia, computer- 
administered oral proficiency test. While at 
present speech performances on the COPI 
are evaluated by trained raters using a 
national standard, the COPI affords an 
excellent opportunity to investigate the use 
of Natural Language Processing for 
computer-assisted evaluation.
