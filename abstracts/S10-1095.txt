This paper describes the UMCC-DLSI
system in SemEval-2010 task number 17
(All-words Word Sense Disambiguation
on Specific Domain). The main purpose
of this work is to evaluate and compare
our computational resource of WordNet?s
mappings using 3 different methods:
Relevant Semantic Tree, Relevant
Semantic Tree 2 and an Adaptation of
k-clique?s Technique. Our proposal is
a non-supervised and knowledge-based
system that uses Domains Ontology and
SUMO.
