We introduce a novel mechanism for
incorporating articulatory dynamics into
speech recognition with the theory of task
dynamics. This system reranks sentence-
level hypotheses by the likelihoods of
their hypothetical articulatory realizations
which are derived from relationships
learned with aligned acoustic/articulatory
data. Experiments compare this with two
baseline systems, namely an acoustic hid-
den Markov model and a dynamic Bayes
network augmented with discretized rep-
resentations of the vocal tract. Our sys-
tem based on task dynamics reduces word-
error rates significantly by 10.2% relative
to the best baseline models.
