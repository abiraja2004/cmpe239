We propose an unsupervised method for clus-
tering the translations of a word, such that
the translations in each cluster share a com-
mon semantic sense. Words are assigned to
clusters based on their usage distribution in
large monolingual and parallel corpora using
the softK-Means algorithm. In addition to de-
scribing our approach, we formalize the task
of translation sense clustering and describe a
procedure that leverages WordNet for evalu-
ation. By comparing our induced clusters to
reference clusters generated from WordNet,
we demonstrate that our method effectively
identifies sense-based translation clusters and
benefits from both monolingual and parallel
corpora. Finally, we describe a method for an-
notating clusters with usage examples.
