Unknown lexical items present a major
obstacle to the development of broad-
coverage semantic role labeling systems.
We address this problem with a semi-
supervised learning approach which ac-
quires training instances for unseen verbs
from an unlabeled corpus. Our method re-
lies on the hypothesis that unknown lexical
items will be structurally and semantically
similar to known items for which annota-
tions are available. Accordingly, we rep-
resent known and unknown sentences as
graphs, formalize the search for the most
similar verb as a graph alignment prob-
lem and solve the optimization using inte-
ger linear programming. Experimental re-
sults show that role labeling performance
for unknown lexical items improves with
training data produced automatically by
our method.
