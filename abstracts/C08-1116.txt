We report on the large-scale acquisition
of class attributes with and without the
use of lists of representative instances, as
well as the discovery of unary attributes,
such as typically expressed in English
through prenominal adjectival modifica-
tion. Our method employs a system based
on compositional language processing, as
applied to the British National Corpus. Ex-
perimental results suggest that document-
based, open class attribute extraction can
produce results of comparable quality as
those obtained using web query logs, indi-
cating the utility of exploiting explicit oc-
currences of class labels in text.
