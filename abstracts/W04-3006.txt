This paper describes our research on both the
detection and subsequent resolution of recog-
nition errors in spoken dialogue systems. The
paper consists of two major components. The
first half concerns the design of the error detec-
tion mechanism for resolving city names in our
MERCURY flight reservation system, and an in-
vestigation of the behavioral patterns of users
in subsequent subdialogues involving keypad
entry for disambiguation. An important obser-
vation is that, upon a request for keypad en-
try, users are frequently unresponsive to the ex-
tent of waiting for a time-out or hanging up the
phone. The second half concerns a pilot ex-
periment investigating the feasibility of replac-
ing the solicitation of a keypad entry with that
of a ?speak-and-spell? entry. A novelty of our
work is the introduction of a speech synthesizer
to simulate the user, which facilitates develop-
ment and evaluation of our proposed strategy.
We have found that the speak-and-spell strat-
egy is quite effective in simulation mode, but it
remains to be tested in real user dialogues.
