The identification and extraction of Multiword
Expressions (MWEs) currently deliver satis-
factory results. However, the integration of
these results into a wider application remains
an issue. This is mainly due to the fact that
the association measures (AMs) used to detect
MWEs require a critical amount of data and
that the MWE dictionaries cannot account for
all the lexical and syntactic variations inherent
in MWEs. In this study, we use an alterna-
tive technique to overcome these limitations. It
consists in defining an n-gram frequency data-
base that can be used to compute AMs on-the-
fly, allowing the extraction procedure to effi-
ciently process all the MWEs in a text, even if
they have not been previously observed.
