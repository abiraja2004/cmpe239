 
This paper describes a series of experiments aimed at 
producing a bottom-up arser that will produce partial 
parses suitable for use in robust interpretation and still 
be reasonably efficient. In the course of these experi- 
ments, we improved parse times by a factor of 18 over 
our first attempt, ending with a system that was twice 
as fast as our previous parser, which relied on strong 
top-down constraints. The major algorithmic variations 
we tried are described along with the corresponding per- 
formance results.
