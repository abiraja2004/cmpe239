Temporal?contrastive discourse connectives
(although, while, since, etc.) signal various
types of relations between clauses such as tem-
poral, contrast, concession and cause. They
are often ambiguous and therefore difficult to
translate from one language to another. We
discuss several new and translation-oriented
experiments for the disambiguation of a spe-
cific subset of discourse connectives in order
to correct some of the translation errors made
by current statistical machine translation sys-
tems.
