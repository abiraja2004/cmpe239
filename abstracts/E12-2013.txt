Cognitive linguistics has reached a stage
of maturity where many researchers are
looking for an explicit formal grounding
of their work. Unfortunately, most current
models of deep language processing incor-
porate assumptions from generative gram-
mar that are at odds with the cognitive
movement in linguistics. This demonstra-
tion shows how Fluid Construction Gram-
mar (FCG), a fully operational and bidi-
rectional unification-based grammar for-
malism, caters for this increasing demand.
FCG features many of the tools that were
pioneered in computational linguistics in
the 70s-90s, but combines them in an inno-
vative way. This demonstration highlights
the main differences between FCG and re-
lated formalisms.
