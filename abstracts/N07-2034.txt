The aim of this work is to show the abil-
ity of finite-state transducers to simultane-
ously translate speech into multiple lan-
guages. Our proposal deals with an ex-
tension of stochastic finite-state transduc-
ers that can produce more than one out-
put at the same time. These kind of de-
vices offer great versatility for the inte-
gration with other finite-state devices such
as acoustic models in order to produce a
speech translation system. This proposal
has been evaluated in a practical situation,
and its results have been compared with
those obtained using a standard mono-
target speech transducer.
