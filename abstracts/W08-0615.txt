 
We present a comparative study between 
two machine learning methods, Conditional 
Random Fields and Support Vector Ma-
chines for clinical named entity recognition. 
We explore their applicability to clinical 
domain. Evaluation against a set of gold 
standard named entities shows that CRFs 
outperform SVMs. The best F-score with 
CRFs is 0.86 and for the SVMs is 0.64 as 
compared to a baseline of 0.60.
