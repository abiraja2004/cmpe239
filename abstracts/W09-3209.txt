Label Propagation, a standard algorithm
for semi-supervised classification, suffers
from scalability issues involving memory
and computation when used with large-
scale graphs from real-world datasets. In
this paper we approach Label Propagation
as solution to a system of linear equations
which can be implemented as a scalable
parallel algorithm using the map-reduce
framework. In addition to semi-supervised
classification, this approach to Label Prop-
agation allows us to adapt the algorithm to
make it usable for ranking on graphs and
derive the theoretical connection between
Label Propagation and PageRank. We pro-
vide empirical evidence to that effect using
two natural language tasks ? lexical relat-
edness and polarity induction. The version
of the Label Propagation algorithm pre-
sented here scales linearly in the size of
the data with a constant main memory re-
quirement, in contrast to the quadratic cost
of both in traditional approaches.
