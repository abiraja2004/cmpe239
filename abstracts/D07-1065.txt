In this paper, we describe a new algorithm
for recovering WH-trace empty nodes. Our
approach combines a set of hand-written
patterns together with a probabilistic model.
Because the patterns heavily utilize regu-
lar expressions, the pertinent tree structures
are covered using a limited number of pat-
terns. The probabilistic model is essen-
tially a probabilistic context-free grammar
(PCFG) approach with the patterns acting as
the terminals in production rules. We eval-
uate the algorithm?s performance on gold
trees and parser output using three differ-
ent metrics. Our method compares favorably
with state-of-the-art algorithms that recover
WH-traces.
