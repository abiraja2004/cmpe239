We investigate the task of detecting reli-
able statements about food-health relation-
ships from natural language texts. For that
purpose, we created a specially annotated
web corpus from forum entries discussing the
healthiness of certain food items. We ex-
amine a set of task-specific features (mostly)
based on linguistic insights that are instrumen-
tal in finding utterances that are commonly
perceived as reliable. These features are in-
corporated in a supervised classifier and com-
pared against standard features that are widely
used for various tasks in natural language pro-
cessing, such as bag of words, part-of speech
and syntactic parse information.
