Word lattice decoding has proven useful in
spoken language translation; we argue that it
provides a compelling model for translation of
text genres, as well. We show that prior work
in translating lattices using finite state tech-
niques can be naturally extended to more ex-
pressive synchronous context-free grammar-
based models. Additionally, we resolve a
significant complication that non-linear word
lattice inputs introduce in reordering mod-
els. Our experiments evaluating the approach
demonstrate substantial gains for Chinese-
English and Arabic-English translation.
