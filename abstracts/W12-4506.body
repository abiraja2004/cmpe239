In this paper, we present our system de-
scription for the CoNLL-2012 coreference
resolution task on English, Chinese and
Arabic. We investigate a projection-based
model in which we first translate Chinese
and Arabic into English, run a publicly
available coreference system, and then use
a new projection algorithm to map the
coreferring entities back from English in-
to mention candidates detected in the Chi-
nese and Arabic source. We compare to
a baseline that just runs the English coref-
erence system on the supplied parses for
Chinese and Arabic. Because our method
does not beat the baseline system on the
development set, we submit outputs gen-
erated by the baseline system as our final
submission.
