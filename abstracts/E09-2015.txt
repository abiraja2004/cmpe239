GF is a grammar formalism that has a
powerful type system and module system,
permitting a high level of abstraction and
division of labour in grammar writing. GF
is suited both for expert linguists, who
appreciate its capacity of generalizations
and conciseness, and for beginners, who
benefit from its static type checker and,
in particular, the GF Resource Grammar
Library, which currently covers 12 lan-
guages. GF has a notion of multilingual
grammars, enabling code sharing, linguis-
tic generalizations, rapid development of
translation systems, and painless porting
of applications to new languages.
