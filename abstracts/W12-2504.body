The identification of stylistic inconsistency is a
challenging task relevant to a number of gen-
res, including literature. In this work, we
carry out stylistic segmentation of a well-known
poem, The Waste Land by T.S. Eliot, which
is traditionally analyzed in terms of numerous
voices which appear throughout the text. Our
method, adapted from work in topic segmen-
tation and plagiarism detection, predicts breaks
based on a curve of stylistic change which com-
bines information from a diverse set of features,
most notably co-occurrence in larger corpora via
reduced-dimensionality vectors. We show that
this extrinsic information is more useful than
(within-text) distributional features. We achieve
well above baseline performance on both artifi-
cial mixed-style texts and The Waste Land itself.
