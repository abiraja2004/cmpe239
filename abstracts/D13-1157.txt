In a language generation system, a content
planner selects which elements must be in-
cluded in the output text and the ordering be-
tween them. Recent empirical approaches per-
form content selection without any ordering
and have thus no means to ensure that the out-
put is coherent. In this paper we focus on
the problem of generating text from a database
and present a trainable end-to-end generation
system that includes both content selection
and ordering. Content plans are represented
intuitively by a set of grammar rules that op-
erate on the document level and are acquired
automatically from training data. We de-
velop two approaches: the first one is inspired
from Rhetorical Structure Theory and repre-
sents the document as a tree of discourse re-
lations between database records; the second
one requires little linguistic sophistication and
uses tree structures to represent global patterns
of database record sequences within a doc-
ument. Experimental evaluation on two do-
mains yields considerable improvements over
the state of the art for both approaches.
