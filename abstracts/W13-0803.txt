Selecting a set of nonterminals for the syn-
chronous CFGs underlying the hierarchical
phrase-based models is usually done on the
basis of a monolingual resource (like a syntac-
tic parser). However, a standard bilingual re-
source like word alignments is itself rich with
reordering patterns that, if clustered some-
how, might provide labels of different (pos-
sibly complementary) nature to monolingual
labels. In this paper we explore a first ver-
sion of this idea based on a hierarchical de-
composition of word alignments into recursive
tree representations. We identify five clus-
ters of alignment patterns in which the chil-
dren of a node in a decomposition tree are
found and employ these five as nonterminal la-
bels for the Hiero productions. Although this
is our first non-optimized instantiation of the
idea, our experiments show competitive per-
formance with the Hiero baseline, exemplify-
ing certain merits of this novel approach.
