 
The Loebner Prize is the first, and only regular, 
competition based on the Turing Test, but in order to 
stage the competition various modifications to the 
original test have been made. In particular, the Grand 
Prize has a controversial nd as yet undefined Audio- 
Visual condition attached toit. This paper discusses the 
value of the test with and without the A/V condition, and 
makes a proposal about what he general nature of the 
A/V test should be.
