In this work, we are concerned with a coarse
grained semantic analysis over sparse data, which
labels all nouns with a set of semantic categories.
To get the benefit of unlabeled data, we propose
a bootstrapping framework with Maximum En-
tropy modeling (MaxEnt) as the statistical learn-
ing component. During the iterative tagging pro-
cess, unlabeled data is used not only for better
statistical estimation, but also as a medium to in-
tegrate non-statistical knowledge into the model
training. Two main issues are discussed in this
paper. First, Association Rule principles are sug-
gested to guide MaxEnt feature selections. Sec-
ond, to guarantee the convergence of the boot-
strapping process, three adjusting strategies are
proposed to soft tag unlabeled data.
