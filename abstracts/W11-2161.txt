We present the DFKI hybrid translation sys-
tem at the WMT workshop 2011. Three SMT
and two RBMT systems are combined at the
level of the final translation output. The trans-
lation results show that our hybrid system sig-
nificantly outperformed individual systems by
exploring strengths of both rule-based and sta-
tistical translations.
