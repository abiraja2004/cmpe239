We give a technical description of the
fission module of the COMIC mul-
timodal dialogue system, which both
plans the multimodal content of the sys-
tem turns and controls the execution of
those plans. We emphasise the parts of
the implementation that allow the sys-
tem to begin producing output as soon as
possible by preparing and outputting the
content in parallel. We also demonstrate
how the module was designed to ensure
robustness and configurability, and de-
scribe how the module has performed
successfully as part of the overall sys-
tem. Finally, we discuss how the tech-
niques used in this module can be ap-
plied to other similar dialogue systems.
