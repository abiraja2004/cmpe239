 
This paper describes a system that 
provides customer service by allowing 
users to retrieve identification umbers of 
parts for medical systems using spoken 
natural language dialogue. The paper also 
presents an evaluation of the system 
which shows that the system successfully 
retrieves the identification numbers of 
approximately 80% of the parts.
