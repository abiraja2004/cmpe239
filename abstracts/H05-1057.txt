Many proper names are spelled inconsis-
tently in speech recognizer output, posing
a problem for applications where locating
mentions of named entities is critical. We
model the distortion in the spelling of a
name due to the speech recognizer as the
effect of a noisy channel. The models fol-
low the framework of the IBM translation
models. The model is trained using a par-
allel text of closed caption and automatic
speech recognition output. We also test a
string edit distance based method. The ef-
fectiveness of these models is evaluated on
a name query retrieval task. Our methods
result in a 60% improvement in F1. We
also demonstrate why the problem has not
been critical in TREC and TDT tasks.
