This paper describes a study of the pat-
terns of translational equivalence exhib-
ited by a variety of bitexts. The study
found that the complexity of these pat-
terns in every bitext was higher than sug-
gested in the literature. These findings
shed new light on why ?syntactic? con-
straints have not helped to improve statis-
tical translation models, including finite-
state phrase-based models, tree-to-string
models, and tree-to-tree models. The
paper also presents evidence that inver-
sion transduction grammars cannot gen-
erate some translational equivalence rela-
tions, even in relatively simple real bi-
texts in syntactically similar languages
with rigid word order. Instructions
