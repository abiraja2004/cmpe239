 
This study investigates similarity judg-
ments from two angles.  First, we look at 
models suggested in the psychology and 
philosophy literature which capture the 
essence of concept similarity evaluation 
for humans.  Second, we analyze the 
properties of many metrics which simu-
late such evaluation capabilities. The first 
angle reveals that non-experts can judge 
similarity and that their judgments need 
not be based on predefined traits.  We use 
such conclusions to inform us on how 
gold standards for word sense disam-
biguation tasks could be established.  
From the second angle, we conclude that 
more attention should be paid to metric 
properties before assigning them to per-
form a particular task.
