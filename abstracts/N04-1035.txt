We propose a theory that gives formal seman-
tics to word-level alignments defined over par-
allel corpora. We use our theory to introduce a
linear algorithm that can be used to derive from
word-aligned, parallel corpora the minimal set
of syntactically motivated transformation rules
that explain human translation data.
