 
As a step toward conversational systems that al- 
low for a more natural human-computer interac- 
tion, we rep6r~ on GSG, a system that, while pro- 
viding a natural-l~nguage interface to a variety of 
applications, engages in clarification dialogues with 
the end user through which new semantic mappings 
are dynamically acquired. GsG exploits task- and 
language-dependent information but is fully task- 
and language-independent in its architecture and 
strategies.
