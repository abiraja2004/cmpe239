 
Informal language is actively used in net-
work-mediated communication, e.g. chat 
room, BBS, email and text message. We refer 
the anomalous terms used in such context as 
network informal language (NIL) expres-
sions. For example, ??(ou3)? is used to re-
place ?? (wo3)? in Chinese ICQ. Without 
unconventional resource, knowledge and 
techniques, the existing natural language 
processing approaches exhibit less effective-
ness in dealing with NIL text. We propose to 
study NIL expressions with a NIL corpus and 
investigate techniques in processing NIL ex-
pressions. Two methods for Chinese NIL ex-
pression recognition are designed in NILER 
system. The experimental results show that 
pattern matching method produces higher 
precision and support vector machines 
method higher F-1 measure. These results are 
encouraging and justify our future research 
effort in NIL processing.
