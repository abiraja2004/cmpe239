This paper describes a simple evaluation
metric for MT which attempts to overcome
the well-known deficits of the standard
BLEU metric from a slightly different an-
gle. It employes Levenshtein?s edit dis-
tance for establishing alignment between
the MT output and the reference transla-
tion in order to reflect the morphological
properties of highly inflected languages. It
also incorporates a very simple measure
expressing the differences in the word or-
der. The paper also includes evaluation on
the data from the previous SMT workshop
for several language pairs.
