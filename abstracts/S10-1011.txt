This paper presents the description and
evaluation framework of SemEval-2010
Word Sense Induction & Disambiguation
task, as well as the evaluation results of 26
participating systems. In this task, partici-
pants were required to induce the senses of
100 target words using a training set, and
then disambiguate unseen instances of the
same words using the induced senses. Sys-
tems? answers were evaluated in: (1) an
unsupervised manner by using two clus-
tering evaluation measures, and (2) a su-
pervised manner in a WSD task.
