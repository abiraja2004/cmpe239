 
State of the art set expansion algorithms pro-
duce varying quality expansions for different 
entity types. Even for the highest quality ex-
pansions, errors still occur and manual re-
finements are necessary for most practical 
uses. In this paper, we propose algorithms to 
aide this refinement process, greatly reducing 
the amount of manual labor required. The me-
thods rely on the fact that most expansion er-
rors are systematic, often stemming from the 
fact that some seed elements are ambiguous. 
Using our methods, empirical evidence shows 
that average R-precision over random entity 
sets improves by 26% to 51% when given 
from 5 to 10 manually tagged errors. Both 
proposed refinement models have linear time 
complexity in set size allowing for practical 
online use in set expansion systems.
