Attempts to estimate phrase translation
probablities for statistical machine transla-
tion using iteratively-trained models have
repeatedly failed to produce translations as
good as those obtained by estimating phrase
translation probablities from surface statis-
tics of bilingual word alignments as de-
scribed by Koehn, et al (2003). We pro-
pose a new iteratively-trained phrase trans-
lation model that produces translations of
quality equal to or better than those pro-
duced by Koehn, et al?s model. Moreover,
with the new model, translation quality de-
grades much more slowly as pruning is tigh-
tend to reduce translation time.
