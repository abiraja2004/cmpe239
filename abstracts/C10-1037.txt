We consider the task of summarizing a
cluster of related sentences with a short
sentence which we call multi-sentence
compression and present a simple ap-
proach based on shortest paths in word
graphs. The advantage and the novelty of
the proposed method is that it is syntax-
lean and requires little more than a tok-
enizer and a tagger. Despite its simplic-
ity, it is capable of generating grammati-
cal and informative summaries as our ex-
periments with English and Spanish data
demonstrate.
