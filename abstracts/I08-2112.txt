Lexical mismatch is a problem that con-
founds automatic question answering sys-
tems. While existing lexical ontologies such
as WordNet have been successfully used to
match verbal synonyms (e.g., beat and de-
feat) and common nouns (tennis is-a sport),
their coverage of proper nouns is less ex-
tensive. Question answering depends sub-
stantially on processing named entities, and
thus it would be of significant benefit if
lexical ontologies could be enhanced with
additional hypernymic (i.e., is-a) relations
that include proper nouns, such as Edward
Teach is-a pirate. We demonstrate how a re-
cently developed statistical approach to min-
ing such relations can be tailored to iden-
tify named entity hyponyms, and how as a
result, superior question answering perfor-
mance can be obtained. We ranked candi-
date hyponyms on 75 categories of named
entities and attained 53% mean average pre-
cision. On TREC QA data our method pro-
duces a 9% improvement in performance.
