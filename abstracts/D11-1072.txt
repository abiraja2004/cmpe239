Disambiguating named entities in natural-
language text maps mentions of ambiguous
names onto canonical entities like people or
places, registered in a knowledge base such as
DBpedia or YAGO. This paper presents a ro-
bust method for collective disambiguation, by
harnessing context from knowledge bases and
using a new form of coherence graph. It unifies
prior approaches into a comprehensive frame-
work that combines three measures: the prior
probability of an entity being mentioned, the
similarity between the contexts of a mention
and a candidate entity, as well as the coherence
among candidate entities for all mentions to-
gether. The method builds a weighted graph of
mentions and candidate entities, and computes
a dense subgraph that approximates the best
joint mention-entity mapping. Experiments
show that the new method significantly outper-
forms prior methods in terms of accuracy, with
robust behavior across a variety of inputs.
