Words are important both in historical lin-
guistics and natural language processing.
They are not indivisible abstract atoms;

units such as morphemes, phonemes, syl-
lables, and letters. In this presentation,
I attempt to sketch the similarity pat-
terns among a number of diverse research
projects in which I participated.
