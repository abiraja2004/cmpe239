We present a cross-lingual projection frame-
work for temporal annotations. Auto-
matically obtained TimeML annotations in
the English portion of a parallel corpus
are transferred to the German translation
along a word alignment. Direct projection
augmented with shallow heuristic knowl-
edge outperforms the uninformed baseline
by 6.64% F

-measure for events, and by
17.93% for time expressions. Subsequent
training of statistical classifiers on the (im-
perfect) projected annotations significantly
boosts precision by up to 31% to 83.95% and
89.52%, respectively.
