 
User modeling is an iml>ortant COlnponents of dia- 
log systems. Most previous approaches are rule-based 
methods, hi this paper, we proimse to represent user 
models through Bayesian networks. Some advantages 
of the Bayesian approach over the rule-based approach 
are as follows. First, rules for updating user models are 
not necessary because up<lating is directly performed 
by the ewduation of the network base<l on probal>ility 
theory; this provides us a more formal way of dealing 
with uncertainties. Second, the Bayesian network pro: 
rides more detailed information of users' knowledge, 
because the degree of belief on each concept is pro- 
vided in terms of prol~ability. We prove these advan- 
tages through a prelinfinary experiment.
