 
Sublanguages _differ from each other, and from the "stan- 
dard Ian~age,  in their syntactic, semantic, and 
discourse vrolx:rties. Understanding these differences i
important'if -we are to improve our ability to process 
these sublanguages. We have developed a sen~.'- 
automatic ~ure  for identifying sublangnage syntact/c 
usage from a sample of text in the sublanguage..We 
describe the results of applying this procedure to taree 
text samples: two sets of medical documents and a set of 
equipment failure me~ages.
