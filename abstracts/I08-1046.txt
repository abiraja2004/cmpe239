We propose a method that incorporates
paraphrase information from the Web to
boost the performance of a supervised re-
lation extraction system. Contextual infor-
mation is extracted from the Web using a
semi-supervised process, and summarized
by skip-bigram overlap measures over the
entire extract. This allows the capture of lo-
cal contextual information as well as more
distant associations. We observe a statisti-
cally significant boost in relation extraction
performance.
We investigate two extensions, thematic
clustering and hypernym expansion. In tan-
dem with thematic clustering to reduce noise
in our paraphrase extraction, we attempt to
increase the coverage of our search for para-
phrases using hypernym expansion.
Evaluation of our method on the ACE 2004
corpus shows that it out-performs the base-
line SVM-based supervised learning algo-
rithm across almost all major ACE relation
types, by a margin of up to 31%.
