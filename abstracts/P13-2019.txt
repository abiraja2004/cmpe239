This paper is concerned with the problem
of heterogeneous dependency parsing. In
this paper, we present a novel joint infer-
ence scheme, which is able to leverage
the consensus information between het-
erogeneous treebanks in the parsing phase.
Different from stacked learning meth-
ods (Nivre and McDonald, 2008; Martins
et al, 2008), which process the depen-
dency parsing in a pipelined way (e.g., a
second level uses the first level outputs), in
our method, multiple dependency parsing
models are coordinated to exchange con-
sensus information. We conduct experi-
ments on Chinese Dependency Treebank
(CDT) and Penn Chinese Treebank (CTB),
experimental results show that joint infer-
ence can bring significant improvements
to all state-of-the-art dependency parsers.
