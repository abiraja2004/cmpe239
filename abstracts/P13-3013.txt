This paper presents work in progress to-
wards automatic recognition and classifi-
cation of comparisons and similes.
Among possible applications, we discuss
the place of this task in text simplifica-
tion for readers with Autism Spectrum
Disorders (ASD), who are known to have
deficits in comprehending figurative lan-
guage.
We propose an approach to comparison
recognition through the use of syntactic
patterns. Keeping in mind the require-
ments of autistic readers, we discuss the
properties relevant for distinguishing se-
mantic criteria like figurativeness and ab-
stractness.
