This paper describes our contribution to the
semantic role labeling task (SRL-only) of the
CoNLL-2009 shared task in the closed chal-
lenge (Hajic? et al, 2009). Our system con-
sists of a pipeline of independent, local clas-
sifiers that identify the predicate sense, the ar-
guments of the predicates, and the argument
labels. Using these local models, we carried
out a beam search to generate a pool of candi-
dates. We then reranked the candidates using
a joint learning approach that combines the lo-
cal models and proposition features.
To address the multilingual nature of the data,
we implemented a feature selection procedure
that systematically explored the feature space,
yielding significant gains over a standard set
of features. Our system achieved the second
best semantic score overall with an average la-
beled semantic F1 of 80.31. It obtained the
best F1 score on the Chinese and German data
and the second best one on English.
