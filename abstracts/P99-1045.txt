 
We perform a linguistic analysis of 
documents during indexing for information 
retrieval. By eliminating index terms that 
occur only in subordinate clauses, index size 
is reduced by approximately 30% without 
adversely affecting precision or recall. These 
results hold for two corpora: a sample of the 
world wide web and an electronic 
encyclopedia.
