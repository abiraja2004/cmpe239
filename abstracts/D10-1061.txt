Production of parallel training corpora for the
development of statistical machine translation
(SMT) systems for resource-poor languages
usually requires extensive manual effort. Ac-
tive sample selection aims to reduce the la-
bor, time, and expense incurred in produc-
ing such resources, attaining a given perfor-
mance benchmark with the smallest possible
training corpus by choosing informative, non-
redundant source sentences from an available
candidate pool for manual translation. We
present a novel, discriminative sample selec-
tion strategy that preferentially selects batches
of candidate sentences with constructs that
lead to erroneous translations on a held-out de-
velopment set. The proposed strategy supports
a built-in diversity mechanism that reduces
redundancy in the selected batches. Simu-
lation experiments on English-to-Pashto and
Spanish-to-English translation tasks demon-
strate the superiority of the proposed approach
to a number of competing techniques, such
as random selection, dissimilarity-based se-
lection, as well as a recently proposed semi-
supervised active learning strategy.
