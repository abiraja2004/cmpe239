 
We present a set of discourse structure relations 
that are easy to code, and develop criteria for an 
appropriate data structure for representing these 
relations.  Discourse structure here refers to 
informational relations that hold between sentences 
in a discourse (cf. Hobbs, 1985).  We evaluated 
whether trees are a descriptively adequate data 
structure for representing coherence.  Trees are 
widely assumed as a data structure for representing 
coherence but we found that more powerful data 
structures are needed: In coherence structures of 
naturally occurring texts, we found many different 
kinds of crossed dependencies, as well as many 
nodes with multiple parents.  The claims are 
supported by statistical results from a database of 
135 texts from the Wall Street Journal and the AP 
Newswire that were hand-annotated with 
coherence relations, based on the annotation 
schema presented in this paper.
