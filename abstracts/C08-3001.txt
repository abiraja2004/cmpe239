This paper presents a fully operational
real-time event extraction system which is
capable of accurately and efficiently ex-
tracting violent and natural disaster events
from vast amount of online news articles
per day in different languages. Due to the
requirement that the system must be mul-
tilingual and easily extendable, it is based
on a shallow linguistic analysis. The event
extraction results can be viewed on a pub-
licly accessible website.
