Data sparsity is one of the main factors that
make word sense disambiguation (WSD)
difficult. To overcome this problem we need
to find effective ways to use resources other
than sense labeled data. In this paper I de-
scribe a WSD system that uses a statistical
language model based on a large unanno-
tated corpus. The model is used to evalu-
ate the likelihood of various substitutes for a
word in a given context. These likelihoods
are then used to determine the best sense for
the word in novel contexts. The resulting
system participated in three tasks in the Se-
mEval 2007 workshop. The WSD of prepo-
sitions task proved to be challenging for the
system, possibly illustrating some of its lim-
itations: e.g. not all words have good sub-
stitutes. The system achieved promising re-
sults for the English lexical sample and En-
glish lexical substitution tasks.
