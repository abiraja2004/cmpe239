In this paper, we propose a novel Rhetorical
Structure Index (RSI) to measure the struc-
tural importance of a word or a phrase. Un-
like TF-IDF and other content-driven mea-
surements, RSI identifies words or phrases
that are structural cues in an unstructured doc-
ument. We show structurally motivated fea-
tures with high RSI values are more useful
than content-driven features for applications
such as segmenting unstructured lecture tran-
scripts into meaningful segments. Experi-
ments show that using RSI significantly im-
proves the segmentation accuracy compared
to TF-IDF, a traditional content-based feature
weighting scheme.
