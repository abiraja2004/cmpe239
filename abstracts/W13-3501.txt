Active learning and domain adaptation are
both important tools for reducing labeling
effort to learn a good supervised model in
a target domain. In this paper, we inves-
tigate the problem of online active learn-
ing within a new active domain adapta-
tion setting: there are insufficient labeled
data in both source and target domains,
but it is cheaper to query labels in the
source domain than in the target domain.
Given a total budget, we develop two cost-
sensitive online active learning methods, a
multi-view uncertainty-based method and
a multi-view disagreement-based method,
to query the most informative instances
from the two domains, aiming to learn a
good prediction model in the target do-
main. Empirical studies on the tasks of
cross-domain sentiment classification of
Amazon product reviews demonstrate the
efficacy of the proposed methods on re-
ducing labeling cost.
