State-of-the-art approaches for unsuper-
vised keyphrase extraction are typically
evaluated on a single dataset with a single
parameter setting. Consequently, it is un-
clear how effective these approaches are
on a new dataset from a different domain,
and how sensitive they are to changes in
parameter settings. To gain a better under-
standing of state-of-the-art unsupervised
keyphrase extraction algorithms, we con-
duct a systematic evaluation and analysis
of these algorithms on a variety of stan-
dard evaluation datasets.
