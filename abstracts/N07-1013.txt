We introduce a novel ranking algorithm
called GRASSHOPPER, which ranks items
with an emphasis on diversity. That is, the
top items should be different from each
other in order to have a broad coverage
of the whole item set. Many natural lan-
guage processing tasks can benefit from
such diversity ranking. Our algorithm is
based on random walks in an absorbing
Markov chain. We turn ranked items into
absorbing states, which effectively pre-
vents redundant items from receiving a
high rank. We demonstrate GRASSHOP-
PER?s effectiveness on extractive text sum-
marization: our algorithm ranks between
the 1st and 2nd systems on DUC 2004
Task 2; and on a social network analy-
sis task that identifies movie stars of the
world.
