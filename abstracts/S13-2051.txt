This paper describes our system for shared
task 13 ?Word Sense Induction for Graded and
Non-Graded Senses? of SemEval-2013. The
task is on word sense induction (WSI), and
builds on earlier SemEval WSI tasks in ex-
ploring the possibility of multiple senses be-
ing compatible to varying degrees with a sin-
gle contextual instance: participants are asked
to grade senses rather than selecting a sin-
gle sense like most word sense disambigua-
tion (WSD) settings. The evaluation measures
are designed to assess how well a system per-
ceives the different senses in a contextual in-
stance. We adopt a previously-proposed WSI
methodology for the task, which is based on a
Hierarchical Dirichlet Process (HDP), a non-
parametric topic model. Our system requires
no parameter tuning, uses the English ukWaC
as an external resource, and achieves encour-
aging results over the shared task.
