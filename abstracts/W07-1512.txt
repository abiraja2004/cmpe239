The linguistic quality of a parallel tree-
bank depends crucially on the parallelism
between the source and target language an-
notations. We propose a linguistic notion
of translation units and a quantitative mea-
sure of parallelism for parallel dependency
treebanks, and demonstrate how the pro-
posed translation units and parallelism mea-
sure can be used to compute transfer rules,
spot annotation errors, and compare differ-
ent annotation schemes with respect to each
other. The proposal is evaluated on the
100,000 word Copenhagen Danish-English
Dependency Treebank.
