Typically, the lexicon models used in
statistical machine translation systems
do not include any kind of linguistic
or contextual information, which often
leads to problems in performing a cor-
rect word sense disambiguation. One
way to deal with this problem within
the statistical framework is to use max-
imum entropy methods. In this paper,
we present how to use this type of in-
formation within a statistical machine
translation system. We show that it is
possible to significantly decrease train-
ing and test corpus perplexity of the
translation models. In addition, we per-
form a rescoring of  -Best lists us-
ing our maximum entropy model and
thereby yield an improvement in trans-
lation quality. Experimental results are
presented on the so-called ?Verbmobil
Task?.
