Web search personalization has been well
studied in the recent few years. Relevance
feedback has been used in various ways to
improve relevance of search results. In this
paper, we propose a novel usage of rele-
vance feedback to effectively model the pro-
cess of query formulation and better char-
acterize how a user relates his query to the
document that he intends to retrieve using
a noisy channel model. We model a user
profile as the probabilities of translation of
query to document in this noisy channel us-
ing the relevance feedback obtained from the
user. The user profile thus learnt is applied
in a re-ranking phase to rescore the search
results retrieved using an underlying search
engine. We evaluate our approach by con-
ducting experiments using relevance feed-
back data collected from users using a pop-
ular search engine. The results have shown
improvement over baseline, proving that our
approach can be applied to personalization
of web search. The experiments have also
resulted in some valuable observations that
learning these user profiles using snippets
surrounding the results for a query gives bet-
ter performance than learning from entire
document collection.
