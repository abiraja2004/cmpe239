Learning inference relations between verbs is
at the heart of many semantic applications.
However, most prior work on learning such
rules focused on a rather narrow set of in-
formation sources: mainly distributional sim-
ilarity, and to a lesser extent manually con-
structed verb co-occurrence patterns. In this
paper, we claim that it is imperative to uti-
lize information from various textual scopes:
verb co-occurrence within a sentence, verb co-
occurrence within a document, as well as over-
all corpus statistics. To this end, we propose
a much richer novel set of linguistically mo-
tivated cues for detecting entailment between
verbs and combine them as features in a su-
pervised classification framework. We empir-
ically demonstrate that our model significantly
outperforms previous methods and that infor-
mation from each textual scope contributes to
the verb entailment learning task.
