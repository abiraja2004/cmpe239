The role of aggregation in natural lan-
guage generation is to combine two or
more linguistic structures into a single
sentence. The task is crucial for generat-
ing concise and readable texts. We present
an efficient algorithm for automatically
learning aggregation rules from a text and
its related database. The algorithm treats
aggregation as a set partitioning problem
and uses a global inference procedure to
find an optimal solution. Our experiments
show that this approach yields substan-
tial improvements over a clustering-based
model which relies exclusively on local
information.
