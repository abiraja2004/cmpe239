For sentiment analysis, lexicons play an
important role in many related tasks. In
this paper, aiming to build Chinese emo-
tion lexicons for public use, we adopted a
graph-based algorithm which ranks words
according to a few seed emotion words.
The ranking algorithm exploits the simi-
larity between words, and uses multiple
similarity metrics which can be derived
from dictionaries, unlabeled corpora or
heuristic rules. To evaluate the adopted
algorithm and resources, two independent
judges were asked to label the top words
of ranking list.
It is observed that noise is almost un-
avoidable due to imprecise similarity met-
rics between words. So, to guarantee
the quality of emotion lexicons, we use
an iterative feedback to combine man-
ual labeling and the automatic ranking al-
gorithm above. We also compared our
newly constructed Chinese emotion lexi-
cons (happiness, anger, sadness, fear and
surprise) with existing counterparts, and
related analysis is offered.
