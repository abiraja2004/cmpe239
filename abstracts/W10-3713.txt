The Varro toolkit offers an intuitive mech-
anism for extracting syntactically mo-
tivated multi-word expressions (MWEs)
from dependency treebanks by looking for
recurring connected subtrees instead of
subsequences in strings. This approach
can find MWEs that are in varying orders
and have words inserted into their compo-
nents. This paper also proposes descrip-
tion length gain as a statistical correlation
measure well-suited to tree structures.
