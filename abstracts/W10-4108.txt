 
This paper gives a new definition of Chi-
nese clause called ?Event Descriptive 
Clause? and proposes an automatic me-
thod to identify these clauses in Chinese 
sentence. By analyzing the characteristics 
of the clause, the recognition task is formu-
lated as a classification of Chinese punctua-
tions. The maximum entropy classifier is 
trained and two kinds of useful features and 
their combinations are explored in the task. 
Meanwhile, a simple rule-based post 
processing phase is also proposed to im-
prove the recognition performance. Ulti-
mately, we obtain 81.32% F-score on the 
test set.
