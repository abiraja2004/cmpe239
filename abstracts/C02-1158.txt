A number of machine translation systems based
on the learning algorithms are presented. These
methods acquire translation rules from pairs
of similar sentences in a bilingual text cor-
pora. This means that it is difficult for the
systems to acquire the translation rules from
sparse data. As a result, these methods require
large amounts of training data in order to ac-
quire high-quality translation rules. To over-
come this problem, we propose a method of ma-
chine translation using a Recursive Chain-link-
type Learning. In our new method, the system
can acquire many new high-quality translation
rules from sparse translation examples based on
already acquired translation rules. Therefore,
acquisition of new translation rules results in
the generation of more new translation rules.
Such a process of acquisition of translation rules
is like a linked chain. From the results of evalua-
tion experiments, we confirmed the effectiveness
of Recursive Chain-link-type Learning.
