 
This article is concerned with the building of a test data 
set for assisting the industrial user in machine translation 
evaluation. The emphasis is laid on the interest of an 
approach based on the study of bilingual corpus pragmatic 
characteristics. The study of one chapter of the 
maintenance manual of the Super Puma helicopter made it 
possible to identify the pragmatic characteristics relevant 
in the choice of the morpho-syntactic structures and 
translation processes actually used. The textual test set 
consists in a SGML file including the source text sequences 
aligned with the reference translation sequences and also 
including the pragmatic, formal and translational 
characteristics in the form of annotations (labels and 
formal descriptions).
