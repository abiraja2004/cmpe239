We show for the first time that incorporating
the predictions of a word sense disambigua-
tion system within a typical phrase-based
statistical machine translation (SMT) model
consistently improves translation quality
across all three different IWSLT Chinese-
English test sets, as well as producing sta-
tistically significant improvements on the
larger NIST Chinese-English MT task?
and moreover never hurts performance on
any test set, according not only to BLEU
but to all eight most commonly used au-
tomatic evaluation metrics. Recent work
has challenged the assumption that word
sense disambiguation (WSD) systems are
useful for SMT. Yet SMT translation qual-
ity still obviously suffers from inaccurate
lexical choice. In this paper, we address
this problem by investigating a new strat-
egy for integrating WSD into an SMT sys-
tem, that performs fully phrasal multi-word
disambiguation. Instead of directly incor-
porating a Senseval-style WSD system, we
redefine the WSD task to match the ex-
act same phrasal translation disambiguation
task faced by phrase-based SMT systems.
Our results provide the first known empir-
ical evidence that lexical semantics are in-
deed useful for SMT, despite claims to the
contrary.
