We describe a method based on ?tweak-
ing? an existing learned sequential classi-
fier to change the recall-precision tradeoff,
guided by a user-provided performance
criterion. This method is evaluated on
the task of recognizing personal names in
email and newswire text, and proves to be
both simple and effective.
