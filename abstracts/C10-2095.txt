Most existing techniques for combining
multiple alignment tables can combine
only two alignment tables at a time, and
are based on heuristics (Och and Ney,
2003), (Koehn et al, 2003). In this pa-
per, we propose a novel mathematical for-
mulation for combining an arbitrary num-
ber of alignment tables using their power
mean. The method frames the combi-
nation task as an optimization problem,
and finds the optimal alignment lying be-
tween the intersection and union of multi-
ple alignment tables by optimizing the pa-
rameter p: the affinely extended real num-
ber defining the order of the power mean
function. The combination approach pro-
duces better alignment tables in terms of
both F-measure and BLEU scores.
