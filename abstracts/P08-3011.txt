We present the development and tuning of a
topic-adapted language model for word pre-
diction, which improves keystroke savings
over a comparable baseline. We outline our
plans to develop and integrate style adap-
tations, building on our experience in topic
modeling to dynamically tune the model to
both topically and stylistically relevant texts.
