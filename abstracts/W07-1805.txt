 
In command and control (C&C) speech in-
teraction, users interact by speaking com-
mands or asking questions typically speci-
fied in a context-free grammar (CFG). Un-
fortunately, users often produce out-of-
grammar (OOG) commands, which can re-
sult in misunderstanding or non-
understanding.  We explore a simple ap-
proach to handling OOG commands that 
involves generating a backoff grammar 
from any CFG using filler models, and util-
izing that grammar for recognition when-
ever the CFG fails.  Working within the 
memory footprint requirements of a mobile 
C&C product, applying the approach 
yielded a 35% relative reduction in seman-
tic error rate for OOG commands.  It also 
improved partial recognitions for enabling 
clarification dialogue.
