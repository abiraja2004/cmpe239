 
A new technique to locate content-represent- 
ing words for a given document image using 
abstract representation f character shapes is 
described. A character shape code representa- 
tion defined by the location of a character in a 
text line has been developed. Character shape 
code generation avoids the computational 
expense of conventional optical character rec- 
ognition (OCR). Because character shape 
codes are an abstraction of standard character 
code (e.g., ASCII), the mapping is ambiguous. 
In this paper, the ambiguity is shown to be 
practically limited to an acceptable vel. It is 
illustrated that: first, punctuation marks are 
clearly distinguished from the other charac- 
ters; second, stop words are generally distin- 
guishable from other words, because the 
permutations of character shape codes in func- 
tion words are characteristically different from 
those in content words; and third, numerals 
and acronyms in capital letters are distinguish- 
able from other words. With these clAssifica- 
tions, potential content-representing words are 
identified, and an analysis of their distribution 
yields their rank. Consequently, introducing 
character shape codes makes it possible to 
inexpensively and robustly bridge the gap 
between electronic documents and hard-copy 
documents for the purpose of content identifi- 
cation.
