  
In this paper, we focus on the domain ontology 
acquisition from Chinese corpus by extracting 
rules designed for Chinese phrases. These rules 
are noun sequences with part-of-speech tags. 
Experiments show that this process can construct 
domain ontology prototypes efficiently and 
effectively.
