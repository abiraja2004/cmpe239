This paper describes a wide-coverage sta-
tistical parser that uses Combinatory Cat-
egorial Grammar (CCG) to derive de-
pendency structures. The parser differs
from most existing wide-coverage tree-
bank parsers in capturing the long-range
dependencies inherent in constructions
such as coordination, extraction, raising
and control, as well as the standard local
predicate-argument dependencies. A set
of dependency structures used for train-
ing and testing the parser is obtained from
a treebank of CCG normal-form deriva-
tions, which have been derived (semi-) au-
tomatically from the Penn Treebank. The
parser correctly recovers over 80% of la-
belled dependencies, and around 90% of
unlabelled dependencies.
