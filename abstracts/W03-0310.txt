We present two methods for the automatic cre-
ation of parallel corpora. Whereas previous
work into the automatic construction of parallel
corpora has focused on harvesting them from
the web, we examine the use of existing paral-
lel corpora to bootstrap data for new language
pairs. First, we extend existing parallel cor-
pora using co-training, wherein machine trans-
lations are selectively added to training corpora
with multiple source texts. Retraining transla-
tion models yields modest improvements. Sec-
ond, we simulate the creation of training data
for a language pair for which a parallel corpus
is not available. Starting with no human trans-
lations from German to English we produce a
German to English translation model with 45%
accuracy using parallel corpora in other lan-
guages. This suggests the method may be use-
ful in the creation of parallel corpora for lan-
guages with scarce resources.
