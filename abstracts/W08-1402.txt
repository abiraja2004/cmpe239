 
We report on research on matching 
names in different scripts across languag-
es. We explore two trainable approaches 
based on comparing pronunciations. The 
first, a cross-lingual approach, uses an 
automatic name-matching program that 
exploits rules based on phonological 
comparisons of the two languages carried 
out by humans. The second, monolingual 
approach, relies only on automatic com-
parison of the phonological representa-
tions of each pair. Alignments produced 
by each approach are fed to a machine 
learning algorithm. Results show that the 
monolingual approach results in ma-
chine-learning based comparison of per-
son-names in English and Chinese at an 
accuracy of over 97.0 F-measure.
