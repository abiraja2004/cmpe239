The 2013 Association for Computational
Linguistics MultiLing Pilot posed a task
to measure the performance of multi-
lingual, single-document, summarization
systems using a dataset derived from many
Wikipedias. The objective of the pilot
was to assess automatic summarization of
multilingual text documents outside the
news domain and the potential of using
Wikipedia articles for such research. This
report describes the pilot task, the dataset,
the methods used to evaluate the submitted
summaries, and the overall performance of
each participant?s system.
