 
We introduce a new method of feature selec-
tion for text categorization. Our MMR-based 
feature selection method strives to reduce re-
dundancy between features while maintaining 
information gain in selecting appropriate fea-
tures for text categorization. Empirical results 
show that MMR-based feature selection is 
more effective than Koller & Sahami?s 
method, which is one of greedy feature selec-
tion methods, and conventional information 
gain which is commonly used in feature selec-
tion for text categorization. Moreover, MMR-
based feature selection sometimes produces 
some improvements of conventional machine 
learning algorithms over SVM which is 
known to give the best classification accuracy.
