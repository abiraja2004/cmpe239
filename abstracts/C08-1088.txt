This paper proposes a new approach to 
dynamically determine the tree span for 
tree kernel-based semantic relation ex-
traction. It exploits constituent dependen-
cies to keep the nodes and their head 
children along the path connecting the 
two entities, while removing the noisy in-
formation from the syntactic parse tree, 
eventually leading to a dynamic syntactic 
parse tree. This paper also explores entity 
features and their combined features in a 
unified parse and semantic tree, which in-
tegrates both structured syntactic parse 
information and entity-related semantic 
information. Evaluation on the ACE 
RDC 2004 corpus shows that our dy-
namic syntactic parse tree outperforms all 
previous tree spans, and the composite 
kernel combining this tree kernel with a 
linear state-of-the-art feature-based ker-
nel, achieves the so far best performance.
