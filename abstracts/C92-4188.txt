 
In this paper, we report on a large-scale conversion 
experiment with on-line valency dictionaries. A 
linguistically motivated valency dictionary in Prolog is 
converted into a valency dictionary for a large-scale 
machine translation system. Several aspects of the two 
dictionaries and their backgroand projects are discussed, 
as well as the way their representations are mapped. "/'he 
results of the conversion are looked at from an economic 
perspective (fast coding for NLP), and also from a 
computational-lexicographic perspective (requirements 
for conversions and for standardization of lexicon 
information).
