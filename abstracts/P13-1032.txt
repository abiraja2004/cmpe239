In this paper, we propose a novel re-
ordering model based on sequence label-
ing techniques. Our model converts the
reordering problem into a sequence label-
ing problem, i.e. a tagging task. Results
on five Chinese-English NIST tasks show
that our model improves the baseline sys-
tem by 1.32 BLEU and 1.53 TER on av-
erage. Results of comparative study with
other seven widely used reordering mod-
els will also be reported.
