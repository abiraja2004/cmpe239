We propose a novel approach to sentiment
analysis for a low resource setting. The in-
tuition behind this work is that sentiment
expressed towards an entity, targeted senti-
ment, may be viewed as a span of sentiment
expressed across the entity. This represen-
tation allows us to model sentiment detec-
tion as a sequence tagging problem, jointly
discovering people and organizations along
with whether there is sentiment directed to-
wards them. We compare performance in
both Spanish and English on microblog data,
using only a sentiment lexicon as an exter-
nal resource. By leveraging linguistically-
informed features within conditional random
fields (CRFs) trained to minimize empiri-
cal risk, our best models in Spanish signifi-
cantly outperform a strong baseline, and reach
around 90% accuracy on the combined task of
named entity recognition and sentiment pre-
diction. Our models in English, trained on a
much smaller dataset, are not yet statistically
significant against their baselines.
