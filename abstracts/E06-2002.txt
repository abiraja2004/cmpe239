This paper describes a multi-lingual
phrase-based Statistical Machine Transla-
tion system accessible by means of a Web
page. The user can issue translation re-
quests from Arabic, Chinese or Spanish
into English. The same phrase-based sta-
tistical technology is employed to realize
the three supported language-pairs. New
language-pairs can be easily added to the
demonstrator. The Web-based interface al-
lows the use of the translation system to
any computer connected to the Internet.
