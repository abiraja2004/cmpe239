 
A noun-compound is a compressed 
proposition that requires an audience to 
recover the implicit relationship between 
two concepts that are expressed as nouns. 
Listeners recover this relationship by 
considering the most typical relations 
afforded by each concept. These 
relational possibilities are evident at a 
linguistic level in the syntagmatic 
patterns that connect nouns to the verbal 
actions that act upon, or are facilitated 
by, these nouns. We present a model of 
noun-compound interpretation that first 
learns the relational possibilities for 
individual nouns from corpora, and 
which then uses these to hypothesize 
about the most likely relationship that 
underpins a noun compound.
