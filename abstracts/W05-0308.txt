This paper describes extensions to a corpus
annotation scheme for the manual annotation
of attributions, as well as opinions, emotions,
sentiments, speculations, evaluations and other
private states in language. It discusses the
scheme with respect to the ?Pie in the Sky?
Check List of Desirable Semantic Information
for Annotation. We believe that the scheme is a
good foundation for adding private state anno-
tations to other layers of semantic meaning.
