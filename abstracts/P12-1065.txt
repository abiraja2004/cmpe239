Bootstrapping a classifier from a small set
of seed rules can be viewed as the propaga-
tion of labels between examples via features
shared between them. This paper introduces a
novel variant of the Yarowsky algorithm based
on this view. It is a bootstrapping learning
method which uses a graph propagation algo-
rithm with a well defined objective function.
The experimental results show that our pro-
posed bootstrapping algorithm achieves state
of the art performance or better on several dif-
ferent natural language data sets.
