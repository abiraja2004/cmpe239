 
In this paper we present an application 
fostering the integration and interopera-
bility of computational lexicons, focusing 
on the particular case of mutual linking 
and cross-lingual enrichment of two wor-
dnets, the ItalWordNet and Sinica BOW 
lexicons. This is intended as a case-study 
investigating the needs and requirements 
of semi-automatic integration and inter-
operability of lexical resources.
