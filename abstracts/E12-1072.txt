In pro-drop languages, the detection of
explicit subjects, zero subjects and non-
referential impersonal constructions is cru-
cial for anaphora and co-reference resolu-
tion. While the identification of explicit
and zero subjects has attracted the atten-
tion of researchers in the past, the auto-
matic identification of impersonal construc-
tions in Spanish has not been addressed yet
and this work is the first such study. In
this paper we present a corpus to under-
pin research on the automatic detection of
these linguistic phenomena in Spanish and
a novel machine learning-based methodol-
ogy for their computational treatment. This
study also provides an analysis of the fea-
tures, discusses performance across two
different genres and offers error analysis.
The evaluation results show that our system
performs better in detecting explicit sub-
jects than alternative systems.
