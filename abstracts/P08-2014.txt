This paper introduces a new method for
identifying named-entity (NE) transliterations
within bilingual corpora. Current state-of-the-
art approaches usually require annotated data
and relevant linguistic knowledge which may
not be available for all languages. We show
how to effectively train an accurate transliter-
ation classifier using very little data, obtained
automatically. To perform this task, we intro-
duce a new active sampling paradigm for guid-
ing and adapting the sample selection process.
We also investigate how to improve the clas-
sifier by identifying repeated patterns in the
training data. We evaluated our approach us-
ing English, Russian and Hebrew corpora.
