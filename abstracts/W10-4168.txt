 
This paper describes a character-based 
Chinese word sense induction (WSI) sys-
tem for the International Chinese Lan-
guage Processing Bakeoff 2010. By 
computing the longest common sub-
strings between any two contexts of the 
ambiguous word, our system extracts 
collocations as features and does not de-
pend on any extra tools, such as Chinese 
word segmenters. We also design a con-
strained clustering algorithm for this task. 
Experiemental results show that our sys-
tem could achieve 69.88 scores of 
FScore on the development data set of 
SIGHAN Bakeoff 2010.
