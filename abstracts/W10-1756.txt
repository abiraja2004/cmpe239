We present a unified approach to perform-
ing minimum risk training and minimum
Bayes risk (MBR) decoding with BLEU
in a phrase-based model. Key to our ap-
proach is the use of a Gibbs sampler that
allows us to explore the entire probabil-
ity distribution and maintain a strict prob-
abilistic formulation across the pipeline.
We also describe a new sampling algo-
rithm called corpus sampling which al-
lows us at training time to use BLEU in-
stead of an approximation thereof. Our
approach is theoretically sound and gives
better (up to +0.6%BLEU) and more sta-
ble results than the standard MERT opti-
mization algorithm. By comparing our ap-
proach to lattice MBR, we are also able to
gain crucial insights about both methods.
