We present WebAnno, a general pur-
pose web-based annotation tool for a wide
range of linguistic annotations. Web-
Anno offers annotation project manage-
ment, freely configurable tagsets and the
management of users in different roles.
WebAnno uses modern web technology
for visualizing and editing annotations in
a web browser. It supports arbitrarily
large documents, pluggable import/export
filters, the curation of annotations across
various users, and an interface to farming
out annotations to a crowdsourcing plat-
form. Currently WebAnno allows part-of-
speech, named entity, dependency parsing
and co-reference chain annotations. The
architecture design allows adding addi-
tional modes of visualization and editing,
when new kinds of annotations are to be
supported.
