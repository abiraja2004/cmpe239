Common approaches to assessing docu-
ment quality look at shallow aspects, such
as grammar and vocabulary. For many
real-world applications, deeper notions of
quality are needed. This work represents
a first step in a project aimed at devel-
oping computational methods for deep as-
sessment of quality in the domain of intel-
ligence reports. We present an automated
system for ranking intelligence reports
with regard to coverage of relevant mate-
rial. The system employs methodologies
from the field of automatic summarization,
and achieves performance on a par with
human judges, even in the absence of the
underlying information sources.
