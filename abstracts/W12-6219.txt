Minimum Error Rate Training (MERT) is a
method for training the parameters of a log-
linear model. One advantage of this method
of training is that it can use the large num-
ber of hypotheses encoded in a translation lat-
tice as training data. We demonstrate that the
MERT line optimisation can be modelled as
computing the shortest distance in a weighted
finite-state transducer using a tropical polyno-
mial semiring.
