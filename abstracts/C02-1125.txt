  
We propose a novel measure of the 
representativeness (i.e., indicativeness or topic 
specificity) of a term in a given corpus. The 
measure embodies the idea that the distribution 
of words co-occurring with a representative term 
should be biased according to the word 
distribution in the whole corpus. The bias of the 
word distribution in the co-occurring words is 
defined as the number of distinct words whose 
occurrences are saliently biased in the 
co-occurring words. The saliency of a word is 
defined by a threshold probability that can be 
automatically defined using the whole corpus. 
Comparative evaluation clarified that the 
measure is clearly superior to conventional 
measures in finding topic-specific words in the 
newspaper archives of different sizes.
