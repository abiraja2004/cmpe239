News on electrical bulletin boards con-
sist of high density expressions. Many
sentences end with unique expressions
that consist of nouns and case parti-
cles. This paper focuses on expressions
used at the end of sentences and at-
tempts to summarize them by forming
noun or case particle endings. We sum-
marize the news sentence through pat-
tern matching approach. Our evalua-
tion illustrates that the summarizer re-
duces 2.50 characters per sentence on
average; the reduction ratio is 6%. We
also show that people perceive the cor-
rect meanings of the summarized sen-
tences with 95% accuracy.
