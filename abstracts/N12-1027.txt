A tree transformation is sensible if the size of
each output tree is uniformly bounded by a
linear function in the size of the correspond-
ing input tree. Every sensible tree transfor-
mation computed by an arbitrary weighted ex-
tended top-down tree transducer can also be
computed by a weighted multi bottom-up tree
transducer. This further motivates weighted
multi bottom-up tree transducers as suitable
translation models for syntax-based machine
translation.
