Understanding language requires both linguis-
tic knowledge and knowledge about how the
world works, also known as common-sense
knowledge. We attempt to characterize the
kinds of common-sense knowledge most often
involved in recognizing textual entailments.
We identify 20 categories of common-sense
knowledge that are prevalent in textual entail-
ment, many of which have received scarce at-
tention from researchers building collections
of knowledge.
