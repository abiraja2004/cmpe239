 
We compare the phenomena of clausal coor-dinate ellipsis in Estonian, a Finno-Ugric lan-guage, and German, an Indo-European lan-guage. The rules underlying these phenomena appear to be remarkably similar. Thus, the software module ELLEIPO, which was origi-nally developed to generate clausal coordi-nate ellipsis in German and Dutch, works for Estonian as well. In order to extend ELLEIPO?s coverage to Estonian, we only had to adapt the lexicon and some syntax rules unrelated to coordination. We describe the language-independent rules for coordinate el-lipsis that ELLEIPO applies to non-elliptical syntactic structures in both target languages. 1
