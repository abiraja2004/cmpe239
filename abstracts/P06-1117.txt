This article describes a robust seman-
tic parser that uses a broad knowledge
base created by interconnecting three ma-
jor resources: FrameNet, VerbNet and
PropBank. The FrameNet corpus con-
tains the examples annotated with seman-
tic roles whereas the VerbNet lexicon pro-
vides the knowledge about the syntac-
tic behavior of the verbs. We connect
VerbNet and FrameNet by mapping the
FrameNet frames to the VerbNet Intersec-
tive Levin classes. The PropBank corpus,
which is tightly connected to the VerbNet
lexicon, is used to increase the verb cov-
erage and also to test the effectiveness of
our approach. The results indicate that our
model is an interesting step towards the
design of more robust semantic parsers.
