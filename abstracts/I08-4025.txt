This paper proposes the use of global fea-
tures for Chinese word segmentation. These
global features are combined with local fea-
tures using the averaged perceptron algo-
rithm over N-best candidate word segmenta-
tions. The N-best candidates are produced
using a conditional random field (CRF)
character-based tagger for word segmenta-
tion. Our experiments show that by adding
global features, performance is significantly
improved compared to the character-based
CRF tagger. Performance is also improved
compared to using only local features. Our
system obtains an F-score of 0.9355 on the
CityU corpus, 0.9263 on the CKIP corpus,
0.9512 on the SXU corpus, 0.9296 on the
NCC corpus and 0.9501 on the CTB cor-
pus. All results are for the closed track in
the fourth SIGHAN Chinese Word Segmen-
tation Bakeoff.
