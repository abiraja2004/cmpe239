This paper describes our system for syn-
tactic and semantic dependency parsing
to participate the shared task of CoNLL-
2008. We use a pipeline approach, in
which syntactic dependency parsing, word
sense disambiguation, and semantic role
labeling are performed separately: Syn-
tactic dependency parsing is performed
by a tournament model with a support
vector machine; word sense disambigua-
tion is performed by a nearest neighbour
method in a compressed feature space by
probabilistic latent semantic indexing; and
semantic role labeling is performed by
a an online passive-aggressive algorithm.
The submitted result was 79.10 macro-
average F1 for the joint task, 87.18% syn-
tactic dependencies LAS, and 70.84 se-
mantic dependencies F1. After the dead-
line, we constructed the other configura-
tion, which achieved 80.89 F1 for the joint
task, and 74.53 semantic dependencies F1.
The result shows that the configuration of
pipeline is a crucial issue in the task.
