The CoNLL-2013 shared task focuses on
correcting grammatical errors in essays
written by non-native learners of English.
In this paper, we describe the University
of Illinois system that participated in the
shared task. The system consists of five
components and targets five types of com-
mon grammatical mistakes made by En-
glish as Second Language writers. We de-
scribe our underlying approach, which re-
lates to our previous work, and describe
the novel aspects of the system in more de-
tail. Out of 17 participating teams, our sys-
tem is ranked first based on both the orig-
inal annotation and on the revised annota-
tion.
