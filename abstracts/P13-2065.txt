Current translation models are mainly de-
signed for languages with limited mor-
phology, which are not readily applicable
to agglutinative languages as the differ-
ence in the way lexical forms are gener-
ated. In this paper, we propose a nov-
el approach for translating agglutinative
languages by treating stems and affixes
differently. We employ stem as the atomic
translation unit to alleviate data spare-
ness. In addition, we associate each stem-
granularity translation rule with a distri-
bution of related affixes, and select desir-
able rules according to the similarity of
their affix distributions with given spans to
be translated. Experimental results show
that our approach significantly improves
the translation performance on tasks of
translating from three Turkic languages to
Chinese.
