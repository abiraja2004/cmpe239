 
Machine translation oflocative prepositions is 
not straightforward, even between closely re- 
lated languages. This paper discusses a sys- 
tem of translation of locative prepositions be- 
tween English and French. The system is 
based on the premises that English and French 
do not always conceptualize objects in the 
same way, and that this accounts for the major 
differences in the ways that locative preposi- 
tions are used in these languages. This paper 
introduces knowledge representations of con- 
ceptualizations of objects, and a method for 
translating prepositions based on these con- 
ceptual representations.
