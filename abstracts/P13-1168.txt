Query segmentation, like text chunking,
is the first step towards query understand-
ing. In this study, we explore the effec-
tiveness of crowdsourcing for this task.
Through carefully designed control ex-
periments and Inter Annotator Agreement
metrics for analysis of experimental data,
we show that crowdsourcing may not be a
suitable approach for query segmentation
because the crowd seems to have a very
strong bias towards dividing the query into
roughly equal (often only two) parts. Sim-
ilarly, in the case of hierarchical or nested
segmentation, turkers have a strong prefer-
ence towards balanced binary trees.
