 
Two classifiers -- Support Vector Machine 
(SVM) and Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) are 
applied here for the recognition of biomedical 
named entities. According to their different 
characteristics, the results of two classifiers are 
merged to achieve better performance. We propose 
an automatic corpus expansion method for SVM 
and CRF to overcome the shortage of the annotated 
training data. In addition, we incorporate a 
keyword-based post-processing step to deal with 
the remaining problems such as assigning an 
appropriate named entity tag to the word/phrase 
containing parentheses.
