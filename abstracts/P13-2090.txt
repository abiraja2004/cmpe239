We study subjective language in social
media and create Twitter-specific lexi-
cons via bootstrapping sentiment-bearing
terms from multilingual Twitter streams.
Starting with a domain-independent, high-
precision sentiment lexicon and a large
pool of unlabeled data, we bootstrap
Twitter-specific sentiment lexicons, us-
ing a small amount of labeled data to
guide the process. Our experiments on
English, Spanish and Russian show that
the resulting lexicons are effective for
sentiment classification for many under-
explored languages in social media.
