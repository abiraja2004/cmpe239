We propose a non-humanlike spoken di-
alogue design, which consists of two el-
ements: non-humanlike turn-taking and
non-humanlike acknowledgment. Two ex-
perimental studies are reported in this pa-
per. The first study shows that the pro-
posed non-humanlike spoken dialogue de-
sign is effective for reducing speech colli-
sions. It also presents pieces of evidence
that show quick humanlike turn-taking is
less important in spoken dialogue system
design. The second study supports a hy-
pothesis found in the first study that user
preference on response timing varies de-
pending on interaction patterns. Upon re-
ceiving these results, this paper suggests a
practical design guideline for spoken dia-
logue systems.
