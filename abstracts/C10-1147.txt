A large body of prior research on coref-
erence resolution recasts the problem as
a two-class classification problem. How-
ever, standard supervised machine learn-
ing algorithms that minimize classifica-
tion errors on the training instances do not
always lead to maximizing the F-measure
of the chosen evaluation metric for coref-
erence resolution. In this paper, we pro-
pose a novel approach comprising the use
of instance weighting and beam search to
maximize the evaluation metric score on
the training corpus during training. Ex-
perimental results show that this approach
achieves significant improvement over the
state-of-the-art. We report results on stan-
dard benchmark corpora (two MUC cor-
pora and three ACE corpora), when evalu-
ated using the link-based MUC metric and
the mention-based B-CUBED metric.
