In this paper, we present an evaluation of the
Link Grammar parser on a corpus consisting
of sentences describing protein-protein interac-
tions. We introduce the notion of an interac-
tion subgraph, which is the subgraph of a de-
pendency graph expressing a protein-protein in-
teraction. We measure the performance of the
parser for recovery of dependencies, fully correct
linkages and interaction subgraphs. We analyze
the causes of parser failure and report specific
causes of error, and identify potential modifica-
tions to the grammar to address the identified
issues. We also report and discuss the effect of
an extension to the dictionary of the parser.
