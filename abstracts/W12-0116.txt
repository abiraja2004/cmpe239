In this paper, we present our linguistically-
augmented statistical machine translation
model from Bulgarian to English, which
combines a statistical machine translation
(SMT) system (as backbone) with deep lin-
guistic features (as factors). The motiva-
tion is to take advantages of the robust-
ness of the SMT system and the linguis-
tic knowledge of morphological analysis
and the hand-crafted grammar through sys-
tem combination approach. The prelimi-
nary evaluation has shown very promising
results in terms of BLEU scores (38.85) and
the manual analysis also confirms the high
quality of the translation the system deliv-
ers.
