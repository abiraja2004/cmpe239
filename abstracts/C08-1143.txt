 
This paper addresses two issues of active 
learning. Firstly, to solve a problem of 
uncertainty sampling that it often fails by 
selecting outliers, this paper presents a 
new selective sampling technique, sam-
pling by uncertainty and density (SUD), 
in which a k-Nearest-Neighbor-based 
density measure is adopted to determine 
whether an unlabeled example is an out-
lier. Secondly, a technique of sampling 
by clustering (SBC) is applied to build a 
representative initial training data set for 
active learning. Finally, we implement a 
new algorithm of active learning with 
SUD and SBC techniques. The experi-
mental results from three real-world data 
sets show that our method outperforms 
competing methods, particularly at the 
early stages of active learning.
