This work applies boosted wrapper induction
(BWI), a machine learning algorithm for informa-
tion extraction from semi-structured documents, to
the problem of named entity recognition. The de-
fault feature set of BWI is augmented with features
based on distributional term clusters induced from a
large unlabeled text corpus. Using no traditional lin-
guistic resources, such as syntactic tags or special-
purpose gazetteers, this approach yields results near
the state of the art in the MUC 6 named entity do-
main. Supervised learning using features derived
through unsupervised corpus analysis may be re-
garded as an alternative to bootstrapping methods.
