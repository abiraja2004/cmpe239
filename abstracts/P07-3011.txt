The aim of this paper is to present a new
method for identifying linguistic structure in
the aggregate analysis of the language vari-
ation. The method consists of extracting the
most frequent sound correspondences from
the aligned transcriptions of words. Based
on the extracted correspondences every site
is compared to all other sites, and a corre-
spondence index is calculated for each site.
This method enables us to identify sound al-
ternations responsible for dialect divisions
and to measure the extent to which each al-
ternation is responsible for the divisions ob-
tained by the aggregate analysis.
