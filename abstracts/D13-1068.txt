Recently, much research focuses on event s-
toryline generation, which aims to produce a
concise, global and temporal event summary
from a collection of articles. Generally, each
event contains multiple sub-events and the sto-
ryline should be composed by the componen-
t summaries of all the sub-events. However,
different sub-events have different part-whole
relationship with the major event, which is
important to correspond to users? interests
but seldom considered in previous work. To
distinguish different types of sub-events, we
propose a mixture-event-aspect model which
models different sub-events into local and
global aspects. Combining these local/global
aspects with summarization requirements to-
gether, we utilize an optimization method to
generate the component summaries along the
timeline. We develop experimental systems on
6 distinctively different datasets. Evaluation
and comparison results indicate the effective-
ness of our proposed method.
