This paper presents suggested semantic representations for different types
of referring expressions in the format of Minimal Recursion Semantics
and sketches syntactic analyses which can create them compositionally.
We explore cross-linguistic harmonization of these representations, to
promote interoperability and reusability of linguistic analyses. We follow
Borthen and Haugereid (2005) in positing COG-ST (?cognitive status?)
as a feature on the syntax-semantics interface to handle phenomena as-
sociated with definiteness. Our proposal helps to unify the treatments of
definiteness markers, demonstratives, overt pronouns and null anaphora
across languages. In languages with articles, they contribute an existen-
tial quantifier and the appropriate value for COG-ST. In other languages,
the COG-ST value is determined by an affix. The contribution of demon-
strative determiners is decomposed into a COG-ST value, a quantifier,
and proximity information, each of which can be contributed by a dif-
ferent kind of grammatical construction in a given language. Along with
COG-ST, we posit a feature that distinguishes between pronouns (and
null anaphora) that are sensitive to the identity of the referent of their
antecedent and those that are sensitive to its type.
