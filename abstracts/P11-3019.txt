Turkish is an agglutinative language with
complex morphological structures, therefore
using only word forms is not enough for many
computational tasks. In this paper we an-
alyze the effect of morphology in a Named
Entity Recognition system for Turkish. We
start with the standard word-level representa-
tion and incrementally explore the effect of
capturing syntactic and contextual properties
of tokens. Furthermore, we also explore a new
representation in which roots and morphologi-
cal features are represented as separate tokens
instead of representing only words as tokens.
Using syntactic and contextual properties with
the new representation provide an 7.6% rela-
tive improvement over the baseline.
