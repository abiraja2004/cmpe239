We present a method for lexical simplifica-
tion. Simplification rules are learned from a
comparable corpus, and the rules are applied
in a context-aware fashion to input sentences.
Our method is unsupervised. Furthermore, it
does not require any alignment or correspon-
dence among the complex and simple corpora.
We evaluate the simplification according to
three criteria: preservation of grammaticality,
preservation of meaning, and degree of sim-
plification. Results show that our method out-
performs an established simplification base-
line for both meaning preservation and sim-
plification, while maintaining a high level of
grammaticality.
