This paper describes the systems submitted by
Avaya Labs (AVAYA) to SemEval-2013 Task
2 - Sentiment Analysis in Twitter. For the
constrained conditions of both the message
polarity classification and contextual polarity
disambiguation subtasks, our approach cen-
ters on training high-dimensional, linear clas-
sifiers with a combination of lexical and syn-
tactic features. The constrained message po-
larity model is then used to tag nearly half
a million unlabeled tweets. These automati-
cally labeled data are used for two purposes:
1) to discover prior polarities of words and
2) to provide additional training examples for
self-training. Our systems performed compet-
itively, placing in the top five for all subtasks
and data conditions. More importantly, these
results show that expanding the polarity lexi-
con and augmenting the training data with un-
labeled tweets can yield improvements in pre-
cision and recall in classifying the polarity of
non-neutral messages and contexts.
