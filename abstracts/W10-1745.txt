This paper describes the CMU entry for
the system combination shared task at
WMT?10. Our combination method is hy-
pothesis selection, which uses information
from n-best lists from the input MT sys-
tems, where available. The sentence level
features used are independent from the
MT systems involved. Compared to the
baseline we added source-to-target word
alignment based features and trained sys-
tem weights to our feature set. We com-
bined MT systems for French - English
and German - English using provided data
only.
