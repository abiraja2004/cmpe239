Without  lengthy,  iterative  refinement  of 
guidelines, and equally lengthy and itera-
tive training of annotators, the level of in-
ter-subjective agreement on simple tasks 
of  phonetic,  phonological,  syntactic,  se-
mantic,  and  pragmatic  annotation  is 
shockingly low.
This is a significant practical problem in 
speech  and  language  technology,  but  it 
poses questions  of  interest  to psycholo-
gists, philosophers of language, and theo-
retical linguists as well.
