We propose a joint model for unsuper-
vised induction of sentiment, aspect and
discourse information and show that by in-
corporating a notion of latent discourse re-
lations in the model, we improve the pre-
diction accuracy for aspect and sentiment
polarity on the sub-sentential level. We
deviate from the traditional view of dis-
course, as we induce types of discourse re-
lations and associated discourse cues rel-
evant to the considered opinion analysis
task; consequently, the induced discourse
relations play the role of opinion and as-
pect shifters. The quantitative analysis that
we conducted indicated that the integra-
tion of a discourse model increased the
prediction accuracy results with respect to
the discourse-agnostic approach and the
qualitative analysis suggests that the in-
duced representations encode a meaning-
ful discourse structure.
