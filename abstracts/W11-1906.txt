In this paper, we describe a machine learn-
ing system based on rule and tree ensembles
for unrestricted coreference resolution. We
use Entropy Guided Transformation Learning
(ETL) and Decision Trees as the base learners,
and, respectively, ETL Committee and Ran-
dom Forest as ensemble algorithms. Our sys-
tem is evaluated on the closed track of the
CoNLL 2011 shared task: Modeling Unre-
stricted Coreference in OntoNotes. A prelim-
inary version of our system achieves the 6th
best score out of 21 competitors in the CoNLL
2011 shared task. Here, we depict the system
architecture and our experimental results and
findings.
