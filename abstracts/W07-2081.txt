This paper describes a system for classify-
ing semantic relations among nominals, as
in SemEval task 4. This system uses a
corpus of 2,500 compounds annotated with
WordNet senses and covering 139 different
semantic relations. Given a set of nomi-
nal pairs for training, as provided in the Se-
mEval task 4 training data, this system con-
structs for each training pair a set of features
made up of relations and WordNet sense
pairs which occurred with those nominals
in the corpus. A Naive Bayes learning al-
gorithm learns associations between these
features and relation membership categories.
The identification of relations among nomi-
nals in test items takes place on the basis of
these associations.
