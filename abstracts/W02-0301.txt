We explore the use of Support Vector Ma-
chines (SVMs) for biomedical named en-
tity recognition. To make the SVM train-
ing with the available largest corpus ? the
GENIA corpus ? tractable, we propose to
split the non-entity class into sub-classes,
using part-of-speech information. In ad-
dition, we explore new features such as
word cache and the states of an HMM
trained by unsupervised learning. Experi-
ments on the GENIA corpus show that our
class splitting technique not only enables
the training with the GENIA corpus but
also improves the accuracy. The proposed
new features also contribute to improve
the accuracy. We compare our SVM-
based recognition system with a system
using Maximum Entropy tagging method.
