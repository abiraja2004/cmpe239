 
As part of DARPA's Strategic Computing Program, we have moved a large natural 
language system out of the laboratory. This involved: 
o Delivery of knowledge acquis i t ion  software to the Naval Ocean Systems 
Center  (NOSC) to build l inguist ic knowledge bases, such as d ic t ionary  ent r ies  
and case frames, 
o Demonstrat ion of the natura l  language in ter face  in a naval  dec is ion -mak ing  
sett ing,  and 
o Del ivery of the in ter face  software to Texas Instruments,  which has in tegrated  
it into the total  software package of the Strategic  Computing Fleet Command 
Center  Battle Management Program (FCCBMP). 
The resu l t ing  natura l  language in ter face  will be del ivered to the Pacif ic Fleet Command 
Center in Hawaii. 
This paper  is an overview of th is  ef fort  in technology t rans fer ,  indicat ing the 
techno logy  features  that  have made this possible and ref lect ing upon what the 
exper ience  i l lust rates  regard ing t ranspor tab i l i ty ,  techno logy status ,  and del ivery of 
natura l  language process ing outs ide of a laboratory  sett ing. The paper  will be most 
va luable to those engaged in applying s ta te -o f - the -ar t  techn iques  to del iver natura l  
language in ter faces  and to those  in teres ted  in developing the next  generat ion  of 
complete natura l  language in ter faces .
