We present a simple yet powerful hier-
archical search algorithm for automatic
word alignment. Our algorithm induces
a forest of alignments from which we
can efficiently extract a ranked k-best list.
We score a given alignment within the
forest with a flexible, linear discrimina-
tive model incorporating hundreds of fea-
tures, and trained on a relatively small
amount of annotated data. We report re-
sults on Arabic-English word alignment
and translation tasks. Our model out-
performs a GIZA++ Model-4 baseline by
6.3 points in F-measure, yielding a 1.1
BLEU score increase over a state-of-the-art
syntax-based machine translation system.
