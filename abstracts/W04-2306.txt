GEMINI (Generic Environment for Multilin-
gual Interactive Natural Interfaces) is an EC
funded research project, which has two main
objectives: First, the development of a flexible
platform able to produce user-friendly interac-
tive multilingual and multi-modal dialogue in-
terfaces to databases with a minimum of hu-
man effort, and, second, the demonstration of
the platform?s efficiency through the develop-
ment of two different applications based on this
platform: EG-Banking, a voice-portal for high-
quality interactions for bank customers, and
CitizenCare, an e-government platform frame-
work for citizen-to-administration interaction
which are available for spoken and web-based
user interaction.
