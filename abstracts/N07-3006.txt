Previous work on discourse parsing has
mostly relied on surface syntactic and lex-
ical features; the use of semantics is lim-
ited to shallow semantics. The goal of this
thesis is to exploit event semantics in order
to build discourse parse trees (DPT) based
on informational rhetorical relations. Our
work employs an Inductive Logic Pro-
gramming (ILP) based rhetorical relation
classifier, a Neural Network based dis-
course segmenter, a bottom-up sentence
level discourse parser and a shift-reduce
document level discourse parser.
