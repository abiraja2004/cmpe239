This paper describes the Cambridge Uni-
versity Engineering Department submis-
sion to the Fifth Workshop on Statistical
Machine Translation. We report results for
the French-English and Spanish-English
shared translation tasks in both directions.
The CUED system is based on HiFST, a
hierarchical phrase-based decoder imple-
mented using weighted finite-state trans-
ducers. In the French-English task, we
investigate the use of context-dependent
alignment models. We also show that
lattice minimum Bayes-risk decoding is
an effective framework for multi-source
translation, leading to large gains in BLEU
score.
