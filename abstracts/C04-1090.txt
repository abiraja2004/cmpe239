 
We propose a path-based transfer model for 
machine translation. The model is trained with 
a word-aligned parallel corpus where the 
source language sentences are parsed. The 
training algorithm extracts a set of transfer 
rules and their probabilities from the training 
corpus. A rule translates a path in the source 
language dependency tree into a fragment in 
the target dependency tree. The problem of 
finding the most probable translation becomes 
a graph-theoretic problem of finding the 
minimum path covering of the source 
language dependency tree.
