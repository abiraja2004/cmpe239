Most sentiment analysis approaches use as
baseline a support vector machines (SVM)
classifier with binary unigram weights.
In this paper, we explore whether more
sophisticated feature weighting schemes
from Information Retrieval can enhance
classification accuracy. We show that vari-
ants of the classic tf.idf scheme adapted
to sentiment analysis provide significant
increases in accuracy, especially when us-
ing a sublinear function for term frequency
weights and document frequency smooth-
ing. The techniques are tested on a wide
selection of data sets and produce the best
accuracy to our knowledge.
