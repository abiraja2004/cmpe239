This paper addresses two previously unresolved is-
sues in the automatic evaluation of Text Structuring
(TS) in Natural Language Generation (NLG). First,
we describe how to verify the generality of an exist-
ing collection of sentence orderings defined by one
domain expert using data provided by additional
experts. Second, a general evaluation methodol-
ogy is outlined which investigates the previously
unaddressed possibility that there may exist many
optimal solutions for TS in the employed domain.
This methodology is implemented in a set of ex-
periments which identify the most promising can-
didate for TS among several metrics of coherence
previously suggested in the literature.1
