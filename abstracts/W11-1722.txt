The aim of this paper is to present an ap-
proach to tackle the task of opinion question
answering and text summarization. Follow-
ing the guidelines TAC 2008 Opinion Sum-
marization Pilot task, we propose new meth-
ods for each of the major components of the
process. In particular, for the information
retrieval, opinion mining and summarization
stages. The performance obtained improves
with respect to the state of the art by approxi-
mately 12.50%, thus concluding that the sug-
gested approaches for these three components
are adequate.
