We present an extension of the DUALIST
tool that enables social scientists to engage
directly with large Twitter datasets. Our
approach supports collaborative construc-
tion of classifiers and associated gold stan-
dard data sets. The tool can be used to
build classifier cascades that decomposes
tweet streams, and provide analysis of tar-
geted conversations. A central concern is
to provide an environment in which social
science researchers can rapidly develop an
informed sense of what the datasets look
like. The intent is that they develop, not
only an informed view as to how the data
could be fruitfully analysed, but also how
feasible it is to analyse it in that way.
