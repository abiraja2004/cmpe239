In this paper we investigate the auto-
matic generation and evaluation of senten-
tial paraphrases. We describe a method
for generating sentential paraphrases by
using a large aligned monolingual cor-
pus of news headlines acquired automat-
ically from Google News and a stan-
dard Phrase-Based Machine Translation
(PBMT) framework. The output of this
system is compared to a word substitu-
tion baseline. Human judges prefer the
PBMT paraphrasing system over the word
substitution system. We demonstrate that
BLEU correlates well with human judge-
ments provided that the generated para-
phrased sentence is sufficiently different
from the source sentence.
