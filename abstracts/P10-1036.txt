We propose a novel self-training method
for a parser which uses a lexicalised gram-
mar and supertagger, focusing on increas-
ing the speed of the parser rather than
its accuracy. The idea is to train the su-
pertagger on large amounts of parser out-
put, so that the supertagger can learn to
supply the supertags that the parser will
eventually choose as part of the highest-
scoring derivation. Since the supertag-
ger supplies fewer supertags overall, the
parsing speed is increased. We demon-
strate the effectiveness of the method us-
ing a CCG supertagger and parser, obtain-
ing significant speed increases on newspa-
per text with no loss in accuracy. We also
show that the method can be used to adapt
the CCG parser to new domains, obtain-
ing accuracy and speed improvements for
Wikipedia and biomedical text.
