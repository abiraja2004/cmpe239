 
This paper presents work on the task of con-
structing an example base1 from a given bi-
lingual corpus based on the annotation 
schema of Translation Corresponding Tree 
(TCT). Each TCT describes a translation ex-
ample (a pair of bilingual sentences). It repre-
sents the syntactic structure of source 
language sentence, and more importantly is 
the facility to specify the correspondences be-
tween string (both the source and target sen-
tences) and the representation tree. 
Furthermore, syntax transformation clues are 
also encapsulated at each node in the TCT 
representation to capture the differentiation of 
grammatical structure between the source and 
target languages. With this annotation 
schema, translation examples are effectively 
represented and organized in the bilingual 
knowledge database that we need for the Por-
tuguese to Chinese machine translation sys-
tem.
