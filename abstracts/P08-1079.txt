We present a novel framework for the dis-
covery and representation of general semantic
relationships that hold between lexical items.
We propose that each such relationship can be
identified with a cluster of patterns that cap-
tures this relationship. We give a fully unsu-
pervised algorithm for pattern cluster discov-
ery, which searches, clusters and merges high-
frequency words-based patterns around ran-
domly selected hook words. Pattern clusters
can be used to extract instances of the corre-
sponding relationships. To assess the quality
of discovered relationships, we use the pattern
clusters to automatically generate SAT anal-
ogy questions. We also compare to a set of
known relationships, achieving very good re-
sults in both methods. The evaluation (done
in both English and Russian) substantiates the
premise that our pattern clusters indeed reflect
relationships perceived by humans.
