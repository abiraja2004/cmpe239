 
This paper describes a Chinese part-of-
speech tagging system based on the maxi-
mum entropy model. It presents a novel 
two-stage approach to using the part-of-
speech tags of the words on both sides of 
the current word in Chinese part-of-speech 
tagging. The system is evaluated on four 
corpora at the Fourth SIGHAN Bakeoff in 
the close track of the Chinese part-of-
speech tagging task.
