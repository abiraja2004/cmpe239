Example-based machine translation (EBMT)
is a promising translation method for speech-
to-speech translation because of its robust-
ness. It retrieves example sentences similar to
the input and adjusts their translations to ob-
tain the output. However, it has problems in
that the performance degrades when input sen-
tences are long and when the style of inputs
and that of the example corpus are different.
This paper proposes a method for retrieving
?meaning-equivalent sentences? to overcome
these two problems. A meaning-equivalent
sentence shares the main meaning with an in-
put despite lacking some unimportant informa-
tion. The translations of meaning-equivalent
sentences correspond to ?rough translations.?
The retrieval is based on content words, modal-
ity, and tense.
