. This paper describes an automatic summarization approach
that constructs a summary by extracting the significant sentences. The
approach takes advantage of the cooccurrence relationships between
terms only in the document. The techniques used are principal compo-
nent analysis (PCA) to extract the significant terms and singular value
decompostion (SVD) to find out the significant sentences. The PCA can
quantify both the term frequency and term-term relationship in the doc-
ument by the eigenvalue-eigenvector pairs. And the sentence-term matrix
can be decomposed into the proper dimensional sentence-concentrated
and term-concentrated marices which are used for the Euclidean dis-
tances between the sentence and term vectors and also removed the noise
of variability in term usage by the SVD. Experimental results on Korean
newspaper articles show that the proposed method is to be preferred
over random selection of sentences or only PCA when summarization is
the goal.
