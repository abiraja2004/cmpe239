Classifying and identifying semantic re-
lations between facts and opinions on
the Web is of utmost importance for or-
ganizing information on the Web, how-
ever, this requires consideration of a
broader set of semantic relations than are
typically handled in Recognizing Tex-
tual Entailment (RTE), Cross-document
Structure Theory (CST), and similar
tasks. In this paper, we describe the con-
struction and evaluation of a system that
identifies and classifies semantic rela-
tions in Internet data. Our system targets
a set of semantic relations that have been
inspired by CST but that have been gen-
eralized and broadened to facilitate ap-
plication to mixed fact and opinion data
from the Internet. Our system identi-
fies these semantic relations in Japanese
Web texts using a combination of lexical,
syntactic, and semantic information and
evaluate our system against gold stan-
dard data that was manually constructed
for this task. We will release all gold
standard data used in training and eval-
uation of our system this summer.
