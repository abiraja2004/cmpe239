We compare vectors containing counts of
trigrams of part-of-speech (POS) tags in
order to obtain an aggregate measure of
syntax difference. Since lexical syntactic
categories reflect more abstract syntax as
well, we argue that this procedure reflects
more than just the basic syntactic cate-
gories. We tag the material automatically
and analyze the frequency vectors for POS
trigrams using a permutation test. A test
analysis of a 305,000 word corpus con-
taining the English of Finnish emigrants
to Australia is promising in that the proce-
dure proposed works well in distinguish-
ing two different groups (adult vs. child
emigrants) and also in highlighting syntac-
tic deviations between the two groups.
