In this paper, a Maximum Entropy Markov
Model (MEMM) for dialog state tracking
is proposed to efficiently handle user goal
evolvement in two steps. The system first
predicts the occurrence of a user goal change
based on linguistic features and dialog context
for each dialog turn, and then the proposed
model could utilize this user goal change in-
formation to infer the most probable dialog
state sequence which underlies the evolve-
ment of user goal during the dialog. It is
believed that with the suggested various do-
main independent feature functions, the pro-
posed model could better exploit not only the
intra-dependencies within long ASR N-best
lists but also the inter-dependencies of the ob-
servations across dialog turns, which leads to
more efficient and accurate dialog state infer-
ence.
