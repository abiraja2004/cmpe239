 
In this paper, we describe an item-familiarity account of the semi-productivity of morphological 
and lexical rules, and illustrate how it can be applied to practical issues which arise when building 
large scale lexical knowledge bases which utilize lexical rules. Our approach assumes that attested 
uses of derived words and senses are explicitly recorded, but that productive use of lexical rules is 
also possible, though controlled by probabilities associated with rule application. We discuss how 
the necessary probabilities and estimates of lexical rule productivity may be acquired from corpora.
