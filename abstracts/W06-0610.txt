We present a comparison of two for-
malisms for representing natural language
utterances, namely deep syntactical Tec-
togrammatical Layer of Functional Gen-
erative Description (FGD) and a seman-
tic formalism, MultiNet. We discuss the
possible position of MultiNet in the FGD
framework and present a preliminary map-
ping of representational means of these
two formalisms.
