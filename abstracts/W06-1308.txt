 
This paper presents an extension to the 
Reference Domain Theory (Salmon-Alt, 
2001) in order to solve plural references. 
While this theory doesn?t take plural 
reference into account in its original 
form, this paper shows how several 
entities can be grouped together by 
building a new domain and how they can 
be accessed later on. We introduce the 
notion of super-domain, representing the 
access structure to all the plural referents 
of a given type.
