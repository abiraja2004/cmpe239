 
Statistical anguage models are useful 
because they can provide probabilis- 
tic information upon uncertain decision 
making. The most common statistic is 
n-grams measuring word cooccurrences 
in texts. The method suffers from data 
shortage problem, however. In this pa- 
per, we suggest Bayesian networks be 
used in approximating the statistics of 
insufficient occurrences and of those that 
do not occur in the sample texts with 
graceful degradation. Collocation map 
is a sigmoid belief network that can be 
constructed from bigrams. We compared 
the conditional probabilities and mutual 
information computed from bigrams and 
Collocation map. The results show that 
the variance of the values from Colloca- 
tion map is smaller than that from fre- 
quency measure for the infrequent pairs 
by 48%. The predictive power of Col- 
location map for arbitrary associations 
not observed from sample texts is also 
demonstrated.
