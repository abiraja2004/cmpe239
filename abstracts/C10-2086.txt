 
Phrase-based statistical MT (SMT) is a 
milestone in MT. However, the transla-
tion model in the phrase based SMT is 
structure free which greatly limits its 
reordering capacity. To address this is-
sue, we propose a non-lexical head-
modifier based reordering model on 
word level by utilizing constituent based 
parse tree in source side. Our experi-
mental results on the NIST Chinese-
English benchmarking data show that, 
with a very small size model, our me-
thod significantly outperforms the base-
line by 1.48% bleu score.
