This paper demonstrates that the use of
ensemble methods and carefully calibrat-
ing the decision threshold can signifi-
cantly improve the performance of ma-
chine learning methods for morphologi-
cal word decomposition. We employ two
algorithms which come from a family of
generative probabilistic models. The mod-
els consider segment boundaries as hidden
variables and include probabilities for let-
ter transitions within segments. The ad-
vantage of this model family is that it can
learn from small datasets and easily gen-
eralises to larger datasets. The first algo-
rithm PROMODES, which participated in
the Morpho Challenge 2009 (an interna-
tional competition for unsupervised mor-
phological analysis) employs a lower or-
der model whereas the second algorithm
PROMODES-H is a novel development of
the first using a higher order model. We
present the mathematical description for
both algorithms, conduct experiments on
the morphologically rich language Zulu
and compare characteristics of both algo-
rithms based on the experimental results.
