many natural language applications, the 
coarse categories that most NE extractors 
work with prove insufficient for complex 
applications such as Question Answering and 
Ontology generation.  We examine one 
coarse category of named entities, persons, 
and describe a method for automatically 
classifying person instances into eight finer-
grained subcategories.  We present a 
supervised learning method that considers the 
local context surrounding the entity as well as 
more global semantic information derived 
from topic signatures and WordNet.  We 
reinforce this method with an algorithm that 
takes advantage of the presence of entities in 
multiple contexts.
