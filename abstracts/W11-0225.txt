Thai Traditional Medicine (TTM) has a long
history in Thailand and is nowadays consid-
ered an effective alternative approach to the
modern medicine. One of the main knowledge
in Thai traditional medicine is the use of var-
ious types of herbs to form medicines. Our
main goal is to bridge the gap between the tra-
ditional knowledge and the modern biomedi-
cal knowledge. Using text mining and visu-
alization techniques, some implicit relations
from one source could be used to verify and
enhance the knowledge discovery in another
source. In this paper, we present our ongoing
work, ThaiHerbMiner, a Thai herbal medicine
mining and visualizing tool. ThaiHerbMiner
applies text mining to extract some salient re-
lations from a collection of PubMed articles
related to Thai herbs. The extracted relations
can be browsed and viewed using information
visualization. Our proposed tool can also rec-
ommend a list of herbs which have similar
medical properties.
