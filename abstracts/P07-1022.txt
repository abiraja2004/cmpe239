This paper shows how to use the Unfold-
Fold transformation to transform Projective
Bilexical Dependency Grammars (PBDGs)
into ambiguity-preserving weakly equiva-
lent Context-Free Grammars (CFGs). These
CFGs can be parsed in O(n3) time using a
CKY algorithm with appropriate indexing,
rather than the O(n5) time required by a
naive encoding. Informally, using the CKY
algorithm with such a CFG mimics the steps
of the Eisner-Satta O(n3) PBDG parsing al-
gorithm. This transformation makes all of
the techniques developed for CFGs available
to PBDGs. We demonstrate this by describ-
ing a maximum posterior parse decoder for
PBDGs.
