This paper describes a dual-classifier ap-
proach to contextual sentiment analysis at the
SemEval-2013 Task 2. Contextual analysis of
polarity focuses on a word or phrase, rather
than the broader task of identifying the senti-
ment of an entire text. The Task 2 definition
includes target word spans that range in size
from a single word to entire sentences. How-
ever, the context of a single word is depen-
dent on the word?s surrounding syntax, while a
phrase contains most of the polarity within it-
self. We thus describe separate treatment with
two independent classifiers, outperforming the
accuracy of a single classifier. Our system
ranked 6th out of 19 teams on SMS message
classification, and 8th of 23 on twitter data.
We also show a surprising result that a very
small amount of word context is needed for
high-performance polarity extraction.
