Annotating large text corpora is a time-
consuming effort. Although single-user an-
notation tools are available, web-based an-
notation applications allow for distributed
annotation and file access from different lo-
cations. In this paper we present the web-
based annotation application Serengeti for
annotating anaphoric relations which will be
extended for the annotation of lexical chains.
