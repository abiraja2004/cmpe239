Appositions are adjacent NPs used to add
information to a discourse. We propose
systems exploiting syntactic and seman-
tic constraints to extract appositions from
OntoNotes. Our joint log-linear model
outperforms the state-of-the-art Favre and
Hakkani-Tu?r (2009) model by ?10% on
Broadcast News, and achieves 54.3% F-
score on multiple genres.
