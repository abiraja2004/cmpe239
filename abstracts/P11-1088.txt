Arabic handwriting recognition (HR) is a
challenging problem due to Arabic?s con-
nected letter forms, consonantal diacritics and
rich morphology. In this paper we isolate
the task of identification of erroneous words
in HR from the task of producing corrections
for these words. We consider a variety of
linguistic (morphological and syntactic) and
non-linguistic features to automatically iden-
tify these errors. Our best approach achieves
a roughly ?15% absolute increase in F-score
over a simple but reasonable baseline. A de-
tailed error analysis shows that linguistic fea-
tures, such as lemma (i.e., citation form) mod-
els, help improve HR-error detection precisely
where we expect them to: semantically inco-
herent error words.
