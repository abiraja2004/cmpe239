We propose an unsupervised system that
learns continuous degrees of lexicality for
noun-noun compounds, beating a strong base-
line on several tasks. We demonstrate that the
distributional representations of compounds
and their parts can be used to learn a fine-
grained representation of semantic contribu-
tion. Finally, we argue such a representation
captures compositionality better than the cur-
rent status-quo which treats compositionality
as a binary classification problem.
