We propose the use of morphemes for auto-
matic evaluation of machine translation out-
put, and systematically investigate a set of F
score and BLEU score based metrics calculated
on words, morphemes and POS tags along with
all corresponding combinations. Correlations
between the new metrics and human judg-
ments are calculated on the data of the third,
fourth and fifth shared tasks of the Statisti-
cal Machine Translation Workshop. Machine
translation outputs in five different European
languages are used: English, Spanish, French,
German and Czech. The results show that the
F scores which take into account morphemes
and POS tags are the most promising metrics.
