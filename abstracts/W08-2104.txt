This article investigates the effect of a set
of linguistically motivated features on ar-
gument disambiguation in data-driven de-
pendency parsing of Swedish. We present
results from experiments with gold stan-
dard features, such as animacy, definite-
ness and finiteness, as well as correspond-
ing experiments where these features have
been acquired automatically and show
significant improvements both in overall
parse results and in the analysis of specific
argument relations, such as subjects, ob-
jects and predicatives.
