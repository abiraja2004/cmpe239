We present an approach of expanding paral-
lel corpora for machine translation. By uti-
lizing Semantic role labeling (SRL) on one
side of the language pair, we extract SRL sub-
stitution rules from existing parallel corpus.
The rules are then used for generating new
sentence pairs. An SVM classifier is built to
filter the generated sentence pairs. The fil-
tered corpus is used for training phrase-based
translation models, which can be used directly
in translation tasks or combined with base-
line models. Experimental results on Chinese-
English machine translation tasks show an av-
erage improvement of 0.45 BLEU and 1.22
TER points across 5 different NIST test sets.
