This paper describes a fully unsupervised
and automated method for large-scale ex-
traction of multiword expressions (MWEs)
from large corpora. The method aims at cap-
turing the non-compositionality of MWEs;
the intuition is that a noun within a MWE
cannot easily be replaced by a semanti-
cally similar noun. To implement this intu-
ition, a noun clustering is automatically ex-
tracted (using distributional similarity mea-
sures), which gives us clusters of semanti-
cally related nouns. Next, a number of statis-
tical measures ? based on selectional prefer-
ences ? is developed that formalize the intu-
ition of non-compositionality. Our approach
has been tested on Dutch, and automatically
evaluated using Dutch lexical resources.
