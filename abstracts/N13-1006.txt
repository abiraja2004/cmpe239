Different languages contain complementary
cues about entities, which can be used to im-
prove Named Entity Recognition (NER) sys-
tems. We propose a method that formu-
lates the problem of exploring such signals on
unannotated bilingual text as a simple Inte-
ger Linear Program, which encourages entity
tags to agree via bilingual constraints. Bilin-
gual NER experiments on the large OntoNotes
4.0 Chinese-English corpus show that the pro-
posed method can improve strong baselines
for both Chinese and English. In particular,
Chinese performance improves by over 5%
absolute F1 score. We can then annotate a
large amount of bilingual text (80k sentence
pairs) using our method, and add it as up-
training data to the original monolingual NER
training corpus. The Chinese model retrained
on this new combined dataset outperforms the
strong baseline by over 3% F1 score.
