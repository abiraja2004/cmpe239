Abstract  
A general, practical method for hand- 
ling sparse data that avoids held-out 
data and iterative reestimation is derived 
from first principles. It has been tested 
on a part-of-speech tagging task and out- 
performed (deleted) interpolation with 
context-independent weights, even when 
the latter used a globally optimal para- 
meter setting determined a posteriori.
