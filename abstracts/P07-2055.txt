In this paper, we present a hybrid method for
word segmentation and POS tagging. The
target languages are those in which word
boundaries are ambiguous, such as Chinese
and Japanese. In the method, word-based
and character-based processing is combined,
and word segmentation and POS tagging are
conducted simultaneously. Experimental re-
sults on multiple corpora show that the inte-
grated method has high accuracy.
