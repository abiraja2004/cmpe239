Named Entity Recognition and Classi-
fication (NERC) is a well-studied NLP
task typically focused on coarse-grained
named entity (NE) classes. NERC for
more fine-grained semantic NE classes has
not been systematically studied. This pa-
per quantifies the difficulty of fine-grained
NERC (FG-NERC) when performed at
large scale on the people domain. We
apply unsupervised acquisition methods
to construct a gold standard dataset for
FG-NERC. This dataset is used to bench-
mark methods for classifying NEs at var-
ious levels of fine-grainedness using clas-
sical NERC techniques and global contex-
tual information inspired fromWord Sense
Disambiguation approaches. Our results
indicate high difficulty of the task and pro-
vide a ?strong? baseline for future research.
