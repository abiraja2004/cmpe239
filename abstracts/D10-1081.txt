This paper proposes a fast and simple unsuper-
vised word segmentation algorithm that uti-
lizes the local predictability of adjacent char-
acter sequences, while searching for a least-
effort representation of the data. The model
uses branching entropy as a means of con-
straining the hypothesis space, in order to ef-
ficiently obtain a solution that minimizes the
length of a two-part MDL code. An evaluation
with corpora in Japanese, Thai, English, and
the ?CHILDES? corpus for research in lan-
guage development reveals that the algorithm
achieves an accuracy, comparable to that of
the state-of-the-art methods in unsupervised
word segmentation, in a significantly reduced
computational time.
