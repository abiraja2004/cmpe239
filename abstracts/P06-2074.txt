 
Information Extraction (IE) is a fundamen-
tal technology for NLP. Previous methods 
for IE were relying on co-occurrence rela-
tions, soft patterns and properties of the 
target (for example, syntactic role), which 
result in problems of handling paraphrasing 
and alignment of instances. Our system 
ARE (Anchor and Relation) is based on the 
dependency relation model and tackles 
these problems by unifying entities accord-
ing to their dependency relations, which we 
found to provide more invariant relations 
between entities in many cases. In order to 
exploit the complexity and characteristics 
of relation paths, we further classify the re-
lation paths into the categories of ?easy?, 
?average? and ?hard?, and utilize different 
extraction strategies based on the character-
istics of those categories. Our extraction 
method leads to improvement in perform-
ance by 3% and 6% for MUC4 and MUC6 
respectively as compared to the state-of-art 
IE systems.
