  
There is increasing concern about 
English-Korean (E-K) transliteration 
recently. In the previous works, direct 
converting methods from English 
alphabets to Korean alphabets were a 
main research topic. In this paper, we 
present an E-K transliteration model using 
pronunciation and contextual rules. Unlike 
the previous works, our method uses 
phonetic information such as phoneme 
and its context. We also use word 
formation information such as English 
words of Greek origin. With them, our 
method shows significant performance 
increase about 31% in word accuracy.
