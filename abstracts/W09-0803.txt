Various methods have been devised to pro-
duce morphological analyzers and gen-
erators for Semitic languages, ranging
from methods based on widely used finite-
state technologies to very specific solu-
tions designed for a specific language
or problem. Since the earliest propos-
als of how to adopt the elsewhere suc-
cessful finite-state methods to root-and-
pattern morphologies, the solution of en-
coding Semitic grammars using multi-tape
automata has resurfaced on a regular ba-
sis. Multi-tape automata, however, require
specific algorithms and reimplementation
of finite-state operators across the board,
and hence such technology has not been
readily available to linguists. This paper,
using an actual Arabic grammar as a case
study, describes an approach to encoding
multi-tape automata on a single tape that
can be implemented using any standard
finite-automaton toolkit.
