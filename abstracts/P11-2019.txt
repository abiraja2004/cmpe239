This opinion paper discusses subjective natu-
ral language problems in terms of their mo-
tivations, applications, characterizations, and
implications. It argues that such problems de-
serve increased attention because of their po-
tential to challenge the status of theoretical
understanding, problem-solving methods, and
evaluation techniques in computational lin-
guistics. The author supports a more holis-
tic approach to such problems; a view that
extends beyond opinion mining or sentiment
analysis.
