The application of statistical NLP systems to
resource constrained devices is limited by the
need to maintain parameters for a large num-
ber of features and an alphabet mapping fea-
tures to parameters. We introduce random
feature mixing to eliminate alphabet storage
and reduce the number of parameters without
severely impacting model performance.
