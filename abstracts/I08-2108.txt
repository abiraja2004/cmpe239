This paper reconsiders the task of MRD-
based word sense disambiguation, in extend-
ing the basic Lesk algorithm to investigate
the impact onWSD performance of different
tokenisation schemes, scoring mechanisms,
methods of gloss extension and filtering
methods. In experimentation over the Lex-
eed Sensebank and the Japanese Senseval-
2 dictionary task, we demonstrate that char-
acter bigrams with sense-sensitive gloss ex-
tension over hyponyms and hypernyms en-
hances WSD performance.
