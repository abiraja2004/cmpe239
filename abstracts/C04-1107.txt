This paper investigates a novel application of sup-
port vector machines (SVMs) for sentence reduction.
We also propose a new probabilistic sentence reduc-
tion method based on support vector machine learn-
ing. Experimental results show that the proposed
methods outperform earlier methods in term of sen-
tence reduction performance.
