In this paper, we investigate a supervised ma-
chine learning framework for automatically
learning of English Light Verb Constructions
(LVCs). Our system achieves an 86.3% accu-
racy with a baseline (chance) performance of
52.2% when trained with groups of either con-
textual or statistical features. In addition, we
present an in-depth analysis of these contex-
tual and statistical features and show that the
system trained by these two types of cosmet-
ically different features reaches similar per-
formance empirically. However, in the situa-
tion where the surface structures of candidate
LVCs are identical, the system trained with
contextual features which contain information
on surrounding words performs 16.7% better.
In this study, we also construct a balanced
benchmark dataset with 2,162 sentences from
BNC for English LVCs. And this data set is
publicly available and is also a useful com-
putational resource for research on MWEs in
general.
