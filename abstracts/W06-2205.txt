Semantic relationships between words
comprised by thesauri are essential fea-
tures for IR, text mining and informa-
tion extraction systems. This paper in-
troduces a new approach to identifica-
tion of semantic relations such as syn-
onymy by a lexical graph. The graph
is generated from a text corpus by em-
bedding syntactically parsed sentences
in the graph structure. The vertices
of the graph are lexical items (words),
their connection follows the syntactic
structure of a sentence. The struc-
ture of the graph and distances be-
tween vertices can be utilized to define
metrics for identification of semantic
relations. The approach has been eval-
uated on a test set of 200 German syn-
onym sets. Influence of size of the text
corpus, word generality and frequency
has been investigated. Conducted ex-
periments for synonyms demonstrate
that the presented methods can be ex-
tended to other semantic relations.
