 
Grading is a primary cognitive operation that 
has an important expressive function. Infor-
mation on degree is grammatically relevant 
and constitutes what Lazard (2006) calls a 
primary domain of grammaticalization: Ac-
cording to typological studies (Cuzzolin & 
Lehmann, 2004), many languages of the 
world have in fact at their disposal multiple 
grammatical devices to express gradation. In 
Italian, the class of superlativizing structures 
alternative to the morphological superlative is 
very rich and consists, among others, of ad-
verbs of degree, focalizing adverbs and proto-
typical comparisons. This contribution deals 
with a particular analytic structure of superla-
tive in Italian that is still neglected in the liter-
ature. This is what we will call Constructional 
Intensifying Adjectives (CIAs), adjectives 
which modify the intensity of other adjectives 
on the basis of regular semantic patterns, thus 
giving rise to multiword superlative construc-
tions of the type: ADJX+ADJINTENS. A com-
parative quantitative corpus analysis 
demonstrates that this strategy, though para-
digmatically limited, is nonetheless widely 
exploited: From a distributional point of view, 
some of these CIAs only combine with one or 
a few adjectives and form MWEs that appear 
to be completely lexicalized, while some oth-
ers modify wider classes of adjectives thus 
displaying a certain degree of productivity.
