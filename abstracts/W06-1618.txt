 
Complex tasks like question answering 
need to be able to identify events in text 
and the relations among those events. We 
show that this event identification task 
and a related task, identifying the seman-
tic class of these events, can both be for-
mulated as classification problems in a 
word-chunking paradigm. We introduce a 
variety of linguistically motivated fea-
tures for this task and then train a system 
that is able to identify events with a pre-
cision of 82% and a recall of 71%. We 
then show a variety of analyses of this 
model, and their implications for the 
event identification task.
