In this paper we propose a new distance
function (rank distance) designed to reflect
stylistic similarity between texts. To assess
the ability of this distance measure to cap-
ture stylistic similarity between texts, we
tested it in two different machine learning
settings: clustering and binary classifica-
tion.
