In this paper we present our systems for cal-
culating the degree of semantic similarity be-
tween two texts that we submitted to the Se-
mantic Textual Similarity task at SemEval-
2013. Our systems predict similarity using
a regression over features based on the fol-
lowing sources of information: string similar-
ity, topic distributions of the texts based on
latent Dirichlet alocation, and similarity be-
tween the documents returned by an informa-
tion retrieval engine when the target texts are
used as queries. We also explore methods for
integrating predictions using different training
datasets and feature sets. Our best system was
ranked 17th out of 89 participating systems.
In our post-task analysis, we identify simple
changes to our system that further improve our
results.
