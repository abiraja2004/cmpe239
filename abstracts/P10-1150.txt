A challenging problem in open informa-
tion extraction and text mining is the learn-
ing of the selectional restrictions of se-
mantic relations. We propose a mini-
mally supervised bootstrapping algorithm
that uses a single seed and a recursive
lexico-syntactic pattern to learn the ar-
guments and the supertypes of a diverse
set of semantic relations from the Web.
We evaluate the performance of our algo-
rithm on multiple semantic relations ex-
pressed using ?verb?, ?noun?, and ?verb
prep? lexico-syntactic patterns. Human-
based evaluation shows that the accuracy
of the harvested information is about 90%.
We also compare our results with existing
knowledge base to outline the similarities
and differences of the granularity and di-
versity of the harvested knowledge.
