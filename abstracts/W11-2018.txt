Detecting levels of interest from speakers
is a new problem in Spoken Dialog Under-
standing with significant impact on real world
business applications. Previous work has fo-
cused on the analysis of traditional acous-
tic signals and shallow lexical features. In
this paper, we present a novel hierarchical fu-
sion learning model that takes feedback from
previous multistream predictions of promi-
nent seed samples into account and uses a
mean cosine similarity measure to learn rules
that improve reclassification. Our method is
domain-independent and can be adapted to
other speech and language processing areas
where domain adaptation is expensive to per-
form. Incorporating Discriminative Term Fre-
quency and Inverse Document Frequency (D-
TFIDF), lexical affect scoring, and low and
high level prosodic and acoustic features, our
experiments outperform the published results
of all systems participating in the 2010 Inter-
speech Paralinguistic Affect Subchallenge.
