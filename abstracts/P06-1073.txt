Short vowels and other diacritics are not
part of written Arabic scripts. Exceptions
are made for important political and reli-
gious texts and in scripts for beginning stu-
dents of Arabic. Script without diacritics
have considerable ambiguity because many
words with different diacritic patterns ap-
pear identical in a diacritic-less setting. We
propose in this paper a maximum entropy
approach for restoring diacritics in a doc-
ument. The approach can easily integrate
and make effective use of diverse types of
information; the model we propose inte-
grates a wide array of lexical, segment-
based and part-of-speech tag features. The
combination of these feature types leads
to a state-of-the-art diacritization model.
Using a publicly available corpus (LDC?s
Arabic Treebank Part 3), we achieve a di-
acritic error rate of 5.1%, a segment error
rate 8.5%, and a word error rate of 17.3%.
In case-ending-less setting, we obtain a di-
acritic error rate of 2.2%, a segment error
rate 4.0%, and a word error rate of 7.2%.
