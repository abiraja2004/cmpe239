This paper describes a decoding algorithm
for a syntax-based translation model (Ya-
mada and Knight, 2001). The model
has been extended to incorporate phrasal
translations as presented here. In con-
trast to a conventional word-to-word sta-
tistical model, a decoder for the syntax-
based model builds up an English parse
tree given a sentence in a foreign lan-
guage. As the model size becomes huge in
a practical setting, and the decoder consid-
ers multiple syntactic structures for each
word alignment, several pruning tech-
niques are necessary. We tested our de-
coder in a Chinese-to-English translation
system, and obtained better results than
IBM Model 4. We also discuss issues con-
cerning the relation between this decoder
and a language model.
