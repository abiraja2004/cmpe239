PCFGs can grow exponentially as additional
annotations are added to an initially simple
base grammar. We present an approach where
multiple annotations coexist, but in a factored
manner that avoids this combinatorial explo-
sion. Our method works with linguistically-
motivated annotations, induced latent struc-
ture, lexicalization, or any mix of the three.
We use a structured expectation propagation
algorithm that makes use of the factored struc-
ture in two ways. First, by partitioning the fac-
tors, it speeds up parsing exponentially over
the unfactored approach. Second, it minimizes
the redundancy of the factors during training,
improving accuracy over an independent ap-
proach. Using purely latent variable annota-
tions, we can efficiently train and parse with
up to 8 latent bits per symbol, achieving F1
scores up to 88.4 on the Penn Treebank while
using two orders of magnitudes fewer parame-
ters compared to the na??ve approach. Combin-
ing latent, lexicalized, and unlexicalized anno-
tations, our best parser gets 89.4 F1 on all sen-
tences from section 23 of the Penn Treebank.
