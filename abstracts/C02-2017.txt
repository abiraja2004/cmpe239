We describe a parser for robust and flexible inter-
pretation of user utterances in a multi-modal sys-
tem for web search in newspaper databases. Users
can speak or type, and they can navigate and follow
links using mouse clicks. Spoken or written queries
may combine search expressions with browser com-
mands and search space restrictions. In interpreting
input queries, the system has to be fault-tolerant to
account for spontanous speech phenomena as well
as typing or speech recognition errors which often
distort the meaning of the utterance and are difficult
to detect and correct. Our parser integrates shallow
parsing techniques with knowledge-based text re-
trieval to allow for robust processing and coordina-
tion of input modes. Parsing relies on a two-layered
approach: typical meta-expressions like those con-
cerning search, newspaper types and dates are iden-
tified and excluded from the search string to be sent
to the search engine. The search terms which are
left after preprocessing are then grouped according
to co-occurrence statistics which have been derived
from a newspaper corpus. These co-occurrence
statistics concern typical noun phrases as they ap-
pear in newspaper texts.
