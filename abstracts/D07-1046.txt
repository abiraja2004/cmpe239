Morphological analysis and disambiguation
are crucial stages in a variety of natural
language processing applications, especially
when languages with complex morphology
are concerned. We present a system which
disambiguates the output of a morphologi-
cal analyzer for Hebrew. It consists of sev-
eral simple classifiers and a module which
combines them under linguistically moti-
vated constraints. We investigate a number
of techniques for combining the predictions
of the classifiers. Our best result, 91.44% ac-
curacy, reflects a 25% reduction in error rate
compared with the previous state of the art.
