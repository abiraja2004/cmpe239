 
Online learning calls for instant assess-
ment and feedback. YanFa is a system 
developed to score online English-
Chinese translation exercises with intel-
ligent feedback for Chinese non-English 
majors. With the aid of HowNet and 
Cilin?Chinese Synonym Set (Extended 
Version), the system adopts the hybrid 
approach to scoring student translation 
semantically. It compares student trans-
lation with model translation by Syno-
nym Matching, Sentence-pattern Match-
ing and Word Similarity Calculating re-
spectively. The experiment results show 
that the correlation ratio between the 
scores given by the system and by hu-
man raters is 0.58, which indicates that 
the algorithm is able to fulfill the task of 
automated scoring. YanFa is also able to 
provide feedback on syntactic mistakes 
made by students through interacting 
with them. It asks students to analyze 
the English sentence elements. Then it 
compares the student analyses with 
those of the parser and points out the 
parts which might lead to their wrong 
understanding as well as their wrong 
translating.
