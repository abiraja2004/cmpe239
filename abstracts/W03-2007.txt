Patent corpus processing should be cen-
tered around patent claim processing be-
cause claims are the most important part
in patent specifications. It is common that
claims written in Japanese are described in
one sentence with peculiar style and word-
ing and are difficult to understand for ordi-
nary people. The peculiarity is caused by
structural complexity of the sentences and
many difficult terms used in the descrip-
tion. We have already proposed a frame-
work to represent the structure of patent
claims and a method to automatically an-
alyze it. We are currently investigating a
method to clarify terms in patent claims
and to find the explanatory portions from
the detailed description part of the patent
specifications. Through both approaches,
we believe we can improve readability of
patent claims.
