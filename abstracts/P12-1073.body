In this paper we propose a method to auto-
matically label multi-lingual data with named
entity tags. We build on prior work utiliz-
ing Wikipedia metadata and show how to ef-
fectively combine the weak annotations stem-
ming from Wikipedia metadata with infor-
mation obtained through English-foreign lan-
guage parallel Wikipedia sentences. The com-
bination is achieved using a novel semi-CRF
model for foreign sentence tagging in the con-
text of a parallel English sentence. The model
outperforms both standard annotation projec-
tion methods and methods based solely on
Wikipedia metadata.
