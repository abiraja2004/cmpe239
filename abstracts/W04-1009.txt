 
In this paper, a novel linguistically advanced text 
summarization system is described for reducing 
the minimum size of highly readable variable -
sized summaries of digitized text documents pro-
duced by text summarization methods that use 
discourse analysis to rank sentences for inclusion 
in the final summary. The basic algorithm used in 
FXPAL?s PALSUMM text summarization sys-
tem combines text structure methods that pre-
serve readability and correct reference resolution 
with statistical methods to reduce overall sum-
mary length while promoting the inclusion of 
important material.
