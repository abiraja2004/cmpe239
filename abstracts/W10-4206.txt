This paper investigates the relationship be-
tween the results of an extrinsic, task-
based evaluation of an NLG system and
various metrics measuring both surface
and deep semantic textual properties, in-
cluding relevance. The latter rely heav-
ily on domain knowledge. We show that
they correlate systematically with some
measures of performance. The core ar-
gument of this paper is that more domain
knowledge-based metrics shed more light
on the relationship between deep semantic
properties of a text and task performance.
