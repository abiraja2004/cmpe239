This paper describes the MulTra project,
aiming at the development of an efficient
multilingual translation technology based
on an abstract and generic linguistic model
as well as on object-oriented software de-
sign. In particular, we will address the is-
sue of the rapid growth both of the trans-
fer modules and of the bilingual databases.
For the latter, we will show that a signifi-
cant part of bilingual lexical databases can
be derived automatically through transitiv-
ity, with corpus validation.
