Optimal ensembling (OE) is a word sense 
disambiguation  (WSD)  method  using 
word-specific training factors (average pos-
itive vs negative training per sense,  posex 
and negex) to predict best system (classifier 
algorithm / applicable feature set) for given 
target  word.  Our  official  entry  (OE1)  in 
Senseval-4  Task  17  (coarse-grained  En-
glish lexical sample task) contained many 
design flaws and thus  failed to  show the 
whole  potential  of  the  method,  finishing 
-4.9% behind top system (+0.5 gain over 
best  base  system).  A fixed system (OE2) 
finished  only  -3.4%  behind  (+2.0%  net 
gain).  All  our  systems  were  'closed',  i.e. 
used the official training data only (average 
56 training examples per each sense).  We 
also show that the official evaluation mea-
sure  tends  to  favor  systems  that  do  well 
with high-trained words.
