Recently, dependency grammar has gained renewed
attention as empirical methods in parsing have
emphasized the importance of relations between
words, which is what dependency grammars model
explicitly, but context-free phrase-structure gram-
mars do not. While there has been much work on
formalizing dependency grammar and on parsing
algorithms for dependency grammars in the past,
there is not a complete generative formalization of
dependency grammar based on string-rewriting in
which the derivation structure is the desired depen-
dency structure. Such a system allows for the defi-
nition of a compact parse forest in a straightforward
manner. In this paper, we present a simple gen-
erative formalism for dependency grammars based
on Extended Context-Free Grammar, along with
a parser; the formalism captures the intuitions of
previous formalizations while deviating minimally
from the much-used Context-Free Grammar.
