In this paper, we propose a novel frame-
work to enrich Translation Memory (TM)
systems with Statistical Machine Trans-
lation (SMT) outputs using ranking. In
order to offer the human translators mul-
tiple choices, instead of only using the
top SMT output and top TM hit, we
merge the N-best output from the SMT
system and the k-best hits with highest
fuzzy match scores from the TM sys-
tem. The merged list is then ranked ac-
cording to the prospective post-editing ef-
fort and provided to the translators to aid
their work. Experiments show that our
ranked output achieve 0.8747 precision at
top 1 and 0.8134 precision at top 5. Our
framework facilitates a tight integration
between SMT and TM, where full advan-
tage is taken of TM while high quality
SMT output is availed of to improve the
productivity of human translators.
