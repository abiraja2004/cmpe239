We investigate the impact of the precision/recall
trade-off of information extraction on the per-
formance of an offline corpus-based question
answering (QA) system. One of our findings is
that, because of the robust final answer selection
mechanism of the QA system, recall is more im-
portant. We show that the recall of the extrac-
tion component can be improved using syntac-
tic parsing instead of more common surface text
patterns, substantially increasing the number of
factoid questions answered by the QA system.
