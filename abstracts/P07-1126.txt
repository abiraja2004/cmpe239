We present a novel approach to automati-
cally annotate images using associated text.
We detect and classify all entities (persons
and objects) in the text after which we de-
termine the salience (the importance of an
entity in a text) and visualness (the extent to
which an entity can be perceived visually)
of these entities. We combine these mea-
sures to compute the probability that an en-
tity is present in the image. The suitability
of our approach was successfully tested on
100 image-text pairs of Yahoo! News.
