An eggcorn is a type of linguistic error where
a word is substituted with one that is seman-
tically plausible ? that is, the substitution is
a semantic reanalysis of what may be a rare,
archaic, or otherwise opaque term. We build
a system that, given the original word and its
eggcorn form, finds a semantic path between
the two. Based on these paths, we derive a ty-
pology that reflects the different classes of se-
mantic reinterpretation underlying eggcorns.
