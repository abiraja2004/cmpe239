Natural language processing technology
for the dialects of Arabic is still in its
infancy, due to the problem of obtaining
large amounts of text data for spoken Ara-
bic. In this paper we describe the de-
velopment of a part-of-speech (POS) tag-
ger for Egyptian Colloquial Arabic. We
adopt a minimally supervised approach
that only requires raw text data from sev-
eral varieties of Arabic and a morpholog-
ical analyzer for Modern Standard Ara-
bic. No dialect-specific tools are used. We
present several statistical modeling and
cross-dialectal data sharing techniques to
enhance the performance of the baseline
tagger and compare the results to those
obtained by a supervised tagger trained
on hand-annotated data and, by a state-of-
the-art Modern Standard Arabic tagger ap-
plied to Egyptian Arabic.
