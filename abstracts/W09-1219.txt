 
We describe our CoNLL 2009 Shared Task 
system in the present paper. The system in-
cludes three cascaded components: a genera-
tive dependency parser, a classifier for 
syntactic dependency labels and a semantic 
classifier. The experimental results show that 
the labeled macro F1 scores of our system on 
the joint task range from 43.50% (Chinese) to 
57.95% (Czech), with an average of 51.07%.
