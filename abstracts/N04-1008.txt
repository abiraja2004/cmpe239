 
In this paper we describe and evaluate a Ques-
tion Answering system that goes beyond an-
swering factoid questions. We focus on FAQ-
like questions and answers, and build our sys-
tem around a noisy-channel architecture which 
exploits both a language model for answers 
and a transformation model for an-
swer/question terms, trained on a corpus of 1 
million question/answer pairs collected from 
the Web.
