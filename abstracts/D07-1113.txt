 
In this paper, we present an election predic-
tion system (Crystal) based on web users? 
opinions posted on an election prediction 
website. Given a prediction message, Crys-
tal first identifies which party the message 
predicts to win and then aggregates predic-
tion analysis results of a large amount of 
opinions to project the election results. We 
collect past election prediction messages 
from the Web and automatically build a 
gold standard. We focus on capturing lexi-
cal patterns that people frequently use 
when they express their predictive opinions 
about a coming election. To predict elec-
tion results, we apply SVM-based super-
vised learning. To improve performance, 
we propose a novel technique which gener-
alizes n-gram feature patterns. Experimen-
tal results show that Crystal significantly 
outperforms several baselines as well as a 
non-generalized n-gram approach. Crystal 
predicts future elections with 81.68% accu-
racy.
