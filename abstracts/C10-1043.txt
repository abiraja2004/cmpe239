We describe an approach to automatically
learn reordering rules to be applied as a
preprocessing step in phrase-based ma-
chine translation. We learn rules for 8 dif-
ferent language pairs, showing BLEU im-
provements for all of them, and demon-
strate that many important order trans-
formations (SVO to SOV or VSO, head-
modifier, verb movement) can be captured
by this approach.
