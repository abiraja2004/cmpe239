 
A critical path in the development of natural language 
understanding (NLU) modules lies in the difficulty of 
defining a mapping from words to semantics: Usually it 
takes in the order of years of highly-skilled labor to de- 
velop a semantic mapping, e.g., in the form of a semantic 
grammar, that is comprehensive enough for a given do- 
main. Yet, due to the very nature of human language, 
such mappings invariably fail to achieve full coverage on 
unseen data. Acknowledging the impossibility of stat- 
ing a priori all the surface forms by which a concept can 
be expressed, we present GsG: an empathic computer 
system for the rapid deployment of NLU front-ends and 
their dynamic customization by non-expert end-users. 
Given a new domain for which an NLU front-end is to 
be developed, two stages are involved. In the author- 
ing stage, GSQ aids the developer in the construction 
of a simple domain model and a kernel analysis gram- 
mar. Then, in the run-time stage, GSG provides the end- 
user with an interactive environment in which the kernel 
grammar isdynamically extended. Three learning meth- 
ods are employed in the acquisition of semantic mappings 
from unseen data: (i) parser predictions, (ii) hidden un- 
derstanding model, and (iii) end-user paraphrases. A 
baseline version of GsG has been implemented and pre- 
llminary experiments show promising results.
