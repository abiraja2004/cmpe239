The frame-semantic parsing task is challeng-
ing for supervised techniques, even for those
few languages where relatively large amounts
of labeled data are available. In this prelim-
inary work, we consider unsupervised induc-
tion of frame-semantic representations. An
existing state-of-the-art Bayesian model for
PropBank-style unsupervised semantic role
induction (Titov and Klementiev, 2012) is ex-
tended to jointly induce semantic frames and
their roles. We evaluate the model perfor-
mance both quantitatively and qualitatively by
comparing the induced representation against
FrameNet annotations.
