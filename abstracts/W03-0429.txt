We present an approach to named entity recog-
nition that uses support vector machines to cap-
ture transition probabilities in a lattice. The
support vector machines are trained with hun-
dreds of thousands of features drawn from the
CoNLL-2003 Shared Task training data. Mar-
gin outputs are converted to estimated prob-
abilities using a simple static function. Per-
formance is evaluated using the CoNLL-2003
Shared Task test set; Test B results were F?=1
= 84.67 for English, and F?=1 = 69.96 for Ger-
man.
