The increasing complexity of summarization systems
makes it difficult to analyze exactly which mod-
ules make a difference in performance. We carried
out a principled comparison between the two most
commonly used schemes for assigning importance to
words in the context of query focused multi-document
summarization: raw frequency (word probability) and
log-likelihood ratio. We demonstrate that the advan-
tages of log-likelihood ratio come from its known dis-
tributional properties which allow for the identifica-
tion of a set of words that in its entirety defines the
aboutness of the input. We also find that LLR is more
suitable for query-focused summarization since, un-
like raw frequency, it is more sensitive to the integra-
tion of the information need defined by the user.
