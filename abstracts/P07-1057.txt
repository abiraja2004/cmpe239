Recently, there has been a rise of in-
terest in unsupervised detection of high-
level semantic relations involving com-
plex units, such as phrases and whole
sentences. Typically such approaches are
faced with two main obstacles: data
sparseness and correctly generalizing
from the examples. In this work, we
describe the Clustered Clause represen-
tation, which utilizes information-based
clustering and inter-sentence dependen-
cies to create a simplified and generalized
representation of the grammatical clause.
We implement an algorithm which uses
this representation to detect a predefined
set of high-level relations, and demon-
strate our model?s effectiveness in over-
coming both the problems mentioned.
