Distributional similarity methods have
proven to be a valuable tool for the in-
duction of semantic similarity. Up till
now, most algorithms use two-way co-
occurrence data to compute the mean-
ing of words. Co-occurrence frequencies,
however, need not be pairwise. One can
easily imagine situations where it is desir-
able to investigate co-occurrence frequen-
cies of three modes and beyond. This pa-
per will investigate a tensor factorization
method called non-negative tensor factor-
ization to build a model of three-way co-
occurrences. The approach is applied to
the problem of selectional preference in-
duction, and automatically evaluated in a
pseudo-disambiguation task. The results
show that non-negative tensor factoriza-
tion is a promising tool for NLP.
