issues for monolingual and multilingual link 
detection.  The experimental results show 
that nouns, verbs, adjectives and compound 
nouns are useful to represent news stories; 
story expansion is helpful; topic 
segmentation has a little effect; and a 
translation model is needed to capture the 
differences between languages.
