This paper is concerned with learning cat-
egorial grammars in Gold?s model. In
contrast to k-valued classical categorial
grammars, k-valued Lambek grammars
are not learnable from strings. This re-
sult was shown for several variants but
the question was left open for the weak-
est one, the non-associative variant NL.
We show that the class of rigid and k-
valued NL grammars is unlearnable from
strings, for each k; this result is obtained
by a specific construction of a limit point
in the considered class, that does not use
product operator.
Another interest of our construction is that
it provides limit points for the whole hier-
archy of Lambek grammars, including the
recent pregroup grammars.
Such a result aims at clarifying the pos-
sible directions for future learning algo-
rithms: it expresses the difficulty of learn-
ing categorial grammars from strings and
the need for an adequate structure on ex-
amples.
