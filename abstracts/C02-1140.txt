The dictionary look-up of unknown words is partic-
ularly difficult in Japanese due to the complicated
writing system. We propose a system which allows
learners of Japanese to look up words according to
their expected, but not necessarily correct, reading.
This is an improvement over previous systems which
provide no handling of incorrect readings. In prepro-
cessing, we calculate the possible readings each kanji
character can take and different types of phonolog-
ical and conjugational changes that can occur, and
associate a probability with each. Using these prob-
abilities and corpus-based frequencies we calculate a
plausibility measure for each generated reading given
a dictionary entry, based on the naive Bayes model.
In response to a reading input, we calculate the plau-
sibility of each dictionary entry corresponding to the
reading and display a list of candidates for the user
to choose from. We have implemented our system
in a web-based environment and are currently eval-
uating its usefulness to learners of Japanese.
