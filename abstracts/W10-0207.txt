 
This paper describes methods aimed at solv-
ing the novel problem of automatically dis-
covering ?wishes? from (English) documents 
such as reviews or customer surveys. These 
wishes are sentences in which authors make 
suggestions (especially for improvements) 
about a product or service or show intentions 
to purchase a product or service. Such 
?wishes? are of great use to product managers 
and sales personnel, and supplement the area 
of sentiment analysis by providing insights 
into the minds of consumers. We describe 
rules that can help detect these ?wishes? from 
text. We evaluate these methods on texts from 
the electronic and banking industries.
