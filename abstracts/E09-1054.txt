In this paper, we present a novel approach
to integrate speech recognition and rule-
based machine translation by lattice pars-
ing. The presented approach is hybrid
in two senses. First, it combines struc-
tural and statistical methods for language
modeling task. Second, it employs a
chart parser which utilizes manually cre-
ated syntax rules in addition to scores ob-
tained after statistical processing during
speech recognition. The employed chart
parser is a unification-based active chart
parser. It can parse word graphs by using a
mixed strategy instead of being bottom-up
or top-down only. The results are reported
based on word error rate on the NIST
HUB-1 word-lattices. The presented ap-
proach is implemented and compared with
other syntactic language modeling tech-
niques.
