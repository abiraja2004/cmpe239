We describe a method for augmenting
a bilingual lexicon with additional in-
formation for selecting an appropriate 
translation word. For each word in the 
source language, we calculate a corre-
lation matrix of its association words 
versus its translation candidates. We 
estimate the degree of correlation by
using comparable corpora based on 
these assumptions: ?parallel word as-
sociations? and ?one sense per word 
association.? In our word translation 
disambiguation experiment, the results 
show that our method achieved 42% 
recall and 49% precision for Japa-
nese-English newspaper texts, and 45% 
recall and 76% precision for Chi-
nese-Japanese technical documents.
