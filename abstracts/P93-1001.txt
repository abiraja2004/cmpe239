 
There have been a number of recent papers on aligning parallel texts at the sentence l vel, e.g., Brown et al(1991), 
Gale and Church (to appear), Isabelle (1992), Kay and R/Ssenschein (to appear), Simard et al(1992), Warwick- 
Armstrong and Russell (1990). On clean inputs, such as the Canadian Hansards, these methods have been very 
successful (at least 96% correct by sentence). Unfortunately, if the input is noisy (due to OCR and/or unknown 
markup conventions), then these methods tend to break down because the noise can make it difficult to find 
paragraph boundaries, let alne sentences. This paper describes a new program, charal ign, that aligns texts at the 
character level rather than at the sentence/paragraph level, based on the cognate approach proposed by Simard et al
