There exists a well-established and almost
unanimously adopted measure of tagger
performance, namely, accuracy. Although
it is perfectly adequate for small tagsets
and typical approaches to disambiguation,
we show that it is deficient when applied
to rich morphological tagsets and propose
various extensions designed to better cor-
relate with the real usefulness of the tag-
ger.
