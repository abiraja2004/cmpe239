This paper describes the supporting resources
provided for the BioNLP Shared Task 2011.
These resources were constructed with the
goal to alleviate some of the burden of sys-
tem development from the participants and al-
low them to focus on the novel aspects of con-
structing their event extraction systems. With
the availability of these resources we also seek
to enable the evaluation of the applicability of
specific tools and representations towards im-
proving the performance of event extraction
systems. Additionally we supplied evaluation
software and services and constructed a vi-
sualisation tool, stav, which visualises event
extraction results and annotations. These re-
sources helped the participants make sure that
their final submissions and research efforts
were on track during the development stages
and evaluate their progress throughout the du-
ration of the shared task. The visualisation
software was also employed to show the dif-
ferences between the gold annotations and
those of the submitted results, allowing the
participants to better understand the perfor-
mance of their system. The resources, evalu-
ation tools and visualisation tool are provided
freely for research purposes and can be found
