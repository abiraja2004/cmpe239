Several approaches have been described
for the automatic unsupervised acquisi-
tion of patterns for information extraction.
Each approach is based on a particular
model for the patterns to be acquired, such
as a predicate-argument structure or a de-
pendency chain. The effect of these al-
ternative models has not been previously
studied. In this paper, we compare the
prior models and introduce a new model,
the Subtree model, based on arbitrary sub-
trees of dependency trees. We describe
a discovery procedure for this model and
demonstrate experimentally an improve-
ment in recall using Subtree patterns.
