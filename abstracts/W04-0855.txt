It is known that whenever a system?s actions
depend on the meaning of the text being pro-
cessed, disambiguation is beneficial or even nec-
essary. The contest Senseval is an international
frame where the research in this important field
is validated in an hierarchical manner. In this
paper we present our system participating for
the first time at Senseval 3 contest on WSD,
contest developed in March-April 2004. We
present also our intentions on improving our
system, intentions occurred from the study of
results.
