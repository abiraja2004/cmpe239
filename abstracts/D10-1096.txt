In state-of-the-art approaches to information
extraction (IE), dependency graphs constitute
the fundamental data structure for syntactic
structuring and subsequent knowledge elicita-
tion from natural language documents. The
top-performing systems in the BioNLP 2009
Shared Task on Event Extraction all shared the
idea to use dependency structures generated
by a variety of parsers ? either directly or
in some converted manner ? and optionally
modified their output to fit the special needs
of IE. As there are systematic differences be-
tween various dependency representations be-
ing used in this competition, we scrutinize on
different encoding styles for dependency in-
formation and their possible impact on solv-
ing several IE tasks. After assessing more
or less established dependency representations
such as the Stanford and CoNLL-X dependen-
cies, we will then focus on trimming opera-
tions that pave the way to more effective IE.
Our evaluation study covers data from a num-
ber of constituency- and dependency-based
parsers and provides experimental evidence
which dependency representations are partic-
ularly beneficial for the event extraction task.
Based on empirical findings from our study
we were able to achieve the performance of
57.2% F-score on the development data set of
the BioNLP Shared Task 2009.
