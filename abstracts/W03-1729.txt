 
SYSTRAN?s Chinese word segmentation 
is one important component of its 
Chinese-English machine translation 
system. The Chinese word segmentation 
module uses a rule-based approach, based 
on a large dictionary and fine-grained 
linguistic rules. It works on general-
purpose texts from different Chinese-
speaking regions, with comparable 
performance. SYSTRAN participated in 
the four open tracks in the First 
International Chinese Word Segmentation 
Bakeoff. This paper gives a general 
description of the segmentation module, 
as well as the results and analysis of its 
performance in the Bakeoff.
