This paper introduces an integrative approach
to automatic word sense subjectivity annota-
tion. We use features that exploit the hier-
archical structure and domain information in
lexical resources such as WordNet, as well as
other types of features that measure the sim-
ilarity of glosses and the overlap among sets
of semantically related words. Integrated in a
machine learning framework, the entire set of
features is found to give better results than any
individual type of feature.
