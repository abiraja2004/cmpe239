Part-Of-Speech(POS) tagging is the essen-
tial basis of Natural language process-
ing(NLP). In this paper, we present an al-
gorithm that combines a variety of context
features, e.g. the POS tags of the words next
to the word a that needs to be tagged and the
context lexical information of a by Canoni-
cal Belief Network to together determine the
POS tag of a. Experiments on a Chinese cor-
pus are conducted to compare our algorithm
with the standard HMM-based POS tagging
and the POS tagging software ICTCLAS3.0.
The experimental results show that our algo-
rithm is more effective.
