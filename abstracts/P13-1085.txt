Subcategorization frames (SCFs), selec-
tional preferences (SPs) and verb classes
capture related aspects of the predicate-
argument structure. We present the first
unified framework for unsupervised learn-
ing of these three types of information.
We show how to utilize Determinantal
Point Processes (DPPs), elegant proba-
bilistic models that are defined over the
possible subsets of a given dataset and
give higher probability mass to high qual-
ity and diverse subsets, for clustering. Our
novel clustering algorithm constructs a
joint SCF-DPP DPP kernel matrix and uti-
lizes the efficient sampling algorithms of
DPPs to cluster together verbs with sim-
ilar SCFs and SPs. We evaluate the in-
duced clusters in the context of the three
tasks and show results that are superior to
strong baselines for each 1.
