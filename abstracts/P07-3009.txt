We investigate a family of update methods
for online machine learning algorithms for
cost-sensitive multiclass and structured clas-
sification problems. The update rules are
based on multinomial logistic models. The
most interesting question for such an ap-
proach is how to integrate the cost function
into the learning paradigm. We propose a
number of solutions to this problem.
To demonstrate the applicability of the al-
gorithms, we evaluated them on a number
of classification tasks related to incremental
dependency parsing. These tasks were con-
ventional multiclass classification, hiearchi-
cal classification, and a structured classifica-
tion task: complete labeled dependency tree
prediction. The performance figures of the
logistic algorithms range from slightly lower
to slightly higher than margin-based online
algorithms.
