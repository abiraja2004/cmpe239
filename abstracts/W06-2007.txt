We present an unsupervised approach to
Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD). We
automatically acquire English sense exam-
ples using an English-Chinese bilingual
dictionary, Chinese monolingual corpora
and Chinese-English machine translation
software. We then train machine learn-
ing classifiers on these sense examples
and test them on two gold standard En-
glish WSD datasets, one for binary and
the other for fine-grained sense identifica-
tion. On binary disambiguation, perfor-
mance of our unsupervised system has ap-
proached that of the state-of-the-art super-
vised ones. On multi-way disambiguation,
it has achieved a very good result that is
competitive to other state-of-the-art unsu-
pervised systems. Given the fact that our
approach does not rely on manually anno-
tated resources, such as sense-tagged data
or parallel corpora, the results are very
promising.
