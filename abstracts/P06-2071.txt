We discuss Image Sense Discrimination
(ISD), and apply a method based on spec-
tral clustering, using multimodal features
from the image and text of the embedding
web page. We evaluate our method on a
new data set of annotated web images, re-
trieved with ambiguous query terms. Ex-
periments investigate different levels of
sense granularity, as well as the impact of
text and image features, and global versus
local text features.
