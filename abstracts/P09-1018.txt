This paper revisits the pivot language ap-
proach for machine translation. First,
we investigate three different methods
for pivot translation. Then we employ
a hybrid method combining RBMT and
SMT systems to fill up the data gap
for pivot translation, where the source-
pivot and pivot-target corpora are inde-
pendent. Experimental results on spo-
ken language translation show that this
hybrid method significantly improves the
translation quality, which outperforms the
method using a source-target corpus of
the same size. In addition, we pro-
pose a system combination approach to
select better translations from those pro-
duced by various pivot translation meth-
ods. This method regards system com-
bination as a translation evaluation prob-
lem and formalizes it with a regression
learning model. Experimental results in-
dicate that our method achieves consistent
and significant improvement over individ-
ual translation outputs.
