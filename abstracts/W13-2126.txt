Paraphrasing is expressing the same se-
mantic content using different linguistic
means. Although previous work has ad-
dressed linguistic variations at different
levels of language, paraphrasing in Turk-
ish has not been yet thoroughly studied.
This paper presents the first study towards
Turkish paraphrase alignment. We per-
form an analysis of different types of para-
phrases on a modest Turkish paraphrase
corpus and present preliminary results on
that analysis from different standpoints.
We also explore the impact of human in-
terpretation of paraphrasing on the align-
ment of paraphrase sentence pairs.
