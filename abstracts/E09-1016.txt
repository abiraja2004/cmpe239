 
This paper presents a feasibility study for im-
plementing lexical morphology principles in a 
machine translation system in order to solve 
unknown words. Multilingual symbolic treat-
ment of word-formation is seducing but re-
quires an in-depth analysis of every step that 
has to be performed. The construction of a 
prototype is firstly presented, highlighting the 
methodological issues of such approach. Sec-
ondly, an evaluation is performed on a large 
set of data, showing the benefits and the limits 
of such approach.
