 
Data-driven research in linguistics typically 
involves the processes of data annotation, data 
visualization and identification of relevant pat-
terns.  We describe our experience in incorpo-
rating these processes at an undergraduate 
course on language information technology.  
Students collectively annotated the syntactic 
structures of a set of Classical Chinese poems; 
the resulting treebank was put on a platform 
for corpus search and visualization; finally, us-
ing this platform, students investigated re-
search questions about the text of the treebank.
