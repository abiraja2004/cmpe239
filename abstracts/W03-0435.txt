We used the memory-based learner Timbl
(Daelemans et al, 2002) to find names in En-
glish and German newspaper text. A first sys-
tem used only the training data, and a number
of gazetteers. The results show that gazetteers
are not beneficial in the English case, while
they are for the German data. Type-token gen-
eralization was applied, but also reduced per-
formance. The second system used gazetteers
derived from the unannotated corpus, as well as
the ratio of capitalized versus uncapitalized use
of each word. These strategies gave an increase
in performance.
