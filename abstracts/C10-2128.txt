This paper presents a survey of research
in controlled natural languages that can be
used as high-level knowledge representa-
tion languages. Over the past 10 years
or so, a number of machine-oriented con-
trolled natural languages have emerged
that can be used as high-level interface
languages to various kinds of knowledge
systems. These languages are relevant to
the area of computational linguistics since
they have two very interesting properties:
firstly, they look informal like natural lan-
guages and are therefore easier to write
and understand by humans than formal
languages; secondly, they are precisely
defined subsets of natural languages and
can be translated automatically (and often
deterministically) into a formal target lan-
guage and then be used for automated rea-
soning. We present and compare the most
mature of these novel languages, show
how they can balance the disadvantages
of natural languages and formal languages
for knowledge representation, and discuss
how domain specialists can be supported
writing specifications in controlled natural
language.
