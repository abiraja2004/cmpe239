This paper proposes a novel noise-aware char-
acter alignment method for bootstrapping sta-
tistical machine transliteration from automat-
ically extracted phrase pairs. The model is
an extension of a Bayesian many-to-many
alignment method for distinguishing non-
transliteration (noise) parts in phrase pairs. It
worked effectively in the experiments of boot-
strapping Japanese-to-English statistical ma-
chine transliteration in patent domain using
patent bilingual corpora.
