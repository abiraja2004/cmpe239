Our paper aims at capturing the distri-
bution of negative polarity items (NPIs)
within lexicalized Tree Adjoining Gram-
mar (LTAG). The condition under which
an NPI can occur in a sentence is for it to
be in the scope of a negation with no quan-
tifiers scopally intervening. We model this
restriction within a recent framework for
LTAG semantics based on semantic uni-
fication. The proposed analysis provides
features that signal the presence of a nega-
tion in the semantics and that specify its
scope. We extend our analysis to mod-
elling the interaction of NPI licensing and
neg raising constructions.
