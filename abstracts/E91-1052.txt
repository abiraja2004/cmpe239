 
Attribute grammars are an elegant formalization of the 
augmented context-free grammars characteristic ofmost 
current natural anguage systems. This paper presents 
an extension of Earley's algorithm to Knuth's attribute 
grammars, considering the case of S-attributed 
grammars. For this case, we study the conditions on 
the underlying base grammar under which the extended 
algorithm may be guaranteed to terminate. Finite 
partitioning of attribute domains is proposed to 
guarantee the termination of the algorithm, without he 
need for any restrictions on the context-free base.
