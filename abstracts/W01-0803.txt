In this paper, the issue of document
structuring is addressed. To achieve this
task, we advocate that Segmented Dis-
course Representation Theory (SDRT)
is a most expressive discourse frame-
work. Then we sketch a discourse plan-
ning mechanism which aims at pro-
ducing as many paraphrastic document
structures as possible from a set of fac-
tual data encoded into a logical form.
