 
Several computational simulations of how 
children solve the word segmentation problem 
have been proposed, but most have been 
applied only to a limited number of languages. 
One model with some experimental support 
uses distributional statistics of sound sequence 
predictability (Saffran et al 1996).  However, 
the experimental design does not fully specify 
how predictability is best measured or 
modeled in a simulation.  Saffran et al (1996) 
assume transitional probability, but Brent 
(1999a) claims mutual information (MI) is 
more appropriate.  Both assume predictability 
is measured locally, relative to neighboring 
segment-pairs. 
This paper replicates Brent?s (1999a) mutual-
information model on a corpus of child-
directed speech in Modern Greek, and 
introduces a variant model using a global 
threshold. Brent?s finding regarding the 
superiority of MI is confirmed; the relative 
performance of local comparisons and global 
thresholds depends on the evaluation metric.
