We study substitute vectors to solve the
part-of-speech ambiguity problem in an
unsupervised setting. Part-of-speech tag-
ging is a crucial preliminary process in
many natural language processing applica-
tions. Because many words in natural lan-
guages have more than one part-of-speech
tag, resolving part-of-speech ambiguity is
an important task. We claim that part-
of-speech ambiguity can be solved using
substitute vectors. A substitute vector is
constructed with possible substitutes of a
target word. This study is built on pre-
vious work which has proven that word
substitutes are very fruitful for part-of-
speech induction. Experiments show that
our methodology works for words with
high ambiguity.
