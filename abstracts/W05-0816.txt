Several algorithms are available for sen-
tence alignment, but there is a lack of
systematic evaluation and comparison of
these algorithms under different condi-
tions. In most cases, the factors which
can significantly affect the performance
of a sentence alignment algorithm have
not been considered while evaluating. We
have used a method for evaluation that
can give a better estimate about a sen-
tence alignment algorithm?s performance,
so that the best one can be selected. We
have compared four approaches using this
method. These have mostly been tried
on European language pairs. We have
evaluated manually-checked and validated
English-Hindi aligned parallel corpora un-
der different conditions. We also suggest
some guidelines on actual alignment.
