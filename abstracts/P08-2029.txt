Natural Language Processing (NLP) for Infor-
mation Retrieval has always been an interest-
ing and challenging research area. Despite the
high expectations, most of the results indicate
that successfully using NLP is very complex.
In this paper, we show how Support Vector
Machines along with kernel functions can ef-
fectively represent syntax and semantics. Our
experiments on question/answer classification
show that the above models highly improve on
bag-of-words on a TREC dataset.
