 
In this paper, we describe a search procedure for sta- 
tistical machine translation (MT) based on dynmnic 
programming (DP). Starting from a DP-based solu- 
tion to the traveling salesman problem, we present 
a novel technique to restrict the possible word re- 
ordering between source and target language in or- 
der to achieve an efficient search algorithm. A search 
restriction especially useful for tile translation di- 
rection from German to English is presented. The 
experimental tests are carried out on the Verbmo- 
bil task (Germm>English, 8000-word vocabulary), 
which is a limited-domain spoken-language task.
