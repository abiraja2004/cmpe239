We describe a boosting-based supervised
learning approach to the ?Multi-Way Clas-
sification of Semantic Relations between
Pairs of Nominals? task #8 of SemEval-
2. Participants were asked to determine
which relation, from a set of nine relations
plus ?Other?, exists between two nomi-
nals, and also to determine the roles of the
two nominals in the relation.
Our participation has focused, rather than
on the choice of a rich set of features,
on the classification model adopted to de-
termine the correct assignment of relation
and roles.
