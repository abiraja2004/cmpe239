 
This paper describes a rule-learning approach 
towards Chinese prosodic phrase prediction for 
TTS systems. Firstly, we prepared a speech 
corpus having about 3000 sentences and 
manually labelled the sentences with two-level 
prosodic structure. Secondly, candidate 
features related to prosodic phrasing and the 
corresponding prosodic boundary labels are 
extracted from the corpus text to establish an 
example database. A series of comparative 
experiments is conducted to figure out the 
most effective features from the candidates. 
Lastly, two typical rule learning algorithms 
(C4.5 and TBL) are applied on the example 
database to induce prediction rules. The paper 
also suggests general evaluation parameters for 
prosodic phrase prediction. With these 
parameters, our methods are compared with 
RNN and bigram based statistical methods on 
the same corpus. The experiments show that 
the automatic rule-learning approach can 
achieve better prediction accuracy than the 
non-rule based methods and yet retain the 
advantage of the simplicity and 
understandability of rule systems. Thus it is 
justified as an effective alternative to prosodic 
phrase prediction.
