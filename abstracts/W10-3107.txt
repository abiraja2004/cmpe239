In this initial annotation study, we sug-
gest an appropriate approach for determin-
ing the level of certainty in text, including
classification into multiple levels of cer-
tainty, types of statement and indicators of
amplified certainty. A primary evaluation,
based on pairwise inter-annotator agree-
ment (IAA) using F
1
-score, is performed
on a small corpus comprising documents
from the World Bank. While IAA results
are low, the analysis will allow further re-
finement of the created guidelines.
