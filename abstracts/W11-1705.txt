We propose a novel method to construct se-
mantic orientation lexicons using large data
and a thesaurus. To deal with large data, we
use Count-Min sketch to store the approxi-
mate counts of all word pairs in a bounded
space of 8GB. We use a thesaurus (like Roget)
to constrain near-synonymous words to have
the same polarity. This framework can easily
scale to any language with a thesaurus and a
unzipped corpus size ? 50 GB (12 billion to-
kens). We evaluate these lexicons intrinsically
and extrinsically, and they perform compara-
ble when compared to other existing lexicons.
