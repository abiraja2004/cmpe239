 
Although it is generally agreed that Word 
Sense Disambiguation (WSD) is an ap-
plication dependent task, the great major-
ity of the efforts has aimed at the devel-
opment of WSD systems without consid-
ering their application. We argue that this 
strategy is not appropriate, since some 
aspects, such as the sense repository and 
the disambiguation process itself, vary 
according to the application. Taking Ma-
chine Translation (MT) as application 
and focusing on the sense repository, we 
present evidence for this argument by ex-
amining WSD in English-Portuguese MT 
of eight sample verbs. By showing that 
the traditional monolingual WSD strate-
gies are not suitable for multilingual ap-
plications, we intend to motivate the de-
velopment of WSD methods for particu-
lar applications.
