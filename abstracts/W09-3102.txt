Whereas multilingual comparable corpora
have been used to identify translations of
words or terms, monolingual corpora can
help identify paraphrases. The present
work addresses paraphrases found be-
tween two different discourse types: spe-
cialized and lay texts. We therefore built
comparable corpora of specialized and lay
texts in order to detect equivalent lay and
specialized expressions. We identified two
devices used in such paraphrases: nomi-
nalizations and neo-classical compounds.
The results showed that the paraphrases
had a good precision and that nominaliza-
tions were indeed relevant in the context of
studying the differences between special-
ized and lay language. Neo-classical com-
pounds were less conclusive. This study
also demonstrates that simple paraphrase
acquisition methods can also work on texts
with a rather small degree of similarity,
once similar text segments are detected.
