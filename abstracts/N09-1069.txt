The (batch) EM algorithm plays an important
role in unsupervised induction, but it some-
times suffers from slow convergence. In this
paper, we show that online variants (1) provide
significant speedups and (2) can even find bet-
ter solutions than those found by batch EM.
We support these findings on four unsuper-
vised tasks: part-of-speech tagging, document
classification, word segmentation, and word
alignment.
