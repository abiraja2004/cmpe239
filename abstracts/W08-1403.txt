 
Hall? Norden is a web site with information 
regarding mobility between the Nordic coun-
tries in five different languages; Swedish, 
Danish, Norwegian, Icelandic and Finnish.  
We wanted to create a Nordic cross-language 
dictionary for the use in a cross-language 
search engine for Hall? Norden. The entire 
set of texts on the web site was treated as one 
multilingual parallel corpus. From this we 
extracted parallel corpora for each language 
pair. The corpora were very sparse, contain-
ing on average less than 80 000 words per 
language pair. We have used the Uplug word 
alignment system (Tiedemann 2003a), for the 
creation of the dictionaries. The results gave 
on average 213 new dictionary words (fre-
quency > 3) per language pair. The average 
error rate was 16 percent. Different combina-
tions with Finnish had a higher error rate, 33 
percent, whereas the error rate for the re-
maining language pairs only yielded on aver-
age 9 percent errors. The high error rate for 
Finnish is possibly due to the fact that the 
Finnish language belongs to a different lan-
guage family. Although the corpora were 
very sparse the word alignment results for the 
combinations of Swedish, Danish, Norwe-
gian and Icelandic were surprisingly good 
compared to other experiments with larger 
corpora.
