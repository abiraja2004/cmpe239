We present a method for producing a
bird?s-eye view of statements that are ex-
pressed on Web pages on a given topic.
This method aggregates statements that
are relevant to the topic, and shows con-
tradictory and contrastive relations among
them. This view of contradictions and
contrasts helps users acquire a top-down
understanding of the topic. To realize
this, we extract such statements and re-
lations, including cross-document implicit
contrastive relations between statements,
in an unsupervised manner. Our experi-
mental results indicate the effectiveness of
our approach.
