Numerous sentiment analysis applications
make usage of a sentiment lexicon. In
this paper we present experiments on hy-
brid sentiment lexicon acquisition. The ap-
proach is corpus-based and thus suitable
for languages lacking general dictionary-
based resources. The approach is a hy-
brid two-step process that combines semi-
supervised graph-based algorithms and su-
pervised models. We evaluate the perfor-
mance on three tasks that capture differ-
ent aspects of a sentiment lexicon: polar-
ity ranking task, polarity regression task,
and sentiment classification task. Exten-
sive evaluation shows that the results are
comparable to those of a well-known senti-
ment lexicon SentiWordNet on the polarity
ranking task. On the sentiment classifica-
tion task, the results are also comparable to
SentiWordNet when restricted to monosen-
timous (all senses carry the same senti-
ment) words. This is satisfactory, given the
absence of explicit semantic relations be-
tween words in the corpus.
