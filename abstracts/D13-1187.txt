Different demographics, e.g., gender or age,
can demonstrate substantial variation in their
language use, particularly in informal contexts
such as social media. In this paper we focus on
learning gender differences in the use of sub-
jective language in English, Spanish, and Rus-
sian Twitter data, and explore cross-cultural
differences in emoticon and hashtag use for
male and female users. We show that gen-
der differences in subjective language can ef-
fectively be used to improve sentiment anal-
ysis, and in particular, polarity classification
for Spanish and Russian. Our results show
statistically significant relative F-measure im-
provement over the gender-independent base-
line 1.5% and 1% for Russian, 2% and 0.5%
for Spanish, and 2.5% and 5% for English for
polarity and subjectivity classification.
