 
Recent work on natural language processing 
systems is aimed at more conversational, 
context-adaptive systems in multiple do-
mains. An important requirement for such a 
system is the automatic detection of the do-
main and a domain consistency check of the 
given speech recognition hypotheses. We 
report a pilot study addressing these tasks, 
the underlying data collection and investi-
gate the feasibility of annotating the data re-
liably by human annotators.
