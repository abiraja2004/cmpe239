We propose a method that automat-
ically generates paraphrase sets from
seed sentences to be used as refer-
ence sets in objective machine trans-
lation evaluation measures like BLEU
and NIST. We measured the quality
of the paraphrases produced in an ex-
periment, i.e., (i) their grammatical-
ity: at least 99% correct sentences;
(ii) their equivalence in meaning: at
least 96% correct paraphrases either
by meaning equivalence or entailment;
and, (iii) the amount of internal lexi-
cal and syntactical variation in a set of
paraphrases: slightly superior to that
of hand-produced sets. The paraphrase
sets produced by this method thus seem
adequate as reference sets to be used for
MT evaluation.
