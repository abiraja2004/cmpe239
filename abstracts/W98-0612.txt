 
A great deal of psycholinguistic f ndings reveal that context highlights or obscures 
certain aspects in the meaning of a word (viz., word sense modulation). Computational 
models of lexicon, however, are mostly concerned with the ways context selects a 
meaning for a word (word sense selection). In this paper, we propose a model that 
combines sense selection with sense modulation. Word senses in this proposal consist of 
a sense-concept and a sense-view. Furthermore, we outline an exemplar-based approach 
in which se~se-views are developed gradually and incrementally. A prototype 
implementation of this model for sentential context isalso briefly discussed.
