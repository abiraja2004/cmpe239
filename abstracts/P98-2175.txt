 
An open, extendible multi-dictionary sys- 
tem is introduced in the paper. It supports 
the translator in accessing adequate ntries 
of various bi- and monolingual dictionaries 
and translation examples from parallel cor- 
pora. Simultaneously an unlimited number 
of dictionaries can be held open, thus by a 
single interrogation step, all the dictionaries 
(translations, explanations, ynonyms, etc.) 
can be surveyed. The implemented system 
(called MoBiDic) knows morphological 
rules of the dictionaries' languages. Thus, 
never the actual (inflected) words, but al- 
ways their lemmas - that is, the right dic- 
tionary entries - are looked up. MoBiDic 
has an open, multimedial architecture, thus 
it is suitable for handling not only textual, 
but speaking or picture dictionaries, as well. 
The same system is also able to find words 
and expressions in corpora, dynamically 
providing the translators with examples 
from their earlier translations or other 
translators' works. MoBiDic has been de- 
signed for translator workgroups, where the 
translators' own glossaries (built also with 
the help of the system) may also be dis- 
seminated among the members of the 
group, with different access rights, if 
needed. The system has a TCP/IP-based 
client-server implementation for various 
platforms and available with a gradually in- 
creasing number of dictionaries for numer- 
ous language pairs.
