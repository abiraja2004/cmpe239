We propose a tuning method for statistical ma-
chine translation, based on the pairwise rank-
ing approach. Hopkins and May (2011) pre-
sented a method that uses a binary classifier.
In this work, we use linear regression and
show that our approach is as effective as us-
ing a binary classifier and converges faster.
