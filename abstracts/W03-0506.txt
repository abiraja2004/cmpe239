For one document, current summarization sys-
tems produce a uniform version of summary
for all users. Personalized summarizations are
necessary in order to represent users? prefer-
ences and interests. Annotation is getting im-
portant for document sharing and
collaborative filtering, which in fact record
users? dynamic behaviors compared to tradi-
tional steady profiles. In this paper we intro-
duce a new summarization system based on
users? annotations. Annotations and their con-
texts are extracted to represent features of sen-
tences, which are given different weights for
representation of the document. Our system
produces two versions of summaries for each
document: generic summary without consider-
ing annotations and annotation-based sum-
mary. Since annotation is a kind of personal
data, annotation-based summary is tailored to
user?s interests to some extent. We show by
experiments that annotations can help a lot in
improving summarization performance com-
pared to no annotation consideration. At the
same time, we make an extensive study on us-
ers? annotating behaviors and annotations dis-
tribution, and propose a variety of techniques
to evaluate the relationships between annota-
tions and summaries, such as how the number
of annotations affects the summarizing per-
formance. A study about collaborative filter-
ing is also made to evaluate the
summarization based on annotations of similar
users.
