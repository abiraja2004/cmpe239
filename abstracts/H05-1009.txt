This paper presents a novel approach to
combining different word alignments. We
view word alignment as a pattern classifi-
cation problem, where alignment combi-
nation is treated as a classifier ensemble,
and alignment links are adorned with lin-
guistic features. A neural network model
is used to learn word alignments from the
individual alignment systems. We show
that our alignment combination approach
yields a significant 20-34% relative er-
ror reduction over the best-known align-
ment combination technique on English-
Spanish and English-Chinese data.
