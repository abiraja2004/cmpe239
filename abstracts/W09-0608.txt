This paper introduces a class-based ap-
proach to ordering prenominal modifiers.
Modifiers are grouped into broad classes
based on where they tend to occur prenom-
inally, and a framework is developed to or-
der sets of modifiers based on their classes.
This system is developed to generate sev-
eral orderings for modifiers with more
flexible positional constraints, and lends
itself to bootstrapping for the classification
of previously unseen modifiers.
