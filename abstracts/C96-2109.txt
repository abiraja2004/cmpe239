 
This paper describes an operational se- 
mantics for DATR theories. The seman- 
tics is presented as a set of inference rules 
that axiomatises the evaluation relation- 
ship for DATR expressions. The infer- 
ence rules provide a clear picture of the 
way in which DATR works, and should 
lead to a better understanding of the 
mathematical nd computational prop- 
erties of the language.
