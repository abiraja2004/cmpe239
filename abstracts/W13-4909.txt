We propose the use of the word categories and
embeddings induced from raw text as auxil-
iary features in dependency parsing. To in-
duce word features, we make use of contex-
tual, morphologic and orthographic properties
of the words. To exploit the contextual infor-
mation, we make use of substitute words, the
most likely substitutes for target words, gen-
erated by using a statistical language model.
We generate morphologic and orthographic
properties of word types in an unsupervised
manner. We use a co-occurrence model with
these properties to embed words onto a 25-
dimensional unit sphere. The AI-KU sys-
tem shows improvements for some of the lan-
guages it is trained on for the first Shared Task
of Statistical Parsing of Morphologically Rich
Languages.
