We present a method for incorporat-
ing arbitrary context-informed word at-
tributes into statistical machine trans-
lation by clustering attribute-qualified
source words, and smoothing their
word translation probabilities using bi-
nary decision trees. We describe two
ways in which the decision trees are
used in machine translation: by us-
ing the attribute-qualified source word
clusters directly, or by using attribute-
dependent lexical translation probabil-
ities that are obtained from the trees,
as a lexical smoothing feature in the de-
coder model. We present experiments
using Arabic-to-English newswire data,
and using Arabic diacritics and part-of-
speech as source word attributes, and
show that the proposed method im-
proves on a state-of-the-art translation
system.
