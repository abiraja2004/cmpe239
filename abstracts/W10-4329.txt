In spoken communications, correction ut-
terances, which are utterances correct-
ing other participants utterances and be-
haviors, play crucial roles, and detecting
them is one of the key issues. Previ-
ously, much work has been done on au-
tomatic detection of correction utterances
in human-human and human-computer di-
alogs, but they mostly dealt with the cor-
rection of erroneous utterances. How-
ever, in many real situations, especially in
communications between humans and mo-
bile robots, the misunderstandings man-
ifest themselves not only through utter-
ances but also through physical actions
performed by the participants. In this pa-
per, we focus on action corrections and
propose a classification of such utterances
into Omission, Commission, and Degree
corrections. We present the results of our
analysis of correction utterances in dialogs
between two humans who were engaging
in a kind of on-line computer game, where
one participant plays the role of the re-
mote manager of a convenience store, and
the other plays the role of a robot store
clerk. We analyze the linguistic content,
prosody as well as the timing of correction
utterances and found that all features were
significantly correlated with action correc-
tions.
