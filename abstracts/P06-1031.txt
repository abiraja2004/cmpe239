This paper proposes a method for detect-
ing errors in article usage and singular plu-
ral usage based on the mass count distinc-
tion. First, it learns decision lists from
training data generated automatically to
distinguish mass and count nouns. Then,
in order to improve its performance, it is
augmented by feedback that is obtained
from the writing of learners. Finally, it de-
tects errors by applying rules to the mass
count distinction. Experiments show that
it achieves a recall of 0.71 and a preci-
sion of 0.72 and outperforms other meth-
ods used for comparison when augmented
by feedback.
