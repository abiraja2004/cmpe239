We present and compare two approaches
to the task of summarizing evaluative ar-
guments. The first is a sentence extraction-
based approach while the second is a lan-
guage generation-based approach. We
evaluate these approaches in a user study
and find that they quantitatively perform
equally well. Qualitatively, however, we
find that they perform well for different but
complementary reasons. We conclude that
an effective method for summarizing eval-
uative arguments must effectively synthe-
size the two approaches.
