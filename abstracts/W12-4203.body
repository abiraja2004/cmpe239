This paper presents an approach to improving
performance of statistical machine translation
by automatically creating new training data
for difficult to translate phenomena. In partic-
ular this contribution is targeted towards tack-
ling the poor performance of a state-of-the-art
system on negated sentences. The corpus ex-
pansion is achieved by high quality rephrasing
of existing sentences to their negated counter-
parts making use of semantic transfer. The
method is designed to work on both sides of
the parallel corpus while preserving the align-
ment. Our results show an overall improve-
ment of 0.16 BLEU points, with a statisti-
cally significant increase of 1.63 BLEU points
when tested on only negated test data.
