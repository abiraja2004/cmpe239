This paper describes a hybrid model that
combines a rule-based model with two
statistical models for the task of POS
guessing of Chinese unknown words. The
rule-based model is sensitive to the type,
length, and internal structure of unknown
words, and the two statistical models uti-
lize contextual information and the like-
lihood for a character to appear in a par-
ticular position of words of a particular
length and POS category. By combining
models that use different sources of infor-
mation, the hybrid model achieves a pre-
cision of 89%, a significant improvement
over the best result reported in previous
studies, which was 69%.
