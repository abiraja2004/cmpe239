This paper describes our system for the
classification of argument coercion for
SemEval-2010 Task 7. We present two ap-
proaches to classifying an argument?s se-
mantic class, which is then compared to
the predicate?s expected semantic class to
detect coercions. The first approach is
based on learning the members of an arbi-
trary semantic class using WordNet?s hy-
pernymy structure. The second approach
leverages automatically extracted seman-
tic parse information from a large corpus
to identify similar arguments by the pred-
icates that select them. We show the re-
sults these approaches obtain on the task
as well as how they can improve a tradi-
tional feature-based approach.
