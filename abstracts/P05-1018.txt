This paper considers the problem of auto-
matic assessment of local coherence. We
present a novel entity-based representa-
tion of discourse which is inspired by Cen-
tering Theory and can be computed au-
tomatically from raw text. We view co-
herence assessment as a ranking learning
problem and show that the proposed dis-
course representation supports the effec-
tive learning of a ranking function. Our
experiments demonstrate that the induced
model achieves significantly higher ac-
curacy than a state-of-the-art coherence
model.
