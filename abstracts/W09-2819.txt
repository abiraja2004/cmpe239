We present an approach to generating refer-
ring expressions in context utilizing feature se-
lection informed by psycholinguistic research.
Features suggested by studies on pronoun in-
terpretation were used to train a classifier sys-
tem which determined the most appropriate
selection from a list of possible references.
This application demonstrates one way to help
bridge the gap between computational and
empirical means of reference generation.
