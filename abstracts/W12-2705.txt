Modeling of foreign entity names is an im-
portant unsolved problem in morpheme-based
modeling that is common in morphologically
rich languages. In this paper we present an
unsupervised vocabulary adaptation method
for morph-based speech recognition. Foreign
word candidates are detected automatically
from in-domain text through the use of letter
n-gram perplexity. Over-segmented foreign
entity names are restored to their base forms in
the morph-segmented in-domain text for eas-
ier and more reliable modeling and recogni-
tion. The adapted pronunciation rules are fi-
nally generated with a trainable grapheme-to-
phoneme converter. In ASR performance the
unsupervised method almost matches the abil-
ity of supervised adaptation in correctly rec-
ognizing foreign entity names.
