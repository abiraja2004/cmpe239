Recent systems have been developed for
sentiment classification, opinion recogni-
tion, and opinion analysis (e.g., detect-
ing polarity and strength). We pursue an-
other aspect of opinion analysis: identi-
fying the sources of opinions, emotions,
and sentiments. We view this problem as
an information extraction task and adopt
a hybrid approach that combines Con-
ditional Random Fields (Lafferty et al,
2001) and a variation of AutoSlog (Riloff,
1996a). While CRFs model source iden-
tification as a sequence tagging task, Au-
toSlog learns extraction patterns. Our re-
sults show that the combination of these
two methods performs better than either
one alone. The resulting system identifies
opinion sources with 79.3% precision and
59.5% recall using a head noun matching
measure, and 81.2% precision and 60.6%
recall using an overlap measure.
