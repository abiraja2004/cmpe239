Predicting possible code-switching points can
help develop more accurate methods for au-
tomatically processing mixed-language text,
such as multilingual language models for
speech recognition systems and syntactic an-
alyzers. We present in this paper exploratory
results on learning to predict potential code-
switching points in Spanish-English. We
trained different learning algorithms using a
transcription of code-switched discourse. To
evaluate the performance of the classifiers, we
used two different criteria: 1) measuring pre-
cision, recall, and F-measure of the predic-
tions against the reference in the transcrip-
tion, and 2) rating the naturalness of artifi-
cially generated code-switched sentences. Av-
erage scores for the code-switched sentences
generated by our machine learning approach
were close to the scores of those generated by
humans.
