In this paper we present a method for extracting
bilingual terminologies from comparable corpora.
In our approach we treat bilingual term extrac-
tion as a classification problem. For classification
we use an SVM binary classifier and training data
taken from the EUROVOC thesaurus. We test our
approach on a held-out test set from EUROVOC
and perform precision, recall and f-measure eval-
uations for 20 European language pairs. The per-
formance of our classifier reaches the 100% pre-
cision level for many language pairs. We also
perform manual evaluation on bilingual terms ex-
tracted from English-German term-tagged compa-
rable corpora. The results of this manual evalu-
ation showed 60-83% of the term pairs generated
are exact translations and over 90% exact or partial
translations.
