We explore the application of neural language
models to machine translation. We develop a
new model that combines the neural proba-
bilistic language model of Bengio et al, rec-
tified linear units, and noise-contrastive esti-
mation, and we incorporate it into a machine
translation system both by reranking k-best
lists and by direct integration into the decoder.
Our large-scale, large-vocabulary experiments
across four language pairs show that our neu-
ral language model improves translation qual-
ity by up to 1.1 Bleu.
