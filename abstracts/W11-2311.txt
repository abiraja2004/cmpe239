This paper describes a machine translation
system that offers many deaf and hearing-
impaired people the chance to access pub-
lished information in Arabic by translating
text into their first language, Arabic Sign Lan-
guage (ArSL). The system was created under
the close guidance of a team that included
three deaf native signers and one ArSL in-
terpreter. We discuss problems inherent in
the design and development of such transla-
tion systems and review previous ArSL ma-
chine translation systems, which all too often
demonstrate a lack of collaboration between
engineers and the deaf community. We de-
scribe and explain in detail both the adapted
translation approach chosen for the proposed
system and the ArSL corpus that we collected
for this purpose. The corpus has 203 signed
sentences (with 710 distinct signs) with con-
tent restricted to the domain of instructional
language as typically used in deaf education.
Evaluation shows that the system produces
translated sign sentences outputs with an av-
erage word error rate of 46.7% and an average
position error rate of 29.4% using leave-one-
out cross validation. The most frequent source
of errors is missing signs in the corpus; this
could be addressed in future by collecting
more corpus material.
