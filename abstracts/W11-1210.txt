Supervised learning algorithms for identify-
ing comparable sentence pairs from a domi-
nantly non-parallel corpora require resources
for computing feature functions as well as
training the classifier. In this paper we pro-
pose active learning techniques for addressing
the problem of building comparable data for
low-resource languages. In particular we pro-
pose strategies to elicit two kinds of annota-
tions from comparable sentence pairs: class
label assignment and parallel segment extrac-
tion. We also propose an active learning strat-
egy for these two annotations that performs
significantly better than when sampling for ei-
ther of the annotations independently.
