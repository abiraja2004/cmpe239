In this paper we propose an instance based
method for lexical entailment and apply
it to automatic ontology population from
text. The approach is fully unsupervised and
based on kernel methods. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our technique largely
surpassing both the random and most fre-
quent baselines and outperforming current
state-of-the-art unsupervised approaches on
a benchmark ontology available in the liter-
ature.
