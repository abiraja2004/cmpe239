Although traditionally seen as a language-
independent task, collocation extraction
relies nowadays more and more on the
linguistic preprocessing of texts (e.g.,
lemmatization, POS tagging, chunking or
parsing) prior to the application of sta-
tistical measures. This paper provides
a language-oriented review of the exist-
ing extraction work. It points out sev-
eral language-specific issues related to ex-
traction and proposes a strategy for cop-
ing with them. It then describes a hybrid
extraction system based on a multilingual
parser. Finally, it presents a case-study on
the performance of an association measure
across a number of languages.
