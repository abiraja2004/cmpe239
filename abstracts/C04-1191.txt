We present an automatic approach to learn-
ing criteria for classifying the parts-of-speech
used in lexical mappings. This will fur-
ther automate our knowledge acquisition sys-
tem for non-technical users. The criteria for
the speech parts are based on the types of
the denoted terms along with morphological
and corpus-based clues. Associations among
these and the parts-of-speech are learned us-
ing the lexical mappings contained in the Cyc
knowledge base as training data. With over
30 speech parts to choose from, the classifier
achieves good results (77.8% correct). Ac-
curate results (93.0%) are achieved in the
special case of the mass-count distinction for
nouns. Comparable results are also obtained
using OpenCyc (73.1% general and 88.4%
mass-count).
