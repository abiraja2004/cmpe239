We present a model for discourse co-
herence which combines the local entity-
based approach of (Barzilay and Lapata,
2005) and the HMM-based content model
of (Barzilay and Lee, 2004). Unlike the
mixture model of (Soricut and Marcu,
2006), we learn local and global features
jointly, providing a better theoretical ex-
planation of how they are useful. As the
local component of our model we adapt
(Barzilay and Lapata, 2005) by relaxing
independence assumptions so that it is ef-
fective when estimated generatively. Our
model performs the ordering task compet-
itively with (Soricut and Marcu, 2006),
and significantly better than either of the
models it is based on.
