The goal of this paper is to show how
to accomplish a more enjoyable and en-
thusiastic dialogue through the analysis
of human-to-human conversational dia-
logues. We first created a conversational
dialogue corpus annotated with two types
of tags: one type indicates the particu-
lar aspects of the utterance itself, while
the other indicates the degree of enthusi-
asm. We then investigated the relationship
between these tags. Our results indicate
that affective and cooperative utterances
are significant to enthusiastic dialogue.
