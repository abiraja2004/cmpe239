We determine the productivity of determin-
erless PPs in German quantitatively, restrict-
ing ourselves to the preposition unter. The
study is based on two German newspa-
per corpora, comprising some 210 million
words. The problematic construction, i.e.
unter followed by a determinerless singular
noun occurs some 16.000 times in the cor-
pus. To clarify the empirical productivity
of the construction, we apply a productivity
measure developed by Baayen (2001) to the
syntactic domain by making use of statisti-
cal models suggested in Evert (2004). We
compare two different models and suggest a
gradient descent search for parameter esti-
mation. Our results show that the combina-
tion of unter+noun must in fact be character-
ized as productive, and hence that a syntactic
treatment is required.
