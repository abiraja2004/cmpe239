The detection of prosodic characteristics is an im-
portant aspect of both speech synthesis and speech
recognition. Correct placement of pitch accents aids
in more natural sounding speech, while automatic
detection of accents can contribute to better word-
level recognition and better textual understanding.
In this paper we investigate probabilistic, contex-
tual, and phonological factors that influence pitch
accent placement in natural, conversational speech
in a sequence labeling setting. We introduce Con-
ditional Random Fields (CRFs) to pitch accent pre-
diction task in order to incorporate these factors ef-
ficiently in a sequence model. We demonstrate the
usefulness and the incremental effect of these fac-
tors in a sequence model by performing experiments
on hand labeled data from the Switchboard Corpus.
Our model outperforms the baseline and previous
models of pitch accent prediction on the Switch-
board Corpus.
