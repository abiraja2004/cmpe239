The goals of my dissertation are: 1) to pro-
pose a French terminology for the presen-
tation of evaluation results of automatic
summaries, 2) to identify and describe
experimental variables in evaluations of
automatic summaries, 3) to highlight the
most common tendencies, inconsistencies
and methodological problems in summa-
rization evaluation experiments, and 4)
to make recommendations for the presen-
tation of evaluation results of automatic
summaries. In this paper, I focus on the
second objective, i.e. identifying and de-
scribing variables in summarization eval-
uation experiments.
