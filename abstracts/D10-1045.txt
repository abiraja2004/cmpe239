There is considerable interest in interdis-
ciplinary combinations of automatic speech
recognition (ASR), machine learning, natu-
ral language processing, text classification and
information retrieval. Many of these boxes,
especially ASR, are often based on consid-
erable linguistic resources. We would like
to be able to process spoken documents with
few (if any) resources. Moreover, connect-
ing black boxes in series tends to multiply er-
rors, especially when the key terms are out-of-
vocabulary (OOV). The proposed alternative
applies text processing directly to the speech
without a dependency on ASR. The method
finds long (? 1 sec) repetitions in speech,
and clusters them into pseudo-terms (roughly
phrases). Document clustering and classi-
fication work surprisingly well on pseudo-
terms; performance on a Switchboard task ap-
proaches a baseline using gold standard man-
ual transcriptions.
