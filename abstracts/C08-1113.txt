We address corpus building situations,
where complete annotations to the whole
corpus is time consuming and unrealistic.
Thus, annotation is done only on crucial
part of sentences, or contains unresolved
label ambiguities. We propose a parame-
ter estimation method for Conditional Ran-
dom Fields (CRFs), which enables us to
use such incomplete annotations. We show
promising results of our method as applied
to two types of NLP tasks: a domain adap-
tation task of a Japanese word segmenta-
tion using partial annotations, and a part-
of-speech tagging task using ambiguous
tags in the Penn treebank corpus.
