In this paper we present a statistical
transliteration technique that is language
independent. This technique uses statis-
tical alignment models and Conditional
Random Fields (CRF). Statistical align-
ment models maximizes the probability of
the observed (source, target) word pairs
using the expectation maximization algo-
rithm and then the character level align-
ments are set to maximum posterior pre-
dictions of the model. CRF has efficient
training and decoding processes which is
conditioned on both source and target lan-
guages and produces globally optimal so-
lution.
