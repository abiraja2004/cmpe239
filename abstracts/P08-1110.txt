We define a new formalism, based on Sikkel?s
parsing schemata for constituency parsers,
that can be used to describe, analyze and com-
pare dependency parsing algorithms. This
abstraction allows us to establish clear rela-
tions between several existing projective de-
pendency parsers and prove their correctness.
