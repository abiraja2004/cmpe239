We study the impact of syntactic and shallow
semantic information in automatic classifi-
cation of questions and answers and answer
re-ranking. We define (a) new tree struc-
tures based on shallow semantics encoded
in Predicate Argument Structures (PASs)
and (b) new kernel functions to exploit the
representational power of such structures
with Support Vector Machines. Our ex-
periments suggest that syntactic information
helps tasks such as question/answer classifi-
cation and that shallow semantics gives re-
markable contribution when a reliable set of
PASs can be extracted, e.g. from answers.
