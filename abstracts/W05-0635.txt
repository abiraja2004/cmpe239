In this paper we introduce a semantic role
labeling system constructed on top of the
full syntactic analysis of text. The la-
beling problem is modeled using a rich
set of lexical, syntactic, and semantic at-
tributes and learned using one-versus-all
AdaBoost classifiers.
Our results indicate that even a simple ap-
proach that assumes that each semantic ar-
gument maps into exactly one syntactic
phrase obtains encouraging performance,
surpassing the best system that uses par-
tial syntax by almost 6%.
