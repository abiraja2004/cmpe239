We combine lexical, syntactic, and discourse
features to produce a highly predictive model
of human readers? judgments of text readabil-
ity. This is the first study to take into ac-
count such a variety of linguistic factors and
the first to empirically demonstrate that dis-
course relations are strongly associated with
the perceived quality of text. We show that
various surface metrics generally expected to
be related to readability are not very good pre-
dictors of readability judgments in our Wall
Street Journal corpus. We also establish that
readability predictors behave differently de-
pending on the task: predicting text readabil-
ity or ranking the readability. Our experi-
ments indicate that discourse relations are the
one class of features that exhibits robustness
across these two tasks.
