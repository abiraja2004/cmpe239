Syntactic structures, by their nature, re-
flect first and foremost the formal con-
structions used for expressing meanings.
This renders them sensitive to formal vari-
ation both within and across languages,
and limits their value to semantic ap-
plications. We present UCCA, a novel
multi-layered framework for semantic rep-
resentation that aims to accommodate the
semantic distinctions expressed through
linguistic utterances. We demonstrate
UCCA?s portability across domains and
languages, and its relative insensitivity
to meaning-preserving syntactic variation.
We also show that UCCA can be ef-
fectively and quickly learned by annota-
tors with no linguistic background, and
describe the compilation of a UCCA-
annotated corpus.
