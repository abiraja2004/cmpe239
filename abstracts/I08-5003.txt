In this paper we first present a brief discus-
sion of the problem of Named Entity Recog-
nition (NER) in the context of the IJCNLP
workshop on NER for South and South East
Asian (SSEA) languages1 . We also present a
short report on the development of a named
entity annotated corpus in five South Asian
language, namely Hindi, Bengali, Telugu,
Oriya and Urdu. We present some details
about a new named entity tagset used for this
corpus and describe the annotation guide-
lines. Since the corpus was used for a shared
task, we also explain the evaluation mea-
sures used for the task. We then present
the results of our experiments on a baseline
which uses a maximum entropy based ap-
proach. Finally, we give an overview of the
papers to be presented at the workshop, in-
cluding those from the shared task track. We
discuss the results obtained by teams partic-
ipating in the task and compare their results
with the baseline results.
