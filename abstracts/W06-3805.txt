We study how two graph algorithms ap-
ply to topic-driven summarization in the
scope of Document Understanding Con-
ferences. The DUC 2005 and 2006 tasks
were to summarize into 250 words a col-
lection of documents on a topic consist-
ing of a few statements or questions.
Our algorithms select sentences for ex-
traction. We measure their performance
on the DUC 2005 test data, using the Sum-
mary Content Units made available after
the challenge. One algorithm matches a
graph representing the entire topic against
each sentence in the collection. The
other algorithm checks, for pairs of open-
class words in the topic, whether they can
be connected in the syntactic graph of
each sentence. Matching performs bet-
ter than connecting words, but a combi-
nation of both methods works best. They
also both favour longer sentences, which
makes summaries more fluent.
