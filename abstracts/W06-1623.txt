We consider the problem of constructing
a directed acyclic graph that encodes tem-
poral relations found in a text. The unit of
our analysis is a temporal segment, a frag-
ment of text that maintains temporal co-
herence. The strength of our approach lies
in its ability to simultaneously optimize
pairwise ordering preferences and global
constraints on the graph topology. Our
learning method achieves 83% F-measure
in temporal segmentation and 84% accu-
racy in inferring temporal relations be-
tween two segments.
