This research focuses on determining seman-
tic compositionality of word expressions us-
ing word space models (WSMs). We discuss
previous works employing WSMs and present
differences in the proposed approaches which
include types of WSMs, corpora, preprocess-
ing techniques, methods for determining com-
positionality, and evaluation testbeds.
We also present results of our own approach
for determining the semantic compositionality
based on comparing distributional vectors of
expressions and their components. The vec-
tors were obtained by Latent Semantic Analy-
sis (LSA) applied to the ukWaC corpus. Our
results outperform those of all the participants
in the Distributional Semantics and Composi-
tionality (DISCO) 2011 shared task.
