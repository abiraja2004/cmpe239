We present a simple and novel classifier-based
preordering approach. Unlike existing pre-
ordering models, we train feature-rich dis-
criminative classifiers that directly predict the
target-side word order. Our approach com-
bines the strengths of lexical reordering and
syntactic preordering models by performing
long-distance reorderings using the structure
of the parse tree, while utilizing a discrimina-
tive model with a rich set of features, includ-
ing lexical features. We present extensive ex-
periments on 22 language pairs, including pre-
ordering into English from 7 other languages.
We obtain improvements of up to 1.4 BLEU
on language pairs in the WMT 2010 shared
task. For languages from different families the
improvements often exceed 2 BLEU. Many of
these gains are also significant in human eval-
uations.
