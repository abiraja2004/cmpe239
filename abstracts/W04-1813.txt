 
This paper introduces new specificity 
determining methods for terms based on 
information theoretic measures. The 
specificity of terms represents the quantity of 
domain specific information that is contained 
in the terms. Compositional and contextual   
information of terms are used in proposed 
methods. As the methods don?t rely on domain 
dependent information, they can be applied to 
other domains without extra processes.  
Experiments showed very promising results 
with the precision 82.0% when applied to the 
terms in MeSH thesaurus.
