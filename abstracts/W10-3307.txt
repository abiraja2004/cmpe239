Increasing biosurveillance capacity is a
public health priority in both the devel-
oped and the developing world. Effec-
tive syndromic surveillance is especially
important if we are to successfully iden-
tify and monitor disease outbreaks in their
early stages. This paper describes the
construction and preliminary evaluation
of a syndromic surveillance orientated ap-
plication ontology designed to facilitate
the early identification of Influenza-Like-
Illness syndrome from Emergency Room
clinical reports using natural language
processing.
