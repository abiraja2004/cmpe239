This paper proposes a new framework for
a spoken dialogue system based on dia-
logue examples between human subjects
and the Wizard of OZ (WOZ) system. Us-
ing this framework and a model of infor-
mation retrieval dialogue, a spoken dia-
logue system for retrieving shop informa-
tion while driving in a car has been de-
signed. The system refers to the dialogue
examples to find an example that is suit-
able for generating a query or a reply. The
authors have also constructed a large-scale
dialogue database using a WOZ system,
which enables efficient collection of dia-
logue examples.
