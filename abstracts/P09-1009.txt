We investigate the task of unsupervised
constituency parsing from bilingual par-
allel corpora. Our goal is to use bilin-
gual cues to learn improved parsing mod-
els for each language and to evaluate these
models on held-out monolingual test data.
We formulate a generative Bayesian model
which seeks to explain the observed par-
allel data through a combination of bilin-
gual and monolingual parameters. To this
end, we adapt a formalism known as un-
ordered tree alignment to our probabilistic
setting. Using this formalism, our model
loosely binds parallel trees while allow-
ing language-specific syntactic structure.
We perform inference under this model us-
ing Markov Chain Monte Carlo and dy-
namic programming. Applying this model
to three parallel corpora (Korean-English,
Urdu-English, and Chinese-English) we
find substantial performance gains over
the CCM model, a strong monolingual
baseline. On average, across a variety of
testing scenarios, our model achieves an
8.8 absolute gain in F-measure. 1
