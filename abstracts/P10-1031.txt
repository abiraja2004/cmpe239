Extracting knowledge from unstructured
text is a long-standing goal of NLP. Al-
though learning approaches to many of its
subtasks have been developed (e.g., pars-
ing, taxonomy induction, information ex-
traction), all end-to-end solutions to date
require heavy supervision and/or manual
engineering, limiting their scope and scal-
ability. We present OntoUSP, a system that
induces and populates a probabilistic on-
tology using only dependency-parsed text
as input. OntoUSP builds on the USP
unsupervised semantic parser by jointly
forming ISA and IS-PART hierarchies of
lambda-form clusters. The ISA hierar-
chy allows more general knowledge to
be learned, and the use of smoothing for
parameter estimation. We evaluate On-
toUSP by using it to extract a knowledge
base from biomedical abstracts and an-
swer questions. OntoUSP improves on
the recall of USP by 47% and greatly
outperforms previous state-of-the-art ap-
proaches.
