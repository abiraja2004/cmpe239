 
In this paper we present a psycholinguistically 
motivated architecture and its prototypical 
implementation for an incremental conceptu- 
alizer, which monitors dynamic hanges in the 
world and simultaneously generates warnings 
for (possibly) safety-critical developments. It 
does so by conceptualizing events and build- 
ing up a hierarchical knowledge representa- 
tion of the perceived states of affairs. If it 
detects a safety problem, it selects suitable 
elements from the representation for a warn- 
ing, brings them into an appropriate order, and 
generates incremental preverbal messages 
(propositional structures) from them, which 
can be taken by a subsequent component to 
encode them linguistically.
