 
In this paper, we propose a practical 
method to detect Japanese homophone 
errors in Japanese texts. It is very 
important o detect homophone rrors 
in Japanese revision systems because 
Japanese texts suffer from homophone 
errors frequently. In order to detect ho- 
mophone errors, we have only to solve 
the homophone problem. We can use the 
decision list to do it because the homo- 
phone problem is equivalent to the word 
sense disambiguation problem. However, 
the homophone problem is different from 
the word sense disambiguation problem 
because the former can use the written 
word but the latter cannot. In this pa- 
per, we incorporate the written word into 
the original decision list by obtaining the 
identifying strength of the written word. 
The improved ecision list can raise the 
F-measure of error detection.
