 
This paper describes a system aimed at auto-
matically scoring two task types of high and 
medium-high linguistic entropy from a spoken 
English test with a total of six widely differing 
task types. 
We describe the speech recognizer used for 
this system and its acoustic model and lan-
guage model adaptation; the speech features 
computed based on the recognition output; 
and finally the scoring models based on mul-
tiple regression and classification trees. 
For both tasks, agreement measures between 
machine and human scores (correlation, 
kappa) are close to or reach inter-human 
agreements.
