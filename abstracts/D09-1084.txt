Semantic similarity is a central concept
that extends across numerous fields such
as artificial intelligence, natural language
processing, cognitive science and psychol-
ogy. Accurate measurement of semantic
similarity between words is essential for
various tasks such as, document cluster-
ing, information retrieval, and synonym
extraction. We propose a novel model
of semantic similarity using the semantic
relations that exist among words. Given
two words, first, we represent the seman-
tic relations that hold between those words
using automatically extracted lexical pat-
tern clusters. Next, the semantic similar-
ity between the two words is computed
using a Mahalanobis distance measure.
We compare the proposed similarity mea-
sure against previously proposed seman-
tic similarity measures on Miller-Charles
benchmark dataset and WordSimilarity-
353 collection. The proposed method out-
performs all existing web-based seman-
tic similarity measures, achieving a Pear-
son correlation coefficient of 0.867 on the
Millet-Charles dataset.
