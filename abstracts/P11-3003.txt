In this thesis proposal I present my thesis
work, about pre- and postprocessing for sta-
tistical machine translation, mainly into Ger-
manic languages. I focus my work on four ar-
eas: compounding, definite noun phrases, re-
ordering, and error correction. Initial results
are positive within all four areas, and there are
promising possibilities for extending these ap-
proaches. In addition I also focus on methods
for performing thorough error analysis of ma-
chine translation output, which can both moti-
vate and evaluate the studies performed.
