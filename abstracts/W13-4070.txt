In this paper, we describe two dialogue
state tracking models competing in the
2012 Dialogue State Tracking Challenge
(DSTC). First, we detail a novel discrim-
inative dialogue state tracker which di-
rectly estimates slot-level beliefs using de-
terministic state transition probability dis-
tribution. Second, we present a gener-
ative model employing a simple depen-
dency structure to achieve fast inference.
The models are evaluated on the DSTC
data, and both significantly outperform the
baseline DSTC tracker.
