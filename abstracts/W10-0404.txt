 
Web applications have the opportunity to 
check spelling, style, and grammar using a 
software service architecture.  A software ser-
vice authoring aid can offer contextual spell 
checking, detect real word errors, and avoid 
poor grammar checker suggestions through 
the use of large language models.  Here we 
present After the Deadline, an open source au-
thoring aid, used in production on Word-
Press.com, a blogging platform with over ten 
million writers.  We discuss the benefits of the 
software service environment and how it af-
fected our choice of algorithms.  We summa-
rize our design principles as speed over 
accuracy, simplicity over complexity, and do 
what works.
