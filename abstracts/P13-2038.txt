Unsupervised object matching (UOM) is
a promising approach to cross-language
natural language processing such as bilin-
gual lexicon acquisition, parallel corpus
construction, and cross-language text cat-
egorization, because it does not require
labor-intensive linguistic resources. How-
ever, UOM only finds one-to-one corre-
spondences from data sets with the same
number of instances in source and target
domains, and this prevents us from ap-
plying UOM to real-world cross-language
natural language processing tasks. To al-
leviate these limitations, we proposes la-
tent semantic matching, which embeds
objects in both source and target lan-
guage domains into a shared latent topic
space. We demonstrate the effectiveness
of our method on cross-language text cat-
egorization. The results show that our
method outperforms conventional unsu-
pervised object matching methods.
