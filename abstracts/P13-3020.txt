In a multi-class document categorization
using graph-based semi-supervised learn-
ing (GBSSL), it is essential to construct
a proper graph expressing the relation
among nodes and to use a reasonable cat-
egorization algorithm. Furthermore, it is
also important to provide high-quality cor-
rect data as training data. In this con-
text, we propose a method to construct a
similarity graph by employing both sur-
face information and latent information
to express similarity between nodes and
a method to select high-quality training
data for GBSSL by means of the PageR-
ank algorithm. Experimenting on Reuters-
21578 corpus, we have confirmed that our
proposed methods work well for raising
the accuracy of a multi-class document
categorization.
