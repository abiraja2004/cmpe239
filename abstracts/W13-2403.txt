In this paper we describe our experience in
conducting the first open sentiment anal-
ysis evaluations in Russian in 2011-2012.
These initiatives took part within Russian
Information Retrieval Seminar (ROMIP),
which is an annual TREC-like competition
in Russian. Several test and train collec-
tions were created for such tasks as senti-
ment classification in blogs and newswire,
opinion retrieval. The paper describes the
state of the art in sentiment analysis in
Russian, collection characteristics, track
tasks and evaluation metrics.
