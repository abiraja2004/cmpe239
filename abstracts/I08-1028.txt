Language understanding (LU) modules for
spoken dialogue systems in the early phases
of their development need to be (i) easy
to construct and (ii) robust against vari-
ous expressions. Conventional methods of
LU are not suitable for new domains, be-
cause they take a great deal of effort to
make rules or transcribe and annotate a suf-
ficient corpus for training. In our method,
the weightings of the Weighted Finite State
Transducer (WFST) are designed on two
levels and simpler than those for conven-
tional WFST-based methods. Therefore,
our method needs much fewer training data,
which enables rapid prototyping of LU mod-
ules. We evaluated our method in two dif-
ferent domains. The results revealed that our
method outperformed baseline methods with
less than one hundred utterances as training
data, which can be reasonably prepared for
new domains. This shows that our method
is appropriate for rapid prototyping of LU
modules.
