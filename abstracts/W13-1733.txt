This paper describes LIMSI?s participation to
the first shared task on Native Language Iden-
tification. Our submission uses a Maximum
Entropy classifier, using as features character
and chunk n-grams, spelling and grammati-
cal mistakes, and lexical preferences. Perfor-
mance was slightly improved by using a two-
step classifier to better distinguish otherwise
easily confused native languages.
