We describe our entry in the CoNLL-X shared task.
The system consists of three phases: a probabilistic
vine parser (Eisner and N. Smith, 2005) that pro-
duces unlabeled dependency trees, a probabilistic
relation-labeling model, and a discriminative mini-
mum risk reranker (D. Smith and Eisner, 2006). The
system is designed for fast training and decoding and
for high precision. We describe sources of cross-
lingual error and ways to ameliorate them. We then
provide a detailed error analysis of parses produced
for sentences in German (much training data) and
Arabic (little training data).
