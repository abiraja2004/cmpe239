We describe the system of the PIKB team
for BioNLP?09 Shared Task 1, which targets
tunable domain-independent event extraction.
Our approach is based on a three-stage clas-
sification: (1) trigger word tagging, (2) sim-
ple event extraction, and (3) complex event
extraction. We use the MIRA framework for
all three stages, which allows us to trade pre-
cision for increased recall by appropriately
changing the loss function during training. We
report results for three systems focusing on re-
call (R = 28.88%), precision (P = 65.58%),
and F1-measure (F1 = 33.57%), respectively.
