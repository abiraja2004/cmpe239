This paper describes LIMSI?s submis-
sions to the shared WMT?13 translation
task. We report results for French-English,
German-English and Spanish-English in
both directions. Our submissions use
n-code, an open source system based on
bilingual n-grams, and continuous space
models in a post-processing step. The
main novelties of this year?s participation
are the following: our first participation
to the Spanish-English task; experiments
with source pre-ordering; a tighter integra-
tion of continuous space language mod-
els using artificial text generation (for Ger-
man); and the use of different tuning sets
according to the original language of the
text to be translated.
