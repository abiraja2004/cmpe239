 
All known algorithms dedicated to the 
generation of referential descriptions use natural 
language alone to accomplish this communi- 
cative goal. Motivated by some limitations 
underlying these algorithms and the resulting 
restrictions in their scope, we attempt to extend 
the basic schema of these procedures to multi- 
media environments, that is, to descriptions 
consisting of images and text. We discuss 
several issues in this enterprise, including the 
transfer of basic ingredients to images and the 
hereby reinterpretation f language-specific 
concepts, matters of choice in the generation 
process, and the extended application potential 
in some typical scenarios. Moreover, we sketch 
our intended area of application, the identifi- 
cation of a particular object in the large visuali- 
zation of mathematical proofs, which has some 
characteristic properties of each of these 
scenarios. Our achievement lies in extending 
the scope of techniques for generating refer- 
ential descriptions through the incorporation of
multimedia components and in enhancing the 
application areas for these techniques.
