We seek to measure political candidates? ideo-
logical positioning from their speeches. To ac-
complish this, we infer ideological cues from
a corpus of political writings annotated with
known ideologies. We then represent the
speeches of U.S. Presidential candidates as se-
quences of cues and lags (filler distinguished
only by its length in words). We apply a
domain-informed Bayesian HMM to infer the
proportions of ideologies each candidate uses
in each campaign. The results are validated
against a set of preregistered, domain expert-
authored hypotheses.
