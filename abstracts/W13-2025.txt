The absence of a comprehensive database
of locations where bacteria live is an im-
portant obstacle for biologists to under-
stand and study the interactions between
bacteria and their habitats. This paper re-
ports the results to a challenge, set forth by
the Bacteria Biotopes Task of the BioNLP
Shared Task 2013. Two systems are ex-
plained: Sub-task 1 system for identifying
habitat mentions in unstructured biomedi-
cal text and normalizing them through the
OntoBiotope ontology and Sub-task 2 sys-
tem for extracting localization and part-
of relations between bacteria and habitats.
Both approaches rely on syntactic rules
designed by considering the shallow lin-
guistic analysis of the text. Sub-task 2
system also makes use of discourse-based
rules. The two systems achieve promising
results on the shared task test data set.
