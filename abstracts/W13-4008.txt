Online debate forums provide a rich col-
lection of differing opinions on vari-
ous topics. In dual-sided debates, users
present their opinions or judge other?s
opinions to support their stance. In this
paper, we examine the use of users? inten-
tions and debate structure for stance clas-
sification of the debate posts. We propose
a domain independent approach to capture
users? intent at sentence level using its de-
pendency parse and sentiWordNet and to
build the intention structure of the post to
identify its stance. To aid the task of clas-
sification, we define the health of the de-
bate structure and show that maximizing
its value leads to better stance classifica-
tion accuracies.
