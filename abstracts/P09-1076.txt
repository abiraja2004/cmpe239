Articles in the Penn TreeBank were iden-
tified as being reviews, summaries, let-
ters to the editor, news reportage, correc-
tions, wit and short verse, or quarterly
profit reports. All but the latter three
were then characterised in terms of fea-
tures manually annotated in the Penn Dis-
course TreeBank ? discourse connectives
and their senses. Summaries turned out
to display very different discourse features
than the other three genres. Letters also
appeared to have some different features.
The two main findings involve (1) differ-
ences between genres in the senses asso-
ciated with intra-sentential discourse con-
nectives, inter-sentential discourse con-
nectives and inter-sentential discourse re-
lations that are not lexically marked; and
(2) differences within all four genres be-
tween the senses of discourse relations
not lexically marked and those that are
marked. The first finding means that genre
should be made a factor in automated
sense labelling of non-lexically marked
discourse relations. The second means
that lexically marked relations provide a
poor model for automated sense labelling
of relations that are not lexically marked.
