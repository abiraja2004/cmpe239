This paper addresses the classification of
semantic relations between pairs of sen-
tences extracted from a Dutch parallel cor-
pus at the word, phrase and sentence level.
We first investigate the performance of hu-
man annotators on the task of manually
aligning dependency analyses of the re-
spective sentences and of assigning one
of five semantic relations to the aligned
phrases (equals, generalizes, specifies, re-
states and intersects). Results indicate that
humans can perform this task well, with
an F-score of .98 on alignment and an F-
score of .95 on semantic relations (after
correction). We then describe and evalu-
ate a combined alignment and classifica-
tion algorithm, which achieves an F-score
on alignment of .85 (using EuroWordNet)
and an F-score of .80 on semantic relation
classification.
