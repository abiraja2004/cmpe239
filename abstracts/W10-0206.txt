 
Emotion cause detection is a new research area 
in emotion processing even though most theo-
ries of emotion treat recognition of a triggering 
cause event as an integral part of emotion. As a 
first step towards fully automatic inference of 
cause-emotion correlation, we propose a text-
driven, rule-based approach to emotion cause 
detection in this paper. First of all, a Chinese 
emotion cause annotated corpus is constructed 
based on our proposed annotation scheme. By 
analyzing the corpus data, we identify seven 
groups of linguistic cues and generalize two 
sets of linguistic rules for detection of emotion 
causes. With the linguistic rules, we then de-
velop a rule-based system for emotion cause 
detection. In addition, we propose an evaluation 
scheme with two phases for performance as-
sessment. Experiments show that our system 
achieves a promising performance for cause oc-
currence detection as well as cause event detec-
tion. The current study should lay the ground 
for future research on the inferences of implicit 
information and the discovery of new informa-
tion based on cause-event relation.
