Chinese word segmentation and Part-of-
Speech (POS) tagging have been com-
monly considered as two separated tasks.
In this paper, we present a system that
performs Chinese word segmentation and
POS tagging simultaneously. We train a
segmenter and a tagger model separately
based on linear-chain Conditional Ran-
dom Fields (CRF), using lexical, morpho-
logical and semantic features. We propose
an approximated joint decoding method
by reranking the N-best segmenter out-
put, based POS tagging information. Ex-
perimental results on SIGHAN Bakeoff
dataset and Penn Chinese Treebank show
that our reranking method significantly
improve both segmentation and POS tag-
ging accuracies.
