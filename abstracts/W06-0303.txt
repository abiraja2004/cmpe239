On the World Wide Web, the volume of
subjective information, such as opinions
and reviews, has been increasing rapidly.
The trends and rules latent in a large set of
subjective descriptions can potentially be
useful for decision-making purposes. In
this paper, we propose a method for sum-
marizing subjective descriptions, specifi-
cally opinions in Japanese. We visual-
ize the pro and con arguments for a target
topic, such as ?Should Japan introduce the
summertime system?? Users can summa-
rize the arguments about the topic in order
to choose a more reasonable standpoint for
decision making. We evaluate our system,
called ?OpinionReader?, experimentally.
