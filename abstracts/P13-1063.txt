Wikipedia infoboxes are a valuable source
of structured knowledge for global knowl-
edge sharing. However, infobox infor-
mation is very incomplete and imbal-
anced among the Wikipedias in differen-
t languages. It is a promising but chal-
lenging problem to utilize the rich struc-
tured knowledge from a source language
Wikipedia to help complete the missing in-
foboxes for a target language.
In this paper, we formulate the prob-
lem of cross-lingual knowledge extraction
from multilingual Wikipedia sources, and
present a novel framework, called Wiki-
CiKE, to solve this problem. An instance-
based transfer learning method is utilized
to overcome the problems of topic drift
and translation errors. Our experimen-
tal results demonstrate that WikiCiKE out-
performs the monolingual knowledge ex-
traction method and the translation-based
method.
