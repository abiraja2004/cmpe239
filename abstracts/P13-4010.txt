We present ICARUS, a versatile graphi-
cal search tool to query dependency tree-
banks. Search results can be inspected
both quantitatively and qualitatively by
means of frequency lists, tables, or depen-
dency graphs. ICARUS also ships with
plugins that enable it to interface with tool
chains running either locally or remotely.
