Sentiment classification is the task of labeling a re-
view document according to the polarity of its pre-
vailing opinion (favorable or unfavorable). In ap-
proaching this problem, a model builder often has
three sources of information available: a small col-
lection of labeled documents, a large collection of
unlabeled documents, and human understanding of
language. Ideally, a learning method will utilize all
three sources. To accomplish this goal, we general-
ize an existing procedure that uses the latter two.
We extend this procedure by re-interpreting it
as a Naive Bayes model for document sentiment.
Viewed as such, it can also be seen to extract a
pair of derived features that are linearly combined
to predict sentiment. This perspective allows us to
improve upon previous methods, primarily through
two strategies: incorporating additional derived fea-
tures into the model and, where possible, using la-
beled data to estimate their relative influence.
