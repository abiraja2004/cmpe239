Text simplification aims to rewrite text into
simpler versions, and thus make information
accessible to a broader audience. Most pre-
vious work simplifies sentences using hand-
crafted rules aimed at splitting long sentences,
or substitutes difficult words using a prede-
fined dictionary. This paper presents a data-
driven model based on quasi-synchronous
grammar, a formalism that can naturally
capture structural mismatches and complex
rewrite operations. We describe how such a
grammar can be induced from Wikipedia and
propose an integer linear programming model
for selecting the most appropriate simplifica-
tion from the space of possible rewrites gen-
erated by the grammar. We show experimen-
tally that our method creates simplifications
that significantly reduce the reading difficulty
of the input, while maintaining grammaticality
and preserving its meaning.
