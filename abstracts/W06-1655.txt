Markov order-1 conditional random fields
(CRFs) and semi-Markov CRFs are two
popular models for sequence segmenta-
tion and labeling. Both models have ad-
vantages in terms of the type of features
they most naturally represent. We pro-
pose a hybrid model that is capable of rep-
resenting both types of features, and de-
scribe efficient algorithms for its training
and inference. We demonstrate that our
hybrid model achieves error reductions of
18% and 25% over a standard order-1 CRF
and a semi-Markov CRF (resp.) on the
task of Chinese word segmentation. We
also propose the use of a powerful fea-
ture for the semi-Markov CRF: the log
conditional odds that a given token se-
quence constitutes a chunk according to
a generative model, which reduces error
by an additional 13%. Our best system
achieves 96.8% F-measure, the highest re-
ported score on this test set.
