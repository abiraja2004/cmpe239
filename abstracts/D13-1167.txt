We present Multi-Relational Latent Seman-
tic Analysis (MRLSA) which generalizes La-
tent Semantic Analysis (LSA). MRLSA pro-
vides an elegant approach to combining mul-
tiple relations between words by construct-
ing a 3-way tensor. Similar to LSA, a low-
rank approximation of the tensor is derived
using a tensor decomposition. Each word in
the vocabulary is thus represented by a vec-
tor in the latent semantic space and each re-
lation is captured by a latent square matrix.
The degree of two words having a specific
relation can then be measured through sim-
ple linear algebraic operations. We demon-
strate that by integrating multiple relations
from both homogeneous and heterogeneous
information sources, MRLSA achieves state-
of-the-art performance on existing benchmark
datasets for two relations, antonymy and is-a.
