We propose a top-down algorithm for ex-
tracting k-best lists from a parser. Our
algorithm, TKA? is a variant of the k-
best A? (KA?) algorithm of Pauls and
Klein (2009). In contrast to KA?, which
performs an inside and outside pass be-
fore performing k-best extraction bottom
up, TKA? performs only the inside pass
before extracting k-best lists top down.
TKA? maintains the same optimality and
efficiency guarantees of KA?, but is sim-
pler to both specify and implement.
