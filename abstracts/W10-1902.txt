Linear-chain Conditional Random Fields
(CRF) has been applied to perform the
Named Entity Recognition (NER) task in
many biomedical text mining and infor-
mation extraction systems. However, the
linear-chain CRF cannot capture long dis-
tance dependency, which is very common
in the biomedical literature. In this pa-
per, we propose a novel study of capturing
such long distance dependency by defin-
ing two principles of constructing skip-
edges for a skip-chain CRF: linking sim-
ilar words and linking words having typed
dependencies. The approach is applied to
recognize gene/protein mentions in the lit-
erature. When tested on the BioCreAtIvE
II Gene Mention dataset and GENIA cor-
pus, the approach contributes significant
improvements over the linear-chain CRF.
We also present in-depth error analysis on
inconsistent labeling and study the influ-
ence of the quality of skip edges on the la-
beling performance.
