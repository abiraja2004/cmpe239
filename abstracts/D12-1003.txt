This paper proposes a novel method for lex-
icon extraction that extracts translation pairs
from comparable corpora by using graph-
based label propagation. In previous work,
it was established that performance drasti-
cally decreases when the coverage of a seed
lexicon is small. We resolve this problem
by utilizing indirect relations with the bilin-
gual seeds together with direct relations, in
which each word is represented by a distri-
bution of translated seeds. The seed distri-
butions are propagated over a graph repre-
senting relations among words, and transla-
tion pairs are extracted by identifying word
pairs with a high similarity in the seed dis-
tributions. We propose two types of the
graphs: a co-occurrence graph, representing
co-occurrence relations between words, and
a similarity graph, representing context sim-
ilarities between words. Evaluations using
English and Japanese patent comparable cor-
pora show that our proposed graph propaga-
tion method outperforms conventional meth-
ods. Further, the similarity graph achieved im-
proved performance by clustering synonyms
into the same translation.
