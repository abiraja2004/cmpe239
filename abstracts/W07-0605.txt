Empirical data regarding the syntactic com-
plexity of children?s speech is important for
theories of language acquisition. Currently
much of this data is absent in the annotated
versions of the CHILDES database. In this
perliminary study, we show that a state-of-
the-art subcategorization acquisition system of
Preiss et al (2007) can be used to extract large-
scale subcategorization (frequency) informa-
tion from the (i) child and (ii) child-directed
speech within the CHILDES database without
any domain-specific tuning. We demonstrate
that the acquired information is sufficiently ac-
curate to confirm and extend previously re-
ported research findings. We also report quali-
tative results which can be used to further im-
prove parsing and lexical acquisition technol-
ogy for child language data in the future.
