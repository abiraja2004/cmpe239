In this paper, we propose a novel approach to
automatic generation of aspect-oriented sum-
maries from multiple documents. We first de-
velop an event-aspect LDA model to cluster
sentences into aspects. We then use extend-
ed LexRank algorithm to rank the sentences
in each cluster. We use Integer Linear Pro-
gramming for sentence selection. Key features
of our method include automatic grouping of
semantically related sentences and sentence
ranking based on extension of random walk
model. Also, we implement a new sentence
compression algorithm which use dependency
tree instead of parser tree. We compare our
method with four baseline methods. Quantita-
tive evaluation based on Rouge metric demon-
strates the effectiveness and advantages of our
method.
