 
It is shown that the behaviour of test per-sons as observed in association experi-ments can be simulated statistically on the basis of the common occurrences of words in large text corpora, thereby ap-plying the law of association by contigu-ity which is well known from psycho-logical learning theory. In particular, the focus of this work is on the prediction of the word associations as obtained from subjects on presentation of multiword stimuli. Results are presented for applica-tions as diverse as crossword puzzle solv-ing and the identification of word transla-tions based on non-parallel texts.
