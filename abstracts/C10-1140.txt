This paper proposes an efficient online
method that trains a classifier with many
conjunctive features. We employ kernel
computation called kernel slicing, which
explicitly considers conjunctions among
frequent features in computing the poly-
nomial kernel, to combine the merits of
linear and kernel-based training. To im-
prove the scalability of this training, we
reuse the temporal margins of partial fea-
ture vectors and terminate unnecessary
margin computations. Experiments on de-
pendency parsing and hyponymy-relation
extraction demonstrated that our method
could train a classifier orders of magni-
tude faster than kernel-based online learn-
ing, while retaining its space efficiency.
