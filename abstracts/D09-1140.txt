In this research we aim to detect sub-
jective sentences in multimodal conversa-
tions. We introduce a novel technique
wherein subjective patterns are learned
from both labeled and unlabeled data, us-
ing n-gram word sequences with vary-
ing levels of lexical instantiation. Ap-
plying this technique to meeting speech
and email conversations, we gain signifi-
cant improvement over state-of-the-art ap-
proaches. Furthermore, we show that cou-
pling the pattern-based approach with fea-
tures that capture characteristics of gen-
eral conversation structure yields addi-
tional improvement.
