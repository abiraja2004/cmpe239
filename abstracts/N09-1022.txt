We propose a unified approach to web search
query alterations in Japanese that is not lim-
ited to particular character types or ortho-
graphic similarity between a query and its al-
teration candidate. Our model is based on pre-
vious work on English query correction, but
makes some crucial improvements: (1) we
augment the query-candidate list to include
orthographically dissimilar but semantically
similar pairs; and (2) we use kernel-based
lexical semantic similarity to avoid the prob-
lem of data sparseness in computing query-
candidate similarity. We also propose an ef-
ficient method for generating query-candidate
pairs for model training and testing. We show
that the proposed method achieves about 80%
accuracy on the query alteration task, improv-
ing over previously proposed methods that use
semantic similarity.
