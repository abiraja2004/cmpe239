 
Spoken language understanding is a critical 
component of automated customer service ap-
plications.  Creating effective SLU models is 
inherently a data driven process and requires 
considerable human intervention.  We de-
scribe an interactive system for speech data 
mining.  Using data visualization and interac-
tive speech analysis, our system allows a User 
Experience (UE) expert to browse and under-
stand data variability quickly.  Supervised 
machine learning techniques are used to cap-
ture knowledge from the UE expert.  This cap-
tured knowledge is used to build an initial 
SLU model, an annotation guide, and a train-
ing and testing system for the labelers.  Our 
goal is to shorten the time to market by in-
creasing the efficiency of the process and to 
improve the quality of the call types, the call 
routing, and the overall application.
