Determining the polarity of a sentiment-
bearing expression requires more than a sim-
ple bag-of-words approach. In particular,
words or constituents within the expression
can interact with each other to yield a particu-
lar overall polarity. In this paper, we view such
subsentential interactions in light of composi-
tional semantics, and present a novel learning-
based approach that incorporates structural in-
ference motivated by compositional seman-
tics into the learning procedure. Our exper-
iments show that (1) simple heuristics based
on compositional semantics can perform bet-
ter than learning-based methods that do not in-
corporate compositional semantics (accuracy
of 89.7% vs. 89.1%), but (2) a method that
integrates compositional semantics into learn-
ing performs better than all other alterna-
tives (90.7%). We also find that ?content-
word negators?, not widely employed in pre-
vious work, play an important role in de-
termining expression-level polarity. Finally,
in contrast to conventional wisdom, we find
that expression-level classification accuracy
uniformly decreases as additional, potentially
disambiguating, context is considered.
