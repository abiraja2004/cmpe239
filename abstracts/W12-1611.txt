We use Reinforcement Learning (RL) to learn
question-answering dialogue policies for a
real-world application. We analyze a corpus
of interactions of museum visitors with two
virtual characters that serve as guides at the
Museum of Science in Boston, in order to
build a realistic model of user behavior when
interacting with these characters. A simulated
user is built based on this model and used
for learning the dialogue policy of the virtual
characters using RL. Our learned policy out-
performs two baselines (including the original
dialogue policy that was used for collecting
the corpus) in a simulation setting.
