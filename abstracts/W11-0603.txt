Learning to group words into phrases with-
out supervision is a hard task for NLP sys-
tems, but infants routinely accomplish it. We
hypothesize that infants use acoustic cues to
prosody, which NLP systems typically ignore.
To evaluate the utility of prosodic information
for phrase discovery, we present an HMM-
based unsupervised chunker that learns from
only transcribed words and raw acoustic cor-
relates to prosody. Unlike previous work on
unsupervised parsing and chunking, we use
neither gold standard part-of-speech tags nor
punctuation in the input. Evaluated on the
Switchboard corpus, our model outperforms
several baselines that exploit either lexical or
prosodic information alone, and, despite pro-
ducing a flat structure, performs competitively
with a state-of-the-art unsupervised lexical-
ized parser, with a substantial advantage in
precision. Our results support the hypothesis
that acoustic-prosodic cues provide useful ev-
idence about syntactic phrases for language-
learning infants.
