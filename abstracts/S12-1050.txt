The paper presents the SemEval-2012 Shared
Task 5: Chinese Semantic Dependency Pars-
ing. The goal of this task is to identify the de-
pendency structure of Chinese sentences from
the semantic view. We firstly introduce the
motivation of providing Chinese semantic de-
pendency parsing task, and then describe the
task in detail including data preparation, data
format, task evaluation, and so on. Over ten
thousand sentences were labeled for partici-
pants to train and evaluate their systems. At
last, we briefly describe the submitted systems
and analyze these results.
