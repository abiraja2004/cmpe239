Work on authorship attribution has tradition-
ally focused on long texts. In this work, we
tackle the question of whether the author of
a very short text can be successfully iden-
tified. We use Twitter as an experimental
testbed. We introduce the concept of an au-
thor?s unique ?signature?, and show that such
signatures are typical of many authors when
writing very short texts. We also present a new
authorship attribution feature (?flexible pat-
terns?) and demonstrate a significant improve-
ment over our baselines. Our results show that
the author of a single tweet can be identified
with good accuracy in an array of flavors of
the authorship attribution task.
