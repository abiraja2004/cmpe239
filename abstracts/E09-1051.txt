We show how global constraints such as transitiv-
ity can be treated intensionally in a Zero-One Inte-
ger Linear Programming (ILP) framework which is
geared to find the optimal and coherent partition of
coreference sets given a number of candidate pairs
and their weights delivered by a pairwise classifier
(used as reliable clustering seed pairs). In order to
find out whether ILP optimization, which is NP-
complete, actually is the best we can do, we com-
pared the first consistent solution generated by our
adaptation of an efficient Zero-One algorithm with
the optimal solution. The first consistent solution,
which often can be found very fast, is already as
good as the optimal solution; optimization is thus
not needed.
