We investigate the automatic detection of
sentences containing linguistic hedges us-
ing corpus statistics and syntactic pat-
terns. We take Wikipedia as an already
annotated corpus using its tagged weasel
words which mark sentences and phrases
as non-factual. We evaluate the quality of
Wikipedia as training data for hedge detec-
tion, as well as shallow linguistic features.
