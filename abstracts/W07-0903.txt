Importing large amounts of data into
databases does not always go without the
loss of important information. In this work,
methods are presented that aim to rediscover
this information by inferring it from the in-
formation that is available in the database.
From and animal specimen database, the
information to which expedition an ani-
mal that was found belongs is rediscovered.
While the work is in an early stage, the ob-
tained results are promising, and prove that
it is possible to rediscover expedition infor-
mation from the database.
