Natural language interfaces to spatial databases have not received a lot of attention
in computational linguistics, in spite of the potential value of such systems for
users of Geographical Information Systems (GISs). This paper presents a controlled
language for GIS queries, solves some of the semantic problems for spatial inference
in this language, and introduces a system that implements this controlled language
as a novel interface for GIS.
