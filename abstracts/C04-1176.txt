This paper presents a method to construct
Japanese KATAKANA variant list from
large corpus. Our method is useful for
information retrieval, information extrac-
tion, question answering, and so on, because
KATAKANA words tend to be used as
?loan words? and the transliteration causes
several variations of spelling. Our method
consists of three steps. At step 1, our sys-
tem collects KATAKANA words from large
corpus. At step 2, our system collects can-
didate pairs of KATAKANA variants from
the collected KATAKANA words using a
spelling similarity which is based on the edit
distance. At step 3, our system selects vari-
ant pairs from the candidate pairs using a
semantic similarity which is calculated by
a vector space model of a context of each
KATAKANA word. We conducted exper-
iments using 38 years of Japanese news-
paper articles and constructed Japanese
KATAKANA variant list with the perfor-
mance of 97.4% recall and 89.1% precision.
Estimating from this precision, our system
can extract 178,569 variant pairs from the
corpus.
