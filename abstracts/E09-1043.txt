We extend the factored translation model
(Koehn and Hoang, 2007) to allow trans-
lations of longer phrases composed of fac-
tors such as POS and morphological tags
to act as templates for the selection and re-
ordering of surface phrase translation. We
also reintroduce the use of alignment in-
formation within the decoder, which forms
an integral part of decoding in the Align-
ment Template System (Och, 2002), into
phrase-based decoding.
Results show an increase in transla-
tion performance of up to 1.0% BLEU
for out-of-domain French?English transla-
tion. We also show how this method com-
pares and relates to lexicalized reordering.
