 
This paper describes algorithms and software developed to characterise and detect generic 
intelligent language-like features iu an input signal, using Natural Language Learning 
techniques: looking for characteristic statistical "language-signatures" in test corpora. As a 
first step towards such species-independent language-detection, we present a suite of 
programs to analyse digital representations of a range of data, and use the results to 
extrapolate whether or not there are language-like structures which distiuguish this data from 
other sources, such as nmsic, images, and white noise. We assume that generic species- 
independent commuuication can be detected by concentrating on localised patterns and 
rhythms, identifying segments at the level of characters, words and phrases, without 
necessarily having to "understand" the content. 
We assume that a language-like signal will be encoded symbolically, i.e. some kind of 
character-stream. Our language-detection algorithm for symbolic input uses a number of 
statistical clues: data compression ratio, "chunking" to find character bit-length and 
boundaries, and matching against a Zipfian type-token distribution for "letters" and "words". 
We do not claim extensive (let alne exhaustive) empirical evidence that our language- 
detection clues are "correct"; the only real test will come when the Search for Extra- 
Terrestrial Intelligence finds true alien signals. If and when true SETI signals are found, the 
first step to interpretation is to identify the language-like f atures, using techniques like the 
above. Our current research goal is to apply Natural Language Learning techniques to the 
identification of "higher-level" grammatical nd semantic structure in a linguistic signal.
