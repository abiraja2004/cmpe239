In scientific literature, sentences that cite re-
lated work can be a valuable resource for
applications such as summarization, syn-
onym identification, and entity extraction.
In order to determine which equivalent en-
tities are discussed in the various citation
sentences, we propose aligning the words
within these sentences according to semantic
similarity. This problem is partly analogous
to the problem of multiple sequence align-
ment in the biosciences, and is also closely
related to the word alignment problem in sta-
tistical machine translation. In this paper
we address the problem of multiple citation
concept alignment by combining and mod-
ifying the CRF based pairwise word align-
ment system of Blunsom & Cohn (2006)
and a posterior decoding based multiple se-
quence alignment algorithm of Schwartz &
Pachter (2007). We evaluate the algorithm
on hand-labeled data, achieving results that
improve on a baseline.
