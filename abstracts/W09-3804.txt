We present a biparsing algorithm for
Stochastic Bracketing Inversion Transduc-
tion Grammars that runs in O(bn3) time
instead of O(n6). Transduction gram-
mars learned via an EM estimation proce-
dure based on this biparsing algorithm are
evaluated directly on the translation task,
by building a phrase-based statistical MT
system on top of the alignments dictated
by Viterbi parses under the induced bi-
grammars. Translation quality at different
levels of pruning are compared, showing
improvements over a conventional word
aligner even at heavy pruning levels.
