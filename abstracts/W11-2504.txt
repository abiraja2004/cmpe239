This paper improves an existing bilingual
paraphrase extraction technique using mono-
lingual distributional similarity to rerank can-
didate paraphrases. Raw monolingual data
provides a complementary and orthogonal
source of information that lessens the com-
monly observed errors in bilingual pivot-
based methods. Our experiments reveal that
monolingual scoring of bilingually extracted
paraphrases has a significantly stronger cor-
relation with human judgment for grammat-
icality than the probabilities assigned by the
bilingual pivoting method does. The results
also show that monolingual distribution simi-
larity can serve as a threshold for high preci-
sion paraphrase selection.
