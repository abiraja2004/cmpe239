 
We show that discourse structure need not bear 
the full burden of conveying discourse relations by 
showing that many of them can be explained non- 
structurally in terms of the grounding of anaphoric 
presuppositions (Van der Sandt, 1992). This simpli- 
fies discourse structure, while still allowing the real- 
isation of a full range of discourse relations. This is 
achieved using the same semantic machinery used 
in deriving clause-level semantics.
