We propose a unified model of syntax and dis-
course in which text structure is viewed as a 
tree structure augmented with anaphoric rela-
tions  and  other  secondary  relations.  We  de-
scribe how the model accounts  for discourse 
connectives  and  the  syntax-discourse-seman-
tics interface. Our model is dependency-based, 
ie, words are the basic building blocks in our 
analyses.  The  analyses  have  been  applied 
cross-linguistically in the Copenhagen Depen-
dency  Treebanks,  a  set  of  parallel  treebanks 
for Danish, English, German, Italian, and Spa-
nish which are currently being annotated with 
respect  to  discourse,  anaphora,  syntax,  mor-
phology, and translational equivalence.
