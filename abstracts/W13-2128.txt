We present the first prototype of a han-
dover report generator developed for the
MIME (Managing Information in Medi-
cal Emergencies) project. NLG applica-
tions in the medical domain have been var-
ied but most are deployed in clinical situa-
tions. We develop a mobile device for pre-
hospital care which receives streamed sen-
sor data and user input, and converts these
into a handover report for paramedics.
