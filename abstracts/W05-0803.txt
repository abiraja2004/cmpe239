We present an Earley-style dynamic pro-
gramming algorithm for parsing sentence
pairs from a parallel corpus simultane-
ously, building up two phrase structure
trees and a correspondence mapping be-
tween the nodes. The intended use of
the algorithm is in bootstrapping gram-
mars for less studied languages by using
implicit grammatical information in par-
allel corpora. Therefore, we presuppose a
given (statistical) word alignment under-
lying in the synchronous parsing task; this
leads to a significant reduction of the pars-
ing complexity. The theoretical complex-
ity results are corroborated by a quantita-
tive evaluation in which we ran an imple-
mentation of the algorithm on a suite of
test sentences from the Europarl parallel
corpus.
