This paper explores two hypotheses regarding
vector space models that predict the compo-
sitionality of German noun-noun compounds:
(1) Against our intuition, we demonstrate that
window-based rather than syntax-based distri-
butional features perform better predictions,
and that not adjectives or verbs but nouns rep-
resent the most salient part-of-speech. Our
overall best result is state-of-the-art, reach-
ing Spearman?s ? = 0.65 with a word-
space model of nominal features from a 20-
word window of a 1.5 billion word web cor-
pus. (2) While there are no significant dif-
ferences in predicting compound?modifier vs.
compound?head ratings on compositionality,
we show that the modifier (rather than the
head) properties predominantly influence the
degree of compositionality of the compound.
