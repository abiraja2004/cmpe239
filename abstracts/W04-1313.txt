This paper investigates two approaches to
speech segmentation based on different heuris-
tics: the utterance-boundary strategy, and the
predictability strategy. On the basis of for-
mer empirical results as well as theoretical con-
siderations, it is suggested that the utterance-
boundary approach could be used as a prepro-
cessing step in order to lighten the task of the
predictability approach, without damaging the
resulting segmentation. This intuition leads to
the formulation of an explicit model, which is
empirically evaluated for a task of word segmen-
tation on a child-oriented phonemically tran-
scribed French corpus. The results show that
the hybrid algorithm outperforms its compo-
nent parts while reducing the total memory load
involved.
