Recent years have seen increasing re-
search on extracting and using temporal
information in natural language applica-
tions. However most of the works found
in the literature have focused on identi-
fying and understanding temporal expres-
sions in newswire texts. In this paper
we report our work on anchoring tempo-
ral expressions in a novel genre, emails.
The highly under-specified nature of these
expressions fits well with our constraint-
based representation of time, Time Cal-
culus for Natural Language (TCNL). We
have developed and evaluated a Tempo-
ral Expression Anchoror (TEA), and the
result shows that it performs significantly
better than the baseline, and compares fa-
vorably with some of the closely related
work.
