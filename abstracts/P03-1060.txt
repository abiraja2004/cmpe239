Noun extraction is very important for
many NLP applications such as informa-
tion retrieval, automatic text classification,
and information extraction. Most of the
previous Korean noun extraction systems
use a morphological analyzer or a Part-
of-Speech (POS) tagger. Therefore, they
require much of the linguistic knowledge
such as morpheme dictionaries and rules
(e.g. morphosyntactic rules and morpho-
logical rules).
This paper proposes a new noun extrac-
tion method that uses the syllable based
word recognition model. It finds the
most probable syllable-tag sequence of
the input sentence by using automatically
acquired statistical information from the
POS tagged corpus and extracts nouns by
detecting word boundaries. Furthermore,
it does not require any labor for construct-
ing and maintaining linguistic knowledge.
We have performed various experiments
with a wide range of variables influenc-
ing the performance. The experimental
results show that without morphological
analysis or POS tagging, the proposed
method achieves comparable performance
with the previous methods.
