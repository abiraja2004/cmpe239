This paper presents the Kazakh Language Corpus
(KLC), which is one of the first attempts made
within a local research community to assemble a
Kazakh corpus. KLC is designed to be a large scale
corpus containing over 135 million words and con-
veying five stylistic genres: literary, publicistic, of-
ficial, scientific and informal. Along with its pri-
mary part KLC comprises such parts as: (i) anno-
tated sub-corpus, containing segmented documents
encoded in the eXtensible Markup Language (XML)
that marks complete morphological, syntactic, and
structural characteristics of texts; (ii) as well as a
sub-corpus with the annotated speech data. KLC has
a web-based corpus management system that helps
to navigate the data and retrieve necessary informa-
tion. KLC is also open for contributors, who are
willing to make suggestions, donate texts and help
with annotation of existing materials.
