A number of different notions, including
subjectivity, have been proposed for dis-
tinguishing parts of documents that con-
vey sentiment from those that do not. We
propose a new concept, sentiment rele-
vance, to make this distinction and argue
that it better reflects the requirements of
sentiment analysis systems. We demon-
strate experimentally that sentiment rele-
vance and subjectivity are related, but dif-
ferent. Since no large amount of labeled
training data for our new notion of sen-
timent relevance is available, we investi-
gate two semi-supervised methods for cre-
ating sentiment relevance classifiers: a dis-
tant supervision approach that leverages
structured information about the domain
of the reviews; and transfer learning on
feature representations based on lexical
taxonomies that enables knowledge trans-
fer. We show that both methods learn sen-
timent relevance classifiers that perform
well.
