 
This study explores the use of function 
words for authorship attribution in modern 
Chinese (C-FWAA). This study consists of 
three tasks: (1) examine the C-FWAA 
effectiveness in three genres: novel, essay, 
and blog; (2) compare the strength of 
function words as both genre and 
authorship indicators, and explore  the 
genre interference on C-FWAA; (3) 
examine whether C-FWAA is sensitive to 
the time periods when the texts were 
written.
