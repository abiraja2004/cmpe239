We present an empirical study of one-on-
one human tutoring dialogues in the domain
of Computer Science data structures. We
are interested in discovering effective tutor-
ing strategies, that we frame as discovering
which Dialogue Act (DA) sequences corre-
late with learning. We employ multiple lin-
ear regression, to discover the strongest mod-
els that explain why students learn during
one-on-one tutoring. Importantly, we define
?flexible? DA sequence, in which extraneous
DAs can easily be discounted. Our experi-
ments reveal several cognitively plausible DA
sequences which significantly correlate with
learning outcomes.
