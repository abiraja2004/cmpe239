Previous work on paraphrase extraction us-
ing parallel or comparable corpora has gener-
ally not considered the documents? discourse
structure as a useful information source. We
propose a novel method for collecting para-
phrases relying on the sequential event or-
der in the discourse, using multiple sequence
alignment with a semantic similarity measure.
We show that adding discourse information
boosts the performance of sentence-level para-
phrase acquisition, which consequently gives
a tremendous advantage for extracting phrase-
level paraphrase fragments from matched sen-
tences. Our system beats an informed baseline
by a margin of 50%.
