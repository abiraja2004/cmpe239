We describe a new annotation scheme for
formalizing relation structures in research
papers. The scheme has been developed
through the investigation of computer sci-
ence papers. Using the scheme, we are
building a Japanese corpus to help develop
information extraction systems for digital
libraries. We report on the outline of the
annotation scheme and on annotation ex-
periments conducted on research abstracts
from the IPSJ Journal.
