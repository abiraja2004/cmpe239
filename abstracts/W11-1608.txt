Abstract
We propose a new, ambitious framework for
abstractive summarization, which aims at se-
lecting the content of a summary not from sen-
tences, but from an abstract representation of
the source documents. This abstract repre-
sentation relies on the concept of Information
Items (INIT), which we define as the smallest
element of coherent information in a text or a
sentence. Our framework differs from previ-
ous abstractive summarization models in re-
quiring a semantic analysis of the text. We
present a first attempt made at developing a
system from this framework, along with eval-
uation results for it from TAC 2010. We also
present related work, both from within and
outside of the automatic summarization do-
main.
