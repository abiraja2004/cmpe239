 
The preferred order of pre-nominal adjectives 
in English is determined primarily by seman-
tics.  Nevertheless, Adjective Ordering (AO) 
systems do not generally exploit semantic fea-
tures.  This paper describes a system that or-
ders adjectives with significantly above-
chance accuracy (73.0%) solely on the basis 
of semantic features pertaining to the cogni-
tive-semantic dimension of subjectivity.  The 
results indicate that combining such semantic 
approaches with current methods could result 
in more accurate and robust AO systems.
