 
We present two systems developed at the Uni-
versity of Ottawa for the SemEval 2013 Task 2. 
The first system (for Task A) classifies the po-
larity / sentiment orientation of one target word 
in a Twitter message. The second system (for 
Task B) classifies the polarity of whole Twitter 
messages. Our two systems are very simple, 
based on supervised classifiers with bag-of-
words feature representation, enriched with in-
formation from several sources. We present a 
few additional results, besides results of the 
submitted runs.
