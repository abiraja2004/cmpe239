 
The paper introduces a dependency annota-
tion effort which aims to fully annotate a 
million word Hindi corpus. It is the first at-
tempt of its kind to develop a large scale 
tree-bank for an Indian language. In this 
paper we provide the motivation for fol-
lowing the Paninian framework as the an-
notation scheme and argue that the Pan-
inian framework is better suited to model 
the various linguistic phenomena manifest 
in Indian languages. We present the basic 
annotation scheme. We also show how the 
scheme handles some phenomenon such as 
complex verbs, ellipses, etc. Empirical re-
sults of some experiments done on the cur-
rently annotated sentences are also re-
ported.
