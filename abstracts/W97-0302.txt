 
We present a variation on classic beam 
thresholding techniques that is up to an or- 
der of magnitude faster than the traditional 
method, at the same performance l vel. We 
also present a new thresholding technique, 
global thresholding, which, combined with 
the new beam thresholding, gives an ad- 
ditional factor of two improvement, and a 
novel technique, multiple pass parsing, that 
can be combined with the others to yield 
yet another 50% improvement. We use a 
new search algorithm to simultaneously op- 
timize the thresholding parameters of the 
various algorithms.
