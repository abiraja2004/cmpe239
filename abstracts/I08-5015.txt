Named Entity Recognition(NER) is the task
of identifying and classifying tokens in a
text document into predefined set of classes.
In this paper we show our experiments
with various feature combinations for Tel-
ugu NER. We also observed that the prefix
and suffix information helps a lot in find-
ing the class of the token. We also show
the effect of the training data on the perfor-
mance of the system. The best performing
model gave an F?=1 measure of 44.91. The
language independent features gave an F?=1
measure of 44.89 which is close to F?=1
measure obtained even by including the lan-
guage dependent features.
