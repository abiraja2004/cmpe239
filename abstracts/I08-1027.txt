Automatic estimation of word significance
oriented for speech-based Information Re-
trieval (IR) is addressed. Since the sig-
nificance of words differs in IR, automatic
speech recognition (ASR) performance has
been evaluated based on weighted word er-
ror rate (WWER), which gives a weight
on errors from the viewpoint of IR, instead
of word error rate (WER), which treats all
words uniformly. A decoding strategy that
minimizes WWER based on a Minimum
Bayes-Risk framework has been shown, and
the reduction of errors on both ASR and IR
has been reported. In this paper, we propose
an automatic estimation method for word
significance (weights) based on its influence
on IR. Specifically, weights are estimated so
that evaluation measures of ASR and IR are
equivalent. We apply the proposed method
to a speech-based information retrieval sys-
tem, which is a typical IR system, and show
that the method works well.
