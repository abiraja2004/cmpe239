This paper presents a machine learning ap-
proach that selects and, more generally, ranks
sentences containing clear relations between
genes and terms that are related to them. This
is treated as a binary classification task, where
preference judgments are used to learn how to
choose a sentence from a pair of sentences.
Features to capture how the relationship is de-
scribed textually, as well as how central the
relationship is in the sentence, are used in the
learning process. Simplification of complex
sentences into simple structures is also applied
for the extraction of the features. We show that
such simplification improves the results by up
to 13%. We conducted three different evalu-
ations and we found that the system signifi-
cantly outperforms the baselines.
