Providing sets of semantically related
words in the lexical entries of an electronic
dictionary should help language learners
quickly understand the meaning of the tar-
get words. Relational information might
also improve memorisation, by allowing
the generation of structured vocabulary
study lists. However, an open issue is
which semantic relations are cognitively
most salient, and should therefore be used
for dictionary construction. In this paper,
we present a concept description elicita-
tion experiment conducted with German
and Italian speakers. The analysis of the
experimental data suggests that there is a
small set of concept-class?dependent rela-
tion types that are stable across languages
and robust enough to allow discrimination
across broad concept domains. Our further
research will focus on harvesting instantia-
tions of these classes from corpora.
