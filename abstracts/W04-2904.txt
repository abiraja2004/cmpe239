When evaluating wordspotting systems, one
normally compares receiver operating charac-
teristic curves and different measures of accu-
racy. However, there are many other factors
that are relevant to the system?s usability for
searching speech. In this paper, we discuss
both measures of quality for confidence scores
and propose algorithms for producing scores
that are optimal with respect to these criteria.
