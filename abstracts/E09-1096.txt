 
In this paper, we present a feature-based me-
thod to align documents with similar content 
across two sets of bilingual comparable cor-
pora from daily news texts. We evaluate the 
contribution of each individual feature and 
investigate the incorporation of these diverse 
statistical and heuristic features for the task of 
bilingual document alignment. Experimental 
results on the English-Chinese and English-
Malay comparable news corpora show that 
our proposed Discrete Fourier Transform-
based term frequency distribution feature is 
very effective. It contributes 4.1% and 8% to 
performance improvement over Pearson?s 
correlation method on the two comparable 
corpora. In addition, when more heuristic and 
statistical features as well as a bilingual dic-
tionary are utilized, our method shows an ab-
solute performance improvement of 23.2% 
and 15.3% on the two sets of bilingual corpo-
ra when comparing with a prior information 
retrieval-based method.
