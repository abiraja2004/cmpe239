Summer Linguistics at Texas 
The University of Texas at Austin announces 
a special Summer Linguistics Program 
which will consist of a substantial offering 
of graduate courses given by our own 
faculty members and a distinguished list of 
visitbg scholars. In addition to these 
courses, workshops and seminars (for 
credit as conference courses by arrange- 
ment with individual faculty members) 
will be available on topics such as syntac- 
tic universals, conditions on rule applica- 
tion. f ip ; i j -  and scope, formal vs. substan- 
tive explanation in phonology, etc. Ure in- 
vite applications from graduate students in 
linguistics and allied disciplhes such .as 
education, English, foreign languages, psy- 
chology, philosophy, anthropology, and 
others, 
The list of courses and instructors will in- 
clude the following: 
LIN 380K Generative Phonology-Robert 
T. Harms 
IAN 380L Transformational Grammar- 
Jorge Hankamer and Ivan Sag 
LIN 381M Phonetic Theory-Peter MacNeilage 
LIN 384 Outline of Turkish Syntax-Jorge 
Hankryner (tentative) 
LIP 393 Semantics-Robert E. Wall 
IJN 393 Seminar in Phonetics and 
Phonology-Bj6m Lindblom 
&IN 393 Seminar in Syntax and Semantics- 
Emmon Bach and Barbara Partee 
LIN 394 New Directions in Historical. 
Linguistics-Robert D. King 
LIN 398 Seminar in Linguistic 
Variation- John Baugh 
In ad& tion to the above-listed faculty 
members, the following scholars will be 
available for individual consultatbu: Lee 
Baker, Peter Cole, David Decamp, Polly 
Jacobson, Lauri Karttunen, W. P. Leh- 
mann, Fritz Newmeyer, Susan Schmerling, 
and others. Several intensive Oriental and 
European language courses will also be 
taught as a part of the regular UT summer 
session. 
Low cost accommodations will be availa- 
ble in housing cooperatives. Classes will 
begin June 13 and exams will end July 20; 
the Program will thus not conflict with the 
LSA Linguistic Institute in Salzburg. 
Tuition and fees: For Texas residents, the 
price of summer courses is $64.70 for one 
three-hour course, $89.90 for two three- 
hour courses. For out-of-state residents, it 
Ps $159.70 for one three-hour course, 
$304.90 for two three-hour courses. In ad- 
dition, there is a $10.00 property fee, 
refundable at the end of the course.

During the summer of 1978, Alan K. Melby wrote to many 
American universities, asking about the graduate work 
in computational linguistics. He has supplied a copy 
of his list of affirmative answers, presented here in 
the casual format of its compilation. Melby points out 
that MIT and Yale did not respond but would be considered 
by a student planning work on computers and language.

SUMMARY OF RESEARCH ON COMPUTATIONAL ASPECTS OF 
EVOLVING THEORIES 
Raymond D. ,Gumb 
Temple University 
The concent of an evolving theory [3] is a natural 
extension of concepts in f r ee  tense l o p i c  w i t h  equality. 
In the semanticr of free tense log ic ,  an individual can 
have a property at one time M a t  tt does not ab another, 
the  domain of discourse can vary with the passage of time 
as individuals are born an8 die, an8 individual terms can 
refeq at one time but n o t  at another. understand in^ a 
t h e o r y  t o  be a s e t  of sentences i n  the languape of free 
t e n s e  logic with equality, an evolvinq theory  is an indexcd 
e e t  of theories ordered In time. Intuitively, an evolvinp 
t h e o r y  mip;htreoresent  t h e  l i f e  work of a t h i n k e r ,  where 
t h e  individual theories in the evolvinp theory  correspond 
to chapters of the  life work written at different ti&es. 
The evolving t h e o r y  reflects chan~es i n  the thinker's 
views with the passape of tfme. 
Evolvinp theories have been studied from both semantic 
and  roof theoretic ~erspectives, and various concents 
such as the semantic c o n c e ~ t  of satiafiability and the  
woof  theoretic concept of consistency have been extended 
to anply to evo lv ing  theories [3]. The semantics is given 
Ih terms of metaphor theory which stands intermediate 
between Leblanc'e truth-value semantics and moddl theory 
and translates readily into both. 'The deductive system 
far (a class of) evolving theories I s  celled the forest 
method because a tree is generated for each point in time. 
The forest method, in effect a jqeneralization o f  Kripke 
tableaux construct ions, is mechanlzable, The forest 
method is correc t  w i t h  r e s ~ e c t  to the  semantics 131. 
The forest' method can be & n ~ l l e d  whemer the1 restriction 
on the temporal order relation has the com~utable Krinke 
closure ~ r o ~ e r t y ,  a property of m roper ties of relations 
whlch has been characterized model theoretically in [?I . 
The eornput'able Krlpke closures are a subclass pf  the 
monotonic closures r7], which have closure properties much 
like transitivity (a computable Kripke and monotonic closure). 
A preservation theorem giving the syntactic form of 
axiornatizatione of the first-order monotonic cloeures [7] 
suagests a peneralizatton of the Roy-Warshall transitive 
closure algorithm. The preservation theorem might also 
be used to determine (much as an e n t r y  in an engineer in^ 
handbook) whether, given a proper ty  of r e l a t i o n s  Pr, there  
is a Pr-closure algorithm. 
Evolving: theories can be based in other  intensional 
loa les  such as as modal [4] and intuitionistic l o p i c s .  
Some (but not r?a l l )  of the loeics underlying kinds of e v o l v i n ~  
theories where the forest method i s  ap'alicable can be 
axiomatized 11, 6J* 
In certain (but  not a l l )  cases,  t h e  forest method 
(or restrictions o f )  can be used to give e f fec t ive  
proofs of me extended Jo in t  consiatencg theorem, a result 
whlch incornorates t h e  Craip and Lyndon interpolation 
lemmas and. the Robinson joint consistency theorem. 
Roughly, the theorehi n a t e s  that two theories TI an8 T2 are mutu- 
a l l y  inconsistent just- in case there is a separating sentence 
F such that F ( n o t  F) is a logica l  consequence of TI (T2) 
and F " t a l k s  about'" only individual@ and relation8 Chat 
both TI an8 T do. Effective proofs of the theorem are 2 
well-known in standaydl f i r s t - o r d e r  l og i c ,  and s jmi lar  results 
hkwe been established' In free l q ~ i c  with equality [5] 
and in a family of free modal lo,qics with. equality[4]. 
Since t h e   roof I s  effective, a ( d e ~ t h  f i r s t )  algorithm 
can be e~trlctea from it f o r  constructing, piven a closed 
forese for the union of TI and T2, a senarating sentence F. 
Evolving theordes, outfitted with additional devices 
to enhance their plausibility, appear to be a natuial for 
representinp ttemporal knowledge. When the extended j o i n t  
canal-stency theorem holgs f o r  t he  representation langulsge 
of a knowleaae base and when an effective proof has bean -
given, the separating sentence algorithm might be a 
useful t o o l  for ~ i n ~ o i n t i n g  inconsistencies in t he  knowleifve 
base 2 .  Only very restricted versions of t h e  al~orithms 
mentioned. above have been programmed, those in LISP [2] 
and SNOBOL,

The comments on t h e  dus t  jacket f o r  t h e  t h i r d  ed i t ion  of Colin Cherry's 
On Human Communication come from reviews of previous ed i t ions  whf-ch appeared 
i n  such d iverse  places as t h e  Canadian Journal  of Psychology, Physics Today, 
and Romance P h l l o l o ~  ahd lndicllte that it fs a broad ranging and fasc ina t ing  
book. The range is ce r t a in ly  broad, so  broad t h a t  I have included a tab le-  
of contents  as an appendix t o  t h i s  review r a t h e r  than attempting t o  summarize 
t h e  contents  of t h e  hook. 
But i t  is no longer fascinat ing.  Students of human c~mmunication 
have thought and debated much and even learned a l i t t l e  between t h e  pub- 
l i c a t i o n  of  t h e  first ed i t ion  of On Hman Communication i n  1957 and t h e  pub- 
l i c a t i o n  of t h e  t h i r d  ed i t ion  i n  1978. But very l i t t l e  of t h a t  mater ia l  has 
become p a r t  of the  substance of Cherry's book @though some of it is c i t e d ) .  
Thus, while the  first e d i t f  on may w e l l  hkve been "A Review, a Survey, and 
a Criticism'' ( t h e  book's s u b t i t l e ) ,  t h e  t h i r d  ed i t ion  is not.  Too much is 
l e f t  unconsidered. 
The most se r ious  gap is i n  t h e  consideration of na tu ra l  languages. 
Cherry gives the  impression t h a t  i n foma t ion  theory, s t a t i s t i c s ,  Fourier  
ana lys i s ,  and perhaps a l i t t l e  l og i c  are t h e  most important fonnal t o o l s  
f o r  the analys is  of natural language. That may have been true when Cherry 
m o t e  the first ed i t ion  of t he  book, but it is cq r t a in ly  not t r u e  now, 
Cherry does make a f e w  references t o  Chomsky, but none of the  substance of 
the Chomskian revolut ion (not  t o  mention post-Chomskian developments) has 
af fec ted  Cherry's treatment of na tura l  language. The texture of  theorizing 
and model bui lding i n  l i n @ i s t i c s ,  psychol inguist ics ,  and cognit ive psychology 
has undergone considerable change since the F i f t i e s ,  but l i t t l e  of t h a t  
has become part of the substance of On Human Communication. 
Similarly,  a great deal of work: has been dove on nonverbal commur~ication 
i n  the last two decades. While cherry a l ludes  t o  some of t h i s  work, he 
midies no attempt t~ summarize any of the  major l i n e s  of inquiry. As with 
modern l i n g u i s t i c s ,  the material is too diverse t o  cover it a11 i n  t he  s o r t  
of survey which Cherry intends On Human Congmicatidn t o  be. What I find 
so disheamtening is  that so l i t t l e  of t h l s  mater ial  i s  mentioned a t  a l l ,  
especia l ly  when one r e a l i z e s  t h a t  Cherry has added a new chapter ("~uman 
Communication: Peeling,  Knowing, and Understanding") t o  , the third edi t ion  
f o r  the purpose of t a lk ing  a b ~ u t  what i s  spec i f i ca l l y  human about human 
communication. That Cherry should devote ten pages t o  Z i p f v s  l a w  while 
not even mentioning the work of Paul Ekman, Carroll Izard, aad Manfred 
CJJrnes ( t o  mention only the  work which comes mqst readily t o  my mind) on 
the  expression and cmnunication of  emotion is b i ea r r e ,  
-P inal ly ,  Cherry's treatment of semiotics is r e l a t i v e l y  insulated from 
most of the-semiotic research of t h e  last tqo de&es. Semiotics is itself 
such a d iverse  and amorphous enterprise (as diverse and amorphous as t h e  
study OF human communication is) t h a t  it is perhaps u n f s i r  t o  c r i t ic i s*  
Cherry f o r  shortchanging it. R u t  Cherry introduced t h e  t3piC of r i t u a l  
i n t o  h i s  final chapter  and t h a t  is a subjec t  on which semioticians have 
had a great deal t o  say (I  am th inking of  structural anthropologis ts  such 
as Claude Levi-Stmuss, Edmund Leach, and Victor  Turner). C,onsequently 
I a m  incl ined t o  view Cherry's neglect  of Semiotics perhaps more 
harshly than I otherwise would. 
No doubt Cherry catlld be charged with o ther  s i n s s f  oniinission, but  the  
th ree  I ' v e  mentioned are se r ious  enough, It is  equally beyond doubt t h a t  
an ed i t ion  of On Human Communication which $ncluded this mater ia l  would be 
a very d i f f e r e n t  book, no t  Colin Cherry's book a t  all. If Cherry had, 
attempted and achieved a synthes is  of h i s  material, then i ts value as a synthes is  
might w e l l  outweigh t h e  dated nature  of some of t h e  elements of t h e  synthesis .  
R u t  Cherry wasn't after a synthesis ;  he simply wanted t o  see what was ou t  
there .  There is now much out there which Cherry hasn't seen. Consequently 
On Human Communication is not a good guide. The person -who wants o r  negds 
a general in t roduct ion t o  t h e  subject  of human communication which r e f l e c t s  
t h e  current s t a t e  of t h e  a r t ( s )  w i l l  have t o  look elsewhere.

JUrgen Kunze establishes his dependency grammar with 
four components. The syntactic is the most important. The 
three non-syntactic components are the paradigmatic component, 
theselectional component, and the assigning component. In the 
first chapter of his book ABHANGIGKEITSGRAMMATIK (Dependency 
Grammar) the reader gets introduced to some of the basic concepts 
useful in understanding the notions explicated later sn. Sub- 
ordination or dependency is introduced by way of a diagram, known 
as a tree, consisting of several connected points. A point or 
node that is connected to one closer to the top of the page is 
subordinate to it. This is called direct dependency. Indirect 
subordinat'ion is when two nodes are connected with one or more 
points in between them. These three nodes comprise a part tree. 
Kunz review 48 
Obviously there are several part trees which combine to make a tree. 
If the bottom-most node of our lfttle part tree is not superordinate 
to any other point then the part tree is an end complex. Every 
node is an en& complex with itself as its only member. 
Once one decides to attach words to these nodes it changes 
from a conne- the dots game to some sort of meaningful diaexam T&e 
first step in this change is to bring order to the diagram. Since 
language is the object of study here and the language the book was 
written in procedes from left to right, the author has ordered his 
tree from left to right. This type of tree is known as a W tree, 
i.e. Ghere each node is attached to a word. The book deals with 
M trees. These are trees in which the nodes are connected to signal 
combinations (Merkmalkombinationen). A marked tree is one in which 
a11 the connections are subordinate relations on one kind or another 
from a set containing all the kinds of subordinate relations pos- 
sible. 
In making his investigatiods, Kunze has limited his field 
of study to modern day written German. This suffices as for in any 
pure theoretical investigation it is acceptable to assume the ob- 
served language is a set of given sentences. The practicability 
of his theory depends on finding a standard of correctness. In 
this case tapping the knowledge of a native speaker is of no help 
Four ways are suggested as possibilities for this standard of cor- 
rectness. The first is grammatical correctness in which all sen- 
tences are acceptable as long as they function as members of their 
classes, i.e. nouns as nouns, verbs as verbs. Second is a more 
refined gramatital correctness taking the meaning of the verb 
into account. Third is the suggestion of a very strict grammar 
Kunz review 49 
bordering on grammar and semantics including semantic categories 
such as ABSTRACT or CONCRETE. The fourth consideration is a 
semantic grammatical correctness. Though this standard of correct- 
ness is needed to make the theory work, measuring correctness is 
not a major factor. 
There is, says Kunze, a base language and base structures 
that can express semantic and syntactic ambiguities. It is important 
when studying these structures to consider which categories and 
qualities are contained in it. A category is a variable with set 
value ranges, for example, in German, case. Qualities are restrictions 
imposed for ordering, appearance or non appearance of sentence frag- 
ments. Plainly-not all categories and qualities are in every 
sentence of a language. An expansion of the base language leads to 
a simplification of the descriptive system but also costs quite a 
bit as far as analysis is concerhed. 
On starting into the meat of the matter tha author writes 
that in no way can one expect such a simple tool as dependency 
trees to encompass the linguistic relations within the sentence 
that are conditioned through language. This inadequacy is evidenced 
by the following situation. Every grammatical structure has an or- 
dered dependency tree. It is however possible to have two different 
structures represented by the same tree. This is one of the 
principles for the representation of sentence structures using 
dependency trees. Reduction is another principle by which we get 
sentences like 'My friend will bring the book' from sentences 
like 'My friend will bring you the book tomorrow. An additional 
principle removes those nodes which were dropped from the latter 
sentence to arfive at the former This procedure is only permis- 
Kunz review 
sible when the middle steps are somewhat acceptable. 
An interesting concept is introduced by the author. He 
calles it the configuration criterion. It ways that one element 
is substitutable for another it it has all the same grammatical 
properties. This concept is used frequently in deciding what is 
dependent on what. 
The fourth chapter deals with the non-syntactic components. 
Paradigmatic categories are established. The categories are 
Gknus, commonly called gender, Person, and Number. Each of these 
three categories is established on the basis of data similar to 
the following example. I saw him. We saw him. These two sen- 
tences are syntactically equal but paradigmatically quite different. 
This illustrates the category of number, the first person singular 
changes to the first person plural. The author splits these 
categories again to account for the phenomenon of endings in 
German. It is possible to have a possessive pronoun with a mas- 
culine ending referring to a female person. Quasi categories are 
also established. These are tempus, modus, and case, and they 
are only quasi categories because they affect other parts of 
speech in a sentence. Kunze constructs a list which enumerates 
the category responsible for their relations, e.g. a noun is 
paradigmatically related to its apposite through case. 
The separation of the paradigmatic from the selectional 
is due to the ease with which the former are presentable. Selec- 
tional relations are more narrowly defined in this case than in 
generative grammar. As with the paradigmatic relations there 
are nine selectional relations, five of which belong to the in- 
Kune review. 
ventory and the other four don' t . 
There are demands made on a system of subordinate relations. 
The first of these is that the marked tree should be an adequate 
reeresentation of the syntactic structure of the sentence. Secondly, 
the subordination relations must allow all categories, qualities, 
and relations in the base structure To represent and differentiate 
the paradigmatic and selectional relations that can't be expressed 
through assigning. 
Affectation ways (Wirknngswege) are dashed lines connecting 
two nodes dominat+ed by a third node (see diagram). They represent 
other relations that exist between nodes aside from subordination. 
That these affection ways of both the paradigmatic and selectional 
relations must be represented through subordination relations is 
another demand made on the system. The last demand made is that 
the conditions for the paradigmatic and selective points (Vorgaben) 
must also be represented. 
The principle called the differentiation principle proves 
these last two are met. The system makes this determination by 
using a a knowledge of dependency trees, a fixed inventory of para- 
digmatic and selectional relations, and a fixed language base in 
a way which yields the required relations. 
The last concept developed by the author is that of bundles. 
Kunz review 52 
There are four types of bundles - a simple bundle, an elementary 
bundle, a complex bundle, and a complex implication bundle. A 
bundle is a tree used to represent not a sentence but a set of 
sentences, i.e. trees. In a complex bundle the paradigmatic and 
selective properties need only be given once. 
Chapter 8 is a discussion of some questions that were 
brought out as a result of this theory.

L e t ' s  exatnine a fewexamples  o f  the  behavior  o f  the a l g o r i t h m  F i r s t ,

F i g .  4 
The s t r e e t  i n  F ig .  4 has a proper name, and i s  thus r e f e r r e d  t o  s imply as 
Schluterstrasse. The t r e e  i s  t he  o n l y  one i n  the d iscourse  wor ld ,  and hence 
i s  i d e n t i f i e d  as the tree. The number o f  i n t e r e s t i n g  p o s s i b l e  s t r a t e g i e s  be- 
comes g r e a t e r  when the o b j e c t  t o  be descr ibed i s  one o f  several  belonging 
t o  the same conceptual c lass .  Consider for example MAN1 i n  Fig. 4. The sys- 
tem looks among i t s  p r o p e r t i e s  f o r  one which d i s t i n g u i s h e s  i t  from MAN2 and 
MAN3, and descr ibes i t  as the small man. A s i m i l a r  process u n d e r l i e s  the  
genera t ion  o f  the  noun phrase t h e  blg man w i t h  the umbrella t o  r e f e r  to 
MAN3. 
Note t h a t  t h e  system uses redundant l abe ls .  Th is  i s  a consequence o f  
the sequent ia l  na tu re  o f  i t s  noun-phrase generat ion:  F i r s t ,  the  p roper t y  
' b i g '  i s  found. When the system n o t i c e s  t ha t  t h e r e  i s  another b i g  man i n  
the  scene, i t  looks f o r  a Furkher d i s t  i w * - s h i n g  proper t y  and f i n d s  the um- 
b r e l l a .  T h i s  p roper ty  would i n  f a c t  be adequate i n  i t s e l f ,  bu t  the  system 
doesn't at tempt  t o  f i n d  a minimal c h a r a c t e r i z i n g  s e t  o f  a t t r i b u t e s .  T h i s  
s o r t  o f  redundancy, which i s  o f ten  found i n  human beings, saves t ime bo th  
i n  the genera t ion  and i n  the  i n t e r p r e t a t i o n  o f  d e f i n i t e  d e s c r i p t i o n s .  
HAM-RPM f r e q u e n t l y  uses negat ive  c h a r a c t e r i z a t i o n s  o f  var ious  k inds ,  
as, f o r  example, when MAN2 i s  descr ibed as the  bry man wi thout  an umbrella. 
Now l e t ' s  t u r n  t o  some more complex problems o f  noun-phrase generat ion.  So 
t h a t  the p i c t u r e s  d o n ' t  g e t  too c l u t t e r e d ,  we w i l l  use examples from a s imple

domain o f  geometr ical  f i g u r e s  ( f i g .  5 ) .  Consider CIRCLE1 i n  F ig .  5. Note 
t h a t  there  a r e  t w o  green c i r c l e s  i n  t h e  scene. The presence o f  several ob- 
j e c t s  which a r e  i n d i s t i n g u i s h a b l e  on the basis o f  t h e i r  a t t r i b u t e s  alone 
i s  the  worst  case which can occur.  The reason why we have spoken o f  a 'wors t -  
case-f  i r s t '  s t r a t e g y  i s  t h a t  the system checks fo r  t h i s  case e a r l y ,  ra the r

i n  t h e  last few examples given. 
In formal  observation shows t h a t  human beings also often notice the pres- 
ence o f  i d e n t i c a l  o b j e c t s  i n  a scene immediately. The o n l y  way t o  d i s t i n g u i s h  
these t w o  circles i s  by re ference t o  s p a t i a l  r e l a t i o n s ,  f o r  example, the 
green clrcle in front  of the red square. 
We may note i n  passing t w o  ways i n  which the  form of  a d e s c r i p t i o n  may 
be cons t ra ined  by the  form o f  the ques t ion  which i s  being answered. F i r s t ,  
p r o p e r t i e s  w h ~ c h  have been presupposed i n  the ques t i on  should not be men- 
t ioned i n a descr i p t  ion. Cons i der the ques t i o n  Which square is red?. The an- 
swer The r e d  sguare  i s  c l e a r l y  unacceptable, so instead the system answers 
  he square in front of the green t r i a n g l e  (= SQUARE I i n F tg . 5) . A second

F i g .  6 
d e s c r ~ p t i o n s .  For example, when answering the  ques t i on  Where is the  red 
t r i a n g l e ? ,  t he  system should no t  answer To the l e f t  of the green square 
whlch is to the rlght of the  r e d  triangle, a l though each ha1 f o f  th i  s de- 
s c r i p t i o n  i s  p e r f e c t l y  n a t u r a l  when considered i n  i s o l a t i o n .

circle ln f r o n t  of the green square which 1s to the l e f t  of the red t r i a n g l e .  
As t h i s  example shows, the products  o f  such r e c u r s i v e  a p p l i c a t i o n s  o f  the 
genera t ion  a l g o r ~ t h m  can soon become d i f f i c u l t  t o  understand. We have made 
the maximum a l l owab le  depth  o f  r e c u r s i o n  a parameter which can be s e t  to  
var lous  va lues  for exper imental  purposes. 
Perhaps the most d i f f i c u l t  problem i n  noun-phrase genera t ion  i s  t he

Al though a l l  o f  the examples d ~ s c u s s e d  up to  now have i nvo l ved  some s o r t  of 
d e s c r i p t i o n  o f  v i s i b l e  aspects o f  a  scene, HAM-RPM f r e q u e n t l y  makes use o f  
genera l  knowledge and in fe rence  r u l e s  t o  draw conc lus ions .  
For example, t h e  system m igh t  be asked Is the park3ng zone t a r r e d ? ,  
where the  pa rk i ng  zone i n  question, though p a r t  o f  the scene, i s  h idden 
from view. I t  would then t r y  t o  answer the q u e s t i o n  us ing  approximate i n f e r -  
ences based on f uzzy  knowledge ( ~ a h l s t e r  1978), conc lud ing  t h a t  the  p a r k i n g  
zone might  ve ry  w e l l  be tarred,  because a p a r k i n g  zone i s  i n  a sense a p a r t  o f  
a s t r e e t ,  and s t ree ts ,  l i k e  thoroughfares i n  general,  a r e  u s u a l l y  t a r r e d .  
In ferences which s tand  on such shaky ground as t h i s  one a r e  o f  l i m i t e d  use 
t o  the conversa t iona l  p a r t n e r  un less  the system can desc r ibe  the reasoning 
which u n d e r l i e s  them. 
Furthermore, not j u s t  any d e s c r i p t i o n  will be s a t i s f a c t o r y :  the system 
ought  to  a c t  i n  accordance w i t h  the  f o l l o w i n g  ' three maxims, as fo rmula ted 
by (Grice 1975): 
1. Hake your  c o n t r i b u t i o n  as i n f o r m a t i v e  as i s  r equ i red .  
2. Don't make your c o n t r i b u t i o n  more i n f o r m a t i v e  than  i s  r equ i red .  
3. Be r e l e v a n t .  
Thus, desc r i b ing  an i n fe rence  c h a i n  i n  every d e t a i l  w i l l  no t  i n  genera l  be 
c m u n i c a t i v e l y  adequate, i f  some o f  the in fe rences  a r e  e s s e n t i a l l y  d e f i n i -

A CRITICAL LOOK AT A FORMAL MODEL 
FOR STRATIFICATIONAL LINGUISTICS

SUMMARY 
We present here a formalization 
of the straiificational model of linguis- 
tics proposed by Sampson C131 and inves- 
tigate its generative power. In addition 
to uncovering a number of counter- 
intuitive properties, the results present- 
ed here bear on meta-theoretic claims 
found in the linguistic literature. For 
example, Postal [ l l j  claimed that strati- 
ficational theory was equivalent to 
context-free phrase-structure grammar, 
and hence not worthy of further interest. 
We show, however, that Sampson's model, 
and several of its restricted versions, 
allow a far wider range of generative 
powers. In the cases where the model 
appears to be too powerful, we suggest 
possible alterations which may make it 
more acceptable.
