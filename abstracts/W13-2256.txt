In this paper, we propose a novel syntac-
tic based MT evaluation metric which only
employs the dependency information in
the source side. Experimental results show
that our method achieves higher correla-
tion with human judgments than BLEU,
TER, HWCM and METEOR at both sen-
tence and system level for all of the four
language pairs in WMT 2010.
