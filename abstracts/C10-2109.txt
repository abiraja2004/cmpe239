We present a novel algorithm for de-
tecting errors in MT, specifically focus-
ing on content words that are deleted
during MT. We evaluate it in the con-
text of cross-lingual question answering
(CLQA), where we try to correct the
detected errors by using a better (but
slower) MT system to retranslate a lim-
ited number of sentences at query time.
Using a query-dependent ranking heuris-
tic enabled the system to direct scarce
MT resources towards retranslating the
sentences that were most likely to ben-
efit CLQA. The error detection algo-
rithm identified spuriously deleted con-
tent words with high precision. How-
ever, retranslation was not an effective
approach for correcting them, which in-
dicates the need for a more targeted ap-
proach to error correction in the future.
