We describe a method which uses one or more
intermediary languages in order to automati-
cally generate translation dictionaries. Such
a method could potentially be used to effi-
ciently create translation dictionaries for lan-
guage groups which have as yet had little in-
teraction. For any given word in the source
language, our method involves first translating
into the intermediary language(s), then into
the target language, back into the intermediary
language(s) and finally back into the source
language. The relationship between a word
and the number of possible translations in an-
other language is most often 1-to-many, and so
at each stage, the number of possible transla-
tions grows exponentially. If we arrive back at
the same starting point i.e. the same word in
the source language, then we hypothesise that
the meanings of the words in the chain have
not diverged significantly. Hence we back-
track through the link structure to the target
language word and accept this as a suitable
translation. We have tested our method by us-
ing English as an intermediary language to au-
tomatically generate a Spanish-to-Germandic-
tionary, and the results are encouraging.
