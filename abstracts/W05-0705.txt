 
The goal of many natural language proc-
essing platforms is to be able to someday 
correctly treat all languages. Each new 
language, especially one from a new lan-
guage family, provokes some modifica-
tion and design changes. Here we present 
the changes that we had to introduce into 
our platform designed for European lan-
guages in order to handle a Semitic lan-
guage. Treatment of Arabic was 
successfully integrated into our cross lan-
guage information retrieval system, which 
is visible online.
