We present a noun phrase coreference sys-
tem that extends the work of Soon et
al. (2001) and, to our knowledge, pro-
duces the best results to date on the MUC-
6 and MUC-7 coreference resolution data
sets ? F-measures of 70.4 and 63.4, re-
spectively. Improvements arise from two
sources: extra-linguistic changes to the
learning framework and a large-scale ex-
pansion of the feature set to include more
sophisticated linguistic knowledge.
