 
We present the design and evaluation of a 
translator?s amenuensis that uses compa-
rable corpora to propose and rank non-
literal solutions to the translation of expres-
sions from the general lexicon. Using dis-
tributional similarity and bilingual diction-
aries, the method outperforms established 
techniques for extracting translation 
equivalents from parallel corpora. The in-
terface to the system is available at:
