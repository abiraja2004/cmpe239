This paper reports experiments in
which pCRU ? a generation framework
that combines probabilistic generation
methodology with a comprehensive
model of the generation space ? is
used to semi-automatically create sev-
eral versions of a weather forecast text
generator. The generators are evaluated
in terms of output quality, development
time and computational efficiency against
(i) human forecasters, (ii) a traditional
handcrafted pipelined NLG system, and
(iii) a HALOGEN-style statistical genera-
tor. The most striking result is that despite
acquiring all decision-making abilities
automatically, the best pCRU generators
receive higher scores from human judges
than forecasts written by experts.
