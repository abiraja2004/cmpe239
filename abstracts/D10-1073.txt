Graph-based methods have gained attention in
many areas of Natural Language Processing
(NLP) including Word Sense Disambiguation
(WSD), text summarization, keyword extrac-
tion and others. Most of the work in these ar-
eas formulate their problem in a graph-based
setting and apply unsupervised graph cluster-
ing to obtain a set of clusters. Recent studies
suggest that graphs often exhibit a hierarchi-
cal structure that goes beyond simple flat clus-
tering. This paper presents an unsupervised
method for inferring the hierarchical group-
ing of the senses of a polysemous word. The
inferred hierarchical structures are applied to
the problem of word sense disambiguation,
where we show that our method performs sig-
nificantly better than traditional graph-based
methods and agglomerative clustering yield-
ing improvements over state-of-the-art WSD
systems based on sense induction.
