The performance of machine translation sys-
tems varies greatly depending on the source
and target languages involved. Determining
the contribution of different characteristics of
language pairs on system performance is key
to knowing what aspects of machine transla-
tion to improve and which are irrelevant. This
paper investigates the effect of different ex-
planatory variables on the performance of a
phrase-based system for 110 European lan-
guage pairs. We show that three factors are
strong predictors of performance in isolation:
the amount of reordering, the morphological
complexity of the target language and the his-
torical relatedness of the two languages. To-
gether, these factors contribute 75% to the
variability of the performance of the system.
