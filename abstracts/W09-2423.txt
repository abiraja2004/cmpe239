We present GLARF, a framework for repre-
senting three linguistic levels and systems for
generating this representation. We focus on a
logical level, like LFG?s F-structure, but com-
patible with Penn Treebanks. While less fine-
grained than typical semantic role labeling ap-
proaches, our logical structure has several ad-
vantages: (1) it includes all words in all sen-
tences, regardless of part of speech or seman-
tic domain; and (2) it is easier to produce ac-
curately. Our systems achieve 90% for En-
glish/Japanese News and 74.5% for Chinese
News ? these F-scores are nearly the same as
those achieved for treebank-based parsing.
