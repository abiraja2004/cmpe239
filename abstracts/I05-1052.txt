. This paper argues for the necessity of zero pronoun annotations in 
Korean treebanks and provides an annotation scheme that can be used to de-
velop a gold standard for testing different anaphor resolution algorithms. Rele-
vant issues of pronoun annotation will be discussed by comparing the Penn Ko-
rean Treebank with zero pronoun mark-up and the newly developing Sejong 
Teebank without zero pronoun mark-up. In addition to supportive evidence for 
zero marking, necessary morphosyntactic and semantic features will be sug-
gested for zero annotation in Korean treebanks.
