The Duluth systems that participated in task
11 of SemEval?2013 carried out word sense
induction (WSI) in order to cluster Web search
results. They relied on an approach that repre-
sented Web snippets using second?order co?
occurrences. These systems were all imple-
mented using SenseClusters, a freely available
open source software package.
