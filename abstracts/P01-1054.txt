This paper considers three assumptions
conventionally made about signatures
in typed feature logic that are in po-
tential disagreement with current prac-
tice among grammar developers and
linguists working within feature-based
frameworks such as HPSG: meet-semi-
latticehood, unique feature introduc-
tion, and the absence of subtype cover-
ing. It also discusses the conditions un-
der which each of these can be tractably
restored in realistic grammar signatures
where they do not already exist.
