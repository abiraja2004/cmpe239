In this paper, we propose a novel human com-
putation game for sentiment analysis. Our
game aims at annotating sentiments of a col-
lection of text documents and simultaneously
constructing a highly discriminative lexicon of
positive and negative phrases.
Human computation games have been widely
used in recent years to acquire human knowl-
edge and use it to solve problems which are
infeasible to solve by machine intelligence.
We package the problems of lexicon construc-
tion and sentiment detection as a single hu-
man computation game. We compare the re-
sults obtained by the game with that of other
well-known sentiment detection approaches.
Obtained results are promising and show im-
provements over traditional approaches.
