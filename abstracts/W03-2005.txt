In cross-database retrieval, the domain
of queries diers from that of the re-
trieval target in the distribution of
term occurrences. This causes incor-
rect term weighting in the retrieval sys-
tem which assigns to each term a re-
trieval weight based on the distribu-
tion of term occurrences. To resolve
the problem, we propose \term distil-
lation", a framework for query term
selection in cross-database retrieval.
The experiments using the NTCIR-3
patent retrieval test collection demon-
strate that term distillation is eective
for cross-database retrieval.
