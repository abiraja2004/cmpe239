Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a
fundamental task in text mining and nat-
ural language understanding. Current ap-
proaches to NER (mostly based on super-
vised learning) perform well on domains
similar to the training domain, but they
tend to adapt poorly to slightly different
domains. We present several strategies
for exploiting the domain structure in the
training data to learn a more robust named
entity recognizer that can perform well on
a new domain. First, we propose a sim-
ple yet effective way to automatically rank
features based on their generalizabilities
across domains. We then train a classifier
with strong emphasis on the most general-
izable features. This emphasis is imposed
by putting a rank-based prior on a logis-
tic regression model. We further propose
a domain-aware cross validation strategy
to help choose an appropriate parameter
for the rank-based prior. We evaluated
the proposed method with a task of recog-
nizing named entities (genes) in biology
text involving three species. The exper-
iment results show that the new domain-
aware approach outperforms a state-of-
the-art baseline method in adapting to new
domains, especially when there is a great
difference between the new domain and
the training domain.
