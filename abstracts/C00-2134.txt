 
We propose a new lexicalizcd grammar 
formalism called Lexicalized Tree 
Automata-based Grammar, which lcxicalizes 
tree acccptors instead of trees themselves. We 
discuss the properties of the grammar and 
present a chart parsing algorithm. Wc have 
implemented a translation module for 
conversational texts using this formalism, and 
applied it to an experimental automatic 
interpretation system (speech translation 
system).
