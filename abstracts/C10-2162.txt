 In this paper, we introduce our recent work on Chinese HPSG grammar development through treebank conversion. By manually defining grammatical constraints and anno-tation rules, we convert the bracketing trees in the Penn Chinese Treebank (CTB) to be an HPSG treebank. Then, a large-scale lexi-con is automatically extracted from the HPSG treebank. Experimental results on the CTB 6.0 show that a HPSG lexicon was successfully extracted with 97.24% accu-racy; furthermore, the obtained lexicon achieved 98.51% lexical coverage and 76.51% sentential coverage for unseen text, which are comparable to the state-of-the-art works for English. 1
