We have previously introduced a method
of word sense disambiguation that com-
putes the intended sense of a target word,
using WordNet-based measures of seman-
tic relatedness (Patwardhan et al, 2003).
SenseRelate::TargetWord is a Perl pack-
age that implements this algorithm. The
disambiguation process is carried out by
selecting that sense of the target word
which is most related to the context words.
Relatedness between word senses is mea-
sured using the WordNet::Similarity Perl
modules.
