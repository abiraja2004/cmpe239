A Maximum Entropy Model based system
for discriminative learning of syntactic and
semantic dependencies submitted to the
CoNLL-2008 shared task (Surdeanu, et al,
2008) is presented in this paper. The sys-
tem converts the dependency learning task
to classification issues and reconstructs the
dependent relations based on classification
results. Finally F1 scores of 86.69, 69.95
and 78.35 are obtained for syntactic depen-
dencies, semantic dependencies and the
whole system respectively in closed chal-
lenge. For open challenge the correspond-
ing F1 scores are 86.69, 68.99 and 77.84.
