 
The demonstrator presents a test-bed for 
collecting data on human?computer dia-
logue: a fully automated dialogue system 
that can perform Map Task with a user. 
In a first step, we have used the test-bed 
to collect human?computer Map Task di-
alogue data, and have trained various da-
ta-driven models on it for detecting feed-
back response locations in the user?s 
speech. One of the trained models has 
been tested in user interactions and was 
perceived better in comparison to a sys-
tem using a random model. The demon-
strator will exhibit three versions of the 
Map Task dialogue system?each using a 
different trained data-driven model of 
Response Location Detection.
