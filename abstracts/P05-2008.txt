Sentiment Classification seeks to identify
a piece of text according to its author?s
general feeling toward their subject, be it
positive or negative. Traditional machine
learning techniques have been applied to
this problem with reasonable success, but
they have been shown to work well only
when there is a good match between the
training and test data with respect to topic.
This paper demonstrates that match with
respect to domain and time is also impor-
tant, and presents preliminary experiments
with training data labeled with emoticons,
which has the potential of being indepen-
dent of domain, topic and time.
