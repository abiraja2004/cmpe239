Spoken language generation for dialogue
systems requires a dictionary of mappings
between semantic representations of con-
cepts the system wants to express and re-
alizations of those concepts. Dictionary
creation is a costly process; it is currently
done by hand for each dialogue domain.
We propose a novel unsupervised method
for learning such mappings from user re-
views in the target domain, and test it on
restaurant reviews. We test the hypothesis
that user reviews that provide individual
ratings for distinguished attributes of the
domain entity make it possible to map re-
view sentences to their semantic represen-
tation with high precision. Experimental
analyses show that the mappings learned
cover most of the domain ontology, and
provide good linguistic variation. A sub-
jective user evaluation shows that the con-
sistency between the semantic representa-
tions and the learned realizations is high
and that the naturalness of the realizations
is higher than a hand-crafted baseline.
