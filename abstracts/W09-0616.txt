This paper argues for a game-theoretic ap-
proach to content determination that uses
text-type specific strategies in order to de-
termine the optimal content for various
user types. By means of content deter-
mination for the description of numerical
data the benefits of a game-theoretic treat-
ment of content determination are out-
lined.
