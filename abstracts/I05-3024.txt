This paper presents a data-driven language 
independent word segmentation system that 
has been trained for Chinese corpus at the 
second Chinese word segmentation bakeoff. 
The system consists of a base segmentation 
algorithm and the refining procedures for 
the undecided character sequences. It does 
not use any lexicon and the base 
segmentation is simply done by character 
bigram and HMM-model is applied for the 
remaining character sequences. As a final 
step, high-frequency character trigram 
modifies the error-prone parts of the text.T1T
