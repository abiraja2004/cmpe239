 
Some linguistic constraints cannot be effec- 
tively resolved during parsing at the loca- 
tion in which they are most naturally intro- 
duced. This paper shows how constraints 
can be propagated in a memoizing parser 
(such as a chart parser) in much the same 
way that variable bindings are, providing a 
general treatment of constraint coroutining 
in memoization. Prolog code for a sim- 
ple application of our technique to Bouma 
and van Noord's (1994) categorial gram- 
mar analysis of Dutch is provided.
