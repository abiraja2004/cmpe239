We cast the word alignment problem as max-
imizing a submodular function under matroid
constraints. Our framework is able to express
complex interactions between alignment com-
ponents while remaining computationally ef-
ficient, thanks to the power and generality of
submodular functions. We show that submod-
ularity naturally arises when modeling word
fertility. Experiments on the English-French
Hansards alignment task show that our ap-
proach achieves lower alignment error rates
compared to conventional matching based ap-
proaches.
