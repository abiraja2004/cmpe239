This paper describes our system for Task 11
of SemEval-2013. In the task, participants
are provided with a set of ambiguous search
queries and the snippets returned by a search
engine, and are asked to associate senses with
the snippets. The snippets are then clus-
tered using the sense assignments and sys-
tems are evaluated based on the quality of the
snippet clusters. Our system adopts a pre-
existing Word Sense Induction (WSI) method-
ology based on Hierarchical Dirichlet Process
(HDP), a non-parametric topic model. Our
system is trained over extracts from the full
text of English Wikipedia, and is shown to per-
form well in the shared task.
