This paper describes our use of phrase-
based statistical machine translation (PB-
SMT) for the automatic correction of er-
rors in learner text in our submission to
the CoNLL 2013 Shared Task on Gram-
matical Error Correction. Since the lim-
ited training data provided for the task
was insufficient for training an effective
SMT system, we also explored alternative
ways of generating pairs of incorrect and
correct sentences automatically from other
existing learner corpora. Our approach
does not yield particularly high perfor-
mance but reveals many problems that re-
quire careful attention when building SMT
systems for error correction.
