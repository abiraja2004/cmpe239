The Wizard of Oz (WOZ) method has
been used for a variety of purposes in
early-stage development of dialogue sys-
tems and language technology applica-
tions, from data collection, to experimen-
tation, prototyping and evaluation. How-
ever, software to support WOZ experimen-
tation is often developed ad hoc for spe-
cific application scenarios. In this demo
we present WebWOZ, a web-based WOZ
prototyping platform that aims at support-
ing a variety of experimental settings and
combinations of different language tech-
nology components. We argue that a
generic and distributed platform such as
WebWOZ can increase the usefulness of
the WOZ method.
