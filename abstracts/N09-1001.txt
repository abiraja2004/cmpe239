We supplement WordNet entries with infor-
mation on the subjectivity of its word senses.
Supervised classifiers that operate on word
sense definitions in the same way that text
classifiers operate on web or newspaper texts
need large amounts of training data. The re-
sulting data sparseness problem is aggravated
by the fact that dictionary definitions are very
short. We propose a semi-supervised mini-
mum cut framework that makes use of both
WordNet definitions and its relation structure.
The experimental results show that it outper-
forms supervised minimum cut as well as stan-
dard supervised, non-graph classification, re-
ducing the error rate by 40%. In addition, the
semi-supervised approach achieves the same
results as the supervised framework with less
than 20% of the training data.
