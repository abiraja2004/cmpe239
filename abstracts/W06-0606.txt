 
This report explores the question of compatibility 
between annotation projects including translating 
annotation formalisms  to each other or to 
common forms. Compatibility issues are crucial 
for systems that use the results of multiple 
annotation projects. We hope that this report will 
begin a concerted effort in the field to track the 
compatibility of annotation schemes for part of 
speech tagging, time annotation, treebanking, 
role labeling and other phenomena.
