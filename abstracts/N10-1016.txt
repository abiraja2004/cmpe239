Constrained decoding is of great importance
not only for speed but also for translation qual-
ity. Previous efforts explore soft syntactic con-
straints which are based on constituent bound-
aries deduced from parse trees of the source
language. We present a new framework to es-
tablish soft constraints based on a more nat-
ural alternative: translation boundary rather
than constituent boundary. We propose sim-
ple classifiers to learn translation boundaries
for any source sentences. The classifiers are
trained directly on word-aligned corpus with-
out using any additional resources. We report
the accuracy of our translation boundary clas-
sifiers. We show that using constraints based
on translation boundaries predicted by our
classifiers achieves significant improvements
over the baseline on large-scale Chinese-to-
English translation experiments. The new
constraints also significantly outperform con-
stituent boundary based syntactic constrains.
