 
Results presented in this paper strongly 
support the notion that similarities as well as 
differences in language systems can be 
empirically investigated by looking into the 
linguistic patterns of speech repairs in real 
speech data. A total of 500 Gemmn and 325 
Mandarin Chinese overt immediate speech 
repairs were analysed with regard to their 
internal phrasal structures, with particular 
focus on the syntactic and morphological 
characteristics. Computational models in the 
form of finite state automata (FSA) also 
illustrate the describable regularity of 
German and Mandarin Chinese speech 
repairs in a formal way.
