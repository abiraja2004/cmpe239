In this paper we examine the issues that
arise from the annotation of the discourse
connectives for the Chinese Discourse
Treebank Project. This project is based on
the same principles as the PDTB, a project
that annotates the English discourse con-
nectives in the Penn Treebank. The pa-
per begins by outlining range of discourse
connectives under consideration in this
project and examines the distribution of
the explicit discourse connectives. We
then examine the types of syntactic units
that can be arguments to the discourse
connectives. We show that one of the
most challenging issues in this type of dis-
course annotation is determining the tex-
tual spans of the arguments and this is
partly due to the hierarchical nature of dis-
course relations. Finally, we discuss sense
discrimination of the discourse connec-
tives, which involves separating discourse
connective from non-discourse connective
senses and teasing apart the different dis-
course connective senses, and discourse
connective variation, the use of differ-
ent connectives to represent the same dis-
course relation.
