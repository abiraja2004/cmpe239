 
This paper describes the latest version of 
speech-to-speech translation systems de-
veloped by the team of NICT-ATR for over 
twenty years. The system is now ready to 
be deployed for the travel domain. A new 
noise-suppression technique notably im-
proves speech recognition performance. 
Corpus-based approaches of recognition, 
translation, and synthesis enable coverage 
of a wide variety of topics and portability 
to other languages.
