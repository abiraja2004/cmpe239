We propose a novel reordering model for
phrase-based statistical machine transla-
tion (SMT) that uses a maximum entropy
(MaxEnt) model to predicate reorderings
of neighbor blocks (phrase pairs). The
model provides content-dependent, hier-
archical phrasal reordering with general-
ization based on features automatically
learned from a real-world bitext. We
present an algorithm to extract all reorder-
ing events of neighbor blocks from bilin-
gual data. In our experiments on Chinese-
to-English translation, this MaxEnt-based
reordering model obtains significant im-
provements in BLEU score on the NIST
MT-05 and IWSLT-04 tasks.
