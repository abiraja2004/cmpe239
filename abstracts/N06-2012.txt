Georgian is a less commonly studied lan-
guage with complex, non-concatenative
verbal morphology. We present a compu-
tational model for generation and recogni-
tion of Georgian verb conjugations, rely-
ing on the analysis of Georgian verb struc-
ture as a word-level template. The model
combines a set of finite-state transducers
with a default inheritance mechanism.1
