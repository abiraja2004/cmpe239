We describe a parallel annotation ap-
proach for PubMed abstracts. It includes
both entity/relation annotation and a tree-
bank containing syntactic structure, with a
goal of mapping entities to constituents in
the treebank. Crucial to this approach is a
modification of the Penn Treebank guide-
lines and the characterization of entities as
relation components, which allows the in-
tegration of the entity annotation with the
syntactic structure while retaining the ca-
pacity to annotate and extract more com-
plex events.
