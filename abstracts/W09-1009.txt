Unambiguous Non-Terminally Separated
(UNTS) grammars have properties that
make them attractive for grammatical in-
ference. However, these properties do not
state the maximal performance they can
achieve when they are evaluated against a
gold treebank that is not produced by an
UNTS grammar. In this paper we inves-
tigate such an upper bound. We develop
a method to find an upper bound for the
unlabeled F1 performance that any UNTS
grammar can achieve over a given tree-
bank. Our strategy is to characterize all
possible versions of the gold treebank that
UNTS grammars can produce and to find
the one that optimizes a metric we define.
We show a way to translate this score into
an upper bound for the F1. In particular,
we show that the F1 parsing score of any
UNTS grammar can not be beyond 82.2%
when the gold treebank is the WSJ10 cor-
pus.
