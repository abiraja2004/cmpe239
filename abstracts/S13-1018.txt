We approach the typed-similarity task using
a range of heuristics that rely on information
from the appropriate metadata fields for each
type of similarity. In addition we train a linear
regressor for each type of similarity. The re-
sults indicate that the linear regression is key
for good performance. Our best system was
ranked third in the task.
