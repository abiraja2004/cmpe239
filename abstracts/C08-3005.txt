Building effective spoken dialogue sys-
tems (SDS) is currently a complex task
requiring expert knowledge. Our tools
give control of SDS application develop-
ment to non-experts, who need only use
a Graphical User Interface or GUI to de-
velop state-of-the-art ?Information State
Update? (ISU) dialogue systems. Behind
the GUI is a set of Advanced Dialogue
Tools (ADT) that generate complete SDS
based on Business User Resources. These
resources include a database and a Pro-
cess Model that captures the structure of
an application, for example, banking or
restaurant information. Also generated
are speech recognition Language Models
and grammars for robust interpretation of
spontaneous speech. We will demonstrate
how our simple GUI allows developers to
easily and quickly create and modify SDS
without the need for expensive speech ap-
plication service providers. This demon-
stration shows the interface, the ADT com-
ponents, and discusses some of the re-
search issues involved. We also show an
example application built with the tools: a
tourist information system running on an
ultra-mobile PC.
