In this paper, we use Arabic natural lan-
guage processing techniques to analyze
Arabic debates. The goal is to identify
how the participants in a discussion split
into subgroups with contrasting opinions.
The members of each subgroup share the
same opinion with respect to the discus-
sion topic and an opposing opinion to
the members of other subgroups. We
use opinion mining techniques to identify
opinion expressions and determine their
polarities and their targets. We opinion
predictions to represent the discussion in
one of two formal representations: signed
attitude network or a space of attitude vec-
tors. We identify opinion subgroups by
partitioning the signed network represen-
tation or by clustering the vector space
representation. We evaluate the system us-
ing a data set of labeled discussions and
show that it achieves good results.
