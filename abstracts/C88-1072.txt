 
This paper describes a prototype news analysis 
system Which classifies and indexes news stories in 
real time. The system extracts stories from a 
newswire, parses the sentences of the story, and 
then maps the syntactic structures into a concept 
base. This process results in an index containing 
both ger~eral categories and specific details. 
Central to this system is a Government-Binding 
parser which processes each sentence of a news 
item. The system is completely modular and can be 
interfaced with different news feeds or concept 
bases.
