Parser disambiguation with precision gram-
mars generally takes place via statistical rank-
ing of the parse yield of the grammar using
a supervised parse selection model. In the
standard process, the parse selection model is
trained over a hand-disambiguated treebank,
meaning that without a significant investment
of effort to produce the treebank, parse selec-
tion is not possible. Furthermore, as treebank-
ing is generally streamlined with parse selec-
tion models, creating the initial treebank with-
out a model requires more resources than sub-
sequent treebanks. In this work, we show that,
by taking advantage of the constrained nature
of these HPSG grammars, we can learn a dis-
criminative parse selection model from raw
text in a purely unsupervised fashion. This al-
lows us to bootstrap the treebanking process
and provide better parsers faster, and with less
resources.
