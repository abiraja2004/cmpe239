Multiword expressions (MWE), a known nui-
sance for both linguistics and NLP, blur the
lines between syntax and semantics. Previous
work onMWE identification has relied primar-
ily on surface statistics, which perform poorly
for longer MWEs and cannot model discontin-
uous expressions. To address these problems,
we show that even the simplest parsing mod-
els can effectively identify MWEs of arbitrary
length, and that Tree Substitution Grammars
achieve the best results. Our experiments show
a 36.4% F1 absolute improvement for French
over an n-gram surface statistics baseline, cur-
rently the predominant method for MWE iden-
tification. Our models are useful for several
NLP tasks in which MWE pre-grouping has
improved accuracy.
