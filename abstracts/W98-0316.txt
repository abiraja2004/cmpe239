 
A spontaneously spoken, natural Japanese discourse 
contains many instances of the so-called redundant in- 
terjections and of back-channel utterances. These ex- 
pressions have not hitherto received much attention and 
few systematic analyses have been made, since they 
were regarded as useless, spurious expressions. 
On the basis of the analysis of spoken dialogue cor- 
pus, we claim that these utterances have the charac- 
teristics of discourse markers, which delimit and define 
units of discourse. Our corpus consists of task-oriented 
dialogues conducted both in Jacanese and in English. 
The analysis of the Japanese c,:rpus shows that about 
half of the turns are started with these so-called redun- 
dant utterances, while the English corpus shows that 
about 25 % of the turns start with corresponding En- 
glish expressions. This suggests that at least in the case 
oi" Japanese, these so-called redundant utterances have 
much to do with units of discourse, the building blocks 
of discourse relations, and that they do indeed function 
as discourse markers. 
We show that these utterances comprise a well- 
defined category, characterizable in a regular manner 
by their prosodic properties. Prosodic patterns of dis- 
course markers occurring in the recorded corpus have 
been analyzed. Several pitch patterns have been found 
that characterize the most frequently used Japanese dis- 
course markers. Based on these characteristic pitch pat- 
terns, a system of discourse markers can be designed so 
that a relatively small number of basic forms are shown 
to give rise to most of the discourse markers, with into- 
nation patterns corresponding to the functions of dis- 
course markers.
