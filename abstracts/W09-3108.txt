 
This paper, which builds on previous studies on sentence alignment, introduces a sentence alignment method in which some sentences are used as ?anchors? and a two step proce-dure is applied. In the first step, some lexical information such as proper names, technical terms, numbers and punctuation marks, loca-tion information and length information are used to generate anchor sentences that satisfy some conditions. In the second step, texts are divided into several segments by using the anchor sentences as boundaries, and then the sentences in each segment are aligned by us-ing a length-based approach. By applying this segmentation technique, the method avoids complex computation and error spreading. Experimental results show that the precision of the method is 94.6% on the average for Chinese-Uyghur sentence alignment for multi-domain texts.
