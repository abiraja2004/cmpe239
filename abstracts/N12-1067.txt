We present a novel method for evaluating
grammatical error correction. The core of
our method, which we call MaxMatch (M2),
is an algorithm for efficiently computing the
sequence of phrase-level edits between a
source sentence and a system hypothesis that
achieves the highest overlap with the gold-
standard annotation. This optimal edit se-
quence is subsequently scored using F1 mea-
sure. We test our M2 scorer on the Helping
Our Own (HOO) shared task data and show
that our method results in more accurate eval-
uation for grammatical error correction.
