Information published in online stock invest-
ment message boards, and more recently in
stock microblogs, is considered highly valu-
able by many investors. Previous work fo-
cused on aggregation of sentiment from all
users. However, in this work we show that it
is beneficial to distinguish expert users from
non-experts. We propose a general framework
for identifying expert investors, and use it as a
basis for several models that predict stock rise
from stock microblogging messages (stock
tweets). In particular, we present two methods
that combine expert identification and per-user
unsupervised learning. These methods were
shown to achieve relatively high precision in
predicting stock rise, and significantly outper-
form our baseline. In addition, our work pro-
vides an in-depth analysis of the content and
potential usefulness of stock tweets.
