This paper details the coreference resolution
system submitted by Stanford at the CoNLL-
2011 shared task. Our system is a collection
of deterministic coreference resolution mod-
els that incorporate lexical, syntactic, seman-
tic, and discourse information. All these mod-
els use global document-level information by
sharing mention attributes, such as gender and
number, across mentions in the same cluster.
We participated in both the open and closed
tracks and submitted results using both pre-
dicted and gold mentions. Our system was
ranked first in both tracks, with a score of 57.8
in the closed track and 58.3 in the open track.
