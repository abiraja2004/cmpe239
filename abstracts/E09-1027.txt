 
We investigate linguistic features that correlate 
with the readability of texts for adults with in-
tellectual disabilities (ID).  Based on a corpus 
of texts (including some experimentally meas-
ured for comprehension by adults with ID), we 
analyze the significance of novel discourse-
level features related to the cognitive factors 
underlying our users? literacy challenges.  We 
develop and evaluate a tool for automatically 
rating the readability of texts for these users.  
Our experiments show that our discourse-
level, cognitively-motivated features improve 
automatic readability assessment.
