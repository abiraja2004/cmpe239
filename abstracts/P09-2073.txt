Recently, there is a growing interest in
working with tree-structured data in differ-
ent applications and domains such as com-
putational biology and natural language
processing. Moreover, many applications
in computational linguistics require the
computation of similarities over pair of
syntactic or semantic trees. In this context,
Tree Edit Distance (TED) has been widely
used for many years. However, one of the
main constraints of this method is to tune
the cost of edit operations, which makes
it difficult or sometimes very challenging
in dealing with complex problems. In this
paper, we propose an original method to
estimate and optimize the operation costs
in TED, applying the Particle Swarm Op-
timization algorithm. Our experiments on
Recognizing Textual Entailment show the
success of this method in automatic esti-
mation, rather than manual assignment of
edit costs.
