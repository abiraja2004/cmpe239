We present a constraint-based syntax-semantics
interface for the construction of RMRS (Robust
Minimal Recursion Semantics) representations
from shallow grammars. The architecture is de-
signed to allow modular interfaces to existing
shallow grammars of various depth ? ranging
from chunk grammars to context-free stochastic
grammars. We define modular semantics con-
struction principles in a typed feature structure
formalism that allow flexible adaptation to al-
ternative grammars and different languages.1
