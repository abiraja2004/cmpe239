In  this  paper,  we  described  the  PNNL 
Word Sense Disambiguation system as ap-
plied  to  the  English  all-word  task  in  Se-
mEval 2007. We use a supervised learning 
approach,  employing  a  large  number  of 
features and using Information Gain for di-
mension  reduction.  The  rich  feature  set 
combined with a Maximum Entropy classi-
fier  produces results  that  are significantly 
better than baseline and are the highest F-
score  for  the  fined-grained  English  all-
words subtask of SemEval.
