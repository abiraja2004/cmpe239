sults exploring the intrinsic structure of docu-
ments is widely researched in information re-
trieval (IR) and has attracted a considerable 
amount of time and study. However, one of 
the drawbacks is that those algorithms treat 
queries and documents separately.  Further-
more, most of the approaches are predomi-
nantly built upon graph-based methods, which 
may ignore some hidden information among 
the retrieval set.   
This paper proposes a novel document re-
ranking method based on Latent Dirichlet Al-
location (LDA) which exploits the implicit 
structure of the documents with respect to 
original queries. Rather than relying on graph-
based techniques to identify the internal struc-
ture, the approach tries to find the latent struc-
ture of ?topics? or ?concepts? in the initial re-
trieval set. Then we compute the distance be-
tween queries and initial retrieval results based 
on latent semantic information deduced. Em-
pirical results demonstrate that the method can 
comfortably achieve significant improvement 
over various baseline systems.
