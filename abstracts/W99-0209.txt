 
Nowadays there is a growing research 
activity centred in automated processing of 
texts on electronic form. One of the most 
common problems in this field is co- 
reference resolution, i.e. the way of knowing 
when, in one or more texts, different 
descriptions refer to the same entity. 
A full co-reference r solution is difficult to 
achieve and too computationally 
demanding; moreover, in many applications 
it is enough to group the majority of co- 
referential expressions (expressions with the 
same referent) by means of a partial 
analysis. Our research is focused in co- 
reference resolution restricted to proper 
names, and we part from the definition of a 
new relation called "replicancia". 
Though replicancia relation does not 
coincide extensionally nor intensionally 
with identity, attending to the tests we have 
carried out, the error produced when we take 
the replicantes as co-referents i admissible 
in those applications which need systems 
where a very high speed of processing takes 
priority.
