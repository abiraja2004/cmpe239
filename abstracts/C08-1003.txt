In this paper we explore robustness and
domain adaptation issues for Word Sense
Disambiguation (WSD) using Singular
Value Decomposition (SVD) and unlabeled
data. We focus on the semi-supervised do-
main adaptation scenario, where we train
on the source corpus and test on the tar-
get corpus, and try to improve results us-
ing unlabeled data. Our method yields
up to 16.3% error reduction compared to
state-of-the-art systems, being the first to
report successful semi-supervised domain
adaptation. Surprisingly the improvement
comes from the use of unlabeled data from
the source corpus, and not from the target
corpora, meaning that we get robustness
rather than domain adaptation. In addition,
we study the behavior of our system on the
target domain.
