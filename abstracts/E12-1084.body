German case syncretism is often assumed
to be the accidental by-product of historical
development. This paper contradicts this
claim and argues that the evolution of Ger-
man case is driven by the need to optimize
the cognitive effort and memory required
for processing and interpretation. This hy-
pothesis is supported by a novel kind of
computational experiments that reconstruct
and compare attested variations of the Ger-
man definite article paradigm. The exper-
iments show how the intricate interaction
between those variations and the rest of the
German ?linguistic landscape? may direct
language change.
