In this paper we attempt to deduce tex-
tual entailment based on syntactic depen-
dency trees of a given text-hypothesis pair.
The goals of this project are to provide an
accurate and fast system, which we have
called DLSITE-2, that can be applied in
software systems that require a near-real-
time interaction with the user. To accom-
plish this we use MINIPAR to parse the
phrases and construct their correspond-
ing trees. Later on we apply syntactic-
based techniques to calculate the seman-
tic similarity between text and hypothe-
sis. To measure our method?s precision we
used the test text corpus set from Second
PASCAL Recognising Textual Entailment
Challenge (RTE-2), obtaining an accuracy
rate of 60.75%.
