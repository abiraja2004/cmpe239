This paper presents an algorithm for unsu-
pervised co-occurrence based parsing that
improves and extends existing approaches.
The proposed algorithm induces a context-
free grammar of the language in question
in an iterative manner. The resulting struc-
ture of a sentence will be given as a hier-
archical arrangement of constituents. Al-
though this algorithm does not use any a
priori knowledge about the language, it
is able to detect heads, modifiers and a
phrase type?s different compound compo-
sition possibilities. For evaluation pur-
poses, the algorithm is applied to manually
annotated part-of-speech tags (POS tags)
as well as to word classes induced by an
unsupervised part-of-speech tagger.
