 
 In this paper we argue that access to rich se-
mantic structures  derived from questions and 
answers will enable both the retrieval of more 
accurate answers to simple questions and en-
able inference processes that explain the va-
lidity and contextual coverage of answers to 
complex questions. Processing complex ques-
tions involves the identifications of several 
forms of complex semantic structures. Answer 
Extraction is performed by recognizing event 
inter-relationships and by inferring over mul-
tiple sentences and texts, using background 
knowledge.
