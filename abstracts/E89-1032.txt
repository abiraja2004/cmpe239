 
We present an algorithm for the generation of 
sentences from the semantic representations of
Unification Categorial Grammar. We discuss a 
variant of Shieber's semantic monotonicity 
requirement and its utility in our algorithm. We 
indicate how the algorithm may be extended to other 
grammars obeying the same requirement. Appendices 
contain a full listing of the program and a trace of 
execution of the algorithm.
