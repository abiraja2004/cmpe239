 
This paper presents the Chinese word 
segmentation system developed by NOKIA 
Research Center (NRC), which was 
evaluated in the Fourth International 
Chinese Language Processing Bakeoff and 
the First CIPS Chinese Language 
Processing Evaluation organized by 
SIGHAN. In our system, a preprocessing 
module was used to discover the out-of-
vocabulary words which occur repeatedly 
in the text, then an improved n-gram model 
was used for segmentation and some post 
processing strategies are adopted in system 
to recognize the organization names and 
new words. We took part in three tracks, 
which are called the open and closed track 
on corpora State Language Commission of 
P.R.C. (NCC), and closed track on corpora 
Shanxi University (SXU). Our system 
achieved good performance, especially in 
the open track on NCC, our system ranks 
1st among 11 systems.
