Current methods of using lexical features
in machine translation have difficulty in
scaling up to realistic MT tasks due to
a prohibitively large number of parame-
ters involved. In this paper, we propose
methods of using new linguistic and con-
textual features that do not suffer from
this problem and apply them in a state-of-
the-art hierarchical MT system. The fea-
tures used in this work are non-terminal
labels, non-terminal length distribution,
source string context and source depen-
dency LM scores. The effectiveness of
our techniques is demonstrated by signif-
icant improvements over a strong base-
line. On Arabic-to-English translation,
improvements in lower-cased BLEU are
2.0 on NIST MT06 and 1.7 on MT08
newswire data on decoding output. On
Chinese-to-English translation, the im-
provements are 1.0 on MT06 and 0.8 on
MT08 newswire data.
