This paper shows how factored finite-
state representations of subregular lan-
guage classes are identifiable in the limit
from positive data by learners which are
polytime iterative and optimal. These rep-
resentations are motivated in two ways.
First, the size of this representation for
a given regular language can be expo-
nentially smaller than the size of the
minimal deterministic acceptor recogniz-
ing the language. Second, these rep-
resentations (including the exponentially
smaller ones) describe actual formal lan-
guages which successfully model natural
language phenomenon, notably in the sub-
field of phonology.
