Duplicate document detection is the problem
of finding all document-pairs rapidly whose
similarities are equal to or greater than a
given threshold. There is a method pro-
posed recently called prefix-filter that finds
document-pairs whose similarities never
reach the threshold based on the number
of uncommon terms (words/characters) in
a document-pair and removes them before
similarity calculation. However, prefix-filter
cannot decrease the number of similarity
calculations sufficiently because it leaves
many document-pairs whose similarities are
less than the threshold. In this paper, we
propose multi-level prefix-filter, which re-
duces the number of similarity calculations
more efficiently and maintains the advan-
tage of prefix-filter (no detection loss, no ex-
tra parameter) by applying multiple different
prefix-filters.
