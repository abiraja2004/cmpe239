We apply a novel variant of Random Forests
(Breiman, 2001) to the shallow semantic parsing
problem and show extremely promising results.
The final system has a semantic role classification
accuracy of 88.3% using PropBank gold-standard
parses. These results are better than all others
published except those of the Support Vector Ma-
chine (SVM) approach implemented by Pradhan
et al (2003) and Random Forests have numerous
advantages over SVMs including simplicity, faster
training and classification, easier multi-class classi-
fication, and easier problem-specific customization.
We also present new features which result in a 1.1%
gain in classification accuracy and describe a tech-
nique that results in a 97% reduction in the feature
space with no significant degradation in accuracy.
