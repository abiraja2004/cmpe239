We describe stochastic models of local
phrase movement that can be incorpo-
rated into a Statistical Machine Transla-
tion (SMT) system. These models pro-
vide properly formulated, non-deficient,
probability distributions over reordered
phrase sequences. They are imple-
mented by Weighted Finite State Trans-
ducers. We describe EM-style parameter
re-estimation procedures based on phrase
alignment under the complete translation
model incorporating reordering. Our ex-
periments show that the reordering model
yields substantial improvements in trans-
lation performance on Arabic-to-English
and Chinese-to-English MT tasks. We
also show that the procedure scales as the
bitext size is increased.
