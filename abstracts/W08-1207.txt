There has been extensive work on elicit-
ing human judgements on the sentiment
of words and the resulting annotated word
lists have frequently been used for opin-
ion mining applications in Natural Lan-
guage Processing (NLP). However, this
word-based approach does not take differ-
ent senses of a word into account, which
might differ in whether and what kind
of sentiment they evoke. In this paper,
we therefore introduce a human annotation
scheme for judging both the subjectivity
and polarity of word senses. We show that
the scheme is overall reliable, making this
a well-defined task for automatic process-
ing. We also discuss three issues that sur-
faced during annotation: the role of anno-
tation bias, hierarchical annotation (or un-
derspecification) and bias in the sense in-
ventory used.
