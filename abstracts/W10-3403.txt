 
In this paper, we present an on-going 
project aiming at extending the WordNet 
lexical database by encoding common 
sense featural knowledge elicited from 
language speakers. Such extension of 
WordNet is required in the framework of 
the STaRS.sys project, which has the 
goal of building tools for supporting the 
speech therapist during the preparation of 
exercises to be submitted to aphasic pa-
tients for rehabilitation purposes. We re-
view some preliminary results and illu-
strate what extensions of the existing 
WordNet model are needed to accommo-
date for the encoding of commonsense 
(featural) knowledge.
