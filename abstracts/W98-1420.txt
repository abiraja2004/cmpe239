  
Two main problems in natural language generation are lexical selection and syntactic 
? structure determination. In interlingua pproach to machine translation, determining sentence 
structures becomes more difficult, especially when the interlingua does not contain any syntactic 
information, in this paper, a knowledge-based computational model which handles these 
two problems in interlingua pproach is presented. The developed system takes interlingua 
representations of individual sentences, performs lexical selection, and produces frame-based 
syntactic structures. The system takes all the information about the target language from 
knowledge resources, in other words its architecture is language-independent. The implemented 
system is tested with Turkish through small-sized resources such that its output can be fed into 
a previously developed tactical generator to produce the final realizations of Turkish sentences.
