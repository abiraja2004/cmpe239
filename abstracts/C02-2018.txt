We report about the current state of development of a
document suite and its applications. This collection of
tools for the flexible and robust processing of documents
in German is based on the use of XML as unifying for-
malism for encoding input and output data as well as
process information. It is organized in modules with
limited responsibilities that can easily be combined into
pipelines to solve complex tasks. Strong emphasis is laid
on a number of techniques to deal with lexical and con-
ceptual gaps that are typical when starting a new appli-
cation.
