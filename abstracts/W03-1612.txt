Automatic evaluation of translation qual-
ity has proved to be useful when the target
language is English. In this paper the eval-
uation of translation into Japanese is stud-
ied. An existing method based on n-gram
similarity between translations and refer-
ence sentences is difficult to apply to the
evaluation of Japanese because of the ag-
glutinativeness and variation of semanti-
cally similar expressions in Japanese. The
proposed method applies a set of para-
phrasing rules to the reference sentences
in order to increase the similarity score
for the expressions that differ only in their
writing styles. Experimental results show
the paraphrasing rules improved the cor-
relation between automatic evaluation and
human evaluation from 0.80 to 0.93.
