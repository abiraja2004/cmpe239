For sentence compression, we propose new se-
mantic constraints to directly capture the relations
between a predicate and its arguments, whereas
the existing approaches have focused on relatively
shallow linguistic properties, such as lexical and
syntactic information. These constraints are based
on semantic roles and superior to the constraints
of syntactic dependencies. Our empirical eval-
uation on the Written News Compression Cor-
pus (Clarke and Lapata, 2008) demonstrates that
our system achieves results comparable to other
state-of-the-art techniques.
