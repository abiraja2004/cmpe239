This paper presents a model to compose semantic relations. The model is independent of any
particular set of relations and uses an extended definition for semantic relations. This extended def-
inition includes restrictions on the domain and range of relations and utilizes semantic primitives
to characterize them. Primitives capture elementary properties between the arguments of a relation.
An algebra for composing semantic primitives is used to automatically identify the resulting rela-
tion of composing a pair of compatible relations. Inference axioms are obtained. Axioms take as
input a pair of semantic relations and output a new, previously ignored relation. The usefulness of
this proposed model is shown using PropBank relations. Eight inference axioms are obtained and
their accuracy and productivity are evaluated. The model offers an unsupervised way of accurately
extracting additional semantics from text.
