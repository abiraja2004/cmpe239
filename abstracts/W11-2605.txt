This paper explores two different methods of
learning dialectal morphology from a small
parallel corpus of standard and dialect-form
text, given that a computational description
of the standard morphology is available. The
goal is to produce a model that translates in-
dividual lexical dialectal items to their stan-
dard dialect counterparts in order to facili-
tate dialectal use of available NLP tools that
only assume standard-form input. The results
show that a learning method based on induc-
tive logic programming quickly converges to
the correct model with respect to many phono-
logical and morphological differences that are
regular in nature.
