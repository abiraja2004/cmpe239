 
Plagiarism is the use of the language and 
thoughts of another work and the repre-
sentation of them as one's own original 
work. Various levels of plagiarism exist 
in many domains in general and in aca-
demic papers in particular. Therefore, di-
verse efforts are taken to automatically 
identify plagiarism. In this research, we 
developed software capable of simple 
plagiarism detection. We have built a 
corpus (C) containing 10,100 academic 
papers in computer science written in 
English and two test sets including pa-
pers that were randomly chosen from C. 
A widespread variety of baseline me-
thods has been developed to identify 
identical or similar papers. Several me-
thods are novel. The experimental results 
and their analysis show interesting find-
ings. Some of the novel methods are 
among the best predictive methods.
