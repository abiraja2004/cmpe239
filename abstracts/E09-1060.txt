The quality of the part-of-speech (PoS)
annotation in a corpus is crucial for the
development of PoS taggers. In this pa-
per, we experiment with three complemen-
tary methods for automatically detecting
errors in the PoS annotation for the Ice-
landic Frequency Dictionary corpus. The
first two methods are language indepen-
dent and we argue that the third method
can be adapted to other morphologically
complex languages. Once possible errors
have been detected, we examine each er-
ror candidate and hand-correct the cor-
responding PoS tag if necessary. Over-
all, based on the three methods, we hand-
correct the PoS tagging of 1,334 tokens
(0.23% of the tokens) in the corpus. Fur-
thermore, we re-evaluate existing state-of-
the-art PoS taggers on Icelandic text using
the corrected corpus.
