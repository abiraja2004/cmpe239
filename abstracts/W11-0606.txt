Greater learnability has been offered as an ex-
planation as to why certain properties appear
in human languages more frequently than oth-
ers. Languages with greater learnability are
more likely to be accurately transmitted from
one generation of learners to the next. We ex-
plore whether such a learnability bias is suffi-
cient to result in a property becoming preva-
lent across languages by formalizing language
transmission using a linear model. We then
examine the outcome of repeated transmission
of languages using a mathematical analysis, a
computer simulation, and an experiment with
human participants, and show several ways in
which greater learnability may not result in a
property becoming prevalent. Both the ways
in which transmission failures occur and the
relative number of languages with and with-
out a property can affect whether the rela-
tionship between learnability and prevalence
holds. Our results show that simply finding
a learnability bias is not sufficient to explain
why a particular property is a linguistic univer-
sal, or even frequent among human languages.
