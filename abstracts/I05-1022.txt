. The entity and relation recognition, i.e. (1) assigning semantic classes 
to entities in a sentence, and (2) determining the relations held between entities, 
is an important task in areas such as information extraction. Subtasks (1) and 
(2) are typically carried out sequentially, but this approach is problematic: the 
errors made in subtask (1) are propagated to subtask (2) with an accumulative 
effect; and, the information available only in subtask (2) cannot be used in sub-
task (1). To address this problem, we propose a method that allows subtasks (1) 
and (2) to be associated more closely with each other. The process is performed 
in three stages: firstly, employing two classifiers to do subtasks (1) and (2) in-
dependently; secondly, recognizing an entity by taking all the entities and rela-
tions into account, using a model called the Entity Relation Propagation Dia-
gram; thirdly, recognizing a relation based on the results of the preceding stage. 
The experiments show that the proposed method can improve the entity and re-
lation recognition in some degree.
