As the amount of information created by
human beings is explosively grown in the
last decade, it is getting extremely harder
to obtain necessary information by conven-
tional information access methods. Hence,
creation of drastically new technology is
needed. For developing such new technol-
ogy, search engine infrastructures are re-
quired. Although the existing search engine
APIs can be regarded as such infrastructures,
these APIs have several restrictions such as a
limit on the number of API calls. To help the
development of new technology, we are run-
ning an open search engine infrastructure,
TSUBAKI, on a high-performance comput-
ing environment. In this paper, we describe
TSUBAKI infrastructure.
