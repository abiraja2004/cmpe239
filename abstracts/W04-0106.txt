This paper presents an algorithm for the unsuper-
vised learning of a simple morphology of a nat-
ural language from raw text. A generative prob-
abilistic model is applied to segment word forms
into morphs. The morphs are assumed to be gener-
ated by one of three categories, namely prefix, suf-
fix, or stem, and we make use of some observed
asymmetries between these categories. The model
learns a word structure, where words are allowed
to consist of lengthy sequences of alternating stems
and affixes, which makes the model suitable for
highly-inflecting languages. The ability of the al-
gorithm to find real morpheme boundaries is eval-
uated against a gold standard for both Finnish and
English. In comparison with a state-of-the-art al-
gorithm the new algorithm performs best on the
Finnish data, and on roughly equal level on the En-
glish data.
