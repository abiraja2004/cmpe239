 
It has been recognized that single words extracted from natural language texts are not 
always useful for the representation of information content. Associated or related terms, 
and complex content identifiers derived from thesauruses and knowledge bases, or constructed 
by automatic word grouping techniques, have therefore been proposed for text identification 
purposes. 
The area of associative content analysis and information retrieval is reviewed in this 
study. The available experimental evidence shows that none of the existing or proposed 
methodologies are guaranteed to improve retrieval performance in a replicable manner for 
document collections in different subject areas. The associative techniques are most valu- 
able for restricted environments covering narrow subject areas, or in iterative search situa- 
tions where user inputs are available to refine previously available query formulations and 
search output.
