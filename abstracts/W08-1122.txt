While the effect of domain variation on Penn-
treebank-trained probabilistic parsers has been
investigated in previous work, we study its ef-
fect on a Penn-Treebank-trained probabilistic
generator. We show that applying the gener-
ator to data from the British National Corpus
results in a performance drop (from a BLEU
score of 0.66 on the standard WSJ test set to a
BLEU score of 0.54 on our BNC test set). We
develop a generator retraining method where
the domain-specific training data is automat-
ically produced using state-of-the-art parser
output. The retraining method recovers a sub-
stantial portion of the performance drop, re-
sulting in a generator which achieves a BLEU
score of 0.61 on our BNC test data.
