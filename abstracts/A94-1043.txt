 
This paper proposes an interactive rewriting tool 
for supporting people in creating machine acceptable 
sentences. The experiment and evaluation of this tool 
conducted when applied to a pre-editing support tool 
in a Japanese-to-English machine translation 
(henceforth, MT) system are also described.
