We proposed a subword-based tagging for
Chinese word segmentation to improve
the existing character-based tagging. The
subword-based tagging was implemented
using the maximum entropy (MaxEnt)
and the conditional random fields (CRF)
methods. We found that the proposed
subword-based tagging outperformed the
character-based tagging in all compara-
tive experiments. In addition, we pro-
posed a confidence measure approach to
combine the results of a dictionary-based
and a subword-tagging-based segmenta-
tion. This approach can produce an
ideal tradeoff between the in-vocaulary
rate and out-of-vocabulary rate. Our tech-
niques were evaluated using the test data
from Sighan Bakeoff 2005. We achieved
higher F-scores than the best results in
three of the four corpora: PKU(0.951),
CITYU(0.950) and MSR(0.971).
