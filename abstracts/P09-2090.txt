We describe a set of techniques for Ara-
bic cross-document coreference resolu-
tion. We compare a baseline system of
exact mention string-matching to ones that
include local mention context information
as well as information from an existing
machine translation system. It turns out
that the machine translation-based tech-
nique outperforms the baseline, but local
entity context similarity does not. This
helps to point the way for future cross-
document coreference work in languages
with few existing resources for the task.
