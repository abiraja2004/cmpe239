 
This paper introduces Boas, a semi-automatic 
knowledge licitation system that guides a team of 
two people through the process of developing the 
static knowledge sources for a moderate-quality, 
broad-coverage MT system from any "low-den- 
sity" language into English in about six months. 
The paper focuses on some issues in the elicitation 
of descriptive knowledge in Boas and also the issue 
of the principled reuse of pre-existing resources, 
such as a lexicon, an ontology, and an English gen- 
eration module, among others, made possible by 
the fact that the client MT system is developed for 
a single target language.
