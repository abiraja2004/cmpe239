This paper is concerned with the evaluation
of biomedical named entity recognition sys-
tems. We compare two such systems, one
based on a Hidden Markov Model and one
based on Conditional Random Fields and
syntactic parsing. In our experiments we
used automatically generated data as well
as manually annotated material, including
a new dataset which consists of biomedi-
cal full papers. Through our evaluation, we
assess the strengths and weaknesses of the
systems tested, as well as the datasets them-
selves in terms of the challenges they present
to the systems.
