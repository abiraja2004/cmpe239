 
The measurement of relative 
compositionality of bigrams is crucial to 
identify Multi-word Expressions 
(MWEs) in Natural Language 
Processing (NLP) tasks. The article 
presents the experiments carried out as 
part of the participation in the shared 
task ?Distributional Semantics and 
Compositionality (DiSCo)? organized as 
part of the DiSCo workshop in ACL-
HLT 2011. The experiments deal with 
various collocation based statistical 
approaches to compute the relative 
compositionality of three types of 
bigram phrases (Adjective-Noun, Verb-
subject and Verb-object combinations). 
The experimental results in terms of both 
fine-grained and coarse-grained 
compositionality scores have been 
evaluated with the human annotated gold 
standard data. Reasonable results have 
been obtained in terms of average point 
difference and coarse precision.
