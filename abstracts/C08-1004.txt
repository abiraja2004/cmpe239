This paper addresses the fundamental
problem of document classification, and
we focus attention on classification prob-
lems where the classes are mutually exclu-
sive. In the course of the paper we advo-
cate an approximate sampling distribution
for word counts in documents, and demon-
strate the model?s capacity to outperform
both the simple multinomial and more re-
cently proposed extensions on the classifi-
cation task. We also compare the classi-
fiers to a linear SVM, and show that pro-
vided certain conditions are met, the new
model allows performance which exceeds
that of the SVM and attains amongst the
very best published results on the News-
groups classification task.
