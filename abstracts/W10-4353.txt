 
This paper presents a dialogue system in 
the form of an ECA that acts as a socia-
ble and emotionally intelligent compan-
ion for the user. The system dialogue is 
not task-driven but is social conversation 
in which the user talks about his/her day 
at the office. During conversations the 
system monitors the emotional state of 
the user and uses that information to in-
form its dialogue turns. The system is 
able to respond to spoken interruptions 
by the user, for example, the user can in-
terrupt to correct the system. The system 
is already fully implemented and aspects 
of actual output will be used to illustrate.
