Categorization of text in IR has
traditionally focused on topic. As use
of the Internet and e?mail increases,
categorization has become a key area
of research as users demand methods
of prioritizing documents. This work
investigates text classification by
format style, i.e. "genre", and
demonstrates, by complementing topic
classification, that it can significantly
improve retrieval of information. The
paper compares use of presentation
features to word features, and the
combination thereof, using Na?ve
Bayes, C4.5 and SVM classifiers.
Results show use of combined feature
sets with SVM yields 92%
classification accuracy in sorting seven
genres.
