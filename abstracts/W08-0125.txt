We describe a process for automatically de-
tecting decision-making sub-dialogues in tran-
scripts of multi-party, human-human meet-
ings. Extending our previous work on ac-
tion item identification, we propose a struc-
tured approach that takes into account the dif-
ferent roles utterances play in the decision-
making process. We show that this structured
approach outperforms the accuracy achieved
by existing decision detection systems based
on flat annotations, while enabling the extrac-
tion of more fine-grained information that can
be used for summarization and reporting.
