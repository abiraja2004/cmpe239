Unlike open-domain factoid questions,
clinical information needs arise within the
rich context of patient treatment. This en-
vironment establishes a number of con-
straints on the design of systems aimed
at physicians in real-world settings. In
this paper, we describe a clinical ques-
tion answering system that focuses on a
class of commonly-occurring questions:
?What is the best drug treatment for X??,
where X can be any disease. To evalu-
ate our system, we built a test collection
consisting of thirty randomly-selected dis-
eases from an existing secondary source.
Both an automatic and a manual evalua-
tion demonstrate that our system compares
favorably to PubMed, the search system
most commonly-used by physicians today.
