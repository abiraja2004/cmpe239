 
Traditional indexing methods often record 
physical positions for the specified words, thus fail 
to recognize context information. We suggest that 
Chinese text index should work on the layer of 
sentences. This paper presents an indexing method 
based on sentences and demonstrates how to use 
this method to help compute the mutual 
information of word pairs in a running text. It 
brings many conveniences to work of natural 
language processing.
