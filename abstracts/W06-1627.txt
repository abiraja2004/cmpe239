We develop admissible A* search heuris-
tics for synchronous parsing with Inver-
sion Transduction Grammar, and present
results both for bitext alignment and for
machine translation decoding. We also
combine the dynamic programming hook
trick with A* search for decoding. These
techniques make it possible to find opti-
mal alignments much more quickly, and
make it possible to find optimal transla-
tions for the first time. Even in the pres-
ence of pruning, we are able to achieve
higher BLEU scores with the same amount
of computation.
