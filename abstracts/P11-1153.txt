Topic models have been successfully applied
to many document analysis tasks to discover
topics embedded in text. However, existing
topic models generally cannot capture the la-
tent topical structures in documents. Since
languages are intrinsically cohesive and coher-
ent, modeling and discovering latent topical
transition structures within documents would
be beneficial for many text analysis tasks.
In this work, we propose a new topic model,
Structural Topic Model, which simultaneously
discovers topics and reveals the latent topi-
cal structures in text through explicitly model-
ing topical transitions with a latent first-order
Markov chain. Experiment results show that
the proposed Structural Topic Model can ef-
fectively discover topical structures in text,
and the identified structures significantly im-
prove the performance of tasks such as sen-
tence annotation and sentence ordering.
