We present Wikulu1, a system focusing on
supporting wiki users with their everyday
tasks by means of an intelligent interface.
Wikulu is implemented as an extensible archi-
tecture which transparently integrates natural
language processing (NLP) techniques with
wikis. It is designed to be deployed with any
wiki platform, and the current prototype inte-
grates a wide range of NLP algorithms such
as keyphrase extraction, link discovery, text
segmentation, summarization, or text similar-
ity. Additionally, we show how Wikulu can
be applied for visually analyzing the results
of NLP algorithms, educational purposes, and
enabling semantic wikis.
