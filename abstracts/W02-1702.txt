 
Content selection is a key factor of any 
successful document generation system. 
This paper shows how a content selection 
algorithm has been implemented using an 
efficient combination of XML/XSL 
technology and the framework of RST for 
discourse modeling. The system generates 
multilingual documents adapted to user 
profiles in a learning environment for the 
web.  This CourseViewGenerator applies 
simplified RST schemes to the elaboration 
of a master document in XML from which 
content segments are chosen to suit the 
user's needs. The personalisation of the 
document is achieved through the 
application of a sequence of filtering levels 
of text selection based on the user aspects 
given as input. These cascading filters are 
implemented in XSL.
