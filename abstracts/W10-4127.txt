State-of-the-art Chinese word segmenta-
tion systems have achieved high perfor-
mance when training data and testing data
are from the same domain. However, they
suffer from the generalizability problem
when applied on test data from different
domains. We introduce a multi-layer Chi-
nese word segmentation system which can
integrate the outputs from multiple hetero-
geneous segmentation systems. By train-
ing a second layer of large margin clas-
sifier on top of the outputs from several
Conditional Random Fields classifiers, it
can utilize a small amount of in-domain
training data to improve the performance.
Experimental results show consistent im-
provement on F1 scores and OOV recall
rates by applying the approach.
