This study examines the usefulness of common
off the shelf compression software such as gzip
in enhancing already existing summaries and
producing summaries from scratch. Since the
gzip algorithm works by removing repetitive
data from a file in order to compress it, we
should be able to determine which sentences in
a summary contain the least repetitive data by
judging the gzipped size of the summary with
the sentence compared to the gzipped size of
the summary without the sentence. By picking
the sentence that increased the size of the sum-
mary the most, we hypothesized that the sum-
mary will gain the sentence with the most new
information. This hypothesis was found to be
true in many cases and to varying degrees in
this study.
