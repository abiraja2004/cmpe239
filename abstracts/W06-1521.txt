Abstract
This paper presents informally an Earley
algorithm for TAG which behaves as the
algorithm given by (Schabes and Joshi,
1988). This algorithm is a specialization
to TAG of a more general algorithm ded-
icated to second order ACGs. As second
order ACGs allows to encode Linear Con-
text Free Rewriting Systems (LCFRS) (de
Groote and Pogodalla, 2004), the presen-
tation of this algorithm gives a rough pre-
sentation of the formal tools which can
be used to design efficient algorithms for
LCFRS. Furthermore, as these tools allow
to parse linear ?-terms, they can be used
as a basis for developping algorithms for
generation.
