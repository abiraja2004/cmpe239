We present a statistical phrase-based transla-
tion model that uses hierarchical phrases?
phrases that contain subphrases. The model
is formally a synchronous context-free gram-
mar but is learned from a bitext without any
syntactic information. Thus it can be seen as
a shift to the formal machinery of syntax-
based translation systems without any lin-
guistic commitment. In our experiments us-
ing BLEU as a metric, the hierarchical phrase-
based model achieves a relative improve-
ment of 7.5% over Pharaoh, a state-of-the-art
phrase-based system.
