This paper proposes a novel semi-
supervised word alignment technique
called EMDC that integrates discrimina-
tive and generative methods. A discrim-
inative aligner is used to find high preci-
sion partial alignments that serve as con-
straints for a generative aligner which
implements a constrained version of the
EM algorithm. Experiments on small-size
Chinese and Arabic tasks show consistent
improvements on AER. We also experi-
mented with moderate-size Chinese ma-
chine translation tasks and got an aver-
age of 0.5 point improvement on BLEU
scores across five standard NIST test sets
and four other test sets.
