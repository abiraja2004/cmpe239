A serious bottleneck of comparative parser
evaluation is the fact that different parsers
subscribe to different formal frameworks
and theoretical assumptions. Converting
outputs from one framework to another is
less than optimal as it easily introduces
noise into the process. Here we present a
principled protocol for evaluating parsing
results across frameworks based on func-
tion trees, tree generalization and edit dis-
tance metrics. This extends a previously
proposed framework for cross-theory eval-
uation and allows us to compare a wider
class of parsers. We demonstrate the useful-
ness and language independence of our pro-
cedure by evaluating constituency and de-
pendency parsers on English and Swedish.
