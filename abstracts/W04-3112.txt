 
Researchers in the biomedical and molecular 
biology fields are faced with a wide variety of 
information sources. These are presented in 
the form of images, free text, and structured 
data files that include medical records, gene 
and protein sequence data, and whole genome 
microarray data, all gathered from a variety of 
experimental organisms and clinical subjects. 
The need to organize and relate this informa-
tion, particularly concerning genes,  has moti-
vated the development of resources, such as 
the Unified Medical Language System, Gene 
Ontology, LocusLink, and the Online Inheri-
tance In Man (OMIM) database. We describe 
a natural language processing application to 
extract information on genes from unstruc-
tured text and discuss ways to integrate this 
information with some of the available online 
resources.
