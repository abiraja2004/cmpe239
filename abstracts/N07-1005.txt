The quality of a sentence translated by a
machine translation (MT) system is dif-
ficult to evaluate. We propose a method
for automatically evaluating the quality
of each translation. In general, when
translating a given sentence, one or more
conditions should be satisfied to maintain
a high translation quality. In English-
Japanese translation, for example, prepo-
sitions and infinitives must be appropri-
ately translated. We show several proce-
dures that enable evaluating the quality of
a translated sentence more appropriately
than using conventional methods. The
first procedure is constructing a test set
where the conditions are assigned to each
test-set sentence in the form of yes/no
questions. The second procedure is devel-
oping a system that determines an answer
to each question. The third procedure is
combining a measure based on the ques-
tions and conventional measures. We also
present a method for automatically gener-
ating sub-goals in the form of yes/no ques-
tions and estimating the rate of accom-
plishment of the sub-goals. Promising re-
sults are shown.
