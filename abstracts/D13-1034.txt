This paper contributes an approach for
expressing non-concatenative morphological
phenomena, such as stem derivation in
Semitic languages, in terms of a mildly
context-sensitive grammar formalism. This
offers a convenient level of modelling ab-
straction while remaining computationally
tractable. The nonparametric Bayesian frame-
work of adaptor grammars is extended to this
richer grammar formalism to propose a prob-
abilistic model that can learn word segmenta-
tion and morpheme lexicons, including ones
with discontiguous strings as elements, from
unannotated data. Our experiments on He-
brew and three variants of Arabic data find
that the additional expressiveness to capture
roots and templates as atomic units improves
the quality of concatenative segmentation and
stem identification. We obtain 74% accuracy
in identifying triliteral Hebrew roots, while
performing morphological segmentation with
an F1-score of 78.1.
