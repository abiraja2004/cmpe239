We compare and contrast two different models for
detecting sentence-like units in continuous speech.
The first approach uses hidden Markov sequence
models based on N-grams and maximum likeli-
hood estimation, and employs model interpolation
to combine different representations of the data.
The second approach models the posterior proba-
bilities of the target classes; it is discriminative and
integrates multiple knowledge sources in the max-
imum entropy (maxent) framework. Both models
combine lexical, syntactic, and prosodic informa-
tion. We develop a technique for integrating pre-
trained probability models into the maxent frame-
work, and show that this approach can improve
on an HMM-based state-of-the-art system for the
sentence-boundary detection task. An even more
substantial improvement is obtained by combining
the posterior probabilities of the two systems.
