We present an Earley-style parser for
simple range concatenation grammar, a
formalism strongly equivalent to linear
context-free rewriting systems. Further-
more, we present different filters which
reduce the number of items in the pars-
ing chart. An implementation shows that
parses can be obtained in a reasonable
time.
