 
Previous methods on improving transla-
tion quality by employing multiple SMT 
models usually carry out as a second-
pass decision procedure on hypotheses 
from multiple systems using extra fea-
tures instead of using features in existing 
models in more depth. In this paper, we 
propose translation model generalization 
(TMG), an approach that updates proba-
bility feature values for the translation 
model being used based on the model it-
self and a set of auxiliary models, aiming 
to enhance translation quality in the first-
pass decoding. We validate our approach 
on translation models based on auxiliary 
models built by two different ways. We 
also introduce novel probability variance 
features into the log-linear models for 
further improvements. We conclude that 
our approach can be developed indepen-
dently and integrated into current SMT 
pipeline directly. We demonstrate BLEU 
improvements on the NIST Chinese-to-
English MT tasks for single-system de-
codings, a system combination approach 
and a model combination approach.1
