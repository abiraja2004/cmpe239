This paper proposes a discriminative for-
est reranking algorithm for dependency pars-
ing that can be seen as a form of efficient
stacked parsing. A dynamic programming
shift-reduce parser produces a packed deriva-
tion forest which is then scored by a discrim-
inative reranker, using the 1-best tree output
by the shift-reduce parser as guide features in
addition to third-order graph-based features.
To improve efficiency and accuracy, this pa-
per also proposes a novel shift-reduce parser
that eliminates the spurious ambiguity of arc-
standard transition systems. Testing on the
English Penn Treebank data, forest reranking
gave a state-of-the-art unlabeled dependency
accuracy of 93.12.
