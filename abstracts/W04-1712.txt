This paper proposes a new e-learning paradigm
which enables the user to type in arbitrary sentences.
The current NLP technologies, however, are not ma-
tured enough to perform full-automatic semantic or
discourse analysis. Thus, we take a different ap-
proach; an instructor corrects the contents and its
correction is embedded into the contents in an XML
format called KeML. The key/mouse operations of
the user are also embedded as annotations. Thus,
the contents can be incomplete at the initial stage
and become solid gradually as being utilized. We
have implemented an e-learning system of group dis-
cussion for a foreign language class, which is demon-
strated at the workshop.
