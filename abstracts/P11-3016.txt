Allophonic rules are responsible for the great
variety in phoneme realizations. Infants can
not reliably infer abstract word representa-
tions without knowledge of their native allo-
phonic grammar. We explore the hypothe-
sis that some properties of infants? input, re-
ferred to as indicators, are correlated with al-
lophony. First, we provide an extensive evalu-
ation of individual indicators that rely on dis-
tributional or lexical information. Then, we
present a first evaluation of the combination of
indicators of different types, considering both
logical and numerical combinations schemes.
Though distributional and lexical indicators
are not redundant, straightforward combina-
tions do not outperform individual indicators.
