It has been suggested that some forms of speech
disuencies, most notable interjections and par-
entheticals, tend to occur disproportionally at
major clause boundaries [6] and thus might
serve to aid parsers in establishing these bound-
aries. We have tested a current statistical parser
[1] on Switchboard text with and without inter-
jections and parentheticals and found that the
parser performed better when not faced with
these extra phenomena. This suggest that for
current parsers, at least, interjection and paren-
thetical placement does not help in the parsing
process.
