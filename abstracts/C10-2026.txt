 
Global ranking, a new information re-
trieval (IR) technology, uses a ranking 
model for cases in which there exist re-
lationships between the objects to be 
ranked. In the ranking task, the ranking 
model is defined as a function of the 
properties of the objects as well as the 
relations between the objects. Existing 
global ranking approaches address the 
problem by ?learning to rank?. In this 
paper, we propose a global ranking 
framework that solves the problem via 
data fusion. The idea is to take each re-
trieved document as a pseudo-IR sys-
tem. Each document generates a pseu-
do-ranked list by a global function. The 
data fusion algorithm is then adapted to 
generate the final ranked list. Taking a 
biomedical information extraction task, 
namely, interactor normalization task 
(INT), as an example, we explain how 
the problem can be formulated as a 
global ranking problem, and demon-
strate how the proposed fusion-based 
framework outperforms baseline me-
thods. By using the proposed frame-
work, we improve the performance of 
the top 1 INT system by 3.2% using 
the official evaluation metric of the 
BioCreAtIvE challenge. In addition, by 
employing the standard ranking quality 
measure, NDCG, we demonstrate that

the proposed framework can be cas-

models and improve their ranking re-
sults.
