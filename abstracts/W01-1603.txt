We have developed a discourse level
tagging tool for spoken dialogue cor-
pus using machine learning meth-
ods. As discourse level informa-
tion, we focused on dialogue act, rel-
evance and discourse segment. In
dialogue act tagging, we have im-
plemented a transformation-based
learning procedure and resulted in
70% accuracy in open test. In
relevance and discourse segment
tagging, we have implemented a
decision-tree based learning proce-
dure and resulted in about 75% and
72% accuracy respectively.
