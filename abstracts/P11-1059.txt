Negation is present in all human languages
and it is used to reverse the polarity of part
of statements that are otherwise affirmative by
default. A negated statement often carries pos-
itive implicit meaning, but to pinpoint the pos-
itive part from the negative part is rather dif-
ficult. This paper aims at thoroughly repre-
senting the semantics of negation by revealing
implicit positive meaning. The proposed rep-
resentation relies on focus of negation detec-
tion. For this, new annotation over PropBank
and a learning algorithm are proposed.
