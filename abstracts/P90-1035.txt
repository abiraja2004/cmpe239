 
We define a set of deterministic bottom-up left to right 
parsers which analyze a subset of Tree Adjoining Lan- 
guages. The LR parsing strategy for Context Free 
Grammars is extended to Tree Adjoining Grammars 
(TAGs). We use a machine, called Bottom-up Embed- 
tied Push Down Automaton (BEPDA), that recognizes 
in a bottom-up fashion the set of Tree Adjoining Lan- 
guages (and exactly this se0. Each parser consists of a 
finite state control that drives the moves of a Bottom-up 
Embedded Pushdown Automaton. The parsers handle 
deterministically some context-sensitive Tree Adjoining 
Languages. 
In this paper, we informally describe the BEPDA then 
given a parsing table, we explain the LR parsing algo- 
rithm. We then show how to construct an LR(0) parsing 
table (no lookahead). An example of a context-sensitive 
language recognized eterministically is given. Then, 
we explain informally the construction of SLR(1) pars- 
ing tables for BEPDA. We conclude with a discussion 
of our parsing method and current work.
