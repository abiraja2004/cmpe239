This paper presents an empirical study on
how different selections of input translation
systems affect translation quality in system
combination. We give empirical evidence
that the systems to be combined should be
of similar quality and need to be almost
uncorrelated in order to be beneficial for sys-
tem combination. Experimental results are
presented for composite translations com-
puted from large numbers of different re-
search systems as well as a set of transla-
tion systems derived from one of the best-
ranked machine translation engines in the
2006 NIST machine translation evaluation.
