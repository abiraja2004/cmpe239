In Semantic Textual Similarity (STS), sys-
tems rate the degree of semantic equivalence,
on a graded scale from 0 to 5, with 5 be-
ing the most similar. This year we set up
two tasks: (i) a core task (CORE), and (ii)
a typed-similarity task (TYPED). CORE is
similar in set up to SemEval STS 2012 task
with pairs of sentences from sources related
to those of 2012, yet different in genre from
the 2012 set, namely, this year we included
newswire headlines, machine translation eval-
uation datasets and multiple lexical resource
glossed sets. TYPED, on the other hand, is
novel and tries to characterize why two items
are deemed similar, using cultural heritage
items which are described with metadata such
as title, author or description. Several types of
similarity have been defined, including simi-
lar author, similar time period or similar lo-
cation. The annotation for both tasks lever-
ages crowdsourcing, with relative high inter-
annotator correlation, ranging from 62% to
87%. The CORE task attracted 34 participants
with 89 runs, and the TYPED task attracted 6
teams with 14 runs.
