Letter-substitution ciphers encode a docu-
ment from a known or hypothesized lan-
guage into an unknown writing system or
an unknown encoding of a known writing
system. It is a problem that can occur in
a number of practical applications, such as
in the problem of determining the encod-
ings of electronic documents in which the
language is known, but the encoding stan-
dard is not. It has also been used in rela-
tion to OCR applications. In this paper, we
introduce an exact method for decipher-
ing messages using a generalization of the
Viterbi algorithm. We test this model on a
set of ciphers developed from various web
sites, and find that our algorithm has the
potential to be a viable, practical method
for efficiently solving decipherment prob-
lems.
