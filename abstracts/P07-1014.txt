In this paper, we put forward an information
theoretic definition of the redundancy that is
observed across the sound inventories of the
world?s languages. Through rigorous statis-
tical analysis, we find that this redundancy
is an invariant property of the consonant in-
ventories. The statistical analysis further un-
folds that the vowel inventories do not ex-
hibit any such property, which in turn points
to the fact that the organizing principles of
the vowel and the consonant inventories are
quite different in nature.
