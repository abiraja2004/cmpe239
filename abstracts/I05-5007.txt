Rather than creating and storing thou-
sands of paraphrase examples, para-
phrase templates have strong 
representation capacity and can be used
to generate many paraphrase examples.
This paper describes a new template
representation and generalization
method. Combing a semantic diction-
ary, it uses multiple semantic codes to
represent a paraphrase template. Using
an existing search engine to extend the
word clusters and generalize the exam-
ples.  We also design three metrics to
measure our generalized templates. The 
experimental results show that the rep-
resentation method is reasonable and 
the generalized templates have a higher 
precision and coverage.
