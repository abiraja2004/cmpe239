This paper presents Genpex, a system for au-
tomatic generation of narrative probability ex-
ercises. Generation of exercises in Genpex is
done in two steps. First, the system creates
a specification of a solvable probability prob-
lem, based on input from the user (a researcher
or test developer) who selects a specific ques-
tion type and a narrative context for the prob-
lem. Then, a text expressing the probability
problem is generated. The user can tune the
generated text by setting the values of some
linguistic variation parameters. By varying
the mathematical content of the exercise, its
narrative context and the linguistic parameter
settings, many different exercises can be pro-
duced. Here we focus on the natural language
generation part of Genpex. After describing
how the system works, we briefly present our
first evaluation results, and discuss some as-
pects requiring further investigation.
