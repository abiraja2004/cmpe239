This paper describes a generic, open-
domain multi-document summarisation
system which combines new and exist-
ing techniques in a novel way. The sys-
tem is capable of automatically identify-
ing query-related online documents and
compiling a report from the most use-
ful sources, whilst presenting the result in
such a way as to make it easy for the re-
searcher to look up the information in its
original context.
