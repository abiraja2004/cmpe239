Online discussion forums are a valuable
means for users to resolve specific information
needs, both interactively for the participants
and statically for users who search/browse
over historical thread data. However, the com-
plex structure of forum threads can make it
difficult for users to extract relevant informa-
tion. The discourse structure of web forum
threads, in the form of labelled dependency re-
lationships between posts, has the potential to
greatly improve information access over web
forum archives. In this paper, we present the
task of parsing user forum threads to deter-
mine the labelled dependencies between posts.
Three methods, including a dependency pars-
ing approach, are proposed to jointly clas-
sify the links (relationships) between posts
and the dialogue act (type) of each link. The
proposed methods significantly surpass an in-
formed baseline. We also experiment with ?in
situ? classification of evolving threads, and es-
tablish that our best methods are able to per-
form equivalently well over partial threads as
complete threads.
