 
With the rising influence of the Gene On-
tology, new approaches have emerged 
where the similarity between genes or 
gene products is obtained by comparing 
Gene Ontology code annotations associ-
ated with them. So far, these approaches 
have solely relied on the knowledge en-
coded in the Gene Ontology and the gene 
annotations associated with the Gene On-
tology database. The goal of this paper is 
to demonstrate that improvements to these 
approaches can be obtained by integrating 
textual evidence extracted from relevant 
biomedical literature.
