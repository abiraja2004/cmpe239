This paper presents an HMM-based
chunk tagger for Hindi. Various tagging
schemes for marking chunk boundaries
are discussed along with their results.
Contextual information is incorporated
into the chunk tags in the form of part-
of-speech (POS) information. This in-
formation is also added to the tokens
themselves to achieve better precision.
Error analysis is carried out to reduce
the number of common errors. It is
found that for certain classes of words,
using the POS information is more ef-
fective than using a combination of
word and POS tag as the token. Fi-
nally, chunk labels are also marked on
the chunks.
