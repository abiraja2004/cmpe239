Sentiment analysis of citations in scientific pa-
pers and articles is a new and interesting prob-
lem due to the many linguistic differences be-
tween scientific texts and other genres. In
this paper, we focus on the problem of auto-
matic identification of positive and negative
sentiment polarity in citations to scientific pa-
pers. Using a newly constructed annotated ci-
tation sentiment corpus, we explore the effec-
tiveness of existing and novel features, includ-
ing n-grams, specialised science-specific lex-
ical features, dependency relations, sentence
splitting and negation features. Our results
show that 3-grams and dependencies perform
best in this task; they outperform the sentence
splitting, science lexicon and negation based
features.
