Thanks to the profusion of freely avail-
able tools, it recently became fairly
easy to built a statistical machine trans-
lation (SMT) engine given a bitext. The
expectations we can have on the quality
of such a system may however greatly
vary from one pair of languages to an-
other. We report on our experiments
in building phrase-based translation en-
gines for the four pairs of languages we
had to consider for the SMT shared-
task.
