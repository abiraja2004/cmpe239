This paper describes our vision for a future
time when end users of mixed-initiative spoken
dialogue systems will be able to dynamically
configure the system to suit their personalized
goals. We argue that spoken dialogue systems
will only become a common utility in society
once they can be reconfigured, essentially in-
stantaneously, to support a new working vocab-
ulary within a new domain or subdomain. For
example, if a user is interested in restaurants in
Seattle, the system would go off-line to gather
information from resources such as the Web,
and would infer from that knowledge an ap-
propriate working vocabulary, language mod-
els, and dialogue control mechanism for a sub-
sequent spoken conversation on this topic. In
addition to painting this vision, the paper also
discusses our recent research efforts directed
towards the technology development necessary
to realize this larger goal.
