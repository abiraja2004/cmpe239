In this paper, we introduce a large-scale test collec-
tion for multiple document summarization, the Text
Summarization Challenge 3 (TSC3) corpus. We
detail the corpus construction and evaluation mea-
sures. The significant feature of the corpus is that it
annotates not only the important sentences in a doc-
ument set, but also those among them that have the
same content. Moreover, we define new evaluation
metrics taking redundancy into account and discuss
the effectiveness of redundancy minimization.
