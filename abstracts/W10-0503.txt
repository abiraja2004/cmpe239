Social Network Service (SNS) and personal
blogs have become the most popular platform
for online communication and sharing infor-
mation. However because most modern com-
puter keyboards are Latin-based, Asian lan-
guage speakers (such as Chinese) has to rely
on a input system which accepts Romanisation
of the characters and convert them into charac-
ters or words in that language. In Chinese this
form of Romanisation (usually called Pinyin)
is highly ambiguous, word misuses often oc-
cur because the user choose a wrong candi-
date or deliverately substitute the word with
another character string that has the identical
Romanisation to convey certain semantics, or
to achieve a sarcasm effect. In this paper we
aim to develop a system that can automati-
cally identify such word misuse, and suggest
the correct word to be used.
