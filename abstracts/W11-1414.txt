In this paper we present a methodology for
creating concept map exercises for students.
Concept mapping is a common pedagogical
exercise in which students generate a graph-
ical model of some domain. Our method auto-
matically extracts knowledge representations
from a textbook and uses them to generate
concept maps. The purpose of the study is to
generate and evaluate these concept maps ac-
cording to their accuracy, completeness, and
pedagogy.
