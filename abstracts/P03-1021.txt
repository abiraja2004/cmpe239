Often, the training procedure for statisti-
cal machine translation models is based on
maximum likelihood or related criteria. A
general problem of this approach is that
there is only a loose relation to the final
translation quality on unseen text. In this
paper, we analyze various training criteria
which directly optimize translation qual-
ity. These training criteria make use of re-
cently proposed automatic evaluation met-
rics. We describe a new algorithm for effi-
cient training an unsmoothed error count.
We show that significantly better results
can often be obtained if the final evalua-
tion criterion is taken directly into account
as part of the training procedure.
