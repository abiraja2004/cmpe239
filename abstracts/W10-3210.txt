 
We present a strategy for revealing 
event schema in Chinese based on the 
manual annotation of texts. The overall 
event information is divided into three 
levels and events are chosen as the ele-
mentary units in annotation. Event-level 
annotation content and the obtaining of 
events patterns are explored in detail. 
The discourse-level annotation, annota-
tion of relations between events and an-
notation of the functional attributes pro-
vide a simple way to represent event 
schema.
