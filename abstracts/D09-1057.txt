In this paper, we investigate how an ac-
curate question classifier contributes to
a question answering system. We first
present a Maximum Entropy (ME) based
question classifier which makes use of
head word features and their WordNet hy-
pernyms. We show that our question clas-
sifier can achieve the state of the art per-
formance in the standard UIUC question
dataset. We then investigate quantitatively
the contribution of this question classifier
to a feature driven question answering sys-
tem. With our accurate question classifier
and some standard question answer fea-
tures, our question answering system per-
forms close to the state of the art using
TREC corpus.
