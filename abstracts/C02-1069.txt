This paper investigates methods to automatically
infer structural information from large XML doc-
uments. Using XML as a reference format, we ap-
proach the schema generation problem by applica-
tion of inductive inference theory. In doing so, we re-
view and extend results relating to the search spaces
of grammatical inferences for large data set. We
evaluate the result of an inference process using the
concept of Minimum Message Length. Comprehen-
sive experimentation reveals our new hybrid method
to be the most effective for large documents. Finally
tractability issues, including scalability analysis, are
discussed.
