When an incremental parser gets the next word,
its expectations about upcoming grammatical struc-
tures can change. When a word greatly constrains
these grammatical expectations, uncertainty is re-
duced. This elimination of possibilities constitutes
information processing work. Formalizing this no-
tion of information processing work yields a com-
plexity metric that predicts human repetition ac-
curacy scores across a systematic class of linguis-
tic phenomena, the Accessibility Hierarchy of rela-
tivizable grammatical relations.
