We describe an ongoing work in informa-
tion extraction which is seen as a text nor-
malization task. The normalized represen-
tation can be used to detect paraphrases
in texts. Normalization and paraphrase
detection tasks are built on top of a ro-
bust analyzer for English and are exclu-
sively achieved using symbolic methods.
Both grammar development rules and in-
formation extraction rules are expressed
within the same formalism and are devel-
oped in an integrated way. The experiment
we describe in the paper is evaluated and
presents encouraging results.
