We present a method for improving 
dependency structure analysis of Chi-
nese. Our bottom-up deterministic ana-
lyzer adopt Nivre?s algorithm (Nivre 
and Scholz, 2004). Support Vector Ma-
chines (SVMs) are utilized to deter-
mine the word dependency relations. 
We find that there are two problems in 
our analyzer and propose two methods 
to solve them. One problem is that 
some operations cannot be solved only 
using local feature. We utilize the 
global features to solve this. The other 
problem is that this bottom-up analyzer 
doesn?t use top-down information. We 
supply the top-down information by 
constructing SVMs based root node 
finder to solve this problem. Experi-
mental evaluation on the Penn Chinese 
Treebank Corpus shows that the pro-
posed extensions improve the parsing 
accuracy significantly.
