We describe our hybrid machine trans-
lation system which has been developed
for and used in the WMT10 shared task.
We compute translations from a rule-
based MT system and combine the re-
sulting translation ?templates? with par-
tial phrases from a state-of-the-art phrase-
based, statistical MT engine. Phrase sub-
stitution is guided by several decision
factors, a continuation of previous work
within our group. For the shared task,
we have computed translations for six lan-
guage pairs including English, German,
French and Spanish. Our experiments
have shown that our shallow substitu-
tion approach can effectively improve the
translation result from the RBMT system;
however it has also become clear that a
deeper integration is needed to further im-
prove translation quality.
