This paper describes a method for extract-
ing a large set of hyponymy relations from
Wikipedia. The Wikipedia is much more con-
sistently structured than generic HTML doc-
uments, and we can extract a large number of
hyponymy relations with simple methods. In
this work, we managed to extract more than
1.4 ? 10
6 hyponymy relations with 75.3%
precision from the Japanese version of the
Wikipedia. To the best of our knowledge, this
is the largest machine-readable thesaurus for
Japanese. The main contribution of this paper
is a method for hyponymy acquisition from
hierarchical layouts in Wikipedia. By us-
ing a machine learning technique and pattern
matching, we were able to extract more than
6.3 ? 10
5 relations from hierarchical layouts
in the Japanese Wikipedia, and their precision
was 76.4%. The remaining hyponymy rela-
tions were acquired by existing methods for
extracting relations from definition sentences
and category pages. This means that extrac-
tion from the hierarchical layouts almost dou-
bled the number of relations extracted.
