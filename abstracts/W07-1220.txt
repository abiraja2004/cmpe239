This paper is concerned with the standard-
isation of evaluation metrics for lexical ac-
quisition over precision grammars, which
are attuned to actual parser performance.
Specifically, we investigate the impact that
lexicons at varying levels of lexical item
precision and recall have on the perfor-
mance of pre-existing broad-coverage pre-
cision grammars in parsing, i.e., on their
coverage and accuracy. The grammars used
for the experiments reported here are the
LinGO English Resource Grammar (ERG;
Flickinger (2000)) and JACY (Siegel and
Bender, 2002), precision grammars of En-
glish and Japanese, respectively. Our re-
sults show convincingly that traditional F-
score-based evaluation of lexical acquisition
does not correlate with actual parsing per-
formance. What we argue for, therefore, is a
recall-heavy interpretation of F-score in de-
signing and optimising automated lexical ac-
quisition algorithms.
