The spoken term detection (STD) task aims
to return relevant segments from a spoken
archive that contain the query terms. This pa-
per focuses on the decision stage of an STD
system. We propose a term specific threshold-
ing (TST) method that uses per query poste-
rior score distributions. The STD system de-
scribed in this paper indexes word-level lat-
tices produced by an LVCSR system using
Weighted Finite State Transducers (WFSTs).
The target application is a sign dictionary
where precision is more important than recall.
Experiments compare the performance of dif-
ferent thresholding techniques. The proposed
approach increases the maximum precision at-
tainable by the system.
