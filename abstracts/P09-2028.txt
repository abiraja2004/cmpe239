We demonstrate that the bidirectionality
of deep grammars, allowing them to gen-
erate as well as parse sentences, can be
used to automatically and effectively iden-
tify errors in the grammars. The system is
tested on two implemented HPSG gram-
mars: Jacy for Japanese, and the ERG for
English. Using this system, we were able
to increase generation coverage in Jacy by
18% (45% to 63%) with only four weeks
of grammar development.
