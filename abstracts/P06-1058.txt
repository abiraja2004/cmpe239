 
This paper presents a new approach 
based on Equivalent Pseudowords (EPs) 
to tackle Word Sense Disambiguation 
(WSD) in Chinese language. EPs are par-
ticular artificial ambiguous words, which 
can be used to realize unsupervised WSD. 
A Bayesian classifier is implemented to 
test the efficacy of the EP solution on 
Senseval-3 Chinese test set. The per-
formance is better than state-of-the-art 
results with an average F-measure of 0.80. 
The experiment verifies the value of EP 
for unsupervised WSD.
