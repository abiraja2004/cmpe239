 
This paper describes the HIT system and its 
participation in SemEval-2007 English 
Lexical Substitution Task. Two main steps 
are included in our method: candidate sub-
stitute extraction and candidate scoring. In 
the first step, candidate substitutes for each 
target word in a given sentence are ex-
tracted from WordNet. In the second step, 
the extracted candidates are scored and 
ranked using a web-based scoring method. 
The substitute ranked first is selected as the 
best substitute. For the multiword subtask, 
a simple WordNet-based approach is em-
ployed.
