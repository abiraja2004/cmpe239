 
In sequence labeling tasks, applying dif-
ferent machine learning models and fea-
ture sets usually leads to different results. 
In this paper, we exploit two ensemble 
methods in order to integrate multiple 
results generated under different condi-
tions. One method is based on majority 
vote, while the other is a memory-based 
approach that integrates maximum en-
tropy and conditional random field clas-
sifiers. Our results indicate that the 
memory-based method can outperform 
the individual classifiers, but the major-
ity vote method cannot.
