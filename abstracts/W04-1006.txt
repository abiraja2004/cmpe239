In this paper we describe our method for the sum-
marization of legal documents helping a legal ex-
pert determine the key ideas of a judgment. Our
approach is based on the exploration of the docu-
ment?s architecture and its thematic structures in or-
der to build a table style summary for improving co-
herency and readability of the text. We present the
components of a system, called LetSum, built with
this approach, its implementation and some prelim-
inary evaluation results.
