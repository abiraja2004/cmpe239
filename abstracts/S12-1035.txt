The Joint Conference on Lexical and Compu-
tational Semantics (*SEM) each year hosts a
shared task on semantic related topics. In its
first edition held in 2012, the shared task was
dedicated to resolving the scope and focus of
negation. This paper presents the specifica-
tions, datasets and evaluation criteria of the
task. An overview of participating systems is
provided and their results are summarized.
