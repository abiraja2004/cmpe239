There is a prevailing assumption in the litera-
ture on referring expression generation that re-
lations are used in descriptions only ?as a last
resort?, typically on the basis that including
the second entity in the relation introduces an
additional cognitive load for either speaker or
hearer. In this paper, we describe an experiemt
that attempts to test this assumption; we de-
termine that, even in simple scenes where the
use of relations is not strictly required in order
to identify an entity, relations are in fact often
used. We draw some conclusions as to what
this means for the development of algorithms
for the generation of referring expressions.
