In this paper we focus on how to improve
pronoun resolution using the statistics-
based semantic compatibility information.
We investigate two unexplored issues that
influence the effectiveness of such in-
formation: statistics source and learning
framework. Specifically, we for the first
time propose to utilize the web and the
twin-candidate model, in addition to the
previous combination of the corpus and
the single-candidate model, to compute
and apply the semantic information. Our
study shows that the semantic compatibil-
ity obtained from the web can be effec-
tively incorporated in the twin-candidate
learning model and significantly improve
the resolution of neutral pronouns.
