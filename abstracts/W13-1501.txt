 
This paper discusses user study outcomes with 
teachers who used Language MuseSM a web-
based teacher professional development (TPD) 
application designed to enhance teachers? lin-
guistic awareness, and support teachers in the 
development of language-based instructional 
scaffolding (support) for their English language 
learners (ELL). System development was 
grounded in literature that supports the notion 
that instruction incorporating language support 
for ELLs can improve their accessibility to 
content-area classroom texts ?in terms of ac-
cess to content, and improvement of language 
skills. Measurement outcomes of user piloting 
with teachers in a TPD setting indicated that 
application use increased teachers' linguistic 
knowledge and awareness, and their ability to 
develop appropriate language-based instruction 
for ELLs. Instruction developed during the pi-
lot was informed by the application?s linguistic 
analysis feedback, provided by natural lan-
guage processing capabilities in Language 
Muse.
