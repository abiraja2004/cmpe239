Much has been discussed about the chal-
lenges posed by Multiword Expressions
(MWEs) given their idiosyncratic, flexi-
ble and heterogeneous nature. Nonethe-
less, children successfully learn to use them
and eventually acquire a number of Mul-
tiword Expressions comparable to that of
simplex words. In this paper we report
a wide-coverage investigation of a partic-
ular type of MWE: verb-particle construc-
tions (VPCs) in English and their usage
in child-produced and child-directed sen-
tences. Given their potentially higher com-
plexity in relation to simplex verbs, we
examine whether they appear less promi-
nently in child-produced than in child-
directed speech, and whether the VPCs
that children produce are more conserva-
tive than adults, displaying proportionally
reduced lexical repertoire of VPCs or of
verbs in these combinations. The results
obtained indicate that regardless of any ad-
ditional complexity VPCs feature widely in
children data following closely adult usage.
Studies like these can inform the develop-
ment of computational models for language
acquisition.
