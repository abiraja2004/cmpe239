Active learning is well-suited to many prob-
lems in natural language processing, where
unlabeled data may be abundant but annota-
tion is slow and expensive. This paper aims
to shed light on the best active learning ap-
proaches for sequence labeling tasks such as
information extraction and document segmen-
tation. We survey previously used query selec-
tion strategies for sequence models, and pro-
pose several novel algorithms to address their
shortcomings. We also conduct a large-scale
empirical comparison using multiple corpora,
which demonstrates that our proposed meth-
ods advance the state of the art.
