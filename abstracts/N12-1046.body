It has long been observed that monolingual text
exhibits a tendency toward ?one sense per dis-
course,? and it has been argued that a related
?one translation per discourse? constraint is op-
erative in bilingual contexts as well. In this pa-
per, we introduce a novel method using forced
decoding to confirm the validity of this con-
straint, and we demonstrate that it can be ex-
ploited in order to improve machine translation
quality. Three ways of incorporating such a
preference into a hierarchical phrase-based MT
model are proposed, and the approach where all
three are combined yields the greatest improve-
ments  for  both  Arabic-English  and  Chinese-
English translation experiments.
