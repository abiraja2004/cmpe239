 
A readability formula is obtained that can be used by com- 
puter programs for style checking of Japanese texts and need not 
syntactic or semantic information. The formula is derived as a 
linear combination of tile surface characteristics of the text that are 
related to its readability: (1) the average number of characters per 
sentence, (2) for each type of characters (Roman alphabets, kanzis, 
hiraganas, katakanas), relative frequencies of rims (maximal 
swings) that ,:onsists only of that type of characters, (3) the average 
number of characters per each type of runs, and (4) tooten 
(comma) to kuten (period) ratio. 
To find the proper weighting, principal component analysis 
(PCA) was appliedto these characteristics taken from 77 sample 
texts. 
We have found a component which is related to the readabil- 
ity. Its scores match to the empirical knowledges of reading ease. 
We have also obtained experimental confirmation that the com- 
ponent is an adequate measure for stylistic ease of reading, by the 
cloze procedure and by the examination on the average lime taken 
to fill out one blank of the cloze texts.
