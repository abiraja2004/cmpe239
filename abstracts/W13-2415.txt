This paper describes a plug-in component
to extend the PULS information extraction
framework to analyze Russian-language
text. PULS is a comprehensive framework
for information extraction (IE) that is used
for analysis of news in several scenarios
from English-language text and is primar-
ily monolingual. Although monolingual-
ity is recognized as a serious limitation,
building an IE system for a new language
from the bottom up is very labor-intensive.
Thus, the objective of the present work is
to explore whether the base framework can
be extended to cover additional languages
with limited effort, and to leverage the pre-
existing PULS modules as far as possible,
in order to accelerate the development pro-
cess. The component for Russian analysis
is described and its performance is evalu-
ated on two news-analysis scenarios: epi-
demic surveillance and cross-border secu-
rity. The approach described in the paper
can be generalized to a range of heavily-
inflected languages.
