NegEx, a rule-based algorithm that detects
negations in English clinical text, was trans-
lated into Swedish and evaluated on clini-
cal text written in Swedish. The NegEx al-
gorithm detects negations through the use of
trigger phrases, which indicate that a preced-
ing or following concept is negated. A list
of English trigger phrases was translated into
Swedish, taking grammatical differences be-
tween the two languages into account. This
translation was evaluated on a set of 436 man-
ually classified sentences from Swedish health
records. The results showed a precision of
70% and a recall of 81% for sentences con-
taining the trigger phrases and a negative pre-
dictive value of 96% for sentences not con-
taining any trigger phrases. The precision
was significantly lower for the Swedish adap-
tation than published results on the English
version, but since many negated propositions
were identified through a limited set of trigger
phrases, it could nevertheless be concluded
that the same trigger phrase approach is possi-
ble in a Swedish context, even though it needs
to be further developed.
