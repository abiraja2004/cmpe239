 
This paper proposes an automatic method 
for disambiguating an acronym with mul-
tiple definitions, considering the context 
surrounding the acronym. First, the 
method obtains the Web pages that in-
clude both the acronym and its definitions. 
Second, the method feeds them to the ma-
chine learner. Cross-validation tests re-
sults indicate that the current accuracy of 
obtaining the appropriate definition for an 
acronym is around 92% for two ambigu-
ous definitions and around 86% for five 
ambiguous definitions.
