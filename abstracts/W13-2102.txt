The increasing amount of machine-
readable data available in the context
of the Semantic Web creates a need
for methods that transform such data
into human-comprehensible text. In
this paper we develop and evaluate a
Natural Language Generation (NLG)
system that converts RDF data into
natural language text based on an on-
tology and an associated ontology lex-
icon. While it follows a classical NLG
pipeline, it diverges from most cur-
rent NLG systems in that it exploits
an ontology lexicon in order to capture
context-specific lexicalisations of ontol-
ogy concepts, and combines the use of
such a lexicon with the choice of lexical
items and syntactic structures based on
statistical information extracted from a
domain-specific corpus. We apply the
developed approach to the cooking do-
main, providing both an ontology and
an ontology lexicon in lemon format.
Finally, we evaluate fluency and ade-
quacy of the generated recipes with re-
spect to two target audiences: cooking
novices and advanced cooks.
