This paper describes our system in the shared
task of CoNLL-2013. We illustrate that gram-
matical error detection and correction can be
transformed into a multiclass classification
task and implemented as a single-model sys-
tem regardless of various error types with the
aid of maximum entropy modeling. Our sys-
tem achieves the F1 score of 17.13% on the
standard test set.
