We investigate methods to improve the re-
call in coreference resolution by also trying
to resolve those definite descriptions where
no earlier mention of the referent shares the
same lexical head (coreferent bridging). The
problem, which is notably harder than iden-
tifying coreference relations among men-
tions which have the same lexical head, has
been tackled with several rather different ap-
proaches, and we attempt to provide a mean-
ingful classification along with a quantita-
tive comparison. Based on the different mer-
its of the methods, we discuss possibilities to
improve them and show how they can be ef-
fectively combined.
