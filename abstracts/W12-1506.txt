Until recently, deep stochastic surface realiza-
tion has been hindered by the lack of seman-
tically annotated corpora. This is about to
change. Such corpora are increasingly avail-
able, e.g., in the context of CoNLL shared
tasks. However, recent experiments with
CoNLL 2009 corpora show that these popu-
lar resources, which serve well for other ap-
plications, may not do so for generation. The
attempts to adapt them for generation resulted
so far in a better performance of the realizers,
but not yet in a genuinely semantic generation-
oriented annotation schema. Our goal is to
initiate a debate on how a generation suit-
able annotation schema should be defined. We
define some general principles of a semantic
generation-oriented annotation and propose an
annotation schema that is based on these prin-
ciples. Experiments shows that making the
semantic corpora comply with the suggested
principles does not need to have a negative im-
pact on the quality of the stochastic generators
trained on them.
