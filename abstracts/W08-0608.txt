Chemical named entities represent an impor-
tant facet of biomedical text. We have de-
veloped a system to use character-based n-
grams, Maximum Entropy Markov Models
and rescoring to recognise chemical names
and other such entities, and to make confi-
dence estimates for the extracted entities. An
adjustable threshold allows the system to be
tuned to high precision or high recall. At a
threshold set for balanced precision and recall,
we were able to extract named entities at an
F score of 80.7% from chemistry papers and
83.2% from PubMed abstracts. Furthermore,
we were able to achieve 57.6% and 60.3% re-
call at 95% precision, and 58.9% and 49.1%
precision at 90% recall. These results show
that chemical named entities can be extracted
with good performance, and that the proper-
ties of the extraction can be tuned to suit the
demands of the task.
