Most NLP systems use tokenization as part
of preprocessing. Generally, tokenizers are
based on simple heuristics and do not recog-
nize multi-word units (MWUs) like hot dog
or black hole unless a precompiled list of
MWUs is available. In this paper, we propose
a new cascaded model for detecting MWUs
of arbitrary length for tokenization, focusing
on noun phrases in the physics domain. We
adopt a classification approach because ? un-
like other work on MWUs ? tokenization re-
quires a completely automatic approach. We
achieve an accuracy of 68% for recognizing
non-compositional MWUs and show that our
MWU recognizer improves retrieval perfor-
mance when used as part of an information re-
trieval system.
