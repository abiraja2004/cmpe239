In this paper, we extend the HMM word-
to-phrase alignment model with syntac-
tic dependency constraints. The syn-
tactic dependencies between multiple
words in one language are introduced
into the model in a bid to produce co-
herent alignments. Our experimental re-
sults on a variety of Chinese?English
data show that our syntactically con-
strained model can lead to as much as
a 3.24% relative improvement in BLEU
score over current HMM word-to-phrase
alignment models on a Phrase-Based
Statistical Machine Translation system
when the training data is small, and
a comparable performance compared to
IBM model 4 on a Hiero-style system
with larger training data. An intrin-
sic alignment quality evaluation shows
that our alignment model with depen-
dency constraints leads to improvements
in both precision (by 1.74% relative) and
recall (by 1.75% relative) over the model
without dependency information.
