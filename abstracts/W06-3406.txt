In email conversational analysis, it is of-
ten useful to trace the the intents behind
each message exchange. In this paper,
we consider classification of email mes-
sages as to whether or not they contain
certain intents or email-acts, such as ?pro-
pose a meeting? or ?commit to a task?.
We demonstrate that exploiting the con-
textual information in the messages can
noticeably improve email-act classifica-
tion. More specifically, we describe a
combination of n-gram sequence features
with careful message preprocessing that is
highly effective for this task. Compared
to a previous study (Cohen et al, 2004),
this representation reduces the classifica-
tion error rates by 26.4% on average. Fi-
nally, we introduce Ciranda: a new open
source toolkit for email speech act predic-
tion.
