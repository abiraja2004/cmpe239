Textual entailment is an asymmetric rela-
tion between two text fragments that de-
scribes whether one fragment can be in-
ferred from the other. It thus cannot cap-
ture the notion that the target fragment
is ?almost entailed? by the given text.
The recently suggested idea of partial tex-
tual entailment may remedy this problem.
We investigate partial entailment under the
faceted entailment model and the possibil-
ity of adapting existing textual entailment
methods to this setting. Indeed, our results
show that these methods are useful for rec-
ognizing partial entailment. We also pro-
vide a preliminary assessment of how par-
tial entailment may be used for recogniz-
ing (complete) textual entailment.
