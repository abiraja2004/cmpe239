We propose WIDL-expressions as a flex-
ible formalism that facilitates the integra-
tion of a generic sentence realization sys-
tem within end-to-end language process-
ing applications. WIDL-expressions rep-
resent compactly probability distributions
over finite sets of candidate realizations,
and have optimal algorithms for realiza-
tion via interpolation with language model
probability distributions. We show the ef-
fectiveness of a WIDL-based NLG system
in two sentence realization tasks: auto-
matic translation and headline generation.
