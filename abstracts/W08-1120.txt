 
Natural language generation technology is 
mature enough for implementing an NLG sys-
tem in a commercial environment, but the cir-
cumstances differ significantly from building 
a research system.  This paper describes the 
challenges and rewards of building a commer-
cial NLG component for an electronic medical 
records system.  While the resulting NLG sys-
tem has been successfully completed, the path 
to that success could have been somewhat 
smoother knowing the issues in advance.
