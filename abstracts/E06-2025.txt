We analyze estimation methods for Data-
Oriented Parsing, as well as the theoret-
ical criteria used to evaluate them. We
show that all current estimation methods
are inconsistent in the ?weight-distribution
test?, and argue that these results force us
to rethink both the methods proposed and
the criteria used.
