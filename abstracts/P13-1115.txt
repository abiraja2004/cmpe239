This paper presents an unsupervised ran-
dom walk approach to alleviate data spar-
sity for selectional preferences. Based on
the measure of preferences between predi-
cates and arguments, the model aggregates
all the transitions from a given predicate to
its nearby predicates, and propagates their
argument preferences as the given predi-
cate?s smoothed preferences. Experimen-
tal results show that this approach out-
performs several state-of-the-art method-
s on the pseudo-disambiguation task, and
it better correlates with human plausibility
judgements.
