Given the increasing interest and devel-
opment of computational and quantitative
methods in historical linguistics, it is im-
portant that scholars have a basis for doc-
umenting, testing, evaluating, and shar-
ing complex workflows. We present a
novel open-source toolkit for quantitative
tasks in historical linguistics that offers
these features. This toolkit also serves
as an interface between existing software
packages and frequently used data for-
mats, and it provides implementations of
new and existing algorithms within a ho-
mogeneous framework. We illustrate the
toolkit?s functionality with an exemplary
workflow that starts with raw language
data and ends with automatically calcu-
lated phonetic alignments, cognates and
borrowings. We then illustrate evaluation
metrics on gold standard datasets that are
provided with the toolkit.
