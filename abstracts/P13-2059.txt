This paper explores the use of Proposi-
tional Dynamic Logic (PDL) as a suit-
able formal framework for describing
Sign Language (SL), the language of
deaf people, in the context of natu-
ral language processing. SLs are vi-
sual, complete, standalone languages
which are just as expressive as oral lan-
guages. Signs in SL usually correspond
to sequences of highly specific body
postures interleaved with movements,
which make reference to real world ob-
jects, characters or situations. Here we
propose a formal representation of SL
signs, that will help us with the analysis
of automatically-collected hand track-
ing data from French Sign Language
(FSL) video corpora. We further show
how such a representation could help us
with the design of computer aided SL
verification tools, which in turn would
bring us closer to the development of an
automatic recognition system for these
languages.
