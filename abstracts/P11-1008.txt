We describe an exact decoding algorithm for
syntax-based statistical translation. The ap-
proach uses Lagrangian relaxation to decom-
pose the decoding problem into tractable sub-
problems, thereby avoiding exhaustive dy-
namic programming. The method recovers ex-
act solutions, with certificates of optimality,
on over 97% of test examples; it has compa-
rable speed to state-of-the-art decoders.
