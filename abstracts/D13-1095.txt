In Japanese, zero references often occur and
many of them are categorized into zero ex-
ophora, in which a referent is not mentioned in
the document. However, previous studies have
focused on only zero endophora, in which
a referent explicitly appears. We present a
zero reference resolution model considering
zero exophora and author/reader of a docu-
ment. To deal with zero exophora, our model
adds pseudo entities corresponding to zero
exophora to candidate referents of zero pro-
nouns. In addition, we automatically detect
mentions that refer to the author and reader of
a document by using lexico-syntactic patterns.
We represent their particular behavior in a dis-
course as a feature vector of a machine learn-
ing model. The experimental results demon-
strate the effectiveness of our model for not
only zero exophora but also zero endophora.
