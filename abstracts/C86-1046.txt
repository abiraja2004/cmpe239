language processing system PLAIN from the viewpoint 
of unification grammars. The principles of Dependency 
Unification Grammar (DUG) are discussed. The computer 
language DRL (Dependency Representation Language) is 
introduced J.n which DUGs can be formulated. A unifi- 
cation-based parsing procedure is part of the formal- 
ism. PLAIN is implemented at the universities of Hei- 
delberg, Bonn, Flensburg, Kiel, Zurich and Cambridge 
U.K.
