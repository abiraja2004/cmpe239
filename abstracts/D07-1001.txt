Sentence compression holds promise for
many applications ranging from summarisa-
tion to subtitle generation and subtitle gen-
eration. The task is typically performed on
isolated sentences without taking the sur-
rounding context into account, even though
most applications would operate over entire
documents. In this paper we present a dis-
course informed model which is capable of
producing document compressions that are
coherent and informative. Our model is in-
spired by theories of local coherence and
formulated within the framework of Integer
Linear Programming. Experimental results
show significant improvements over a state-
of-the-art discourse agnostic approach.
