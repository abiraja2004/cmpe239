 
This paper presents a comprehensive NLP sys-
tem by Melingo that has been recently developed 
for Arabic, based on MorfixTM ? an operational 
formerly developed highly successful comprehen-
sive Hebrew NLP system. 
The system discussed includes modules for 
morphological analysis, context sensitive lemmati-
zation, vocalization, text-to-phoneme conversion, 
and syntactic-analysis-based prosody (intonation) 
model. It is employed in applications such as full 
text search, information retrieval, text categoriza-
tion, textual data mining, online contextual dic-
tionaries, filtering, and text-to-speech applications 
in the fields of telephony and accessibility and 
could serve as a handy accessory for non-fluent 
Arabic or Hebrew speakers. 
Modern Hebrew and Modern Standard Arabic 
share some unique Semitic linguistic characteris-
tics. Yet up to now, the two languages have been 
handled separately in Natural Language Processing 
circles, both on the academic and on the applica-
tive levels. This paper reviews the major similari-
ties and the minor dissimilarities between Modern 
Hebrew and Modern Standard Arabic from the 
NLP standpoint, and emphasizes the benefit of de-
veloping and maintaining a unified system for both 
languages.
