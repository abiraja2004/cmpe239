 
This paper presents a dependency parsing scheme 
using an extended finite state approach. The parser 
augments input representation with "channels" so 
that links representing syntactic dependency rela- 
tions among words can be accommodated, and it- 
erates on the input a number of times to arrive at 
a fixed point. Intermediate configurations violating 
various constraints of projective dependency repre- 
sentations such as no crossing links, no independent 
items except sentential head, etc, are filtered via fi- 
nite state filters. We have applied the parser to de- 
pendency parsing of Turkish.
