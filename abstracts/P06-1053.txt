The psycholinguistic literature provides
evidence for syntactic priming, i.e., the
tendency to repeat structures. This pa-
per describes a method for incorporating
priming into an incremental probabilis-
tic parser. Three models are compared,
which involve priming of rules between
sentences, within sentences, and within
coordinate structures. These models sim-
ulate the reading time advantage for par-
allel structures found in human data, and
also yield a small increase in overall pars-
ing accuracy.
