Uncertainty text detection is important
to many social-media-based applications
since more and more users utilize social
media platforms (e.g., Twitter, Facebook,
etc.) as information source to produce
or derive interpretations based on them.
However, existing uncertainty cues are in-
effective in social media context because
of its specific characteristics. In this pa-
per, we propose a variant of annotation
scheme for uncertainty identification and
construct the first uncertainty corpus based
on tweets. We then conduct experiments
on the generated tweets corpus to study the
effectiveness of different types of features
for uncertainty text identification.
