 
We introduce a new approach to named 
entity classification which we term a Pri-
ority Model. We also describe the con-
struction of a semantic database called 
SemCat consisting of a large number of 
semantically categorized names relevant 
to biomedicine. We used SemCat as train-
ing data to investigate name classification 
techniques. We generated a statistical lan-
guage model and probabilistic context-
free grammars for gene and protein name 
classification, and compared the results 
with the new model.  For all three meth-
ods, we used a variable order Markov 
model to predict the nature of strings not 
represented in the training data.  The Pri-
ority Model achieves an F-measure of 
0.958-0.960, consistently higher than the 
statistical language model and probabilis-
tic context-free grammar.
