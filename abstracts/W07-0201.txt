In this paper, we discuss two graphs in
Wikipedia (i) the article graph, and (ii)
the category graph. We perform a graph-
theoretic analysis of the category graph,
and show that it is a scale-free, small
world graph like other well-known lexi-
cal semantic networks. We substantiate
our findings by transferring semantic re-
latedness algorithms defined on WordNet
to the Wikipedia category graph. To as-
sess the usefulness of the category graph
as an NLP resource, we analyze its cover-
age and the performance of the transferred
semantic relatedness algorithms.
