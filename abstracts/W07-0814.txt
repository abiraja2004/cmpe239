Stemming is an important analysis step in
a number of areas such as natural lan-
guage processing (NLP), information re-
trieval (IR), machine translation(MT) and
text classification. In this paper we present
the development of a stemmer for Amharic
that reduces words to their citation forms.
Amharic is a Semitic language with rich and
complex morphology. The application of
such a stemmer is in dictionary based cross
language IR, where there is a need in the
translation step, to look up terms in a ma-
chine readable dictionary (MRD). We apply
a rule based approach supplemented by oc-
currence statistics of words in a MRD and
in a 3.1M words news corpus. The main
purpose of the statistical supplements is to
resolve ambiguity between alternative seg-
mentations. The stemmer is evaluated on
Amharic text from two domains, news arti-
cles and a classic fiction text. It is shown to
have an accuracy of 60% for the old fash-
ioned fiction text and 75% for the news arti-
cles.
