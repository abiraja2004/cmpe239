In this paper, we present five models for sentence
realisation from a bag-of-words containing mini-
mal syntactic information. It has a large variety
of applications ranging from Machine Translation
to Dialogue systems. Our models employ simple
and efficient techniques based on n-gram Language
modeling.
We evaluated the models by comparing the syn-
thesized sentences with reference sentences using
the standard BLEU metric(Papineni et al, 2001).
We obtained higher results (BLEU score of 0.8156)
when compared to the state-of-art results. In fu-
ture, we plan to incorporate our sentence realiser in
Machine Translation and observe its effect on the
translation accuracies.
