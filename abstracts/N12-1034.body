First story detection (FSD) involves identify-
ing first stories about events from a continuous
stream of documents. A major problem in this
task is the high degree of lexical variation in
documents which makes it very difficult to de-
tect stories that talk about the same event but
expressed using different words. We suggest
using paraphrases to alleviate this problem,
making this the first work to use paraphrases
for FSD. We show a novel way of integrat-
ing paraphrases with locality sensitive hashing
(LSH) in order to obtain an efficient FSD sys-
tem that can scale to very large datasets. Our
system achieves state-of-the-art results on the
first story detection task, beating both the best
supervised and unsupervised systems. To test
our approach on large data, we construct a cor-
pus of events for Twitter, consisting of 50 mil-
lion documents, and show that paraphrasing is
also beneficial in this domain.
