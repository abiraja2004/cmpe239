In this paper we explore the potential for iden-
tifying computationally relevant typological fea-
tures from a multilingual corpus of language data
built from readily available language data col-
lected off the Web. Our work builds on previous
structural projection work, where we extend the
work of projection to building individual CFGs
for approximately 100 languages. We then use
the CFGs to discover the values of typological
parameters such as word order, the presence or
absence of definite and indefinite determiners,
etc. Our methods have the potential of being
extended to many more languages and parame-
ters, and can have significant effects on current
research focused on tool and resource develop-
ment for low-density languages and grammar in-
duction from raw corpora.
