Technological development has made
computer interaction more common
and also commercially feasible, and
the number of interactive systems has
grown rapidly. At the same time, the
systems should be able to adapt to var-
ious situations and various users, so as
to provide the most efficient and help-
ful mode of interaction. The aim of
the Interact project is to explore nat-
ural human-computer interaction and
to develop dialogue models which will
allow users to interact with the com-
puter in a natural and robust way. The
paper describes the innovative goals of
the project and presents ways that the
Interact system supports adaptivity on
different system design and interaction
management levels.
