Translation into morphologically rich lan-
guages is an important but recalcitrant prob-
lem in MT. We present a simple and effec-
tive approach that deals with the problem in
two phases. First, a discriminative model is
learned to predict inflections of target words
from rich source-side annotations. Then, this
model is used to create additional sentence-
specific word- and phrase-level translations
that are added to a standard translation model
as ?synthetic? phrases. Our approach re-
lies on morphological analysis of the target
language, but we show that an unsupervised
Bayesian model of morphology can success-
fully be used in place of a supervised analyzer.
We report significant improvements in transla-
tion quality when translating from English to
Russian, Hebrew and Swahili.
