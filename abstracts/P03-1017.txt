Traditional vector-based models use word
co-occurrence counts from large corpora
to represent lexical meaning. In this pa-
per we present a novel approach for con-
structing semantic spaces that takes syn-
tactic relations into account. We introduce
a formalisation for this class of models
and evaluate their adequacy on two mod-
elling tasks: semantic priming and auto-
matic discrimination of lexical relations.
