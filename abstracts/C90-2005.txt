 
In this paper we present abrief look at some of 
the knowledge-based processes used in gener- 
atii~g referring expressions in the natural 
language advisory system WlSBER. Although 
WISBER is fully capable of exploiting syntactic 
information to generate contextually appropriate 
references, the work described here concen- 
trates on the use of conceptual nd contingent 
knowledge about objects in the domain of 
discourse to generate natural-sounding refer- 
ences. A short description of the knowledge 
sources available is followed by examples of the 
processes that transform "deep structures" 
encodimg system intentions into verbalizable 
form. Finally, we discuss a number of pro- 
blems of specifier selection and their solution 
within a knowledge-based framework.
