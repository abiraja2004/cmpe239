Our research organization has been con-
structing a large scale database named
SHACHI by collecting detailed meta in-
formation on language resources (LRs) in
Asia and Western countries. The metadata
database contains more than 2,000 com-
piled LRs such as corpora, dictionaries,
thesauruses and lexicons, forming a large
scale metadata of LRs archive. Its meta-
data, an extended version of OLAC meta-
data set conforming to Dublin Core, have
been collected semi-automatically. This
paper explains the design and the structure
of the metadata database, as well as the re-
alization of the catalogue search tool.
