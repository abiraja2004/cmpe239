In this paper we present a novel ap-
proach to modelling distributional seman-
tics that represents meaning as distribu-
tions over relations in syntactic neighbor-
hoods. We argue that our model approxi-
mates meaning in compositional configu-
rations more effectively than standard dis-
tributional vectors or bag-of-words mod-
els. We test our hypothesis on the problem
of judging event coreferentiality, which in-
volves compositional interactions in the
predicate-argument structure of sentences,
and demonstrate that our model outper-
forms both state-of-the-art window-based
word embeddings as well as simple ap-
proaches to compositional semantics pre-
viously employed in the literature.
