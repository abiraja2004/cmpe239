Many studies in natural language process-
ing are concerned with how to generate
definite descriptions that evoke a discourse
entity already introduced in the context.
A solution to this problem has been ini-
tially proposed by Dale (1989) in terms
of distinguishing descriptions and distin-
guishable entities. In this paper, we give
a formal definition of the terms ?distin-
guishable entity? in non trivial cases and
we show that its properties lead us to the
definition of a distance between entities.
Then, we give a polynomial algorithm to
compute distinguishing descriptions.
