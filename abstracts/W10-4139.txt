 
This paper describes the Chinese Word 
Segmenter for our participation in CIPS-
SIGHAN-2010 bake-off task of Chinese 
word segmentation. We formalize the tasks 
as sequence tagging problems, and 
implemented them using conditional random 
fields (CRFs) model. The system contains two 
modules: multiple preprocessor and basic 
segmenter. The basic segmenter is designed as 
a problem of character-based tagging, and 
using named entity recognition and chunk 
recognition based on boundary to preprocess. 
We participated in the open training on 
Simplified Chinese Text and Traditional 
Chinese Text, and our system achieved one 
Rank#5 and four Rank#2 best in all four 
domain corpus.
