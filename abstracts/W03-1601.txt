Paraphrases, which stem from the va-
riety of lexical and grammatical means
of expressing meaning available in a
language, pose challenges for a sen-
tence generation system. In this
paper, we discuss the generation of
paraphrases from predicate/argument
structure using a simple, uniform gen-
eration methodology. Central to our
approach are lexico-grammatical re-
sources which pair elementary seman-
tic structures with their syntactic re-
alization and a simple but powerful
mechanism for combining resources.
