  
Knowledge of which words are able to fill p~rtic- 
ular argum.ent slots of a predicate can be used 
tbr structural disambiguation. This paper de- 
scribes a proposal :for acquiring such knowledge, 
and in line with much of the recent work in this 
area, a probabilistic approach is taken. We de- 
velop a novel way of using a semantic hierar- 
chy to estimate the probabilities, and demon- 
strate the general approach using a preposi- 
tional phrase atta.chment experiment.
