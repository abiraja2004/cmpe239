This paper ties up some loose ends in finite-state Optimality
Theory. First, it discusses how to perform comprehension un-
der Optimality Theory grammars consisting of finite-state con-
straints. Comprehension has not been much studied in OT; we
show that unlike production, it does not always yield a regular
set, making finite-state methods inapplicable. However, after
giving a suitably flexible presentation of OT, we show care-
fully how to treat comprehension under recent variants of OT
in which grammars can be compiled into finite-state transduc-
ers. We then unify these variants, showing that compilation is
possible if all components of the grammar are regular relations,
including the harmony ordering on scored candidates. A side
benefit of our construction is a far simpler implementation of
directional OT (Eisner, 2000).
