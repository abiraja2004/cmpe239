This paper describes a self-learning soft-
ware agent who collects and learns knowl-
edge from the web and also exchanges her
knowledge via dialogues with the users.
The agent is built on top of information
extraction, web mining, question answer-
ing and dialogue system technologies, and
users can freely formulate their questions
within the gossip domain and obtain the
answers in multiple ways: textual re-
sponse, graph-based visualization of the
related concepts and speech output.
