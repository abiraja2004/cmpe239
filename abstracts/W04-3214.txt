We present a data and error analysis for semantic role
labelling. In a first experiment, we build a generic statis-
tical model for semantic role assignment in the FrameNet
paradigm and show that there is a high variance in perfor-
mance across frames. The main hypothesis of our paper
is that this variance is to a large extent a result of differ-
ences in the underlying argument structure of the pred-
icates in different frames. In a second experiment, we
show that frame uniformity, which measures argument
structure variation, correlates well with the performance
figures, effectively explaining the variance.
