We propose an unsupervised Expectation
Maximization approach to pronoun reso-
lution. The system learns from a fixed
list of potential antecedents for each pro-
noun. We show that unsupervised learn-
ing is possible in this context, as the per-
formance of our system is comparable to
supervised methods. Our results indicate
that a probabilistic gender/number model,
determined automatically from unlabeled
text, is a powerful feature for this task.
