Among the many proposals to promote al-
ternatives to costly to create gold stan-
dards, just recently the idea of a fully au-
tomatically, and thus cheaply, to set up sil-
ver standard has been launched. However,
the current construction policy for such a
silver standard requires crucial parameters
(such as similarity thresholds and agree-
ment cut-offs) to be set a priori, based on
extensive testing though, at corpus com-
pile time. Accordingly, such a corpus is
static, once it is released. We here propose
an alternative policy where silver stan-
dards can be dynamically optimized and
customized on demand (given a specific
goal function) using a gold standard as an
oracle.
