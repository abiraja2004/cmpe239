We investigated the effect of word sur-
prisal on the EEG signal during sen-
tence reading. On each word of 205 ex-
perimental sentences, surprisal was esti-
mated by three types of language model:
Markov models, probabilistic phrase-
structure grammars, and recurrent neu-
ral networks. Four event-related poten-
tial components were extracted from the
EEG of 24 readers of the same sentences.
Surprisal estimates under each model type
formed a significant predictor of the am-
plitude of the N400 component only, with
more surprising words resulting in more
negative N400s. This effect was mostly
due to content words. These findings
provide support for surprisal as a gener-
ally applicable measure of processing dif-
ficulty during language comprehension.
