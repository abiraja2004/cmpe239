 
This paper describes the use of statistical 
analyses of untagged corpora to detect 
similarities and differences in the mean- 
ing of words in text. This work is mo- 
tivated by psychological as well as by 
computational issues. The limitations 
of the method of cluster analysis in as- 
sessing the success of such analyses are 
discussed, and ongoing research using an 
alternative unsupervised neural network 
approach is described.
