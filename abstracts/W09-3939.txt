In this paper we compare two Ma-
chine Learning approaches to the task
of pronominal anaphora resolution: a
conventional classification system based
on C5.0 decision trees, and a novel
perceptron-based ranker. We use coref-
erence links annotated in the Prague De-
pendency Treebank 2.0 for training and
evaluation purposes. The perceptron sys-
tem achieves f-score 79.43% on recogniz-
ing coreference of personal and possessive
pronouns, which clearly outperforms the
classifier and which is the best result re-
ported on this data set so far.
