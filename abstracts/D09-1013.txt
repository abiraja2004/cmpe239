Because of the importance of protein-
protein interaction (PPI) extraction from
text, many corpora have been proposed
with slightly differing definitions of pro-
teins and PPI. Since no single corpus is
large enough to saturate a machine learn-
ing system, it is necessary to learn from
multiple different corpora. In this paper,
we propose a solution to this challenge.
We designed a rich feature vector, and we
applied a support vector machine modi-
fied for corpus weighting (SVM-CW) to
complete the task of multiple corpora PPI
extraction. The rich feature vector, made
from multiple useful kernels, is used to
express the important information for PPI
extraction, and the system with our fea-
ture vector was shown to be both faster
and more accurate than the original kernel-
based system, even when using just a sin-
gle corpus. SVM-CW learns from one cor-
pus, while using other corpora for support.
SVM-CW is simple, but it is more effec-
tive than other methods that have been suc-
cessfully applied to other NLP tasks ear-
lier. With the feature vector and SVM-
CW, our system achieved the best perfor-
mance among all state-of-the-art PPI ex-
traction systems reported so far.
