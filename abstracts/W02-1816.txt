 The application-driven construction
of lexicon has been emphasized as a methodology
of Computational Lexicology recently. We focus on
the closed semantic constraint of the argument(s)
of any verb concept by the noun concepts in a
WordNet-like lexicon, which theoretically is related
to Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) at differ-
ent levels. From the viewpoint of Dynamic Lexi-
con, WSD provides a way of automatic construc-
tion for the closed semantic constraints and also
benefits from the semantic descriptions.
