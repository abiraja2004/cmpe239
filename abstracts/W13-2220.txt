We propose a pre-reordering scheme to
improve the quality of machine translation
by permuting the words of a source sen-
tence to a target-like order. This is accom-
plished as a transition-based system that
walks on the dependency parse tree of the
sentence and emits words in target-like or-
der, driven by a classifier trained on a par-
allel corpus. Our system is capable of gen-
erating arbitrary permutations up to flexi-
ble constraints determined by the choice of
the classifier algorithm and input features.
