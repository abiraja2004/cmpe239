Syntactic machine translation systems extract
rules from bilingual, word-aligned, syntacti-
cally parsed text, but current systems for pars-
ing and word alignment are at best cascaded
and at worst totally independent of one an-
other. This work presents a unified joint model
for simultaneous parsing and word alignment.
To flexibly model syntactic divergence, we de-
velop a discriminative log-linear model over
two parse trees and an ITG derivation which
is encouraged but not forced to synchronize
with the parses. Our model gives absolute
improvements of 3.3 F1 for English pars-
ing, 2.1 F1 for Chinese parsing, and 5.5 F1
for word alignment over each task?s indepen-
dent baseline, giving the best reported results
for both Chinese-English word alignment and
joint parsing on the parallel portion of the Chi-
nese treebank. We also show an improvement
of 1.2 BLEU in downstream MT evaluation
over basic HMM alignments.
