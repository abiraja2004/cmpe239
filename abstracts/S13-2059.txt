In this paper, we describe our system that par-
ticipated in SemEval-2013, Task 2.B (senti-
ment analysis in Twitter). Our approach con-
sists of adapting Naive Bayes probabilities in
order to take into account prior knowledge
(represented in the form of a sentiment lex-
icon). We propose two different methods to
efficiently incorporate prior knowledge. We
show that our approach outperforms the clas-
sical Naive Bayes method and shows compet-
itive results with SVM while having less com-
putational complexity.
