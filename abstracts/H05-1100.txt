We present two methods for incorporat-
ing detailed features in a Spanish parser,
building on a baseline model that is a lex-
icalized PCFG. The first method exploits
Spanish morphology, and achieves an F1
constituency score of 83.6%. This is an
improvement over 81.2% accuracy for the
baseline, which makes little or no use of
morphological information. The second
model uses a reranking approach to add
arbitrary global features of parse trees to
the morphological model. The reranking
model reaches 85.1% F1 accuracy on the
Spanish parsing task. The resulting model
for Spanish parsing combines an approach
that specifically targets morphological in-
formation with an approach that makes
use of general structural features.
