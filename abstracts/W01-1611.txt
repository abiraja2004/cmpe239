The paper addresses the issue of how to increase
adaptivity in response generation for a spoken
dialogue system. Realization strategies for dia-
logue responses depend on communicative con-
dence levels and interaction management goals.
We rst describe a Java/XML-based generator
which produces dierent realizations of system
responses based on agendas specied by the di-
alogue manager. We then discuss how greater
adaptivity can be achieved by using a set of dis-
tinct generator agents, each of which is special-
ized in its realization strategy (e.g. highly ellip-
tical or highly explicit). This allows a simpler
design of each generator agent, while increas-
ing the overall system adaptivity to meet the
requirements for exible cooperation in incre-
mental and immediate interactive situations.
