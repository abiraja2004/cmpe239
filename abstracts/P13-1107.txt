In some societies, internet users have to
create information morphs (e.g. ?Peace
West King? to refer to ?Bo Xilai?) to avoid
active censorship or achieve other com-
munication goals. In this paper we aim
to solve a new problem of resolving en-
tity morphs to their real targets. We ex-
ploit temporal constraints to collect cross-
source comparable corpora relevant to any
given morph query and identify target can-
didates. Then we propose various novel
similarity measurements including surface
features, meta-path based semantic fea-
tures and social correlation features and
combine them in a learning-to-rank frame-
work. Experimental results on Chinese
Sina Weibo data demonstrate that our ap-
proach is promising and significantly out-
performs baseline methods1.
