This paper reports on experiments in the cre-
ation of a bi-lingual Textual Entailment cor-
pus, using non-experts? workforce under strict
cost and time limitations ($100, 10 days). To
this aim workers have been hired for transla-
tion and validation tasks, through the Crowd-
Flower channel to Amazon Mechanical Turk.
As a result, an accurate and reliable corpus of
426 English/Spanish entailment pairs has been
produced in a more cost-effective way com-
pared to other methods for the acquisition of
translations based on crowdsourcing. Focus-
ing on two orthogonal dimensions (i.e. relia-
bility of annotations made by non experts, and
overall corpus creation costs), we summarize
the methodology we adopted, the achieved re-
sults, the main problems encountered, and the
lessons learned.
