 
High frequency can convert a word sequence 
into a multiword expression (MWE), i.e., a 
collocation. In this paper, we use collocations 
as well as syntactically-flexible, lexicalized 
phrases to analyze ?job specification docu-
ments? (a kind of corporate technical docu-
ment) for subsequent acquisition of automated 
knowledge elicitation. We propose the defini-
tion of structural and functional patterns of 
specific corporate documents by analyzing the 
contexts and sections in which the expression 
occurs. Such patterns and its automated pro-
cessing are the basis for identifying organiza-
tional domain knowledge and business 
information which is used later for the first in-
stances of requirement elicitation processes in 
software engineering.
