Developing better methods for segment-
ing continuous text into words is impor-
tant for improving the processing of Asian
languages, and may shed light on how hu-
mans learn to segment speech. We pro-
pose two new Bayesian word segmenta-
tion methods that assume unigram and bi-
gram models of word dependencies re-
spectively. The bigram model greatly out-
performs the unigram model (and previous
probabilistic models), demonstrating the
importance of such dependencies for word
segmentation. We also show that previous
probabilistic models rely crucially on sub-
optimal search procedures.
