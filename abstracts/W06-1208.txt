We present two novel paraphrase tests for
automatically predicting the inherent se-
mantic relation of a given compound nom-
inalisation as one of subject, direct object,
or prepositional object. We compare these
to the usual verb?argument paraphrase test
using corpus statistics, and frequencies ob-
tained by scraping the Google search en-
gine interface. We also implemented a
more robust statistical measure than max-
imum likelihood estimation ? the con-
fidence interval. A significant reduction
in data sparseness was achieved, but this
alone is insufficient to provide a substan-
tial performance improvement.
