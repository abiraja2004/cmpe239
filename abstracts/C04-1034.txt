Abstract
This paper describes an extension of the
dar-algorithm (Navarretta, 2004) for re-
solving intersentential pronominal anaphors
referring to individual and abstract enti-
ties in texts and dialogues. In dar indi-
vidual entities are resolved combining mod-
els which identify high degree of salience
with high degree of givenness (topicality)
of entities in the hearer?s cognitive model,
e.g. (Grosz et al, 1995), with Hajic?ova? et
al.?s (1990) salience account which assigns
the highest degree of salience to entities
in the focal part of an utterance in Infor-
mation Structure terms, which often intro-
duce new information in discourse. Anaph-
ors referring to abstract entities are resolved
with an extension of the algorithm pre-
sented by Eckert and Strube (2000). The
extended dar-algorithm accounts for differ-
ences in the resolution mechanisms of differ-
ent types of Danish pronouns. Manual tests
of the algorithm show that dar performs
better than other resolution algorithms on
the same data.
