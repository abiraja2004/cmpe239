Syntactic analysis influences the way in
which the source sentence is translated.
Previous efforts add syntactic constraints
to phrase-based translation by directly
rewarding/punishing a hypothesis when-
ever it matches/violates source-side con-
stituents. We present a new model that
automatically learns syntactic constraints,
including but not limited to constituent
matching/violation, from training corpus.
The model brackets a source phrase as
to whether it satisfies the learnt syntac-
tic constraints. The bracketed phrases are
then translated as a whole unit by the de-
coder. Experimental results and analy-
sis show that the new model outperforms
other previous methods and achieves a
substantial improvement over the baseline
which is not syntactically informed.
