 
A semantic analysis of topic and focus as two parts of 
tectogrammstical representation by means of transpa- 
rent intenslonal logic (TIL) is presented. It is poin- 
ted out that two sentences (more precisely, their 
teotogrameatlcal representations} differing Just in 
the topic~focus articulation (TFA) denote different 
propos i t ions ,  i .e .  that  TFA has an effect upon the 
semantic content of the sentence. An informal short 
description of an algorithm handling the TFA in the 
translation o~ teotogramsstlcal representations into 
the const ruct ions  of  TIL i s  added. The TFA a lgor i thm 
divides a representation into two parts corresponding 
to the topic and focus; every part is analyzed 
(translated) in isolation and then the resulting cons- 
truction is put together. The TIL construction d~sous- 
sad here reflect the scope of negation and some of the 
presuppositions observed.
