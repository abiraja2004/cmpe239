Lexicons of word difficulty are useful for var-
ious educational applications, including read-
ability classification and text simplification. In
this work, we explore automatic creation of
these lexicons using methods which go beyond
simple term frequency, but without relying on
age-graded texts. In particular, we derive infor-
mation for each word type from the readability
of the web documents they appear in and the
words they co-occur with, linearly combining
these various features. We show the efficacy of
this approach by comparing our lexicon with an
existing coarse-grained, low-coverage resource
and a new crowdsourced annotation.
