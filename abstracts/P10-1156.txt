Word Sense Disambiguation remains one
of the most complex problems facing com-
putational linguists to date. In this pa-
per we present a system that combines
evidence from a monolingual WSD sys-
tem together with that from a multilingual
WSD system to yield state of the art per-
formance on standard All-Words data sets.
The monolingual system is based on a
modification of the graph based state of the
art algorithm In-Degree. The multilingual
system is an improvement over an All-
Words unsupervised approach, SALAAM.
SALAAM exploits multilingual evidence
as a means of disambiguation. In this
paper, we present modifications to both
of the original approaches and then their
combination. We finally report the highest
results obtained to date on the SENSEVAL
2 standard data set using an unsupervised
method, we achieve an overall F measure
of 64.58 using a voting scheme.
