We propose a machine learning based
method of sentiment classification of sen-
tences using word-level polarity. The polari-
ties of words in a sentence are not always the
same as that of the sentence, because there
can be polarity-shifters such as negation ex-
pressions. The proposed method models
the polarity-shifters. Our model can be
trained in two different ways: word-wise and
sentence-wise learning. In sentence-wise
learning, the model can be trained so that the
prediction of sentence polarities should be
accurate. The model can also be combined
with features used in previous work such
as bag-of-words and n-grams. We empiri-
cally show that our method almost always
improves the performance of sentiment clas-
sification of sentences especially when we
have only small amount of training data.
