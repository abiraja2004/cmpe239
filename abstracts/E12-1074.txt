When translating English to German, exist-
ing reordering models often cannot model
the long-range reorderings needed to gen-
erate German translations with verbs in the
correct position. We reorder English as a
preprocessing step for English-to-German
SMT. We use a sequence of hand-crafted
reordering rules applied to English parse
trees. The reordering rules place English
verbal elements in the positions within the
clause they will have in the German transla-
tion. This is a difficult problem, as German
verbal elements can appear in different po-
sitions within a clause (in contrast with En-
glish verbal elements, whose positions do
not vary as much). We obtain a significant
improvement in translation performance.
