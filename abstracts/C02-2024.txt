This paper describes an indexing substrate for typed
feature structures (ISTFS), which is an efficient re-
trieval engine for typed feature structures. Given a
set of typed feature structures, the ISTFS efficiently
retrieves its subset whose elements are unifiable or
in a subsumption relation with a query feature struc-
ture. The efficiency of the ISTFS is achieved by
calculating a unifiability checking table prior to re-
trieval and finding the best index paths dynami-
cally.
