This paper describes the system we devel-
oped to improve German-English transla-
tion of News text for the shared task of
the Fifth Workshop on Statistical Machine
Translation. Working within cdec, an
open source modular framework for ma-
chine translation, we explore the benefits
of several modifications to our hierarchical
phrase-based model, including segmenta-
tion lattices, minimum Bayes Risk de-
coding, grammar extraction methods, and
varying language models. Furthermore,
we analyze decoder speed and memory
performance across our set of models and
show there is an important trade-off that
needs to be made.
