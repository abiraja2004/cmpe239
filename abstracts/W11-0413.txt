Subjectivity and sentiment analysis (SSA) is
an area that has been witnessing a flurry
of novel research. However, only few at-
tempts have been made to build SSA systems
for morphologically-rich languages (MRL). In
the current study, we report efforts to par-
tially bridge this gap. We present a newly
labeled corpus of Modern Standard Arabic
(MSA) from the news domain manually an-
notated for subjectivity and domain at the sen-
tence level. We summarize our linguistically-
motivated annotation guidelines and provide
examples from our corpus exemplifying the
different phenomena. Throughout the paper,
we discuss expression of subjectivity in nat-
ural language, combining various previously
scattered insights belonging to many branches
of linguistics.
