Linguistic markers of personality traits have
been studied extensively, but few cross-
cultural studies exist. In this paper, we eval-
uate how native speakers of American English
and Arabic perceive personality traits and nat-
uralness of English utterances that vary along
the dimensions of verbosity, hedging, lexical
and syntactic alignment, and formality. The
utterances are the turns within dialogue frag-
ments that are presented as text transcripts to
the workers of Amazon?s Mechanical Turk.
The results of the study suggest that all four di-
mensions can be used as linguistic markers of
all personality traits by both language commu-
nities. A further comparative analysis shows
cross-cultural differences for some combina-
tions of measures of personality traits and nat-
uralness, the dimensions of linguistic variabil-
ity and dialogue acts.
