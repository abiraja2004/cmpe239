Most Spoken Dialog Systems are based on
speech grammars and frame/slot semantics.
The semantic descriptions of input utterances
are usually defined ad-hoc with no ability to
generalize beyond the target application do-
main or to learn from annotated corpora. The
approach we propose in this paper exploits
machine learning of frame semantics, bor-
rowing its theoretical model from computa-
tional linguistics. While traditional automatic
Semantic Role Labeling approaches on writ-
ten texts may not perform as well on spo-
ken dialogs, we show successful experiments
on such porting. Hence, we design and eval-
uate automatic FrameNet-based parsers both
for English written texts and for Italian dia-
log utterances. The results show that disflu-
encies of dialog data do not severely hurt per-
formance. Also, a small set of FrameNet-like
manual annotations is enough for realizing ac-
curate Semantic Role Labeling on the target
domains of typical Dialog Systems.
