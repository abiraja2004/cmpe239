We present a set of metrics describing
classification performance for individual
contexts of a spoken dialog system as well
as for the entire system. We show how
these metrics can be used to train and tune
system components and how they are re-
lated to Caller Experience, a subjective
measure describing how well a caller was
treated by the dialog system.
