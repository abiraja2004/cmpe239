We present a novel approach to noun
phrase lemmatisation where the main
phase is cast as a tagging problem. The
idea draws on the observation that the
lemmatisation of almost all Polish noun
phrases may be decomposed into trans-
formation of singular words (tokens) that
make up each phrase. We perform eval-
uation, which shows results similar to
those obtained earlier by a rule-based sys-
tem, while our approach allows to separate
chunking from lemmatisation.
