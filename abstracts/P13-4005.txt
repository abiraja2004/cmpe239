Nowadays, the importance of Social Me-
dia is constantly growing, as people often
use such platforms to share mainstream
media news and comment on the events
that they relate to. As such, people no
loger remain mere spectators to the events
that happen in the world, but become part
of them, commenting on their develop-
ments and the entities involved, sharing
their opinions and distributing related con-
tent. This paper describes a system that
links the main events detected from clus-
ters of newspaper articles to tweets related
to them, detects complementary informa-
tion sources from the links they contain
and subsequently applies sentiment analy-
sis to classify them into positive, negative
and neutral. In this manner, readers can
follow the main events happening in the
world, both from the perspective of main-
stream as well as social media and the pub-
lic?s perception on them.
This system will be part of the EMM me-
dia monitoring framework working live
and it will be demonstrated using Google
Earth.
