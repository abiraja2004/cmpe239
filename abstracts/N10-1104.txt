In this work, we try a hybrid methodology for
language modeling where both morphological
decomposition and factored language model-
ing (FLM) are exploited to deal with the com-
plex morphology of Arabic language. At the
end, we are able to obtain from 3.5% to 7.0%
relative reduction in word error rate (WER)
with respect to a traditional full-words sys-
tem, and from 1.0% to 2.0% relative WER re-
duction with respect to a non-factored decom-
posed system.
