 
Tailored patient information (TPI) systems 
are computer programs which produce 
persoualised heath-information material for 
patients. TPI systems are of growing interest 
to the natural-language generation (NLG) 
community; many TPI systems have also 
been developed in the medical community, 
usually with mail-merge technology. No 
matter what technology is used, experience 
shows that it is not easy to field a TPI 
system, even ff it is shown to be effective in 
clinical trials. In this paper we discuss ome 
of the difficulties in fielding TPI systems. 
This is based on our experiences with 2 TPI 
systems, one for generating asthma- 
information booklets and one for generating 
smoking-cessation letters.
