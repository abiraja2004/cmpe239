Even though NLP tools are widely used for
contemporary text today, there is a lack of
tools that can handle historical documents.
Such tools could greatly facilitate the work
of researchers dealing with large volumes
of historical texts. In this paper we pro-
pose a method for extracting verbs and their
complements from historical Swedish text,
using NLP tools and dictionaries developed
for contemporary Swedish and a set of nor-
malisation rules that are applied before tag-
ging and parsing the text. When evaluated
on a sample of texts from the period 1550?
1880, this method identifies verbs with an
F-score of 77.2% and finds a partially or
completely correct set of complements for
55.6% of the verbs. Although these re-
sults are in general lower than for contem-
porary Swedish, they are strong enough to
make the approach useful for information
extraction in historical research. Moreover,
the exact match rate for complete verb con-
structions is in fact higher for historical
texts than for contemporary texts (38.7%
vs. 30.8%).
