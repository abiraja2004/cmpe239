Long-distance reordering remains one of the
biggest challenges facing machine translation.
We derive soft constraints from the source de-
pendency parsing to directly address the re-
ordering problem for the hierarchical phrase-
based model. Our approach significantly im-
proves Chinese?English machine translation
on a large-scale task by 0.84 BLEU points
on average. Moreover, when we switch the
tuning function from BLEU to the LRscore
which promotes reordering, we observe total
improvements of 1.21 BLEU, 1.30 LRscore
and 3.36 TER over the baseline. On aver-
age our approach improves reordering preci-
sion and recall by 6.9 and 0.3 absolute points,
respectively, and is found to be especially ef-
fective for long-distance reodering.
