State-of-the-art statistical parsing models
applied to free word-order languages tend
to underperform compared to, e.g., pars-
ing English. Constituency-based mod-
els often fail to capture generalizations
that cannot be stated in structural terms,
and dependency-based models employ a
?single-head? assumption that often breaks
in the face of multiple exponence. In this
paper we suggest that the position of a con-
stituent is a form manifestation of its gram-
matical function, one among various pos-
sible means of realization. We develop the
Relational-Realizational approach to pars-
ing in which we untangle the projection
of grammatical functions and their means
of realization to allow for phrase-structure
variability and morphological-syntactic in-
teraction. We empirically demonstrate
the application of our approach to pars-
ing Modern Hebrew, obtaining 7% error
reduction from previously reported results.
