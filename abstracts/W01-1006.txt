 
This paper presents the semi-automatic 
construction method of a practical 
ontology by using various resources. In 
order to acquire a reasonably practical 
ontology in a limited time and with less 
manpower, we extend the Kadokawa 
thesaurus by inserting additional 
semantic relations into its hierarchy, 
which are classified as case relations 
and other semantic relations. The 
former can be obtained by converting 
valency information and case frames 
from previously-built computational 
dictionaries used in machine translation. 
The latter can be acquired from concept 
co-occurrence information, which is 
extracted automatically from large 
corpora. The ontology stores rich 
semantic constraints among 1,110 
concepts, and enables a natural 
language processing system to resolve 
semantic ambiguities by making 
inferences with the concept network of 
the ontology. In our practical machine 
translation system, our ontology-based 
word sense disambiguation method 
achieved an 8.7% improvement over 
methods which do not use an ontology 
for Korean translation.
