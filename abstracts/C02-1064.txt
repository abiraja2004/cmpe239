We describe a method for generating sentences
from ?keywords? or ?headwords?. This method
consists of two main parts, candidate-text con-
struction and evaluation. The construction part
generates text sentences in the form of depen-
dency trees by using complementary informa-
tion to replace information that is missing be-
cause of a ?knowledge gap? and other missing
function words to generate natural text sen-
tences based on a particular monolingual cor-
pus. The evaluation part consists of a model
for generating an appropriate text when given
keywords. This model considers not only word
n-gram information, but also dependency infor-
mation between words. Furthermore, it consid-
ers both string information and morphological
information.
