 
The paper describes an analogy-based measure 
of word-sense proximity grounded on distribu- 
tional evidence in typical contexts, and illus- 
trates a computational system which makes use 
of this measure for purposes of lexical disam- 
biguation. Experimental results show that word- 
sense analogy based on contexts of use com- 
pares favourably with classical word-sense 
similarity defined in terms of thesaural proxim- 
ity.
