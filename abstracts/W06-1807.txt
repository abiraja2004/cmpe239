We demonstrate a proof-of-concept sys-
tem that uses a shallow chunking-based
technique for knowledge extraction from
natural language text, in particular looking
at the task of story understanding. This
technique is extended with a reasoning
engine that borrows techniques from dy-
namic ontology refinement to discover the
semantic similarity of stories and to merge
them together.
