When dialogue systems, through the
use of incremental processing, are
not bounded anymore by strict, non-
overlapping turn-taking, a whole range of
additional interactional devices becomes
available. We explore the use of one such
device, trial intonation. We elaborate
our approach to dialogue management
in incremental systems, based on the
Information-State-Update approach, and
discuss an implementation in a micro-
domain that lends itself to the use of
immediate feedback, trial intonations and
expansions. In an overhearer evaluation,
the incremental system was judged as sig-
nificantly more human-like and reactive
than a non-incremental version.
