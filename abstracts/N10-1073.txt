Although Wikipedia has emerged as a power-
ful collaborative Encyclopedia on the Web, it
is only partially multilingual as most of the
content is in English and a small number of
other languages. In real-life scenarios, non-
English users in general and ESL/EFL 1 users
in particular, have a need to search for rele-
vant English Wikipedia articles as no relevant
articles are available in their language. The
multilingual experience of such users can be
significantly improved if they could express
their information need in their native language
while searching for English Wikipedia arti-
cles. In this paper, we propose a novel cross-
language name search algorithm and employ
it for searching English Wikipedia articles in
a diverse set of languages including Hebrew,
Hindi, Russian, Kannada, Bangla and Tamil.
Our empirical study shows that the multilin-
gual experience of users is significantly im-
proved by our approach.
