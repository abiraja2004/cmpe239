This paper investigates the effect of di-
rection in phrase-based statistial machine
translation decoding. We compare a typ-
ical phrase-based machine translation de-
coder using a left-to-right decoding strat-
egy to a right-to-left decoder. We also
investigate the effectiveness of a bidirec-
tional decoding strategy that integrates
both mono-directional approaches, with
the aim of reducing the effects due to lan-
guage specificity. Our experimental eval-
uation was extensive, based on 272 differ-
ent language pairs, and gave the surprising
result that for most of the language pairs,
it was better decode from right-to-left than
from left-to-right. As expected the rela-
tive performance of left-to-right and right-
to-left strategies proved to be highly lan-
guage dependent. The bidirectional ap-
proach outperformed the both the left-to-
right strategy and the right-to-left strategy,
showing consistent improvements that ap-
peared to be unrelated to the specific lan-
guages used for translation. Bidirectional
decoding gave rise to an improvement in
performance over a left-to-right decoding
strategy in terms of the BLEU score in
99% of our experiments.
