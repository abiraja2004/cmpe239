One of the difficulties in using Folk-
sonomies in computational systems is tag
ambiguity: tags with multiple meanings.
This paper presents a novel method for
building Folksonomy tag ontologies in
which the nodes are disambiguated. Our
method utilizes a clustering algorithm
called DSCBC, which was originally de-
veloped in Natural Language Processing
(NLP), to derive committees of tags, each
of which corresponds to one meaning or
domain. In this work, we use Wikipedia
as the external knowledge source for the
domains of the tags. Using the commit-
tees, an ambiguous tag is identified as one
which belongs to more than one commit-
tee. Then we apply a hierarchical agglom-
erative clustering algorithm to build an on-
tology of tags. The nodes in the derived
ontology are disambiguated in that an am-
biguous tag appears in several nodes in
the ontology, each of which corresponds
to one meaning of the tag. We evaluate the
derived ontology for its ontological den-
sity (how close similar tags are placed),
and its usefulness in applications, in par-
ticular for a personalized tag retrieval task.
The results showed marked improvements
over other approaches.
