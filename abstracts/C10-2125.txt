This paper presents a constraint-based
graph partitioning approach to corefer-
ence resolution solved by relaxation label-
ing. The approach combines the strengths
of groupwise classifiers and chain forma-
tion methods in one global method. Ex-
periments show that our approach signifi-
cantly outperforms systems based on sep-
arate classification and chain formation
steps, and that it achieves the best results
in the state of the art for the same dataset
and metrics.
