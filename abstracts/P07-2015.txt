This paper presents the use of Support
Vector Machines (SVM) to detect rele-
vant information to be included in a query-
focused summary. Several SVMs are
trained using information from pyramids
of summary content units. Their per-
formance is compared with the best per-
forming systems in DUC-2005, using both
ROUGE and autoPan, an automatic scor-
ing method for pyramid evaluation.
