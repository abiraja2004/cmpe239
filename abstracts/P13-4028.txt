 
We present in this paper SEMILAR, the SE-
Mantic simILARity toolkit. SEMILAR im-
plements a number of algorithms for assessing 
the semantic similarity between two texts. It is 
available as a Java library and as a Java 
standalone ap-plication offering GUI-based 
access to the implemented semantic similarity 
methods. Furthermore, it offers facilities for 
manual se-mantic similarity annotation by ex-
perts through its component SEMILAT (a 
SEMantic simILarity Annotation Tool).
