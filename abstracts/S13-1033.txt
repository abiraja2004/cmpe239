 
This paper presents three methods to evaluate 
the Semantic Textual Similarity (STS). The 
first two methods do not require labeled train-
ing data; instead, they automatically extract 
semantic knowledge in the form of word asso-
ciations from a given reference corpus. Two 
kinds of word associations are considered: co-
occurrence statistics and the similarity of 
word contexts. The third method was done in 
collaboration with groups from the Universi-
ties of Paris 13, Matanzas and Alicante. It 
uses several word similarity measures as fea-
tures in order to construct an accurate predic-
tion model for the STS.
