This paper describes the HDS4NLP en-
try to the BioNLP 2013 shared task on
biomedical event extraction. This system
is based on a pairwise model that trans-
forms trigger classification in a simple
multi-class problem in place of the usual
multi-label problem. This model facili-
tates inference compared to global models
while relying on richer information com-
pared to usual pipeline approaches. The
HDS4NLP system ranked 6th on the Ge-
nia task (43.03% f-score), and after fix-
ing a bug discovered after the final submis-
sion, it outperforms the winner of this task
(with a f-score of 51.15%).
