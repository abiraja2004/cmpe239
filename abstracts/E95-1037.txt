 
This paper proposes a corpus-based language 
model for topic identification. We analyze 
the association of noun-noun and noun-verb 
pairs in LOB Corpus. The word association 
norms are based on three factors: 1) word 
importance, 2) pair co-occurrence, and 3) 
distance. They are trained on the paragraph 
and sentence l vels for noun-noun and noun- 
verb pairs, respectively. Under the topic 
coherence postulation, the nouns that have 
the strongest connectivities with the other 
nouns and verbs in the discourse form the 
preferred topic set. The collocational 
semantics then is used to identify the topics 
from paragraphs and to discuss the topic 
shift phenomenon among paragraphs.
