We consider the challenge of learning seman-
tic parsers that scale to large, open-domain
problems, such as question answering with
Freebase. In such settings, the sentences cover
a wide variety of topics and include many
phrases whose meaning is difficult to rep-
resent in a fixed target ontology. For ex-
ample, even simple phrases such as ?daugh-
ter? and ?number of people living in? can-
not be directly represented in Freebase, whose
ontology instead encodes facts about gen-
der, parenthood, and population. In this pa-
per, we introduce a new semantic parsing ap-
proach that learns to resolve such ontologi-
cal mismatches. The parser is learned from
question-answer pairs, uses a probabilistic
CCG to build linguistically motivated logical-
form meaning representations, and includes
an ontology matching model that adapts the
output logical forms for each target ontology.
Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art per-
formance on two benchmark semantic parsing
datasets, including a nine point accuracy im-
provement on a recent Freebase QA corpus.
