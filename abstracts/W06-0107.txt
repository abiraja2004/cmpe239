On the task of determining the tense to use
when translating a Chinese verb into En-
glish, current systems do not perform as
well as human translators. The main focus
of the present paper is to identify features
that human translators use, but which are
not currently automatically extractable.
The goal is twofold: to test a particu-
lar hypothesis about what additional infor-
mation human translators might be using,
and as a pilot to determine where to focus
effort on developing automatic extraction
methods for features that are somewhat be-
yond the reach of current feature extrac-
tion. The paper shows that incorporating
several latent features into the tense clas-
sifier boosts the tense classifier?s perfor-
mance, and a tense classifier using only the
latent features outperforms one using only
the surface features. Our findings confirm
the utility of the latent features in auto-
matic tense classification, explaining the
gap between automatic classification sys-
tems and the human brain.
