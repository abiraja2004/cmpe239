Dictionaries and word translation models
are used by a variety of systems, espe-
cially in machine translation. We build
a multilingual dictionary induction system
for a family of related resource-poor lan-
guages. We assume only the presence
of a single medium-length multitext (the
Bible). The techniques rely upon lexical
and syntactic similarity of languages as
well as on the fact that building dictionar-
ies for several pairs of languages provides
information about other pairs.
