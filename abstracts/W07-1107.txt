 
In this paper we investigate the role of the 
placement of pauses in automatically ex-
tracted multi-word expression (MWE) can-
didates from a learner corpus. The aim is to 
explore whether the analysis of pauses 
might be useful in the validation of these 
candidates as MWEs. The study is based 
on the assumption advanced in the area of 
psycholinguistics that MWEs are stored ho-
listically in the mental lexicon and are 
therefore produced without pauses in natu-
rally occurring discourse. Automatic MWE 
extraction methods are unable to capture 
the criterion of holistic storage and instead 
rely on statistics and raw frequency in the 
identification of MWE candidates. In this 
study we explore the possibility of a com-
bination of the two approaches. We report 
on a study in which we analyse the place-
ment of pauses in various instances of two 
very frequent automatically extracted 
MWE candidates from a learner corpus, i.e. 
the n-grams I don?t know and I think I. In-
tuitively, they are judged differently in 
terms of holistic storage. Our study ex-
plores whether pause analysis can be used 
as an objective empirical criterion to sup-
port this intuition. A corpus of interview 
data of language learners of English forms 
the basis of this study.
