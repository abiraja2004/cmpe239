We report results from a domain adapta-
tion task for statistical machine translation
(SMT) using cache-based adaptive lan-
guage and translation models. We apply
an exponential decay factor and integrate
the cache models in a standard phrase-
based SMT decoder. Without the need for
any domain-specific resources we obtain a
2.6% relative improvement on average in
BLEU scores using our dynamic adapta-
tion procedure.
