. Building a thesaurus is very costly and time-consuming task. To 
alleviate this problem, this paper proposes a new method for extending a 
thesaurus by adding taxonomic information automatically extracted from an 
MRD. The proposed method adopts a machine learning algorithm in acquiring 
rules for identifying a taxonomic relationship to minimize human-intervention. 
The accuracy of our method in identifying hypernyms of a noun is 89.7%, and 
it shows that the proposed method can be successfully applied to the problem of 
extending a thesaurus.
