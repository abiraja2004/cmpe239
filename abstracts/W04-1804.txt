 
The Gene Ontology is an important tool for the 
representation and processing of information 
about gene products and functions. It provides 
controlled vocabularies for the designations of 
cellular components, molecular functions, and 
biological processes used in the annotation of 
genes and gene products. These constitute 
three separate ontologies, of cellular com-
ponents), molecular functions and biological 
processes, respectively. The question we 
address here is: how are the terms in these 
three separate ontologies related to each other? 
We use statistical methods and formal 
ontological principles as a first step towards 
finding answers to this question.
