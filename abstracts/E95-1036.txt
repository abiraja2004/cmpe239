poral anaphora in sentences which con- 
tain quantification over events, within 
the framework of Discourse Representa- 
tion Theory. The analysis in (Partee, 
1984) of quantified sentences, introduced 
by a temporal connective, gives the 
wrong truth-conditions when the tempo- 
ral connective in the subordinate clause 
is before or after. This problem has been 
previously analyzed in (de Swart, 1991) 
as an instance of the proportion problem, 
and given a solution from a Generalized 
Quantifier approach. By using a care- 
ful distinction between the different no- 
tions of reference time, based on (Kamp 
and Reyle, 1993), we propose a solu- 
tion to this problem, within the frame- 
work of Dt~T. We show some applica- 
tions of this solution to additional tem- 
poral anaphora phenomena in quantified 
sentences.
