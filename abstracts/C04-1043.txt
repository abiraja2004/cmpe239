In this paper we present a grammar formalism that
combines the insights from Combinatory Categorial
Grammar with feature structure unification. We
show how information structure can be incorporated
with syntactic and semantic representations in a
principled way. We focus on the way theme, rheme,
and focus are integrated in the compositional se-
mantics, using Discourse Representation Theory as
first-order semantic theory. UCCG can be used for
parsing and generating prosodically annotated text,
and therefore has the potential to advance spoken
dialogue systems.
