Active learning can lower the cost of anno-
tation for some natural language processing
tasks by using a classifier to select informa-
tive instances to send to human annotators. It
has worked well in cases where the training in-
stances are selected one at a time and require
minimal context for annotation. However,
coreference annotations often require some
context and the traditional active learning ap-
proach may not be feasible. In this work we
explore various active learning methods for
coreference resolution that fit more realisti-
cally into coreference annotation workflows.
