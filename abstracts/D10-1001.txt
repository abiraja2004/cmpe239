This paper introduces dual decomposition as a
framework for deriving inference algorithms
for NLP problems. The approach relies on
standard dynamic-programming algorithms as
oracle solvers for sub-problems, together with
a simple method for forcing agreement be-
tween the different oracles. The approach
provably solves a linear programming (LP) re-
laxation of the global inference problem. It
leads to algorithms that are simple, in that they
use existing decoding algorithms; efficient, in
that they avoid exact algorithms for the full
model; and often exact, in that empirically
they often recover the correct solution in spite
of using an LP relaxation. We give experimen-
tal results on two problems: 1) the combina-
tion of two lexicalized parsing models; and
2) the combination of a lexicalized parsing
model and a trigram part-of-speech tagger.
