 
Learning a vocabulary word requires seeing it 
in multiple informative contexts.  We describe 
a system to generate such contexts for a given 
word sense.  Rather than attempt to do word 
sense disambiguation on example contexts al-
ready generated or selected from a corpus, we 
compile information about the word sense into 
the context generation process.  To evaluate the 
sense-appropriateness of the generated contexts 
compared to WordNet examples, three human 
judges chose which word sense(s) fit each ex-
ample, blind to its source and intended sense.  
On average, one judge rated the generated ex-
amples as sense-appropriate, compared to two 
judges for the WordNet examples.  Although 
the system?s precision was only half of Word-
Net?s, its recall was actually higher than 
WordNet?s, thanks to covering many senses for 
which WordNet lacks examples.
