Recent work on consultations between out-
patients with schizophrenia and psychiatrists
has shown that adherence to treatment can
be predicted by patterns of repair ? specifi-
cally, the pro-activity of the patient in check-
ing their understanding, i.e. patient clarifi-
cation. Using machine learning techniques,
we investigate whether this tendency can be
predicted from high-level dialogue features,
such as backchannels, overlap and each partic-
ipant?s proportion of talk. The results indicate
that these features are not predictive of a pa-
tient?s adherence to treatment or satisfaction
with the communication, although they do
have some association with symptoms. How-
ever, all these can be predicted if we allow
features at the word level. These preliminary
experiments indicate that patient adherence is
predictable from dialogue transcripts, but fur-
ther work is necessary to develop a meaning-
ful, general and reliable feature set.
