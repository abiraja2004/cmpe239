This paper reports on guiding parser de-
velopment by extracting information from
output of a large-scale parser applied to
Wikipedia documents. Data-driven parser
improvement is especially important for
applications where the corpus may differ
from that originally used to develop the
core grammar and where efficiency con-
cerns affect whether a new construction
should be added, or existing analyses mod-
ified. The large size of the corpus in ques-
tion also brings scalability concerns to the
foreground.
