 
In this paper we compare two types of 
corpus, focusing on the lexical mnbiguity of 
each of them. The first corpns consists 
mainly of newspaper articles and Hterature 
excerpts, while the second belc)ngs to the 
medical domain. To conduct he study, we 
have used two different disambiguation 
tools. However, first of all, we must verify 
the performance of each system in its 
respective application domain. We then use 
these systems in order to assess and compare 
both the general ambiguity rate and the 
particularities of each domain. (mantitative 
results show that medical documents are 
lexically less ambiguous than tmrestrieted 
documents. Our conclusions show the 
importance of the application area in the 
design of NLP tools.
