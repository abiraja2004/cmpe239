 
We are constricting a Japanese-Chinese 
parallel corpus, which is a part of the 
NICT Multilingual Corpora. The corpus is 
general domain, of large scale of about 
40,000 sentence pairs, long sentences, 
annotated with detailed information and 
high quality. To the best of our knowledge, 
this will be the first annotated Japanese-
Chinese parallel corpus in the world. We 
created the corpus by selecting Japanese 
sentences from Mainichi Newspaper and 
then manually translating them into 
Chinese. We then annotated the corpus 
with morphological and syntactic 
structures and alignments at word and 
phrase levels. This paper describes the 
specification in human translation and the 
scheme of detailed information annotation, 
and the tools we developed in the corpus 
construction. The experience we obtained 
and points we paid special attentions are 
also introduced for share with other 
researches in corpora construction.
