A major weakness of extant statistical ma-
chine translation (SMT) systems is their lack
of a proper training procedure. Phrase extrac-
tion and scoring processes rely on a chain of
crude heuristics, a situation judged problem-
atic by many. In this paper, we recast the ma-
chine translation problem in the familiar terms
of a sequence labeling task, thereby enabling
the use of enriched feature sets and exact train-
ing and inference procedures. The tractabil-
ity of the whole enterprise is achieved through
an efficient implementation of the conditional
random fields (CRFs) model using a weighted
finite-state transducers library. This approach
is experimentally contrasted with several con-
ventional phrase-based systems.
