 
The paper proposes a multimodal interface for a real 
sales database application. We show how natural lan- 
guage processing may be integrated with a visual, di- 
rect manipulation method of database query, to pro- 
duce a user interface which supports a flexible form of 
query specification, provides implicit guidance about 
the coverage of the linguistic component, and allows 
more focused discourse reference.
