This paper presents an unsupervised method for
assembling semantic knowledge from a part-of-
speech tagged corpus using graph algorithms.
The graph model is built by linking pairs of
words which participate in particular syntactic
relationships. We focus on the symmetric rela-
tionship between pairs of nouns which occur to-
gether in lists. An incremental cluster-building
algorithm using this part of the graph achieves
82% accuracy at a lexical acquisition task, eval-
uated against WordNet classes. The model nat-
urally realises domain and corpus specific am-
biguities as distinct components in the graph
surrounding an ambiguous word.
