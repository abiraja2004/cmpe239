This demo presents Information Extraction
from discharge letters in Bulgarian lan-
guage. The Patient history section is au-
tomatically split into episodes (clauses be-
tween two temporal markers); then drugs,
diagnoses and conditions are recognised
within the episodes with accuracy higher
than 90%. The temporal markers, which re-
fer to absolute or relative moments of time,
are identified with precision 87% and re-
call 68%. The direction of time for the
episode starting point: backwards or for-
ward (with respect to certain moment ori-
enting the episode) is recognised with pre-
cision 74.4%.
