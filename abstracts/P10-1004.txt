We present an efficient algorithm for com-
puting the weakest readings of semantically
ambiguous sentences. A corpus-based eval-
uation with a large-scale grammar shows
that our algorithm reduces over 80% of sen-
tences to one or two readings, in negligible
runtime, and thus makes it possible to work
with semantic representations derived by
deep large-scale grammars.
