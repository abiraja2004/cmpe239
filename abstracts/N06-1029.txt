Recognition of tone and intonation is es-
sential for speech recognition and lan-
guage understanding. However, most ap-
proaches to this recognition task have re-
lied upon extensive collections of man-
ually tagged data obtained at substantial
time and financial cost. In this paper,
we explore two approaches to tone learn-
ing with substantially reductions in train-
ing data. We employ both unsupervised
clustering and semi-supervised learning
to recognize pitch accent in English and
tones in Mandarin Chinese. In unsu-
pervised Mandarin tone clustering exper-
iments, we achieve 57-87% accuracy on
materials ranging from broadcast news to
clean lab speech. For English pitch accent
in broadcast news materials, results reach
78%. In the semi-supervised framework,
we achieve Mandarin tone recognition ac-
curacies ranging from 70% for broadcast
news speech to 94% for read speech, out-
performing both Support Vector Machines
(SVMs) trained on only the labeled data
and the 25% most common class assign-
ment level. These results indicate that the
intrinsic structure of tone and pitch accent
acoustics can be exploited to reduce the
need for costly labeled training data for
tone learning and recognition.
