Web search users frequently modify their
queries in hope of receiving better results.
This process is referred to as ?Query Refor-
mulation?. Previous research has mainly fo-
cused on proposing query reformulations in
the form of suggested queries for users. Some
research has studied the problem of predicting
whether the current query is a reformulation
of the previous query or not. However, this
work has been limited to bag-of-words models
where the main signals being used are word
overlap, character level edit distance and word
level edit distance. In this work, we show
that relying solely on surface level text sim-
ilarity results in many false positives where
queries with different intents yet similar top-
ics are mistakenly predicted as query reformu-
lations. We propose a new representation for
Web search queries based on identifying the
concepts in queries and show that we can sig-
nificantly improve query reformulation perfor-
mance using features of query concepts.
