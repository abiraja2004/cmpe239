This paper extends previous work on ex-
tracting parallel sentence pairs from com-
parable data (Munteanu and Marcu, 2005).
For a given source sentence S, a max-
imum entropy (ME) classifier is applied
to a large set of candidate target transla-
tions . A beam-search algorithm is used
to abandon target sentences as non-parallel
early on during classification if they fall
outside the beam. This way, our novel
algorithm avoids any document-level pre-
filtering step. The algorithm increases the
number of extracted parallel sentence pairs
significantly, which leads to a BLEU im-
provement of about 1 % on our Spanish-
English data.
