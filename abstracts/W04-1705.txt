 
A full understanding of text is out of reach of 
current human language technology. However, a 
shallow Natural Language Processing (NLP) 
approach can be used to provide automated help in 
the evaluation of essays. The main idea of this 
paper is that Latent Semantic Indexing (LSA) can 
be used in conjunction with ontologies and First 
order Logic (FOL) to locate segments relevant to a 
question in a student essay. Our test bed, in a first 
instance, is a set of ontologies such the AKT 
reference ontology (describing academic life), 
Newspaper and a Koala ontology (concerning 
koalas? habitat).
