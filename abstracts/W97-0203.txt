 
Minnesota Contextual Content Analysis 
(MCCA) is a technique for characterizing the 
concepts and themes occurring in text 
(sentences, paragraphs, interview transcripts, 
books). MCCA tags each word with a 
category and examines the distribution of 
categories against norms representing general 
usage of categories. MCCA also scores texts 
in terms of social contexts that are similar to 
different functions of language. Distributions 
can be analyzed using non-agglomerative 
clustering to characterize the concepts and 
themes. MCCA categories have been mapped 
to WordNet senses. The &fining 
characteristics that emerge from the mapping 
and the statistical techniques used in MCCA 
for analyzing concepts and themes suggest 
that tagging with WordNet synsets or MCCA 
categories may produce piphenomenal results 
that are misleading. We suggest that WordNet 
synsets and MCCA categories be augmented 
with further lexical semantic information for 
use after text is tagged or categorized. We 
suggest hat such information is useful not 
only for the primary purposes of 
disambiguation in parsing and text 
classification in content analysis and 
information retrieval, but also for tasks in 
corpus analysis, discourse analysis, and 
automatic text summarization.
