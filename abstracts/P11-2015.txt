Community-based knowledge forums, such as
Wikipedia, are susceptible to vandalism, i.e.,
ill-intentioned contributions that are detrimen-
tal to the quality of collective intelligence.
Most previous work to date relies on shallow
lexico-syntactic patterns and metadata to au-
tomatically detect vandalism in Wikipedia. In
this paper, we explore more linguistically mo-
tivated approaches to vandalism detection. In
particular, we hypothesize that textual vandal-
ism constitutes a unique genre where a group
of people share a similar linguistic behav-
ior. Experimental results suggest that (1) sta-
tistical models give evidence to unique lan-
guage styles in vandalism, and that (2) deep
syntactic patterns based on probabilistic con-
text free grammars (PCFG) discriminate van-
dalism more effectively than shallow lexico-
syntactic patterns based on n-grams.
