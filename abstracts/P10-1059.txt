In this paper, we introduce a corpus of
consumer reviews from the rateitall and
the eopinions websites annotated with
opinion-related information. We present
a two-level annotation scheme. In the
first stage, the reviews are analyzed at
the sentence level for (i) relevancy to a
given topic, and (ii) expressing an eval-
uation about the topic. In the second
stage, on-topic sentences containing eval-
uations about the topic are further investi-
gated at the expression level for pinpoint-
ing the properties (semantic orientation,
intensity), and the functional components
of the evaluations (opinion terms, targets
and holders). We discuss the annotation
scheme, the inter-annotator agreement for
different subtasks and our observations.
