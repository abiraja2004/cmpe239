We present analyses aimed at eliciting
which specific aspects of discourse pro-
vide the strongest indication for text im-
portance. In the context of content selec-
tion for single document summarization of
news, we examine the benefits of both the
graph structure of text provided by dis-
course relations and the semantic sense
of these relations. We find that structure
information is the most robust indicator
of importance. Semantic sense only pro-
vides constraints on content selection but
is not indicative of important content by it-
self. However, sense features complement
structure information and lead to improved
performance. Further, both types of dis-
course information prove complementary
to non-discourse features. While our re-
sults establish the usefulness of discourse
features, we also find that lexical overlap
provides a simple and cheap alternative
to discourse for computing text structure
with comparable performance for the task
of content selection.
