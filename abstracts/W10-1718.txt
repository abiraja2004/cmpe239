We describe the progress we have made in
the past year on Joshua (Li et al, 2009a),
an open source toolkit for parsing based
machine translation. The new functional-
ity includes: support for translation gram-
mars with a rich set of syntactic nonter-
minals, the ability for external modules to
posit constraints on how spans in the in-
put sentence should be translated, lattice
parsing for dealing with input uncertainty,
a semiring framework that provides a uni-
fied way of doing various dynamic pro-
gramming calculations, variational decod-
ing for approximating the intractable MAP
decoding, hypergraph-based discrimina-
tive training for better feature engineering,
a parallelized MERT module, document-
level and tail-based MERT, visualization
of the derivation trees, and a cleaner
pipeline for MT experiments.
