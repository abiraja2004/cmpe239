 
This paper explores the possibilities of 
improving parsing results by combining 
outputs of several parsers. To some ex-
tent, we are porting the ideas of Hender-
son and Brill (1999) to the world of 
dependency structures. We differ from 
them in exploring context features more 
deeply. All our experiments were con-
ducted on Czech but the method is lan-
guage-independent. We were able to 
significantly improve over the best pars-
ing result for the given setting, known so 
far. Moreover, our experiments show that 
even parsers far below the state of the art 
can contribute to the total improvement.
