This paper investigates the use of prompt-
based content features for the automated as-
sessment of spontaneous speech in a spoken
language proficiency assessment. The results
show that single highest performing prompt-
based content feature measures the number
of unique lexical types that overlap with the
listening materials and are not contained in
either the reading materials or a sample re-
sponse, with a correlation of r = 0.450 with
holistic proficiency scores provided by hu-
mans. Furthermore, linear regression scor-
ing models that combine the proposed prompt-
based content features with additional spoken
language proficiency features are shown to
achieve competitive performance with scoring
models using content features based on pre-
scored responses.
