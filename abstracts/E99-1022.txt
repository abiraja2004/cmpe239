 
We propose a parser for constraint- 
logic grammars implementing HPSG 
that combines the advantages of dy- 
namic bottom-up and advanced top- 
down control. The parser allows the 
user to apply magic compilation to spe- 
cific constraints in a grammar which as 
a result can be processed dynamically 
in a bottom-up and goal-directed fash- 
ion. State of the art top-down process- 
ing techniques are used to deal with the 
remaining constraints. We discuss vari- 
ous aspects concerning the implementa- 
tion of the parser as part of a grammar 
development system.
