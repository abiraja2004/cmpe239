We investigate the factors which determine
constituent order in German clauses and pro-
pose an algorithm which performs the task
in two steps: First, the best candidate for
the initial sentence position is chosen. Then,
the order for the remaining constituents is
determined. The first task is more difficult
than the second one because of properties
of the German sentence-initial position. Ex-
periments show a significant improvement
over competing approaches. Our algorithm
is also more efficient than these.
