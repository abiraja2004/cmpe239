 
This paper is an outline of a statistical learn- 
ing algorithm for information extraction sys- 
tems. It is based on a lexicaUy intensive anal- 
ysis of a small number of texts that belong 
to one domain and provides a robust lemma- 
tisation of the word forms and the collection 
of the most important syntagmatic dependen- 
cies in weighted regular expressions. The lexi- 
cal and syntactical knowledge is collected in a 
very compact knowledge base that enables the 
analysis of correct and partly incorrect texts 
or messages, which due to transmission er- 
rors, spelling or grammatical mistakes other- 
wise would have been rejected by conventional 
systems.
