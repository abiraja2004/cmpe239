We propose a high-performance cascaded hy-
brid model for Chinese NER. Firstly, we use
Boosting, a standard and theoretically well-
founded machine learning method to combine a
set of weak classifiers together into a base sys-
tem. Secondly, we introduce various types of
heuristic human knowledge into Markov Logic
Networks (MLNs), an effective combination
of first-order logic and probabilistic graphi-
cal models to validate Boosting NER hypothe-
ses. Experimental results show that the cas-
caded hybrid model significantly outperforms
the state-of-the-art Boosting model.
