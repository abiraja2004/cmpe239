In this paper we present a hybrid approach
for identifying Japanese functional ex-
pressions and its application in a Japanese
reading assistant. We combine the re-
sults of machine learning and pattern-
based methods to identify several types
of functional expressions. We show that
by using our approach we can double the
coverage of previous approaches and still
maintain the high level of performance
necessary for our application.
