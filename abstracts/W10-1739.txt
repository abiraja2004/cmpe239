LIUM participated in the System Combi-
nation task of the Fifth Workshop on Sta-
tistical Machine Translation (WMT 2010).
Hypotheses from 5 French/English MT
systems were combined with MANY, an
open source system combination software
based on confusion networks currently de-
veloped at LIUM.
The system combination yielded signifi-
cant improvements in BLEU score when
applied on WMT?09 data. The same be-
havior has been observed when tuning is
performed on development data of this
year evaluation.
