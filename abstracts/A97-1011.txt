 
We describe a practical parser for unre- 
stricted dependencies. The parser creates 
links between words and names the links 
according to their syntactic functions. We 
first describe the older Constraint Gram- 
mar parser where many of the ideas come 
from. Then we proceed to describe the cen- 
tral ideas of our new parser. Finally, the 
parser is evaluated.
