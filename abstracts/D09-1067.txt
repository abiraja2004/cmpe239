In previous research in automatic verb
classification, syntactic features have
proved the most useful features, although
manual classifications rely heavily on se-
mantic features. We show, in contrast
with previous work, that considerable ad-
ditional improvement can be obtained by
using semantic features in automatic clas-
sification: verb selectional preferences ac-
quired from corpus data using a fully unsu-
pervised method. We report these promis-
ing results using a new framework for
verb clustering which incorporates a re-
cent subcategorization acquisition system,
rich syntactic-semantic feature sets, and
a variation of spectral clustering which
performs particularly well in high dimen-
sional feature space.
