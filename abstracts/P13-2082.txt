Semantic parsing is a domain-dependent
process by nature, as its output is defined
over a set of domain symbols. Motivated
by the observation that interpretation can
be decomposed into domain-dependent
and independent components, we suggest
a novel interpretation model, which aug-
ments a domain dependent model with ab-
stract information that can be shared by
multiple domains. Our experiments show
that this type of information is useful and
can reduce the annotation effort signifi-
cantly when moving between domains.
