In this paper, we present a Chinese word 
segmentation system which is consisted of 
four components, i.e. basic segmentation, 
named entity recognition, error-driven 
learner and new word detector. The basic 
segmentation and named entity recognition, 
implemented based on conditional random 
fields, are used to generate initial 
segmentation results. The other two 
components are used to refine the results. 
Our system participated in the tests on 
open and closed tracks of Beijing 
University (PKU) and Microsoft Research 
(MSR). The actual evaluation results show 
that our system performs very well in MSR 
open track, MSR closed track and PKU 
open track.
