We propose to re-examine the hypothesis that
automated metrics developed for MT evalu-
ation can prove useful for paraphrase iden-
tification in light of the significant work on
the development of new MT metrics over the
last 4 years. We show that a meta-classifier
trained using nothing but recent MT metrics
outperforms all previous paraphrase identifi-
cation approaches on the Microsoft Research
Paraphrase corpus. In addition, we apply our
system to a second corpus developed for the
task of plagiarism detection and obtain ex-
tremely positive results. Finally, we conduct
extensive error analysis and uncover the top
systematic sources of error for a paraphrase
identification approach relying solely on MT
metrics. We release both the new dataset and
the error analysis annotations for use by the
community.
