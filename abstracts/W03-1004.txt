We address the problem of sentence align-
ment for monolingual corpora, a phe-
nomenon distinct from alignment in par-
allel corpora. Aligning large compara-
ble corpora automatically would provide
a valuable resource for learning of text-to-
text rewriting rules. We incorporate con-
text into the search for an optimal align-
ment in two complementary ways: learn-
ing rules for matching paragraphs using
topic structure and further refining the
matching through local alignment to find
good sentence pairs. Evaluation shows
that our alignment method outperforms
state-of-the-art systems developed for the
same task.
