 
This paper presents the results of using 
Roget's International Thesaurus as the 
taxonomy in a semantic similarity 
measurement task. Four similarity metrics 
were taken from the literature and applied to 
Roget's. The experimental evaluation 
suggests that the traditional edge counting 
approach does surprisingly well (a 
correlation of r=0.88 with a benchmark set 
of human similarity judgements, with an 
upper bound of r=0.90 for human subjects 
performing the same task.)
