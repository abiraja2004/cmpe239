This paper presents a set of techniques for bitext word align-
ment, optimized for a language pair with the characteristics of
Inuktitut-English. The resulting systems exploit cross-lingual
affinities at the sublexical level of syllables and substrings, as
well as regular patterns of transliteration and the tendency to-
wards monotonicity of alignment. Our most successful systems
were based on classifier combination, and we found different
combination methods performed best under the target evalua-
tion metrics of F-measure and alignment error rate.
