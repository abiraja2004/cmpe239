In this paper we demonstrate that there
is a strong correlation between the Ques-
tion Answering (QA) accuracy and the
log-likelihood of the answer typing com-
ponent of our statistical QA model. We
exploit this observation in a clustering al-
gorithm which optimizes QA accuracy by
maximizing the log-likelihood of a set of
question-and-answer pairs. Experimental
results show that we achieve better QA ac-
curacy using the resulting clusters than by
using manually derived clusters.
