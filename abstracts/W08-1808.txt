Having gold standards allows us to evalu-
ate new methods and approaches against a
common benchmark. In this paper we de-
scribe a set of gold standard question re-
formulations and associated reformulation
guidelines that we have created to support
research into automatic interpretation of
questions in TREC question series, where
questions may refer anaphorically to the
target of the series or to answers to pre-
vious questions. We also assess various
string comparison metrics for their utility
as evaluation measures of the proximity of
an automated system?s reformulations to
the gold standard. Finally we show how
we have used this approach to assess the
question processing capability of our own
QA system and to pinpoint areas for im-
provement.
