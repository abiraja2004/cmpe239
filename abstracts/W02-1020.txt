Text prediction is a form of interactive
machine translation that is well suited to
skilled translators. In principle it can as-
sist in the production of a target text with
minimal disruption to a translator?s nor-
mal routine. However, recent evaluations
of a prototype prediction system showed
that it significantly decreased the produc-
tivity of most translators who used it. In
this paper, we analyze the reasons for this
and propose a solution which consists in
seeking predictions that maximize the ex-
pected benefit to the translator, rather than
just trying to anticipate some amount of
upcoming text. Using a model of a ?typ-
ical translator? constructed from data col-
lected in the evaluations of the prediction
prototype, we show that this approach has
the potential to turn text prediction into a
help rather than a hindrance to a translator.
