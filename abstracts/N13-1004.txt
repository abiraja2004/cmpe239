Current word alignment models for statisti-
cal machine translation do not address mor-
phology beyond merely splitting words. We
present a two-level alignment model that dis-
tinguishes between words and morphemes, in
which we embed an IBM Model 1 inside an
HMM based word alignment model. The
model jointly induces word and morpheme
alignments using an EM algorithm. We eval-
uated our model on Turkish-English parallel
data. We obtained significant improvement of
BLEU scores over IBM Model 4. Our results
indicate that utilizing information from mor-
phology improves the quality of word align-
ments.
