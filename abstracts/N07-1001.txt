In this paper we describe an automatic
prosody labeling framework that exploits
both language and speech information.
We model the syntactic-prosodic informa-
tion with a maximum entropy model that
achieves an accuracy of 85.2% and 91.5%
for pitch accent and boundary tone la-
beling on the Boston University Radio
News corpus. We model the acoustic-
prosodic stream with two different mod-
els, one a maximum entropy model and
the other a traditional HMM. We finally
couple the syntactic-prosodic and acoustic-
prosodic components to achieve signifi-
cantly improved pitch accent and bound-
ary tone classification accuracies of 86.0%
and 93.1% respectively. Similar experimen-
tal results are also reported on Boston Di-
rections corpus.
