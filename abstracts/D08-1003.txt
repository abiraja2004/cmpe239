Regular expressions have served as the dom-
inant workhorse of practical information ex-
traction for several years. However, there has
been little work on reducing the manual ef-
fort involved in building high-quality, com-
plex regular expressions for information ex-
traction tasks. In this paper, we propose Re-
LIE, a novel transformation-based algorithm
for learning such complex regular expressions.
We evaluate the performance of our algorithm
on multiple datasets and compare it against the
CRF algorithm. We show that ReLIE, in ad-
dition to being an order of magnitude faster,
outperforms CRF under conditions of limited
training data and cross-domain data. Finally,
we show how the accuracy of CRF can be im-
proved by using features extracted by ReLIE.
