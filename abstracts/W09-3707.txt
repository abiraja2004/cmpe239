This paper addresses the problem of the identification of the seman-
tic relations in Italian complex nominals (CNs) of the type N+P+N.
We exploit the fact that the semantic relation, which is underspeci-
fied in most cases, is partially made explicit by the preposition. We
develop an annotation framework around five different semantic rela-
tions, which we use to create a corpus of 1700 Italian CNs, obtaining an
inter-annotator agreement of K=.695. Exploiting this data, for each
preposition p we train a classifier to assign one of the five semantic
relations to any CN of the type N+p+N, by using both string and
supersense features. To obtain supersenses, we experiment with a se-
quential tagger as well as a plain lookup in MultiWordNet, and find
that using information obtained from the former yields better results.
