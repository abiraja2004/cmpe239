Combining word alignments trained in
two translation directions has mostly re-
lied on heuristics that are not directly
motivated by intended applications. We
propose a novel method that performs
combination as an optimization process.
Our algorithm explicitly maximizes the ef-
fectiveness function with greedy search
for phrase table training or synchronized
grammar extraction. Experimental results
show that the proposed method leads to
significantly better translation quality than
existing methods. Analysis suggests that
this simple approach is able to maintain
accuracy while maximizing coverage.
