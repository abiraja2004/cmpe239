Nowadays, most of the statistical translation sys-
tems are based on phrases (i.e. groups of words).
In this paper we study different improvements to
the standard phrase-based translation system. We
describe a modified method for the phrase extrac-
tion which deals with larger phrases while keeping
a reasonable number of phrases. We also propose
additional features which lead to a clear improve-
ment in the performance of the translation. We
present results with the EuroParl task in the direc-
tion Spanish to English and results from the evalu-
ation of the shared task ?Exploiting Parallel Texts
for Statistical Machine Translation? (ACL Work-
shop on Parallel Texts 2005).
