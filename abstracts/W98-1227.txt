 
In this paper, we propose a method for con- 
structing bigram LR tables by way of incor- 
porating bigram constraints into an LR table. 
Using a bigram LR table, it is possible for a 
GLR parser to make use of both big'ram and 
CFG constraints in natural language process- 
ing. 
Applying bigram LR tables to our GLR 
method has the following advantages: 
(1) Language models utilizing bigzam LR ta- 
bles have lower perplexity than simple bigram 
language models, since local constraints (hi- 
gram) and global constraints (CFG) are com- 
bined in a single bigram LR table. 
(2) Bigram constraints are easily acquired from 
a given corpus. Therefore data sparseness is 
not likely to arise. 
(3) Separation of local and global constraints 
keeps down the number of CFG rules. 
The first advantage leads to a reduction in 
complexity, and as the result, better perfor- 
mance in GLR parsing. 
Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness 
of our method.
