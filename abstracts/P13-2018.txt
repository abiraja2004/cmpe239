Aspects of Chinese syntax result in a dis-
tinctive mix of parsing challenges. How-
ever, the contribution of individual sources
of error to overall difficulty is not well un-
derstood. We conduct  a  comprehensive
automatic analysis of error types made by
Chinese parsers, covering a broad range of
error types for large sets of sentences, en-
abling the first empirical ranking of Chi-
nese error types by their performance im-
pact. We also investigate which error types
are resolved by using gold part-of-speech
tags, showing that improving Chinese tag-
ging  only  addresses  certain  error  types,
leaving substantial outstanding challenges.
