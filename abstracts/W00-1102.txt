 
This paper describes an experiment aiming at 
evaluating the role of NLP based optimizations 
(i.e. morphological derivation and synonymy 
expansion) in web search strategies. Keywords 
and their expansions are composed in two 
different Boolean expressions (i.e. expansion 
insertion and Cartesian combination) and then 
compared with a keyword conjunctive 
composition, considered as the baseline. 
Results confirm the hypothesis that linguistic 
optirnizations significantly improve the search 
engine performances.
