We present a nonparametric Bayesian ap-
proach to extract a structured database of enti-
ties from text. Neither the number of entities
nor the fields that characterize each entity are
provided in advance; the only supervision is
a set of five prototype examples. Our method
jointly accomplishes three tasks: (i) identify-
ing a set of canonical entities, (ii) inferring a
schema for the fields that describe each entity,
and (iii) matching entities to their references in
raw text. Empirical evaluation shows that the
approach learns an accurate database of enti-
ties and a sensible model of name structure.
