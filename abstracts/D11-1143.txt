Supervised classification needs large amounts
of annotated training data that is expensive to
create. Two approaches that reduce the cost
of annotation are active learning and crowd-
sourcing. However, these two approaches
have not been combined successfully to date.
We evaluate the utility of active learning in
crowdsourcing on two tasks, named entity
recognition and sentiment detection, and show
that active learning outperforms random selec-
tion of annotation examples in a noisy crowd-
sourcing scenario.
