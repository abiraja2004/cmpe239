In this work, we attempt to capture patterns
of co-occurrence across vowel systems and
at the same time figure out the nature of the
force leading to the emergence of such pat-
terns. For this purpose we define a weighted
network where the vowels are the nodes
and an edge between two nodes (read vow-
els) signify their co-occurrence likelihood
over the vowel inventories. Through this
network we identify communities of vow-
els, which essentially reflect their patterns
of co-occurrence across languages. We ob-
serve that in the assortative vowel communi-
ties the constituent nodes (read vowels) are
largely uncorrelated in terms of their fea-
tures indicating that they are formed based
on the principle of maximal perceptual con-
trast. However, in the rest of the communi-
ties, strong correlations are reflected among
the constituent vowels with respect to their
features indicating that it is the principle of
feature economy that binds them together.
