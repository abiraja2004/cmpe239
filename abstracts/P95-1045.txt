 
We extract from sentences a superstruc- 
ture made of argumentative operators and 
connectives applying to the remaining set 
of terminal sub-sentences. We found the 
argumentative interpretation of utterances 
on a semantics defined at the linguistic le- 
vel. We describe the computation of this 
particular semantics, based on the cons- 
traints that the superstructure impels to 
the argumentative power of terminal sub- 
sentences.
