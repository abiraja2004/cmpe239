This paper presents the results of the
WMT10 and MetricsMATR10 shared
tasks,1 which included a translation task,
a system combination task, and an eval-
uation task. We conducted a large-scale
manual evaluation of 104 machine trans-
lation systems and 41 system combina-
tion entries. We used the ranking of these
systems to measure how strongly auto-
matic metrics correlate with human judg-
ments of translation quality for 26 metrics.
This year we also investigated increasing
the number of human judgments by hiring
non-expert annotators through Amazon?s
Mechanical Turk.
