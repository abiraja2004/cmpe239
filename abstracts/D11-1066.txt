The last decade has seen many interesting ap-
plications of Question Answering (QA) tech-
nology. The Jeopardy! quiz show is certainly
one of the most fascinating, from the view-
points of both its broad domain and the com-
plexity of its language. In this paper, we study
kernel methods applied to syntactic/semantic
structures for accurate classification of Jeop-
ardy! definition questions. Our extensive em-
pirical analysis shows that our classification
models largely improve on classifiers based on
word-language models. Such classifiers are
also used in the state-of-the-art QA pipeline
constituting Watson, the IBM Jeopardy! sys-
tem. Our experiments measuring their impact
on Watson show enhancements in QA accu-
racy and a consequent increase in the amount
of money earned in game-based evaluation.
