In this paper, we present two dependency
parser training methods appropriate for pars-
ing outputs of statistical machine transla-
tion (SMT), which pose problems to standard
parsers due to their frequent ungrammatical-
ity. We adapt the MST parser by exploiting
additional features from the source language,
and by introducing artificial grammatical er-
rors in the parser training data, so that the
training sentences resemble SMT output.
We evaluate the modified parser on DEP-
FIX, a system that improves English-Czech
SMT outputs using automatic rule-based cor-
rections of grammatical mistakes which re-
quires parsed SMT output sentences as its in-
put. Both parser modifications led to im-
provements in BLEU score; their combina-
tion was evaluated manually, showing a sta-
tistically significant improvement of the trans-
lation quality.
