 
This paper investigates the possibilities that 
cross-linguistic similarities and dissimilarities 
between related languages offer in terms of 
bootstrapping a morphological analyser. In 
this case an existing Zulu morphological ana-
lyser prototype (ZulMorph) serves as basis 
for a Xhosa analyser. The investigation is 
structured around the morphotactics and the 
morphophonological alternations of the lan-
guages involved. Special attention is given to 
the so-called ?open? class, which represents 
the word root lexicons for specifically nouns 
and verbs. The acquisition and coverage of 
these lexicons prove to be crucial for the suc-
cess of the analysers under development.  
The bootstrapped morphological analyser is 
applied to parallel test corpora and the results 
are discussed. A variety of cross-linguistic ef-
fects is illustrated with examples from the 
corpora. It is found that bootstrapping mor-
phological analysers for languages that ex-
hibit significant structural and lexical simi-
larities may be fruitfully exploited for devel-
oping analysers for lesser-resourced lan-
guages.
