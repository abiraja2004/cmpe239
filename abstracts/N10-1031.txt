This paper presents METEOR-NEXT, an ex-
tended version of the METEOR metric de-
signed to have high correlation with post-
editing measures of machine translation qual-
ity. We describe changes made to the met-
ric?s sentence aligner and scoring scheme as
well as a method for tuning the metric?s pa-
rameters to optimize correlation with human-
targeted Translation Edit Rate (HTER). We
then show that METEOR-NEXT improves cor-
relation with HTER over baseline metrics, in-
cluding earlier versions of METEOR, and ap-
proaches the correlation level of a state-of-the-
art metric, TER-plus (TERp).
