We present a sequential labeling approach
to hedge cue detection submitted to the bi-
ological portion of task 1 for the CoNLL-
2010 shared task. Our main approach is
as follows. We make use of partial syntac-
tic information together with features ob-
tained from the unlabeled corpus, and con-
vert the task into one of sequential BIO-
tagging. If a cue is found, a sentence is
classified as uncertain and certain other-
wise. To examine a large number of fea-
ture combinations, we employ a genetic al-
gorithm. While some features obtained by
this method are difficult to interpret, they
were shown to improve the performance of
the final system.
