The recent success of statistical pars-
ing methods has made treebanks become
important resources for building good
parsers. However, constructing high-
quality annotated treebanks is a challeng-
ing task. We utilized two publicly avail-
able parsers, Berkeley and MST parsers,
for feedback on improving the quality of
part-of-speech tagging for the Vietnamese
Treebank. Analysis of the treebank and
parsing errors revealed how problems with
the Vietnamese Treebank influenced the
parsing results and real difficulties of Viet-
namese parsing that required further im-
provements to existing parsing technolo-
gies.
