Motivated by psycholinguistic findings,
we are currently investigating the role of
eye gaze in spoken language understand-
ing for multimodal conversational sys-
tems. Our assumption is that, during hu-
man machine conversation, a user?s eye
gaze on the graphical display indicates
salient entities on which the user?s atten-
tion is focused. The specific domain infor-
mation about the salient entities is likely
to be the content of communication and
therefore can be used to constrain speech
hypotheses and help language understand-
ing. Based on this assumption, this paper
describes an exploratory study that incor-
porates eye gaze in salience modeling for
spoken language processing. Our empiri-
cal results show that eye gaze has a poten-
tial in improving automated language pro-
cessing. Eye gaze is subconscious and in-
voluntary during human machine conver-
sation. Our work motivates more in-depth
investigation on eye gaze in attention pre-
diction and its implication in automated
language processing.
