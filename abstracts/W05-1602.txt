We present an authoring system for logical forms
encoded as conceptual graphs (CG). The system
belongs to the family of WYSIWYM (What You
See Is What You Mean) text generation systems:
logical forms are entered interactively and the cor-
responding linguistic realization of the expressions
is generated in several languages. The system
maintains a model of the discourse context corre-
sponding to the authored documents.
The system helps users author documents formu-
lated in the CG format. In a first stage, a domain-
specific ontology is acquired by learning from ex-
ample texts in the domain. The ontology acquisi-
tion module builds a typed hierarchy of concepts
and relations derived from the WordNet and Verb-
net.
The user can then edit a specific document, by en-
tering utterances in sequence, and maintaining a
representation of the context. While the user en-
ters data, the system performs the standard steps
of text generation on the basis of the authored log-
ical forms: reference planning, aggregation, lexi-
cal choice and syntactic realization ? in several lan-
guages (we have implemented English and Hebrew
- and are exploring an implementation using the
Bliss graphical language). The feedback in natural
language is produced in real-time for every single
modification performed by the author.
We perform a cost-benefit analysis of the applica-
tion of NLG techniques in the context of authoring
cooking recipes in English and Hebrew. By com-
bining existing large-scale knowledge resources
(WordNet, Verbnet, the SURGE and HUGG real-
ization grammars) and techniques from modern in-
tegrated software development environment (such
as the Eclipse IDE), we obtain an efficient tool for
the generation of logical forms, in domains where
content is not available in the form of databases.
