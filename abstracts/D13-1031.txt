Nowadays supervised sequence labeling
models can reach competitive performance
on the task of Chinese word segmenta-
tion. However, the ability of these mod-
els is restricted by the availability of an-
notated data and the design of features.
We propose a scalable semi-supervised fea-
ture engineering approach. In contrast
to previous works using pre-defined task-
specific features with fixed values, we dy-
namically extract representations of label
distributions from both an in-domain cor-
pus and an out-of-domain corpus. We
update the representation values with a
semi-supervised approach. Experiments
on the benchmark datasets show that our
approach achieve good results and reach
an f-score of 0.961. The feature engineer-
ing approach proposed here is a general
iterative semi-supervised method and not
limited to the word segmentation task.
