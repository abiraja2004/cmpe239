 
In this paper, we demonstrate three NLP 
applications of the BioLexicon, which is a 
lexical resource tailored to the biology 
domain. The applications consist of a 
dictionary-based POS tagger, a syntactic 
parser, and query processing for biomedical 
information retrieval.  Biological 
terminology is a major barrier to the 
accurate processing of literature within 
biology domain. In order to address this 
problem, we have constructed the 
BioLexicon using both manual and semi-
automatic methods. We demonstrate the 
utility of the biology-oriented lexicon 
within three separate NLP applications.
