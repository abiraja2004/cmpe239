 
This paper describes the application of an 
ensemble of indexing and classification 
systems, which have been shown to be suc-
cessful in information retrieval and classi-
fication of medical literature, to a new task 
of assigning ICD-9-CM codes to the clini-
cal history and impression sections of radi-
ology reports. The basic methods used are: 
a modification of the NLM Medical Text 
Indexer system, SVM, k-NN and a simple 
pattern-matching method. The basic meth-
ods are combined using a variant of stack-
ing. Evaluated in the context of a Medical 
NLP Challenge, fusion produced an F-
score of 0.85 on the Challenge test set, 
which is considerably above the mean 
Challenge F-score of 0.77 for 44 participat-
ing groups.
