Models of word alignment built as sequences
of links have limited expressive power, but are
easy to decode. Word aligners that model the
alignment matrix can express arbitrary align-
ments, but are difficult to decode. We pro-
pose an alignment matrix model as a cor-
rection algorithm to an underlying sequence-
based aligner. Then a greedy decoding al-
gorithm enables the full expressive power of
the alignment matrix formulation. Improved
alignment performance is shown for all nine
language pairs tested. The improved align-
ments also improved translation quality from
Chinese to English and English to Italian.
