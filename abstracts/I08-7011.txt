The  purpose  of  this  study  was  to  provide  an 
example of how to build a Yami ontology from 
traditional  songs  by  employing  Prot?g?,  an 
open-source  tool for  editing  and  managing 
ontologies developed  by  Stanford  University. 
Following  Conceptual  Blending  Theory 
(Fauconnier  and Turner, 1998),  we found that 
Yami  people use the  conceptual  metaphor  of 
?fishing? in traditional songs when praising the 
host?s diligence  in  a ceremony  celebrating the 
completion  of  a  workhouse.  The  process  of 
building ontologies  is explored and illustrated. 
The  proposed construction of  an ontology for 
Yami  traditional  songs  can  serve  as  a 
fundamental  template,  using  the corpus 
available online from the Yami documentation 
website  (http://yamiproject.cs.pu.edu.tw/yami) 
to build ontologies for other domains.
