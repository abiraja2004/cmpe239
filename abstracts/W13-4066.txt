 
For robust spoken conversational interaction, 
many dialog state tracking algorithms have 
been developed. Few studies, however, have 
reported the strengths and weaknesses of each 
method. The Dialog State Tracking Challenge 
(DSTC) is designed to address this issue by 
comparing various methods on the same 
domain. In this paper, we present a set of 
techniques that build a robust dialog state 
tracker with high performance: wide-coverage 
and well-calibrated data selection, feature-rich 
discriminative model design, generalization 
improvement techniques and unsupervised 
prior adaptation. The DSTC results show that 
the proposed method is superior to other 
systems on average on both the development 
and test datasets.
