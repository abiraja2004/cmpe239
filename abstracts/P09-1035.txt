A number of approaches to Automatic
MT Evaluation based on deep linguistic
knowledge have been suggested. How-
ever, n-gram based metrics are still to-
day the dominant approach. The main
reason is that the advantages of employ-
ing deeper linguistic information have not
been clarified yet. In this work, we pro-
pose a novel approach for meta-evaluation
of MT evaluation metrics, since correla-
tion cofficient against human judges do
not reveal details about the advantages and
disadvantages of particular metrics. We
then use this approach to investigate the
benefits of introducing linguistic features
into evaluation metrics. Overall, our ex-
periments show that (i) both lexical and
linguistic metrics present complementary
advantages and (ii) combining both kinds
of metrics yields the most robust meta-
evaluation performance.
