 
The study on Automatic Recognizing 
usages of Modern Chinese Adverbs 
is one of the important parts of the 
NLP-oriented research of Chinese 
Functional words Knowledge Base. 
To solve the problems of the existing 
rule-based method of adverbs? usages 
recognition based on the previous 
work, this paper has studied auto-
matically recognizing common Chi-
nese adverbs? usages using statistical 
methods. Three statistical models, viz. 
CRF, ME, and SVM, are used to la-
bel several common Chinese ad-
verbs? usages on the segmentation 
and part-of-speech tagged corpus of 
People?s Daily(Jan 1998). The ex-
periment results show that statistical-
based method is effective in auto-
matically recognizing of several 
common adverbs? usages and has 
good application prospects.
