Speech style accommodation refers to
shifts in style that are used to achieve strate-
gic goals within interactions. Models of
stylistic shift that focus on specific fea-
tures are limited in terms of the contexts
to which they can be applied if the goal of
the analysis is to model socially motivated
speech style accommodation. In this pa-
per, we present an unsupervised Dynamic
Bayesian Model that allows us to model
stylistic style accommodation in a way that
is agnostic to which specific speech style
features will shift in a way that resem-
bles socially motivated stylistic variation.
This greatly expands the applicability of the
model across contexts. Our hypothesis is
that stylistic shifts that occur as a result of
social processes are likely to display some
consistency over time, and if we leverage
this insight in our model,we will achieve
a model that better captures inherent struc-
ture within speech.
