We present a method for learning bilingual
translation lexicons from monolingual cor-
pora. Word types in each language are charac-
terized by purely monolingual features, such
as context counts and orthographic substrings.
Translations are induced using a generative
model based on canonical correlation analy-
sis, which explains the monolingual lexicons
in terms of latent matchings. We show that
high-precision lexicons can be learned in a va-
riety of language pairs and from a range of
corpus types.
