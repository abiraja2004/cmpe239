 
For the Affective Text task at SemEval-
2007, University Paris 7?s system first 
evaluates emotion and valence on all words 
of a news headline (using enriched versions 
of SentiWordNet and a subset of WordNet-
Affect). We use a parser to find the head 
word, considering that it has a major im-
portance. We also detect contrasts (be-
tween positive and negative words) that 
shift valence. Our knowledge-based system 
achieves high accuracy on emotion and va-
lence annotation. These results show that 
working with linguistic techniques and a 
broad-coverage lexicon is a viable ap-
proach to sentiment analysis of headlines.
