This paper describes using RDF/RDFS/XML to cre-
ate and navigate a metadata model of relationships
among entities in text. The metadata we create
is roughly an order of magnitude smaller than the
content being modeled, it provides the end-user
with context sensitive information about the hyper-
linked entities in focus. These entities at the core
of the model are originally found and resolved us-
ing a combination of information extraction and
record linkage techniques. The RDF/RDFS meta-
data model is then used to ?look ahead? and navi-
gate to related information. An RDF aware front-
end web application streamlines the presentation of
information to the end user.
