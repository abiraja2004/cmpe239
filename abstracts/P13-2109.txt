We present fast, accurate, direct non-
projective dependency parsers with third-
order features. Our approach uses AD3,
an accelerated dual decomposition algo-
rithm which we extend to handle special-
ized head automata and sequential head
bigram models. Experiments in fourteen
languages yield parsing speeds competi-
tive to projective parsers, with state-of-
the-art accuracies for the largest datasets
(English, Czech, and German).
