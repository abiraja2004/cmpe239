 
We present a user requirements study for 
Question Answering on meeting records 
that assesses the difficulty of users ques-
tions in terms of what type of knowledge is 
required in order to provide the correct an-
swer. We grounded our work on the em-
pirical analysis of elicited user queries. We 
found that the majority of elicited queries 
(around 60%) pertain to argumentative 
processes and outcomes. Our analysis also 
suggests that standard keyword-based In-
formation Retrieval can only deal success-
fully with less than 20% of the queries, and 
that it must be complemented with other 
types of metadata and inference.
