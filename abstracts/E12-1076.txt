This paper introduces a novel generation
system that composes humanlike descrip-
tions of images from computer vision de-
tections. By leveraging syntactically in-
formed word co-occurrence statistics, the
generator filters and constrains the noisy
detections output from a vision system to
generate syntactic trees that detail what
the computer vision system sees. Results
show that the generation system outper-
forms state-of-the-art systems, automati-
cally generating some of the most natural
image descriptions to date.
