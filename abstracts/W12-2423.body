 
Gene name identification is a fundamental 
step to solve more complicated text mining 
problems such as gene normalization and pro-
tein-protein interactions. However, state-of-
the-art name identification methods are not 
yet sufficient for use in a fully automated sys-
tem. In this regard, a relaxed task, 
gene/protein sentence identification, may 
serve more effectively for manually searching 
and browsing biomedical literature. In this pa-
per, we set up a new task, gene/protein sen-
tence classification and propose an ensemble 
approach for addressing this problem. Well-
known named entity tools use similar gold-
standard sets for training and testing, which 
results in relatively poor performance for un-
known sets. We here explore how to combine 
diverse high-precision gene identifiers for 
more robust performance. The experimental 
results show that the proposed approach out-
performs BANNER as a stand-alone classifier 
for newly annotated sets as well as previous 
gold-standard sets.
