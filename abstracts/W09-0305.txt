 
This paper reports on completed work carried 
out in the framework of an EU-funded project 
aimed at (a) developing a bilingual collection 
of cultural texts in Greek and Bulgarian, (b) 
creating a number of accompanying resources 
that will facilitate study of the primary texts 
across languages, and (c) integrating a system 
which aims to provide web-enabled and 
speech-enhanced access to digitized bilingual 
Cultural Heritage resources. This simple user 
interface, which incorporates advanced search 
mechanisms, also offers innovative accessibil-
ity for visually impaired Greek and Bulgarian 
users. The rationale behind the work (and the 
relative resource) was to promote the com-
parative study of the cultural heritage of the 
two countries.
