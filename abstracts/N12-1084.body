We introduce the social study of bullying to
the NLP community. Bullying, in both physi-
cal and cyber worlds (the latter known as cy-
berbullying), has been recognized as a seri-
ous national health issue among adolescents.
However, previous social studies of bully-
ing are handicapped by data scarcity, while
the few computational studies narrowly re-
strict themselves to cyberbullying which ac-
counts for only a small fraction of all bullying
episodes. Our main contribution is to present
evidence that social media, with appropriate
natural language processing techniques, can
be a valuable and abundant data source for the
study of bullying in both worlds. We iden-
tify several key problems in using such data
sources and formulate them as NLP tasks, in-
cluding text classification, role labeling, senti-
ment analysis, and topic modeling. Since this
is an introductory paper, we present baseline
results on these tasks using off-the-shelf NLP
solutions, and encourage the NLP community
to contribute better models in the future.
