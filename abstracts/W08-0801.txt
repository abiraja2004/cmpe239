We describe a multimodal dialogue system for
interacting with a home entertainment center
via a mobile device. In our working proto-
type, users may utilize both a graphical and
speech user interface to search TV listings,
record and play television programs, and listen
to music. The developed framework is quite
generic, potentially supporting a wide variety
of applications, as we demonstrate by integrat-
ing a weather forecast application. In the pro-
totype, the mobile device serves as the locus
of interaction, providing both a small touch-
screen display, and speech input and output;
while the TV screen features a larger, richer
GUI. The system architecture is agnostic to
the location of the natural language process-
ing components: a consistent user experience
is maintained regardless of whether they run
on a remote server or on the device itself.
