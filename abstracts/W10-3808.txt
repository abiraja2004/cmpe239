 
Morphological analysis and disambigua-
tion are crucial stages in a variety of nat-
ural language processing applications 
such as machine translation, especially 
when languages with complex morphol-
ogy are concerned such as Arabic. Arab-
ic is a highly flexional language, in that, 
the same root can lead to various forms 
according to its context. In this paper, we 
present a system which disambiguates 
the output of a morphological analyzer 
for Arabic. The Arabic morphological 
analyzer used consists of a set of all 
possible morphological analyses for each 
word, with the unique correct syntactic 
feature. We want to choose the correct 
features using the features generated by 
the morphological analyzer for the 
French language in the other side. To ob-
tain this data, we used the results of the 
alignment of word trained with GIZA++ 
(Och and Ney, 2003).
