One of the main goals of this paper is
to describe a formal procedure linking
inflectional and derivational processes
in Czech and to indicate that they can
be, if appropriate tools and resources
are used, applied to other Slavonic lan-
guages. The tools developed at the NLP
Laboratory FI MU, have been used,
particularly the morphological analyser
ajka and the program I par for pro-
cessing and maintaining the morpholog-
ical database.
