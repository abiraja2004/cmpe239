This paper compares a range of methods
for classifying words based on linguis-
tic diagnostics, focusing on the task of
learning countabilities for English nouns.
We propose two basic approaches to
feature representation: distribution-based
representation, which simply looks at
the distribution of features in the cor-
pus data, and agreement-based represen-
tation which analyses the level of token-
wise agreement between multiple pre-
processor systems. We additionally com-
pare a single multiclass classifier archi-
tecture with a suite of binary classifiers,
and combine analyses from multiple pre-
processors. Finally, we present and evalu-
ate a feature selection method.
