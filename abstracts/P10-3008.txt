The emergence of social media brings
chances, but also challenges, to linguis-
tic analysis. In this paper we investigate
a novel problem of discovering patterns
based on emotion and the association of
moods and affective lexicon usage in bl-
ogosphere, a representative for social me-
dia. We propose the use of normative emo-
tional scores for English words in combi-
nation with a psychological model of emo-
tion measurement and a nonparametric
clustering process for inferring meaning-
ful emotion patterns automatically from
data. Our results on a dataset consisting of
more than 17 million mood-groundtruthed
blogposts have shown interesting evidence
of the emotion patterns automatically dis-
covered that match well with the core-
affect emotion model theorized by psy-
chologists. We then present a method
based on information theory to discover
the association of moods and affective lex-
icon usage in the new media.
