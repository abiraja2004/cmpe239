We present a method for learning syntax-
semantics mappings for verbs from unanno-
tated corpora. We learn linkings, i.e., map-
pings from the syntactic arguments and ad-
juncts of a verb to its semantic roles. By learn-
ing such linkings, we do not need to model in-
dividual semantic roles independently of one
another, and we can exploit the relation be-
tween different mappings for the same verb,
or between mappings for different verbs. We
present an evaluation on a standard test set for
semantic role labeling.
