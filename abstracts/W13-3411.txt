We present an open-source virtual ma-
nipulative for conditional log-linear mod-
els. This web-based interactive visual-
ization lets the user tune the probabili-
ties of various shapes?which grow and
shrink accordingly?by dragging sliders
that correspond to feature weights. The
visualization displays a regularized train-
ing objective; it supports gradient as-
cent by optionally displaying gradients
on the sliders and providing ?Step? and
?Solve? buttons. The user can sam-
ple parameters and datasets of differ-
ent sizes and compare their own pa-
rameters to the truth. Our web-
site, http://cs.jhu.edu/?jason/
tutorials/loglin/, guides the user
through a series of interactive lessons and
provides auxiliary readings, explanations,
practice problems and resources.
