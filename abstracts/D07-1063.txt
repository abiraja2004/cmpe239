We propose a novel method for Japanese de-
pendency analysis, which is usually reduced
to the construction of a dependency tree. In
deterministic approaches to this task, depen-
dency trees are constructed by series of ac-
tions of attaching a bunsetsu chunk to one of
the nodes in the tree being constructed. Con-
ventional techniques select the node based
on whether the new bunsetsu chunk and each
node in the trees are in a parent-child rela-
tion or not. However, tree structures include
relations between two nodes other than the
parent-child relation. Therefore, we use
ancestor-descendant relations in addition to
parent-child relations, so that the added re-
dundancy helps errors be corrected. Ex-
perimental results show that the proposed
method achieves higher accuracy.
