Situation entities (SEs) are the events, states,
generic statements, and embedded facts and
propositions introduced to a discourse by
clauses of text. We report on the first data-
driven models for labeling clauses according
to the type of SE they introduce. SE classifi-
cation is important for discourse mode iden-
tification and for tracking the temporal pro-
gression of a discourse. We show that (a)
linguistically-motivated cooccurrence fea-
tures and grammatical relation information
from deep syntactic analysis improve clas-
sification accuracy and (b) using a sequenc-
ing model provides improvements over as-
signing labels based on the utterance alone.
We report on genre effects which support the
analysis of discourse modes having charac-
teristic distributions and sequences of SEs.
