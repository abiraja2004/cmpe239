Opinion Question Answering (Opinion
QA), which aims to find the authors? sen-
timental opinions on a specific target, is
more challenging than traditional fact-
based question answering problems. To
extract the opinion oriented answers, we
need to consider both topic relevance and
opinion sentiment issues. Current solu-
tions to this problem are mostly ad-hoc
combinations of question topic informa-
tion and opinion information. In this pa-
per, we propose an Opinion PageRank
model and an Opinion HITS model to fully
explore the information from different re-
lations among questions and answers, an-
swers and answers, and topics and opin-
ions. By fully exploiting these relations,
the experiment results show that our pro-
posed algorithms outperform several state
of the art baselines on benchmark data set.
A gain of over 10% in F scores is achieved
as compared to many other systems.
