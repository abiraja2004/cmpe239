We describe an LR parser of parts-of-
speech (and punctuation labels) for Tree
Adjoining Grammars (TAGs), that solves
table conflicts in a greedy way, with lim-
ited amount of backtracking. We evaluate
the parser using the Penn Treebank show-
ing that the method yield very fast parsers
with at least reasonable accuracy, confirm-
ing the intuition that LR parsing benefits
from the use of rich grammars.
