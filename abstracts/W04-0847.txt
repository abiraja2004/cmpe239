This article describes the implementation of I2R
word sense disambiguation system (I2R ?WSD)
that participated in one senseval3 task: Chinese lex-
ical sample task. Our core algorithm is a supervised
Naive Bayes classifier. This classifier utilizes an op-
timal feature set, which is determined by maximiz-
ing the cross validated accuracy of NB classifier on
training data. The optimal feature set includes part-
of-speech with position information in local con-
text, and bag of words in topical context.
