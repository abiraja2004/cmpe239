Mikrokosmos contains an ontology plus a number
of lexicons in different languages that were origi-
nally developed for machine translation. The under-
lying representation formalism for these resources
is an ad-hoc frame-based language which makes it
difficult to inter-operate Mikrokosmos with state-of-
the-art knowledge-based systems.
In this paper we propose a translation from the
frame-based representation of Mikrokosmos into
Description logics. This translation allows us to
automatically transform Mikrokosmos sources into
OWL and thus provide a powerful ontology in the
formalism of the semantic web. Furthermore, the
reasoning mechanisms of Description Logics may
also support knowledge acquisition and mainte-
nance as well as its application in natural language
processing systems.
