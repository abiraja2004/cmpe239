We describe an effective constituent pro-
jection strategy, where constituent pro-
jection is performed on the basis of de-
pendency projection. Especially, a novel
measurement is proposed to evaluate the
candidate projected constituents for a tar-
get language sentence, and a PCFG-style
parsing procedure is then used to search
for the most probable projected con-
stituent tree. Experiments show that, the
parser trained on the projected treebank
can significantly boost a state-of-the-art
supervised parser. When integrated into a
tree-based machine translation system, the
projected parser leads to translation per-
formance comparable with using a super-
vised parser trained on thousands of anno-
tated trees.
