 
To participate in the Protein Coreference section of the BioNLP 2011 Shared Task, we use Reconcile, a coreference resolution engine, by replacing some pre-processing components and adding a new mention detector. We got some improvement from training two separate classifiers for detecting anaphora and antecedent mentions. Our system yielded the highest score in the task, F-score 34.05% in partial mention, protein links, and system recall mode. We witnessed that specialized mention detection is crucial for coreference resolution in the biomedical domain.
