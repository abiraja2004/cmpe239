This paper presents the coreference resolution
system Poly-co submitted to the closed track
of the CoNLL-2011 Shared Task. Our sys-
tem integrates a multilayer perceptron classi-
fier in a pipeline approach. We describe the
heuristic used to select the pairs of corefer-
ence candidates that are feeded to the network
for training, and our feature selection method.
The features used in our approach are based on
similarity and identity measures, filtering in-
formations, like gender and number, and other
syntactic information.
