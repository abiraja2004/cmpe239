This paper proposes a simple framework
for building ?virtual networking agents?;
programs that can communicate with users
and collect information through the inter-
net. These virtual agents can also commu-
nicate with each other to share information
that one agent does not have. The frame-
work - ?YouBot? - provides basic functions
such as protocol handling, authentication,
and data storage. The behavior of the vir-
tual agents is defined by a task proces-
sor (?TP?) which can be written in a light-
weight language such as JavaScript. It is
very easy to add new functions to a virtual
agent. The last part of this paper discusses
the micro-blog system ?twitter? and other
web services as information sources that a
virtual agent can utilise to make its behav-
ior more suited to the user.
