We describe the semantic enrichment of journal
articles with chemical structures and biomedi-
cal ontology terms using Oscar, a program for
chemical named entity recognition (NER). We
describe how Oscar works and how it can been
adapted for general NER. We discuss its imple-
mentation in a real publishing workflow and pos-
sible applications for enriched articles.
