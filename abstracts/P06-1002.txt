This paper presents an extensive evalua-
tion of five different alignments and in-
vestigates their impact on the correspond-
ing MT system output. We introduce
new measures for intrinsic evaluations and
examine the distribution of phrases and
untranslated words during decoding to
identify which characteristics of different
alignments affect translation. We show
that precision-oriented alignments yield
better MT output (translating more words
and using longer phrases) than recall-
oriented alignments.
