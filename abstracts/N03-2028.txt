We investigate the optimal LM treatment of
abundant filled pauses (FP) in spontaneous
monologues of a professional dictation task.
Questions addressed here are (1) how to deal
with FP in the LM history and (2) to which ex-
tent can the LM distinguish between positions
with high and low FP likelihood. Our results
differ partly from observations reported on di-
alogues. Discarding FP from all LM histories
clearly improves the performance. Local per-
plexities, entropies and word rankings at po-
sitions following FP suggest that most FP in-
dicate hesitations rather than restarts. Proper
prediction of FP allows to distinguish FP from
word positions by a doubled FP probability.
Recognition experiments confirm the improve-
ments found in our perplexity studies.
