We present an implicit discourse relation
classifier in the Penn Discourse Treebank
(PDTB). Our classifier considers the con-
text of the two arguments, word pair infor-
mation, as well as the arguments? internal
constituent and dependency parses. Our
results on the PDTB yields a significant
14.1% improvement over the baseline. In
our error analysis, we discuss four chal-
lenges in recognizing implicit relations in
the PDTB.
