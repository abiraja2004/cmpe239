Many named entities contain other named
entities inside them. Despite this fact, the
field of named entity recognition has al-
most entirely ignored nested named en-
tity recognition, but due to technological,
rather than ideological reasons. In this pa-
per, we present a new technique for rec-
ognizing nested named entities, by using
a discriminative constituency parser. To
train the model, we transform each sen-
tence into a tree, with constituents for each
named entity (and no other syntactic struc-
ture). We present results on both news-
paper and biomedical corpora which con-
tain nested named entities. In three out
of four sets of experiments, our model
outperforms a standard semi-CRF on the
more traditional top-level entities. At the
same time, we improve the overall F-score
by up to 30% over the flat model, which is
unable to recover any nested entities.
