 
In this article we present a method for combining different information retrieval models in order to increase the retrieval performance 
in a Speech Information Retrieval task. The formulas for combining the models are tuned on training data. Then the system is evaluated 
on test data. The task is particularly difficult because the text collection is automatically transcribed spontaneous speech, with many 
recognition errors. Also, the topics are real information needs, difficult to satisfy. Information Retrieval systems are not able to obtain 
good results on this data set, except for the case when manual summaries are included.
