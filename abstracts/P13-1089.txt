Given that structured output prediction is
typically performed over entire datasets,
one natural question is whether it is pos-
sible to re-use computation from earlier
inference instances to speed up inference
for future instances. Amortized inference
has been proposed as a way to accomplish
this. In this paper, first, we introduce a new
amortized inference algorithm called the
Margin-based Amortized Inference, which
uses the notion of structured margin to
identify inference problems for which pre-
vious solutions are provably optimal. Sec-
ond, we introduce decomposed amortized
inference, which is designed to address
very large inference problems, where ear-
lier amortization methods become less ef-
fective. This approach works by decom-
posing the output structure and applying
amortization piece-wise, thus increasing
the chance that we can re-use previous so-
lutions for parts of the output structure.
These parts are then combined to a global
coherent solution using Lagrangian relax-
ation. In our experiments, using the NLP
tasks of semantic role labeling and entity-
relation extraction, we demonstrate that
with the margin-based algorithm, we need
to call the inference engine only for a third
of the test examples. Further, we show that
the decomposed variant of margin-based
amortized inference achieves a greater re-
duction in the number of inference calls.
