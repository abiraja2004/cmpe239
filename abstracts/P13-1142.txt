We present BRAINSUP, an extensible
framework for the generation of creative
sentences in which users are able to
force several words to appear in the sen-
tences and to control the generation pro-
cess across several semantic dimensions,
namely emotions, colors, domain related-
ness and phonetic properties. We evalu-
ate its performance on a creative sentence
generation task, showing its capability of
generating well-formed, catchy and effec-
tive sentences that have all the good qual-
ities of slogans produced by human copy-
writers.
