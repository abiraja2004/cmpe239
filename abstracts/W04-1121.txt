 
Large amounts of bilingual resource on the Internet 
provide us with the probability of building a large 
scale of bilingual corpus. The irregular characteris-
tics of the real texts, especially without the strictly 
aligned paragraph boundaries, bring a challenge to 
alignment technology. The traditional alignment 
methods have some difficulties in competency for 
doing this. This paper describes a new method for 
aligning real bilingual texts using sentence pair 
location information. The model was motivated by 
the observation that the location of a sentence pair 
with certain length is distributed in the whole text 
similarly. It uses (1:1) sentence beads instead of 
high frequency words as the candidate anchors. 
The method was developed and evaluated through 
many different test data. The results show that it 
can achieve good aligned performance and be ro-
bust and language independent. It can resolve the 
alignment problem on real bilingual text.
