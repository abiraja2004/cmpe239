We discuss text summarization in terms of
maximum coverage problem and its vari-
ant. We explore some decoding algorithms
including the ones never used in this sum-
marization formulation, such as a greedy
algorithm with performance guarantee, a
randomized algorithm, and a branch-and-
bound method. On the basis of the results
of comparative experiments, we also aug-
ment the summarization model so that it
takes into account the relevance to the doc-
ument cluster. Through experiments, we
showed that the augmented model is su-
perior to the best-performing method of
DUC?04 on ROUGE-1 without stopwords.
