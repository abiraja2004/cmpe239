This paper describes a system for syntactic-
semantic dependency parsing for multiple lan-
guages. The system consists of three parts: a
state-of-the-art higher-order projective depen-
dency parser for syntactic dependency pars-
ing, a predicate classifier, and an argument
classifier for semantic dependency parsing.
For semantic dependency parsing, we ex-
plore use of global features. All components
are trained with an approximate max-margin
learning algorithm.
In the closed challenge of the CoNLL-2009
Shared Task (Hajic? et al, 2009), our system
achieved the 3rd best performances for En-
glish and Czech, and the 4th best performance
for Japanese.
