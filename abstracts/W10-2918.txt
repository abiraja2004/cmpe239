This paper presents a comparative study
of three closely related Bayesian mod-
els for unsupervised document level senti-
ment classification, namely, the latent sen-
timent model (LSM), the joint sentiment-
topic (JST) model, and the Reverse-JST
model. Extensive experiments have been
conducted on two corpora, the movie re-
view dataset and the multi-domain senti-
ment dataset. It has been found that while
all the three models achieve either bet-
ter or comparable performance on these
two corpora when compared to the exist-
ing unsupervised sentiment classification
approaches, both JST and Reverse-JST are
able to extract sentiment-oriented topics.
In addition, Reverse-JST always performs
worse than JST suggesting that the JST
model is more appropriate for joint senti-
ment topic detection.
