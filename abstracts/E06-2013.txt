We describe a system for automatic an-
notation of English text in the FrameNet
standard. In addition to the conventional
annotation of frame elements and their se-
mantic roles, we annotate additional se-
mantic information such as support verbs
and prepositions, aspectual markers, cop-
ular verbs, null arguments, and slot fillers.
As far as we are aware, this is the first sys-
tem that finds this information automati-
cally.
