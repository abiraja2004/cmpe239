Text generation requires a planning mod-
ule to select an object of discourse and its
properties. This is specially hard in de-
scriptive games, where a computer agent
tries to describe some aspects of a game
world. We propose to formalize this prob-
lem as a Markov Decision Process, in
which an optimal message policy can be
defined and learned through simulation.
Furthermore, we propose back-off poli-
cies as a novel and effective technique to
fight state dimensionality explosion in this
framework.
