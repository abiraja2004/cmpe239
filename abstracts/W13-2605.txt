Reading experiments using naturalistic
stimuli have shown unanticipated facili-
tations for completing center embeddings
when frequency effects are factored out.
To eliminate possible confounds due to
surface structure, this paper introduces a
processing model based on deep syntac-
tic dependencies. Results on eye-tracking
data indicate that completing deep syntac-
tic embeddings yields significantly more
facilitation than completing surface em-
beddings.
