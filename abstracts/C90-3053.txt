 
This paper deals with the automatic translatiou of prepositions, 
which are highly polysemous. Moreover, the same real situation 
is o f ten  expressed  by d i f fe rent  prepos i t ions  in d i f fe rent  
languages. We proceed f rom the hypothesis that di f ferent usage 
patterns are due to di f ferent conceptualizations of the same real 
s i tuat ion .  Fo l low ing  cogn i t ive  pr inc ip les  o f  spat ia l  
conceptual izat ion, we design, a semantic interpretation process 
for spatial relations in which our translation system uses 
semantic features derived from a semantic sort hierarchy. Thus 
we can  d i f fe rent ia te  subt le  d i s t inc t ions  between spat ia l l y  
s ignif icant configurations.
