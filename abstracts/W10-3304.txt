We describe a method for the identifica-
tion of medical term variations using par-
allel corpora and measures of distribu-
tional similarity. Our approach is based
on automatic word alignment and stan-
dard phrase extraction techniques com-
monly used in statistical machine transla-
tion. Combined with pattern-based filters
we obtain encouraging results compared
to related approaches using similar data-
driven techniques.
