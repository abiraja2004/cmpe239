Machine-produced text often lacks grammat-
icality and fluency. This paper studies gram-
maticality improvement using a syntax-based
algorithm based on CCG. The goal of the
search problem is to find an optimal parse tree
among all that can be constructed through se-
lection and ordering of the input words. The
search problem, which is significantly harder
than parsing, is solved by guided learning for
best-first search. In a standard word order-
ing task, our system gives a BLEU score of
40.1, higher than the previous result of 33.7
achieved by a dependency-based system.
