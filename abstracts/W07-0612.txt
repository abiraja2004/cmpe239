The ability to correctly interpret and pro-
duce noun-noun compounds such as WIND
FARM or CARBON TAX is an important part
of the acquisition of language in various do-
mains of discourse. One approach to the
interpretation of noun-noun compounds as-
sumes that people make use of distributional
information about how the constituent words
of compounds tend to combine; another as-
sumes that people make use of information
about the two constituent concepts? features
to produce interpretations. We present an ex-
periment that examines how people acquire
both the distributional information and con-
ceptual information relevant to compound
interpretation. A plausible model of the in-
terpretation process is also presented.
