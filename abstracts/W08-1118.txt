This paper describes an evaluation study of
an ontology-driven WYSIWYM interface for
metadata creation. Although the results are
encouraging, they are not as positive as those
of a similar tool developed for the medical
domain. We believe this may be due, not to
the WYSIWYM interface, but to the complex-
ity of the underlying ontologies and the fact
that subjects were unfamiliar with them. We
discuss the ways in which ontology develop-
ment might be influenced by issues stemming
from using an NLG approach for user access
to data, and the effect these factors have on
general usability.
