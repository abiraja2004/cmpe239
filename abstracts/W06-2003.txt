 
We introduce the problem of explicit 
modeling of form relationships between 
words in different languages, focusing 
here on languages having an alphabetic 
writing system and affixal morphology. 
We present an algorithm that learns the 
cross-language correspondence between 
affixes and letter sequences. The algo-
rithm does not assume prior knowledge 
of affixes in any of the languages, using 
only a simple single letter correspon-
dence as seed. Results are given for the 
English-Spanish language pair.
