We derive a spectral algorithm for learn-
ing the parameters of a refinement HMM.
This method is simple, efficient, and can
be applied to a wide range of supervised
sequence labeling tasks. Like other spec-
tral methods, it avoids the problem of lo-
cal optima and provides a consistent esti-
mate of the parameters. Our experiments
on a phoneme recognition task show that
when equipped with informative feature
functions, it performs significantly better
than a supervised HMM and competitively
with EM.
