RWTH participated in the shared transla-
tion task of the Fourth Workshop of Sta-
tistical Machine Translation (WMT 2009)
with the German-English, French-English
and Spanish-English pair in each transla-
tion direction. The submissions were gen-
erated using a phrase-based and a hierar-
chical statistical machine translation sys-
tems with appropriate morpho-syntactic
enhancements. POS-based reorderings of
the source language for the phrase-based
systems and splitting of German com-
pounds for both systems were applied. For
some tasks, a system combination was
used to generate a final hypothesis. An ad-
ditional English hypothesis was produced
by combining all three final systems for
translation into English.
