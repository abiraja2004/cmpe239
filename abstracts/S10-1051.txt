This paper addresses the problem of rank-
ing a list of paraphrases associated with a
noun-noun compound as closely as possi-
ble to human raters (Butnariu et al, 2010).
UCD-Goggle tackles this task using se-
mantic knowledge learnt from the Google
n-grams together with human-preferences
for paraphrases mined from training data.
Empirical evaluation shows that UCD-
Goggle achieves 0.432 Spearman correla-
tion with human judgments.
