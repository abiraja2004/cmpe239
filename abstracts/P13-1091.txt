Hyperedge replacement grammar (HRG)
is a formalism for generating and trans-
forming graphs that has potential appli-
cations in natural language understand-
ing and generation. A recognition al-
gorithm due to Lautemann is known to
be polynomial-time for graphs that are
connected and of bounded degree. We
present a more precise characterization of
the algorithm?s complexity, an optimiza-
tion analogous to binarization of context-
free grammars, and some important im-
plementation details, resulting in an algo-
rithm that is practical for natural-language
applications. The algorithm is part of Boli-
nas, a new software toolkit for HRG pro-
cessing.
