Discourse references, notably coreference
and bridging, play an important role in
many text understanding applications, but
their impact on textual entailment is yet to
be systematically understood. On the ba-
sis of an in-depth analysis of entailment
instances, we argue that discourse refer-
ences have the potential of substantially
improving textual entailment recognition,
and identify a number of research direc-
tions towards this goal.
