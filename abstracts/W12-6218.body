This work complements a parallel paper of
a new finite-state dependency parser archi-
tecture (Yli-Jyra?, 2012) by a proposal for
a linguistically elaborated morphology-syntax
interface and its finite-state implementation.
The proposed interface extends Gaifman?s
(1965) classical dependency rule formalism
by separating lexical word forms and morpho-
logical categories from syntactic categories.
The separation lets the linguist take advantage
of the morphological features in order to re-
duce the number of dependency rules and to
make them lexically selective. In addition,
the relative functional specificity of parse trees
gives rise to a measure of parse quality. By fil-
tering worse parses out from the parse forest
using finite-state techniques, the best parses
are saved. Finally, we present a synthesis of
strict grammar parsing and robust text pars-
ing by connecting fragmental parses into trees
with additional linear successor links.
