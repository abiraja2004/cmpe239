In this paper, we present an efficient query
selection algorithm for the retrieval of web
text data to augment a statistical language
model (LM). The number of retrieved rel-
evant documents is optimized with respect
to the number of queries submitted.
The querying scheme is applied in the do-
main of SMS text messages. Continuous
speech recognition experiments are con-
ducted on three languages: English, Span-
ish, and French. The web data is utilized
for augmenting in-domain LMs in general
and for adapting the LMs to a user-specific
vocabulary. Word error rate reductions
of up to 6.6 % (in LM augmentation) and
26.0 % (in LM adaptation) are obtained in
setups, where the size of the web mixture
LM is limited to the size of the baseline
in-domain LM.
