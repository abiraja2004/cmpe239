system that aligns English-Hindi texts 
at the sentence and word level in 
parallel corpora. We describe a simple 
sentence length approach to sentence 
alignment and a hybrid, multi-feature 
approach to perform word alignment. 
We use regression techniques in order 
to learn parameters which characterise 
the relationship between the lengths of 
two sentences in parallel text.  We use 
a multi-feature approach with 
dictionary lookup as a primary 
technique and other methods such as 
local word grouping, transliteration 
similarity (edit-distance) and a nearest 
aligned neighbours approach to deal 
with many-to-many word alignment.  
Our experiments are based on the 
EMILLE (Enabling Minority Language 
Engineering) corpus.  We obtained 
99.09% accuracy for many-to-many 
sentence alignment and 77% precision 
and 67.79% recall for many-to-many 
word alignment.
