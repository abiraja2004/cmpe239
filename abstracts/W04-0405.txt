 
We report that a proper employment of MWEs 
concerned enables us to put forth a tractable 
framework, which is based on a multiple 
nesting of semantic operations, for the 
processing of non-inferential, Non-
propositional Contents (NPCs) of natural 
Japanese sentences. Our framework is 
characterized by its broad syntactic and 
semantic coverage, enabling us to deal with 
multiply composite modalities and their 
semantic/pragmatic similarity. Also, the 
relationship between indirect (Searle, 1975) 
and direct speech, and equations peculiar to 
modal logic and its family (Mally, 1926; Prior, 
1967) are treated in the similarity paradigm.
