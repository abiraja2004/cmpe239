To generate natural language feedback for an
intelligent tutoring system, we developed a
simple planning model with a distinguishing
feature: its plan operators are derived auto-
matically, on the basis of the association rules
mined from our tutorial dialog corpus. Auto-
matically mined rules are also used for real-
ization. We evaluated 5 different versions of
a system that tutors on an abstract sequence
learning task. The version that uses our plan-
ning framework is significantly more effective
than the other four versions. We compared this
version to the human tutors we employed in
our tutorial dialogs, with intriguing results.
