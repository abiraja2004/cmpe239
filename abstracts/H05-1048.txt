In this paper, we describe an integrated
approach to entity mention detection that
yields a monolithic, almost language in-
dependent system. It is optimal in the
sense that all categorical constraints are si-
multaneously considered. The system is
compact and easy to develop and main-
tain, since only a single set of features and
classifiers are needed to be designed and
optimized. It is implemented using one-
versus-all support vector machine (SVM)
classifiers and a number of feature extrac-
tors at several linguistic levels. SVMs
are well known for their ability to han-
dle a large set of overlapping features with
theoretically sound generalization proper-
ties. Data sparsity might be an impor-
tant issue as a result of a large number
of classes and relatively moderate train-
ing data size. However, we report re-
sults that the integrated system performs
as good as a pipelined system that decom-
poses the problem into a few smaller sub-
tasks. We conduct all our experiments us-
ing ACE 2004 data, evaluate the systems
using ACE metrics and report competitive
performance.
