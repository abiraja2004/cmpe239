We present a method for unsupervised
topic modelling which adapts methods
used in document classification (Blei et
al., 2003; Griffiths and Steyvers, 2004) to
unsegmented multi-party discourse tran-
scripts. We show how Bayesian infer-
ence in this generative model can be
used to simultaneously address the prob-
lems of topic segmentation and topic
identification: automatically segmenting
multi-party meetings into topically co-
herent segments with performance which
compares well with previous unsuper-
vised segmentation-only methods (Galley
et al, 2003) while simultaneously extract-
ing topics which rate highly when assessed
for coherence by human judges. We also
show that this method appears robust in
the face of off-topic dialogue and speech
recognition errors.
