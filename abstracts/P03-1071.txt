We present a domain-independent topic
segmentation algorithm for multi-party
speech. Our feature-based algorithm com-
bines knowledge about content using a
text-based algorithm as a feature and
about form using linguistic and acous-
tic cues about topic shifts extracted from
speech. This segmentation algorithm uses
automatically induced decision rules to
combine the different features. The em-
bedded text-based algorithm builds on lex-
ical cohesion and has performance compa-
rable to state-of-the-art algorithms based
on lexical information. A significant er-
ror reduction is obtained by combining the
two knowledge sources.
