 
Tree-based statistical machine translation 
models have made significant progress in re-
cent years, especially when replacing 1-best 
trees with packed forests. However, as the 
parsing accuracy usually goes down dramati-
cally with the increase of sentence length, 
translating long sentences often takes long 
time and only produces degenerate transla-
tions. We propose a new method named sub-
sentence division that reduces the decoding 
time and improves the translation quality for 
tree-based translation. Our approach divides 
long sentences into several sub-sentences by 
exploiting tree structures. Large-scale ex-
periments on the NIST 2008 Chinese-to-
English test set show that our approach 
achieves an absolute improvement of 1.1 
BLEU points over the baseline system in 
50% less time.
