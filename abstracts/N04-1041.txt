 
Systems that automatically discover semantic 
classes have emerged in part to address the 
limitations of broad-coverage lexical re-
sources such as WordNet and Cyc. The cur-
rent state of the art discovers many semantic 
classes but fails to label their concepts. We 
propose an algorithm labeling semantic 
classes and for leveraging them to extract is-a 
relationships using a top-down approach.
