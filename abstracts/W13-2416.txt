In this paper we present a semi-automatic
approach for acqusition of lexico-syntactic
knowledge for event extraction in two
Slavic languages, namely Bulgarian and
Czech. The method uses several weakly-
supervised and unsupervised algorithms,
based on distributional semantics. More-
over, an intervention from a language ex-
pert is envisaged on different steps in the
learning procedure, which increases its ac-
curacy, with respect to unsupervised meth-
ods for lexical and grammar learning.
