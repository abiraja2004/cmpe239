 
In this paper we present an overview of 
recent developments in discourse the-
ory and parsing under the Linguistic 
Discourse Model (LDM) framework, a 
semantic theory of discourse structure. 
We give a novel approach to the prob-
lem of discourse segmentation based 
on discourse semantics and sketch a 
limited but robust approach to sym-
bolic discourse parsing based on syn-
tactic, semantic and lexical rules. To 
demonstrate the utility of the system in 
a real application, we briefly describe 
the architecture of the PALSUMM sys-
tem, a symbolic summarization system 
being developed at FX Palo Alto Labo-
ratory that uses discourse structures 
constructed using the theory outlined 
to summarize written English prose 
texts. 1
