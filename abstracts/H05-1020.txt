 
We approached the problem as learning 
how to order documents by estimated 
relevance with respect to a user query. Our 
support vector machines based classifier 
learns from the relevance judgments 
available with the standard test collections 
and generalizes to new, previously unseen 
queries.  For this, we have designed a 
representation scheme, which is based on 
the  discrete representation of the local (lw) 
and global (gw) weighting functions, thus 
is capable of reproducing and enhancing 
the properties of such popular ranking 
functions as tf.idf, BM25 or those based on 
language models. Our tests with the 
standard test collections have demonstrated 
the capability of our approach to achieve 
the performance of the best known scoring 
functions solely from the labeled examples 
and without taking advantage of knowing 
those functions or their important 
properties or parameters.
