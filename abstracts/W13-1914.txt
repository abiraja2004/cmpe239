Child language narratives are used for lan-
guage analysis, measurement of language
development, and the detection of lan-
guage impairment. In this paper, we ex-
plore the use of Latent Dirichlet Alloca-
tion (LDA) for detecting topics from nar-
ratives, and use the topics derived from
LDA in two classification tasks: automatic
prediction of coherence and language im-
pairment. Our experiments show LDA is
useful for detecting the topics that corre-
spond to the narrative structure. We also
observed improved performance for the
automatic prediction of coherence and lan-
guage impairment when we use features
derived from the topic words provided by
LDA.
