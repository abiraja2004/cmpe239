This paper describes the NRC submission to
the Spanish Cross-Lingual Word Sense Dis-
ambiguation task at SemEval-2013. Since this
word sense disambiguation task uses Spanish
translations of English words as gold annota-
tion, it can be cast as a machine translation
problem. We therefore submitted the output of
a standard phrase-based system as a baseline,
and investigated ways to improve its sense dis-
ambiguation performance. Using only local
context information and no linguistic analy-
sis beyond lemmatization, our machine trans-
lation system surprisingly yields top precision
score based on the best predictions. However,
its top 5 predictions are weaker than those
from other systems.
