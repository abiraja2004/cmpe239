One of the most notable recent improve-
ments of the TectoMT English-to-Czech trans-
lation is a systematic and theoretically sup-
ported revision of formemes?the annotation
of morpho-syntactic features of content words
in deep dependency syntactic structures based
on the Prague tectogrammatics theory. Our
modifications aim at reducing data sparsity,
increasing consistency across languages and
widening the usage area of this markup.
Formemes can be used not only in MT, but in
various other NLP tasks.
