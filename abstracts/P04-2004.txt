This paper describes several ongoing
projects that are united by the theme of
changes in lexical use over time. We
show that paying attention to a docu-
ment?s temporal context can lead to im-
provements in information retrieval and
text categorization. We also explore a
potential application in document clus-
tering that is based upon different types
of lexical changes.
