 
Entity relation detection is a form of in-
formation extraction that finds predefined 
relations between pairs of entities in text. 
This paper describes a relation detection 
approach that combines clues from differ-
ent levels of syntactic processing using 
kernel methods. Information from three 
different levels of processing is consid-
ered: tokenization, sentence parsing and 
deep dependency analysis. Each source of 
information is represented by kernel func-
tions. Then composite kernels are devel-
oped to integrate and extend individual 
kernels so that processing errors occurring 
at one level can be overcome by informa-
tion from other levels. We present an 
evaluation of these methods on the 2004 
ACE relation detection task, using Sup-
port Vector Machines, and show that each 
level of syntactic processing contributes 
useful information for this task. When 
evaluated on the official test data, our ap-
proach produced very competitive ACE 
value scores. We also compare the SVM 
with KNN on different kernels.
