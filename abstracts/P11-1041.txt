Grapheme-to-phoneme conversion (G2P) of
names is an important and challenging prob-
lem. The correct pronunciation of a name is
often reflected in its transliterations, which are
expressed within a different phonological in-
ventory. We investigate the problem of us-
ing transliterations to correct errors produced
by state-of-the-art G2P systems. We present a
novel re-ranking approach that incorporates a
variety of score and n-gram features, in order
to leverage transliterations from multiple lan-
guages. Our experiments demonstrate signifi-
cant accuracy improvements when re-ranking
is applied to n-best lists generated by three
different G2P programs.
