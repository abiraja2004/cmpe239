This paper presents a memoryless categoriza-
tion learner that predicts differences in cate-
gory complexity found in several psycholin-
guistic and psychological experiments. In par-
ticular, this learner predicts the order of diffi-
culty of learning simple Boolean categories,
including the advantage of conjunctive cate-
gories over the disjunctive ones (an advantage
that is not typically modeled by the statistical
approaches). It also models the effect of la-
beling (positive and negative labels vs. posi-
tive labels of two different kinds) on category
complexity. This effect has implications for
the differences between learning a single cat-
egory (e.g., a phonological class of segments)
vs. a set of non-overlapping categories (e.g.,
affixes in a morphological paradigm).
