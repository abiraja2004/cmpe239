 
Interpreting fully natural speech is an important goal 
for spoken language understanding systems. However, 
while corpus studies have shown that about 10% of 
spontaneous tterances contain self-corrections, or RE- 
PAIRS, little is known about he extent o which cues in 
the speech signal may facilitate repair processing. We 
identify several cues based on acoustic and prosodic 
analysis of repairs in a corpus of spontaneous speech, 
and propose methods for exploiting these cues to detect 
and correct repairs. We test our acoustic-prosodic cues 
with other lexical cues to repair identification and find 
that precision rates of 89-93% and recall of 78-83% 
can be achieved, depending upon the cues employed, 
from a prosodically abeled corpus.
