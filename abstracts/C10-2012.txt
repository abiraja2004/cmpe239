This paper presents a methodology for a
quantitative and qualitative evaluation of
Textual Entailment systems. We take ad-
vantage of the decomposition of Text Hy-
pothesis pairs into monothematic pairs,
i.e. pairs where only one linguistic phe-
nomenon at a time is responsible for en-
tailment judgment, and propose to run TE
systems over such datasets. We show
that several behaviours of a system can
be explained in terms of the correlation
between the accuracy on monothematic
pairs and the accuracy on the correspond-
ing original pairs.
