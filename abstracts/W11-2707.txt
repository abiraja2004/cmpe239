We discuss the preferred ordering of elements
of binomials (e.g., conjunctions such as fish
and chips, lager and lime, exciting and in-
teresting) and provide a detailed critique of
Benor and Levy?s probabilistic account of En-
glish binomials. In particular, we discuss the
extent to which their approach is suitable as
a model of language generation. We describe
resources we have developed for the investi-
gation of binomials using a combination of
parsed corpora and very large unparsed cor-
pora. We discuss the use of these resources in
developing models of binomial ordering, con-
centrating in particular on the evaluation is-
sues which arise.
