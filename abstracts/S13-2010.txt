We describe FSS-TimEx, a module for the
recognition and normalization of temporal ex-
pressions we submitted to Task A and B of
the TempEval-3 challenge. FSS-TimEx was
developed as part of a multilingual event ex-
traction system, Nexus, which runs on top of
the EMM news processing engine. It consists
of finite-state rule cascades, using minimalis-
tic text processing stages and simple heuris-
tics to model the relations between events and
temporal expressions. Although FSS-TimEx
is already deployed within an IE application
in the medical domain, we found it useful to
customize its output to the TimeML standard
in order to have an independent performance
measure and guide further developments.
