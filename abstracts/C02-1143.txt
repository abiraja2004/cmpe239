In this paper we report on our experiments on au-
tomatic Word Sense Disambiguation using a max-
imum entropy approach for both English and Chi-
nese verbs. We compare the difficulty of the sense-
tagging tasks in the two languages and investigate
the types of contextual features that are useful for
each language. Our experimental results suggest
that while richer linguistic features are useful for
English WSD, they may not be as beneficial for Chi-
nese.
