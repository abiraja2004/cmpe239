 
We present a new method for discovering a
segmental discourse structure of a document 
while categorizing each segment's function 
and importance. Segments are determined 
by a zero-sum weighting scheme, used on 
occurrences of noun phrases and 
pronominal forms retrieved from the 
document. Segment roles are then 
calculated from the distribution of the terms 
in the segment. Finally, we present results 
of evaluation in terms of precision and 
recall which surpass earlier approaches'.
