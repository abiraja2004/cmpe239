In this paper, we propose a semantic role label-
ing method using a maximum entropy model,
which enables not only to exploit rich features
but also to alleviate the data sparseness prob-
lem in a well-founded model. For applying the
maximum entropy model to semantic role la-
beling, we take a incremental approach as fol-
lows: firstly, the semantic roles are assigned to
the arguments in the immediate clause includ-
ing a predicate, and then, the semantic roles are
assigned to the arguments in the upper clauses
by using previously assigned labels. The exper-
imental result shows that the proposed method
has about 64.76% (F1-measure) on the test set.
