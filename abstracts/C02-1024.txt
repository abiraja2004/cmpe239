This paper extends a polynomial-time parsing al-
gorithm that resolves structural ambiguity in input
sentences by calculating and comparing the deno-
tations of rival constituents, given some model of
the application environment (Schuler, 2001). The
algorithm is extended to incorporate a full set of
logical operators, including quantiers and conjunc-
tions, into this calculation without increasing the
complexity of the overall algorithm beyond polyno-
mial time, both in terms of the length of the in-
put and the number of entities in the environment
model.
