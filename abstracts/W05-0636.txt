A striking feature of human syntactic pro-
cessing is that it is context-dependent, that
is, it seems to take into account seman-
tic information from the discourse con-
text and world knowledge. In this paper,
we attempt to use this insight to bridge
the gap between SRL results from gold
parses and from automatically-generated
parses. To do this, we jointly perform
parsing and semantic role labeling, using
a probabilistic SRL system to rerank the
results of a probabilistic parser. Our cur-
rent results are negative, because a locally-
trained SRL model can return inaccurate
probability estimates.
