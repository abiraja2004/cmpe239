We present parsing algorithms for vari-
ous mildly non-projective dependency for-
malisms. In particular, algorithms are pre-
sented for: all well-nested structures of
gap degree at most 1, with the same com-
plexity as the best existing parsers for con-
stituency formalisms of equivalent genera-
tive power; all well-nested structures with
gap degree bounded by any constant k;
and a new class of structures with gap de-
gree up to k that includes some ill-nested
structures. The third case includes all the
gap degree k structures in a number of de-
pendency treebanks.
