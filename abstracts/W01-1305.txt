Conventional information systems can-
not cater for temporal information eec-
tively. For this reason, it is useful to cap-
ture and maintain the temporal knowl-
edge (especially the relative knowledge)
associated to each action in an informa-
tion system. In this paper, we propose a
model to mine and organize temporal re-
lations embedded in Chinese sentences.
Three kinds of event expressions are ac-
counted for, i.e. single event, multiple
events and declared event(s). Experi-
ments are conducted to evaluate the min-
ing algorithm using a set of news reports
and the results are signicant. Error
analysis has also been performed open-
ing up new doors for future research.
