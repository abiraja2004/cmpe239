This paper presents shallow semantic pars-
ing based only on HPSG parses. An
HPSG-FrameNet map was constructed
from a semantically annotated corpus, and
semantic parsing was performed by map-
ping HPSG dependencies to FrameNet re-
lations. The semantic parsing was evalu-
ated in a Senseval-3 task; the results sug-
gested that there is a high contribution of
syntactic information to semantic analysis.
