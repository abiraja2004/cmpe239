For languages with (semi-) free word or-
der (such as German), labelling gramma-
tical functions on top of phrase-structural
constituent analyses is crucial for making
them interpretable. Unfortunately, most
statistical classifiers consider only local
information for function labelling and fail
to capture important restrictions on the
distribution of core argument functions
such as subject, object etc., namely that
there is at most one subject (etc.) per
clause. We augment a statistical classifier
with an integer linear program imposing
hard linguistic constraints on the solution
space output by the classifier, capturing
global distributional restrictions. We show
that this improves labelling quality, in par-
ticular for argument grammatical func-
tions, in an intrinsic evaluation, and, im-
portantly, grammar coverage for treebank-
based (Lexical-Functional) grammar ac-
quisition and parsing, in an extrinsic eval-
uation.
