We present an approach to query expan-
sion in answer retrieval that uses Statisti-
cal Machine Translation (SMT) techniques
to bridge the lexical gap between ques-
tions and answers. SMT-based query ex-
pansion is done by i) using a full-sentence
paraphraser to introduce synonyms in con-
text of the entire query, and ii) by trans-
lating query terms into answer terms us-
ing a full-sentence SMT model trained on
question-answer pairs. We evaluate these
global, context-aware query expansion tech-
niques on tfidf retrieval from 10 million
question-answer pairs extracted from FAQ
pages. Experimental results show that SMT-
based expansion improves retrieval perfor-
mance over local expansion and over re-
trieval without expansion.
