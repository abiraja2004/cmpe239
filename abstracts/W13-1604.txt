The topic of sentiment analysis in text has
been extensively studied in English for the
past 30 years. An early, influential work by
Cynthia Whissell, the Dictionary of Affect in
Language (DAL), allows rating words along
three dimensions: pleasantness, activation and
imagery. Given the lack of such tools in Span-
ish, we decided to replicate Whissell?s work in
that language. This paper describes the Span-
ish DAL, a knowledge base formed by more
than 2500 words manually rated by humans
along the same three dimensions. We evalu-
ated its usefulness on two sentiment analysis
tasks, which showed that the knowledge base
managed to capture relevant information re-
garding the three affective dimensions.
