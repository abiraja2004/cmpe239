We present a method for improving the perceived nat-
uralness of corpus-based speech synthesizers. It con-
sists in removing pronounced pitch peaks in the origi-
nal recordings, which typically lead to noticeable dis-
continuities in the synthesized speech. We perceptu-
ally evaluated this method using two concatenative and
two HMM-based synthesis systems, and found that us-
ing it on the source recordings managed to improve
the naturalness of the synthesizers and had no effect
on their intelligibility.
