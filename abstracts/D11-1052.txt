We present an automatic method which lever-
ages word lengthening to adapt a sentiment
lexicon specifically for Twitter and similar so-
cial messaging networks. The contributions of
the paper are as follows. First, we call at-
tention to lengthening as a widespread phe-
nomenon in microblogs and social messag-
ing, and demonstrate the importance of han-
dling it correctly. We then show that lengthen-
ing is strongly associated with subjectivity and
sentiment. Finally, we present an automatic
method which leverages this association to de-
tect domain-specific sentiment- and emotion-
bearing words. We evaluate our method by
comparison to human judgments, and analyze
its strengths and weaknesses. Our results are
of interest to anyone analyzing sentiment in
microblogs and social networks, whether for
research or commercial purposes.
