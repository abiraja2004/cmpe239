We describe probabilistic models for a
chart generator based on HPSG. Within
the research field of parsing with lex-
icalized grammars such as HPSG, re-
cent developments have achieved efficient
estimation of probabilistic models and
high-speed parsing guided by probabilis-
tic models. The focus of this paper is
to show that two essential techniques ?
model estimation on packed parse forests
and beam search during parsing ? are suc-
cessfully exported to the task of natural
language generation. Additionally, we re-
port empirical evaluation of the perfor-
mance of several disambiguation models
and how the performance changes accord-
ing to the feature set used in the models
and the size of training data.
