We propose a collaborative framework for
collecting Thai unknown words found on
Web pages over the Internet. Our main
goal is to design and construct a Web-
based system which allows a group of in-
terested users to participate in construct-
ing a Thai unknown-word open dictionary.
The proposed framework provides sup-
porting algorithms and tools for automati-
cally identifying and extracting unknown
words from Web pages of given URLs.
The system yields the result of unknown-
word candidates which are presented to
the users for verification. The approved
unknown words could be combined with
the set of existing words in the lexicon
to improve the performance of many NLP
tasks such as word segmentation, infor-
mation retrieval and machine translation.
Our framework includes word segmenta-
tion and morphological analysis modules
for handling the non-segmenting charac-
teristic of Thai written language. To take
advantage of large available text resource
on the Web, our unknown-word boundary
identification approach is based on the sta-
tistical string pattern-matching algorithm.
Keywords: Unknown words, open dictio-
nary, word segmentation, morphological
analysis, word-boundary detection.
