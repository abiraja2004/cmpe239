As it serves as a basis for POS tagging, cat-
egory induction, and human category ac-
quisition, we investigate the information
needed to disambiguate a word in a lo-
cal context, when using corpus categories.
Specifically, we increase the recall of an
error detection method by abstracting the
word to be disambiguated to a represen-
tation containing information about some
of its inherent properties, namely the set
of categories it can potentially have. This
work thus provides insights into the rela-
tion of corpus categories to categories de-
rived from local contexts.
