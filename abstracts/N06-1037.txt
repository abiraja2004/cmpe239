 
This paper proposes to use a convolution 
kernel over parse trees to model syntactic 
structure information for relation extrac-
tion. Our study reveals that the syntactic 
structure features embedded in a parse 
tree are very effective for relation extrac-
tion and these features can be well cap-
tured by the convolution tree kernel. 
Evaluation on the ACE 2003 corpus 
shows that the convolution kernel over 
parse trees can achieve comparable per-
formance with the previous best-reported 
feature-based methods on the 24 ACE re-
lation subtypes. It also shows that our 
method significantly outperforms the pre-
vious two dependency tree kernels on the 
5 ACE relation major types.
