The identification of personality by auto-
matic analysis of conversation has many
applications in natural language process-
ing, from leader identification in meetings
to partner matching on dating websites.
We automatically train models of the main
five personality dimensions, on a corpus
of conversation extracts and personality
ratings. Results show that the models per-
form better than the baseline, and their
analysis confirms previous findings link-
ing language and personality, while re-
vealing many new linguistic and prosodic
markers.
