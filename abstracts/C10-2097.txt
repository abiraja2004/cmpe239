In this paper, an automatic method for 
Persian WordNet construction based on 
Prenceton WordNet 2.1 (PWN) is intro-
duced. The proposed approach uses Per-
sian and English corpora as well as a bi-
lingual dictionary in order to make a 
mapping between PWN synsets and Per-
sian words. Our method calculates a score 
for each candidate synset of a given Per-
sian word and for each of its translation,
it selects the synset with maximum score 
as a link to the Persian word. The manual 
evaluation on selected links proposed by 
our method on 500 randomly selected 
Persian words, shows about 76.4% quali-
ty respect to precision measure. By aug-
menting the Persian WordNet with the 
un-ambiguous words, the total accuracy 
of automatically extracted Persian Word-
Net is about 82.6% which outperforms 
the previously semi-automated generated 
Persian WordNet by about 12.6%.
