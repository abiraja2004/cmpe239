Data-driven approaches to sentence com-
pression define the task as dropping any
subset of words from the input sentence
while retaining important information and
grammaticality. We show that only 16%
of the observed compressed sentences in
the domain of subtitling can be accounted
for in this way. We argue that part of this
is due to evaluation issues and estimate
that a deletion model is in fact compat-
ible with approximately 55% of the ob-
served data. We analyse the remaining
problems and conclude that in those cases
word order changes and paraphrasing are
crucial, and argue for more elaborate sen-
tence compression models which build on
NLG work.
