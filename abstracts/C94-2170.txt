  : We demonstrate an approach and an accompanying UNIX toolbox for performing wtrious 
kinds of Knowledge tT, xlractions and Structuring. The goal is to "practically" enhance the productivily 
while constructing resources for NLP systems on the basis of large corpora of technical texts,. Users are 
lexicon/grammar builders, terminologists and knowledge ngineers. We stay open to already explored 
methods in this or neighbouring activities but put a greater stress on the use of linguistic knowledge. 
The originality of the work presented here lies in the scope of applications addressed and in the degree 
of use of linguistic knowledge.
