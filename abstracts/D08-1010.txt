This paper proposes a novel maximum en-
tropy based rule selection (MERS) model
for syntax-based statistical machine transla-
tion (SMT). The MERS model combines lo-
cal contextual information around rules and
information of sub-trees covered by variables
in rules. Therefore, our model allows the de-
coder to perform context-dependent rule se-
lection during decoding. We incorporate the
MERS model into a state-of-the-art linguis-
tically syntax-based SMT model, the tree-
to-string alignment template model. Experi-
ments show that our approach achieves signif-
icant improvements over the baseline system.
