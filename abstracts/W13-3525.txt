The acquisition of Belief verbs lags be-
hind the acquisition of Desire verbs in
children. Some psycholinguistic theo-
ries attribute this lag to conceptual differ-
ences between the two classes, while oth-
ers suggest that syntactic differences are
responsible. Through computational ex-
periments, we show that a probabilistic
verb learning model exhibits the pattern of
acquisition, even though there is no dif-
ference in the model in the difficulty of
the semantic or syntactic properties of Be-
lief vs. Desire verbs. Our results point
to the distributional properties of various
verb classes as a potentially important, and
heretofore unexplored, factor in the ob-
served developmental lag of Belief verbs.
