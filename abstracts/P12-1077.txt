We present an approach for detecting salient
(important) dates in texts in order to auto-
matically build event timelines from a search
query (e.g. the name of an event or person,
etc.). This work was carried out on a corpus
of newswire texts in English provided by the
Agence France Presse (AFP). In order to ex-
tract salient dates that warrant inclusion in an
event timeline, we first recognize and normal-
ize temporal expressions in texts and then use
a machine-learning approach to extract salient
dates that relate to a particular topic. We fo-
cused only on extracting the dates and not the
events to which they are related.
