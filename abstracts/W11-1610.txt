We present a substitution-only approach to
sentence compression which ?tightens? a sen-
tence by reducing its character length. Replac-
ing phrases with shorter paraphrases yields
paraphrastic compressions as short as 60% of
the original length. In support of this task,
we introduce a novel technique for re-ranking
paraphrases extracted from bilingual corpora.
At high compression rates1 paraphrastic com-
pressions outperform a state-of-the-art dele-
tion model in an oracle experiment. For fur-
ther compression, deleting from oracle para-
phrastic compressions preserves more mean-
ing than deletion alone. In either setting, para-
phrastic compression shows promise for sur-
passing deletion-only methods.
