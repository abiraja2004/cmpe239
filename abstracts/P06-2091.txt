The present paper proposes a method
by which to translate outputs of a ro-
bust HPSG parser into semantic rep-
resentations of Typed Dynamic Logic
(TDL), a dynamic plural semantics de-
fined in typed lambda calculus. With
its higher-order representations of con-
texts, TDL analyzes and describes
the inherently inter-sentential nature of
quantification and anaphora in a strictly
lexicalized and compositional manner.
The present study shows that the pro-
posed translation method successfully
combines robustness and descriptive ad-
equacy of contemporary semantics. The
present implementation achieves high
coverage, approximately 90%, for the
real text of the Penn Treebank corpus.
