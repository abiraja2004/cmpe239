Comma placements in Chinese text are
relatively arbitrary although there are
some syntactic guidelines for them. In this
research, we attempt to improve the read-
ability of text by optimizing comma place-
ments through integration of linguistic fea-
tures of text and gaze features of readers.
We design a comma predictor for gen-
eral Chinese text based on conditional ran-
dom field models with linguistic features.
After that, we build a rule-based filter for
categorizing commas in text according to
their contribution to readability based on
the analysis of gazes of people reading text
with and without commas.
The experimental results show that our
predictor reproduces the comma distribu-
tion in the Penn Chinese Treebank with
78.41 in F1-score and commas chosen by
our filter smoothen certain gaze behaviors.
