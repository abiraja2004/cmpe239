We report results of experiments which
build and refine models of rhetorical-
semantic relations such as Cause and Con-
trast. We adopt the approach of Marcu
and Echihabi (2002), using a small set of
patterns to build relation models, and ex-
tend their work by refining the training
and classification process using parame-
ter optimization, topic segmentation and
syntactic parsing. Using human-annotated
and automatically-extracted test sets, we
find that each of these techniques results in
improved relation classification accuracy.
