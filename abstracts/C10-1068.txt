This paper proposes a dependency-driven 
scheme to dynamically determine the syn-
tactic parse tree structure for tree ker-
nel-based anaphoricity determination in 
coreference resolution. Given a full syntactic 
parse tree, it keeps the nodes and the paths 
related with current mention based on con-
stituent dependencies from both syntactic 
and semantic perspectives, while removing 
the noisy information, eventually leading to 
a dependency-driven dynamic syntactic 
parse tree (D-DSPT). Evaluation on the ACE 
2003 corpus shows that the D-DSPT out-
performs all previous parse tree structures on 
anaphoricity determination, and that apply-
ing our anaphoricity determination module 
in coreference resolution achieves the so far 
best performance.
