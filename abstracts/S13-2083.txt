This paper describes the specifications and re-
sults of SSA-UO, unsupervised system, pre-
sented in SemEval 2013 for Sentiment Analy-
sis in Twitter (Task 2) (Wilson et al, 2013).
The proposal system includes three phases:
data preprocessing, contextual word polarity
detection and message classification. The
preprocessing phase comprises treatment of
emoticon, slang terms, lemmatization and
POS-tagging. Word polarity detection is car-
ried out taking into account the sentiment as-
sociated with the context in which it appears.
For this, we use a new contextual sentiment
classification method based on coarse-grained
word sense disambiguation, using WordNet
(Miller, 1995) and a coarse-grained sense in-
ventory (sentiment inventory) built up from
SentiWordNet (Baccianella et al, 2010). Fi-
nally, the overall sentiment is determined us-
ing a rule-based classifier. As it may be ob-
served, the results obtained for Twitter and
SMS sentiment classification are good consid-
ering that our proposal is unsupervised.
