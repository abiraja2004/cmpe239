 
This paper makes three significant extensions to a 
noisy channel speller designed for standard writ-
ten text to target the challenging domain of search 
queries. First, the noisy channel model is sub-
sumed by a more general ranker, which allows a 
variety of features to be easily incorporated. Se-
cond, a distributed infrastructure is proposed for 
training and applying Web scale n-gram language 
models. Third, a new phrase-based error model is 
presented. This model places a probability distri-
bution over transformations between multi-word 
phrases, and is estimated using large amounts of 
query-correction pairs derived from search logs. 
Experiments show that each of these extensions 
leads to significant improvements over the state-
of-the-art baseline methods.
