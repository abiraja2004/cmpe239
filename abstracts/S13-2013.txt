We analyze the performance of SUTIME, a
temporal tagger for recognizing and normal-
izing temporal expressions, on TempEval-3
Task A for English. SUTIME is available as
part of the Stanford CoreNLP pipeline and can
be used to annotate documents with temporal
information. Testing on the TempEval-3 eval-
uation corpus showed that this system is com-
petitive with state-of-the-art techniques.
