The content selection component of a nat-
ural language generation system decides
which information should be communi-
cated in its output. We use informa-
tion from reports on the game of cricket.
We first describe a simple factoid-to-text
alignment algorithm then treat content se-
lection as a collective classification prob-
lem and demonstrate that simple ?group-
ing? of statistics at various levels of granu-
larity yields substantially improved results
over a probabilistic baseline. We addi-
tionally show that holding back of specific
types of input data, and linking database
structures with commonality further in-
crease performance.
