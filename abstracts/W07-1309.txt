The verb inflections of Bengali underwent
a series of phonological change between
10th and 18th centuries, which gave rise
to several modern dialects of the language.
In this paper, we offer a functional ex-
planation for this change by quantifying
the functional pressures of ease of artic-
ulation, perceptual contrast and learnabil-
ity through objective functions or con-
straints, or both. The multi-objective and
multi-constraint optimization problem has
been solved through genetic algorithm,
whereby we have observed the emergence
of Pareto-optimal dialects in the system
that closely resemble some of the real
ones.
