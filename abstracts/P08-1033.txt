Since facts or statements in a hedge or negated
context typically appear as false positives, the
proper handling of these language phenomena
is of great importance in biomedical text min-
ing. In this paper we demonstrate the impor-
tance of hedge classification experimentally
in two real life scenarios, namely the ICD-
9-CM coding of radiology reports and gene
name Entity Extraction from scientific texts.
We analysed the major differences of specu-
lative language in these tasks and developed
a maxent-based solution for both the free text
and scientific text processing tasks. Based on
our results, we draw conclusions on the pos-
sible ways of tackling speculative language in
biomedical texts.
