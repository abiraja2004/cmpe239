 
We present-some n w results for the reading 
comprehension task described in \[3\] that im- 
prove on the best published results - from 
36% in \[3\] to 41% (the best of the systems 
described herein). We discuss a variety of 
techniques that tend to give small improve- 
ments, ranging from the fairly simple (give 
verbs more weight in answer selection) to 
the fairly complex (use specific techniques 
for answering specific kinds of questions).
