Systems using text windows to model
word contexts have mostly been using
fixed-sized windows and uniform weights.
The window size is often selected by trial
and error to maximize task results. We
propose a non-supervised method for se-
lecting weights for each window distance,
effectively removing the need to limit win-
dow sizes, by maximizing the mutual gen-
eration of two sets of samples of the same
word. Experiments on Semeval Word
Sense Disambiguation tasks showed con-
siderable improvements.
