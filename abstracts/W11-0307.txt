We develop an approach to biomedical event
extraction using a search-based structured pre-
diction framework, SEARN, which converts
the task into cost-sensitive classification tasks
whose models are learned jointly. We show
that SEARN improves on a simple yet strong
pipeline by 8.6 points in F-score on the
BioNLP 2009 shared task, while achieving the
best reported performance by a joint inference
method. Additionally, we consider the issue of
cost estimation during learning and present an
approach called focused costing that improves
improves efficiency and predictive accuracy.
