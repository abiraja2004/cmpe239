This paper proposes Japanese bottom-up
named entity recognition using a two-
stage machine learning method. Most
work has formalized Named Entity Recog-
nition as a sequential labeling problem, in
which only local information is utilized
for the label estimation, and thus a long
named entity consisting of several mor-
phemes tends to be wrongly recognized.
Our proposed method regards a compound
noun (chunk) as a labeling unit, and first
estimates the labels of all the chunks in
a phrasal unit (bunsetsu) using a machine
learning method. Then, the best label as-
signment in the bunsetsu is determined
from bottom up as the CKY parsing al-
gorithm using a machine learning method.
We conducted an experimental on CRL
NE data, and achieved an F measure of
89.79, which is higher than previous work.
