  
This paper gives an overview of the 
Caderige project. This project involves 
teams from different areas (biology, 
machine learning, natural language 
processing) in order to develop high-
level analysis tools for extracting 
structured information from biological 
bibliographical databases, especially 
Medline. The paper gives an overview 
of the approach and compares it to the 
state of the art.
