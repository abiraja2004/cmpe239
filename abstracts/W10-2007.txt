When subjects describe concepts in terms
of their characteristic properties, they often
produce composite properties, e. g., rabbits
are said to have long ears, not just ears. We
present a set of simple methods to extract
the modifiers of composite properties (in
particular: parts) from corpora. We achieve
our best performance by combining evi-
dence about the association between the
modifier and the part both within the con-
text of the target concept and independently
of it. We show that this performance is rel-
atively stable across languages (Italian and
German) and for production vs. perception
of properties.
