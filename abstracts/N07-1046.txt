We propose a novel HMM-based framework to
accurately transliterate unseen named entities.
The framework leverages features in letter-
alignment and letter n-gram pairs learned from
available bilingual dictionaries. Letter-classes,
such as vowels/non-vowels, are integrated to
further improve transliteration accuracy. The
proposed transliteration system is applied to
out-of-vocabulary named-entities in statistical
machine translation (SMT), and a significant
improvement over traditional transliteration ap-
proach is obtained. Furthermore, by incor-
porating an automatic spell-checker based on
statistics collected from web search engines,
transliteration accuracy is further improved.
The proposed system is implemented within
our SMT system and applied to a real transla-
tion scenario from Arabic to English.
