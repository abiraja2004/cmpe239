This paper describes a novel character tag-
ging approach to Chinese word segmenta-
tion and named entity recognition (NER) for
our participation in Bakeoff-4.1 It integrates
unsupervised segmentation and conditional
random fields (CRFs) learning successfully,
using similar character tags and feature tem-
plates for both word segmentation and NER.
It ranks at the top in all closed tests of word
segmentation and gives promising results for
all closed and open NER tasks in the Bake-
off. Tag set selection and unsupervised seg-
mentation play a critical role in this success.
