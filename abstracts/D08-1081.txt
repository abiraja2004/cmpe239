In this paper we describe research on sum-
marizing conversations in the meetings and
emails domains. We introduce a conver-
sation summarization system that works in
multiple domains utilizing general conversa-
tional features, and compare our results with
domain-dependent systems for meeting and
email data. We find that by treating meet-
ings and emails as conversations with general
conversational features in common, we can
achieve competitive results with state-of-the-
art systems that rely on more domain-specific
features.
