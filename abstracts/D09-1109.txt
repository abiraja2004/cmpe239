In this paper we investigate temporal pat-
terns of web search queries. We carry out
several evaluations to analyze the proper-
ties of temporal profiles of queries, reveal-
ing promising semantic and pragmatic re-
lationships between words. We focus on
two applications: query suggestion and
query categorization. The former shows
a potential for time-series similarity mea-
sures to identify specific semantic relat-
edness between words, which results in
state-of-the-art performance in query sug-
gestion while providing complementary
information to more traditional distribu-
tional similarity measures. The query cat-
egorization evaluation suggests that the
temporal profile alone is not a strong in-
dicator of broad topical categories.
