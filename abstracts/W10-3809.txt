In this paper, we propose a dependency
based statistical system that uses discrim-
inative techniques to train its parameters.
We conducted experiments on an English-
Hindi parallel corpora. The use of syntax
(dependency tree) allows us to address the
large word-reorderings between English
and Hindi. And, discriminative training
allows us to use rich feature sets, includ-
ing linguistic features that are useful in the
machine translation task. We present re-
sults of the experimental implementation
of the system in this paper.
