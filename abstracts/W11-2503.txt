We present a distributional semantic model
combining text- and image-based features. We
evaluate this multimodal semantic model on
simulating similarity judgments, concept clus-
tering and the BLESS benchmark. When inte-
grated with the same core text-based model,
image-based features are at least as good as
further text-based features, and they capture
different qualitative aspects of the tasks, sug-
gesting that the two sources of information are
complementary.
