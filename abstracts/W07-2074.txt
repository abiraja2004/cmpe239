This work describes the University of the
Basque Country system (UBC-ALM) for
lexical sample and all-words WSD subtasks
of SemEval-2007 task 17, where it per-
formed in the second and fifth positions re-
spectively. The system is based on a com-
bination of k-Nearest Neighbor classifiers,
with each classifier learning from a distinct
set of features: local features (syntactic, col-
locations features), topical features (bag-of-
words, domain information) and latent fea-
tures learned from a reduced space using
Singular Value Decomposition.
