 
This paper describes our study on identi-
fying semantic relations that exist between 
diseases and treatments in biomedical sen-
tences. We focus on three semantic rela-
tions: Cure, Prevent, and Side Effect. The 
contributions of this paper consists in the 
fact that better results are obtained com-
pared to previous studies and the fact that 
our research settings allow the integration 
of biomedical and medical knowledge. 
We obtain 98.55% F-measure for the Cure 
relation, 100% F-measure for the Prevent 
relation, and 88.89% F-measure for the 
Side Effect relation.
