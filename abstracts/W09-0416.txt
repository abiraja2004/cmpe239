In this paper, we describe the machine
translation system in the evaluation cam-
paign of the Fourth Workshop on Statisti-
cal Machine Translation at EACL 2009.
We describe the modular design of our
multi-engine MT system with particular
focus on the components used in this par-
ticipation.
We participated in the translation task
for the following translation directions:
French?English and English?French, in
which we employed our multi-engine ar-
chitecture to translate. We also partic-
ipated in the system combination task
which was carried out by the MBR de-
coder and Confusion Network decoder.
We report results on the provided devel-
opment and test sets.
