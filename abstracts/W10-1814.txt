Methods that re-use existing mono-lingual
semantic annotation resources to annotate
a new language rely on the hypothesis that
the semantic annotation scheme used is
cross-lingually valid. We test this hypoth-
esis in an annotation agreement study. We
show that the annotation scheme can be
applied cross-lingually.
