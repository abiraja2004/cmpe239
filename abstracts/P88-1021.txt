 
A prerequisite to a theory of the way agents un- 
derstand speech acts is a theory of how their be- 
liefs and intentions are revised as a consequence 
of events. This process of attitude revision is 
an interesting domain for the application of non- 
monotonic reasoning because speech acts have a 
conventional aspect that is readily represented by 
defaults, but that interacts with an agent's be- 
liefs and intentions in many complex ways that 
may override the defaults. Perrault has devel- 
oped a theory of speech acts, based on Rieter's 
default logic, that captures the conventional as- 
pect; it does not, however, adequately account for 
certain easily observed facts about attitude revi- 
sion resulting from speech acts. A natural the- 
ory of attitude revision seems to require a method 
of stating preferences among competing defaults. 
We present here a speech act theory, formalized 
in hierarchic autoepistemic logic (a refinement of 
Moore's autoepistemic logic), in which revision of 
both the speaker's and hearer's attitudes can be 
adequately described. As a collateral benefit, effi- 
cient automatic reasoning methods for the formal- 
ism exist. The theory has been implemented and 
is now being employed by an utterance-planning 
system.
