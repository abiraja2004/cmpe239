This paper presents an interactive analytic tool
for educational peer-review analysis. It em-
ploys data visualization at multiple levels of
granularity, and provides automated analytic
support using clustering and natural language
processing. This tool helps instructors dis-
cover interesting patterns in writing perfor-
mance that are reflected through peer reviews.
