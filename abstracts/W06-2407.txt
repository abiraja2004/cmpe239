Light verb constructions (LVCs), such as
?make a call? in English, can be said
to be complex predicates in which the
verb plays only a functional role. LVCs
pose challenges for natural language un-
derstanding, as their semantics differ from
usual predicate structures. We extend the
existing corpus-based measures for iden-
tifying LVCs between verb-object pairs
in English, by proposing using new fea-
tures that use mutual information and as-
sess other syntactic properties. Our work
also incorporates both existing and new
LVC features into a machine learning ap-
proach. We experimentally show that us-
ing the proposed framework incorporat-
ing all features outperforms previous work
by 17%. As machine learning techniques
model the trends found in training data,
we believe the proposed LVC detection
framework and statistical features is easily
extendable to other languages.
