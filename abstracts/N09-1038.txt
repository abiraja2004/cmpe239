The extent to which the organization of nat-
ural language grammars reflects a drive to
minimize dependency length remains little
explored. We present the first algorithm
polynomial-time in sentence length for obtain-
ing the minimal-length linearization of a de-
pendency tree subject to constraints of mild
context sensitivity. For the minimally context-
sensitive case of gap-degree 1 dependency
trees, we prove several properties of minimal-
length linearizations which allow us to im-
prove the efficiency of our algorithm to the
point that it can be used on most naturally-
occurring sentences. We use the algorithm
to compare optimal, observed, and random
sentence dependency length for both surface
and deep dependencies in English and Ger-
man. We find in both languages that anal-
yses of surface and deep dependencies yield
highly similar results, and that mild context-
sensitivity affords very little reduction in min-
imal dependency length over fully projective
linearizations; but that observed linearizations
in German are much closer to random and far-
ther from minimal-length linearizations than
in English.
