In Arabic-to-English phrase-based statis-
tical machine translation, a large number
of syntactic disfluencies are due to wrong
long-range reordering of the verb in VSO
sentences, where the verb is anticipated
with respect to the English word order.
In this paper, we propose a chunk-based
reordering technique to automatically de-
tect and displace clause-initial verbs in the
Arabic side of a word-aligned parallel cor-
pus. This method is applied to preprocess
the training data, and to collect statistics
about verb movements. From this anal-
ysis, specific verb reordering lattices are
then built on the test sentences before de-
coding them. The application of our re-
ordering methods on the training and test
sets results in consistent BLEU score im-
provements on the NIST-MT 2009 Arabic-
English benchmark.
