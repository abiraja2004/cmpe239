Categorial grammar has traditionally used
the ?-calculus to represent meaning. We
present an alternative, dependency-based
perspective on linguistic meaning and sit-
uate it in the computational setting. This
perspective is formalized in terms of hy-
brid logic and has a rich yet perspicuous
propositional ontology that enables a wide
variety of semantic phenomena to be rep-
resented in a single meaning formalism.
Finally, we show how we can couple this
formalization to Combinatory Categorial
Grammar to produce interpretations com-
positionally.
