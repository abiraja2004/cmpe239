This paper presents some of the first data visualiza-
tions and analysis of distributions for a lexicalized
statistical parsing model, in order to better under-
stand their nature. In the course of this analysis,
we have paid particular attention to parameters that
include bilexical dependencies. The prevailing view
has been that such statistics are very informative but
suffer greatly from sparse data problems. By using a
parser to constrain-parse its own output, and by hy-
pothesizing and testing for distributional similarity
with back-off distributions, we have evidence that
finally explains that (a) bilexical statistics are actu-
ally getting used quite often but that (b) the distri-
butions are so similar to those that do not include
head words as to be nearly indistinguishable inso-
far as making parse decisions. Finally, our analysis
has provided for the first time an effective way to
do parameter selection for a generative lexicalized
statistical parsing model.
