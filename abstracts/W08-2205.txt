One of the big challenges in understanding text, i.e., constructing an over-
all coherent representation of the text, is that much information needed
in that representation is unstated (implicit). Thus, in order to ?fill in
the gaps? and create an overall representation, language processing sys-
tems need a large amount of world knowledge, and creating those knowl-
edge resources remains a fundamental challenge. In our current work,
we are seeking to augment WordNet as a knowledge resource for lan-
guage understanding in several ways: adding in formal versions of its
word sense definitions (glosses); classifying the morphosemantic links
between nouns and verbs; encoding a small number of ?core theories?
about WordNet?s most commonly used terms; and adding in simple rep-
resentations of scripts. Although this is still work in progress, we describe
our experiences so far with what we hope will be a significantly improved
resource for the deep understanding of language.
