In this paper we address the problem of
solving substitution ciphers using a beam
search approach. We present a concep-
tually consistent and easy to implement
method that improves the current state of
the art for decipherment of substitution ci-
phers and is able to use high order n-gram
language models. We show experiments
with 1:1 substitution ciphers in which the
guaranteed optimal solution for 3-gram
language models has 38.6% decipherment
error, while our approach achieves 4.13%
decipherment error in a fraction of time
by using a 6-gram language model. We
also apply our approach to the famous
Zodiac-408 cipher and obtain slightly bet-
ter (and near to optimal) results than pre-
viously published. Unlike the previous
state-of-the-art approach that uses addi-
tional word lists to evaluate possible deci-
pherments, our approach only uses a letter-
based 6-gram language model. Further-
more we use our algorithm to solve large
vocabulary substitution ciphers and im-
prove the best published decipherment er-
ror rate based on the Gigaword corpus of
7.8% to 6.0% error rate.
