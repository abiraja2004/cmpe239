We present a language-independent and
unsupervised algorithm for the segmenta-
tion of words into morphs. The algorithm
is based on a new generative probabilis-
tic model, which makes use of relevant
prior information on the length and fre-
quency distributions of morphs in a lan-
guage. Our algorithm is shown to out-
perform two competing algorithms, when
evaluated on data from a language with
agglutinative morphology (Finnish), and
to perform well also on English data.
