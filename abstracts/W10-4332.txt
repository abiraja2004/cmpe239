Building an industrial spoken dialogue
system (SDS) requires several iterations
of design, deployment, test, and evalua-
tion phases. Most industrial SDS develop-
ers use a graphical tool to design dialogue
strategies. They are critical to get good
system performances, but their evaluation
is not part of the design phase.
We propose integrating dialogue logs into
the design tool so that developers can
jointly monitor call flows and their asso-
ciated Key Performance Indicators (KPI).
It drastically shortens the complete devel-
opment cycle, and offers a new design ex-
perience.
Orange Dialogue Design Studio (ODDS),
our design tool, allows developers to de-
sign several alternatives and compare their
relative performances. It helps the SDS
developers to understand and analyse the
user behaviour, with the assistance of a re-
inforcement learning algorithm. The SDS
developers can thus confront the different
KPI and control the further SDS choices
by updating the call flow alternatives.
