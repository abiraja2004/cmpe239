 
Speaker name recognition plays an important 
role in many spoken language applications, 
such as rich transcription, information extrac-
tion, question answering, and opinion mining. 
In this paper, we developed an SVM-based 
classification framework to determine the 
speaker names for those included speech seg-
ments in broadcast news speech, called sound-
bites. We evaluated a variety of features with 
different feature selection strategies. Experi-
ments on Mandarin broadcast news speech 
show that using our proposed approach, the 
soundbite speaker name recognition (SSNR) 
accuracy is 68.9% on our blind test set, an ab-
solute 10% improvement compared to a base-
line system, which chooses the person name 
closest to the soundbite.
