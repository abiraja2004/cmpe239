This paper proposes passage reranking
models that (i) do not require manual fea-
ture engineering and (ii) greatly preserve
accuracy, when changing application do-
main. Their main characteristic is the
use of relational semantic structures rep-
resenting questions and their answer pas-
sages. The relations are established us-
ing information from automatic classifiers,
i.e., question category (QC) and focus
classifiers (FC) and Named Entity Recog-
nizers (NER). This way (i) effective struc-
tural relational patterns can be automati-
cally learned with kernel machines; and
(ii) structures are more invariant w.r.t. dif-
ferent domains, thus fostering adaptability.
