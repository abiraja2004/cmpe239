This paper presents results from ex-
periments in automatic classification of
animacy for Norwegian nouns using
decision-tree classifiers. The method
makes use of relative frequency measures
for linguistically motivated morphosyn-
tactic features extracted from an automati-
cally annotated corpus of Norwegian. The
classifiers are evaluated using leave-one-
out training and testing and the initial re-
sults are promising (approaching 90% ac-
curacy) for high frequency nouns, however
deteriorate gradually as lower frequency
nouns are classified. Experiments at-
tempting to empirically locate a frequency
threshold for the classification method in-
dicate that a subset of the chosen mor-
phosyntactic features exhibit a notable re-
silience to data sparseness. Results will be
presented which show that the classifica-
tion accuracy obtained for high frequency
nouns (with absolute frequencies >1000)
can be maintained for nouns with consid-
erably lower frequencies (?50) by back-
ing off to a smaller set of features at clas-
sification.
