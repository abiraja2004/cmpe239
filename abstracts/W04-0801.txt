 
In this paper we describe the Senseval 3 
Basque lexical sample task. The task 
comprised 40 words (15 nouns, 15 verbs and 
10 adjectives) selected from the Basque 
WordNet. 10 of the words were chosen in 
coordination with other lexical-sample tasks. 
The examples were taken from newspapers, an 
in-house balanced corpus and Internet texts. 
We additionally included a large set of 
untagged examples, and a lemmatised version 
of the data including lemma, PoS and case 
information. The method used to hand-tag the 
examples produced an inter-tagger agreement 
of 78.2% before arbitration. The eight 
competing systems attained results well above 
the most frequent baseline and the best system 
from Swarthmore College scored 70.4% 
recall.
