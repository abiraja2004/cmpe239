 
This paper describes preliminary work 
concerning the creation of a Framework to aid 
in lexical semantic resource construction. The 
Framework consists of 9 stages during which 
various lexical resources are collected, 
studied, and combined into a single 
combinatory lexical resource. To evaluate the 
general Framework it was applied to a small 
set of English and Arabic resources, 
automatically combining them into a single 
lexical knowledge base that can be used for 
query translation and disambiguation in Cross-
Language Information Retrieval.
