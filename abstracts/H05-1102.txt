We present a very efficient statistical in-
cremental parser for LTAG-spinal, a vari-
ant of LTAG. The parser supports the
full adjoining operation, dynamic predi-
cate coordination, and non-projective de-
pendencies, with a formalism of provably
stronger generative capacity as compared
to CFG. Using gold standard POS tags as
input, on section 23 of the PTB, the parser
achieves an f-score of 89.3% for syntactic
dependency defined on LTAG derivation
trees, which are deeper than the dependen-
cies extracted from PTB alone with head
rules (for example, in Magerman?s style).
