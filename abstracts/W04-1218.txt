In this paper, we report the adaptation of a
named entity recognition (NER) system to the
biomedical domain in order to participate in
the ?Shared Task Bio-Entity Recognition?.
The system is originally developed for Ger-
man NER that shares characteristics with the
biomedical task. To facilitate adaptability, the
system is knowledge-poor and utilizes unla-
beled data. Investigating the adaptability of the
single components and the enhancements nec-
essary, we get insights into the task of bio-
entity recognition.
