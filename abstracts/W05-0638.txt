 
In this paper, we propose a method that 
exploits full parsing information by repre-
senting it as features of argument classifi-
cation models and as constraints in integer 
linear learning programs. In addition, to 
take advantage of SVM-based and Maxi-
mum Entropy-based argument classifica-
tion models, we incorporate their scoring 
matrices, and use the combined matrix in 
the above-mentioned integer linear pro-
grams. The experimental results show that 
full parsing information not only in-
creases the F-score of argument classifi-
cation models by 0.7%, but also 
effectively removes all labeling inconsis-
tencies, which increases the F-score by 
0.64%. The ensemble of SVM and ME 
also boosts the F-score by 0.77%. Our 
system achieves an F-score of 76.53% in 
the development set and 76.38% in Test 
WSJ.
