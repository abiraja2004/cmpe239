A variety of query systems have been devel-
oped for interrogating parsed corpora, or tree-
banks. With the arrival of efficient, wide-
coverage parsers, it is feasible to create very
large databases of trees. However, existing ap-
proaches that use in-memory search, or rela-
tional or XML database technologies, do not
scale up. We describe a method for storage,
indexing, and query of treebanks that uses an
information retrieval engine. Several experi-
ments with a large treebank demonstrate ex-
cellent scaling characteristics for a wide range
of query types. This work facilitates the cu-
ration of much larger treebanks, and enables
them to be used effectively in a variety of sci-
entific and engineering tasks.
