 
Multilinguality in ontologies has become 
an impending need for institutions 
worldwide with valuable linguistic re-
sources in different natural languages. 
Since most ontologies are developed in 
one language, obtaining multilingual on-
tologies implies to localize or adapt them 
to a concrete language and culture com-
munity. As the adaptation of the ontology 
conceptualization demands considerable 
efforts, we propose to modify the ontol-
ogy terminological layer, and provide a 
model called Linguistic Information Re-
pository (LIR) that associated to the on-
tology meta-model allows terminological 
layer localization.
