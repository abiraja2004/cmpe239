This paper studies how to go beyond relevance
and enable a filtering system to learn more in-
teresting and detailed data driven user models
from multiple forms of evidence. We carry out
a user study using a real time web based per-
sonal news filtering system, and collect exten-
sive multiple forms of evidence, including ex-
plicit and implicit user feedback. We explore
the graphical modeling approach to combine
these forms of evidence. To test whether the ap-
proach can help us understand the domain bet-
ter, we use graph structure learning algorithm
to derive the causal relationships between dif-
ferent forms of evidence. To test whether the
approach can help the system improve the per-
formance, we use the graphical inference algo-
rithms to predict whether a user likes a docu-
ment based on multiple forms of evidence. The
results show that combining multiple forms
of evidence using graphical models can help
us better understand the filtering problem, im-
prove filtering system performance, and handle
various data missing situations naturally.
