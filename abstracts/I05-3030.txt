This paper presents our recent work for 
participation in the Second Interna-
tional Chinese Word Segmentation 
Bakeoff. According to difficulties, we 
divide word segmentation into several 
sub-tasks, which are solved by mixed 
language models, so as to take advan-
tage of each approach in addressing 
special problems. The experiment indi-
cated that this system achieved 96.7% 
and 97.2% in F-measure in PKU and 
MSR open test respectively.
