This paper explores interoperability for
data represented using the Graph Anno-
tation Framework (GrAF) (Ide and Sud-
erman, 2007) and the data formats uti-
lized by two general-purpose annotation
systems: the General Architecture for Text
Engineering (GATE) (Cunningham, 2002)
and the Unstructured Information Man-
agement Architecture (UIMA). GrAF is
intended to serve as a ?pivot? to enable
interoperability among different formats,
and both GATE and UIMA are at least im-
plicitly designed with an eye toward inter-
operability with other formats and tools.
We describe the steps required to per-
form a round-trip rendering from GrAF to
GATE and GrAF to UIMA CAS and back
again, and outline the commonalities as
well as the differences and gaps that came
to light in the process.
