Since the Web consists of documents in
various domains or genres, the method
for Cross-Language Information Retrieval
(CLIR) of Web documents should be in-
dependent of a particular domain. In this
paper, we propose a CLIR method which
employs a Web directory provided in mul-
tiple language versions (such as Yahoo!).
In the proposed method, feature terms are
first extracted from Web documents for
each category in the source and the tar-
get languages. Then, one or more corre-
sponding categories in another language
are determined beforehand by comparing
similarities between categories across lan-
guages. Using these category pairs, we in-
tend to resolve ambiguities of simple dic-
tionary translation by narrowing the cat-
egories to be retrieved in the target lan-
guage.
