This paper describes the development of
several machine translation systems for
the 2009 WMT shared task evaluation.
We only consider the translation between
French and English. We describe a sta-
tistical system based on the Moses de-
coder and a statistical post-editing sys-
tem using SYSTRAN?s rule-based system.
We also investigated techniques to auto-
matically extract additional bilingual texts
from comparable corpora.
