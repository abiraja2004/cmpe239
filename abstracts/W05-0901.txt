This paper demonstrates the usefulness of sum-
maries in an extrinsic task of relevance judgment
based on a new method for measuring agree-
ment, Relevance-Prediction, which compares sub-
jects? judgments on summaries with their own judg-
ments on full text documents. We demonstrate that,
because this measure is more reliable than previ-
ous gold-standard measures, we are able to make
stronger statistical statements about the benefits of
summarization. We found positive correlations be-
tween ROUGE scores and two different summary
types, where only weak or negative correlations
were found using other agreement measures. How-
ever, we show that ROUGE may be sensitive to the
choice of summarization style. We discuss the im-
portance of these results and the implications for fu-
ture summarization evaluations.
