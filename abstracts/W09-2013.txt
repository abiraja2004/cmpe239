We are interested in the ways that language
is used to achieve a variety of goals, where
the same utterance may have vastly different
consequences in different situations. This is
closely related to the topic of creativity in lan-
guage. The fact that the same utterance can
be used to achieve a variety of goals opens up
the possibility of using it to achieve new goals.
The current paper concentrates largely on an
implemented system for exploring how the ef-
fects of an utterance depend on the situation
in which it is produced, but we will end with
some speculations about how how utterances
can come to have new kinds of uses.
