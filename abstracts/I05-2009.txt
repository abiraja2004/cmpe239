 
We describe our analysis and modeling 
of the summarization process of Japa-
nese broadcast news. We have studied 
the entire manual summarization proc-
ess of the Japan Broadcasting Corpora-
tion (NHK). The staff of NHK has been 
making manual summarizations of 
news text on a daily basis since De-
cember 2000. We interviewed these 
professional abstractors and obtained a 
considerable amount of news summa-
ries. We matched the summary with the 
original text, investigated the news text 
structure, and thereby analyzed the 
manual summarization process. We 
then developed a summarization model 
on which we intend to build a summa-
rization system.
