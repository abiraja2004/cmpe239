Feature feedback is an alternative to instance
labeling when seeking supervision from hu-
man experts. Combination of instance and
feature feedback has been shown to reduce the
total annotation cost for supervised learning.
However, learning problems may not benefit
equally from feature feedback. It is well un-
derstood that the benefit from feature feed-
back reduces as the amount of training data
increases. We show that other characteristics
such as domain, instance granularity, feature
space, instance selection strategy and propor-
tion of relevant text, have a significant effect
on benefit from feature feedback. We estimate
the maximum benefit feature feedback may
provide; our estimate does not depend on how
the feedback is solicited and incorporated into
the model. We extend the complexity mea-
sures proposed in the literature and propose
some new ones to categorize learning prob-
lems, and find that they are strong indicators
of the benefit from feature feedback.
