The SAVE Science project is an attempt to ad-
dress the shortcomings of current assessments
of science. The project has developed two vir-
tual worlds that each have a mystery or natu-
ral phenomenon requiring scientific explana-
tion; by recording students? behavior as they
investigate the mystery, these worlds can be
used to assess their understanding of the scien-
tific method. Currently, however, the scoring
of the assessment depends either on manual
grading of students? written responses, or, on
multiple choice questions. This paper presents
an automated grader that can combine with
SAVE Science?s virtual worlds to provide a
cheap mechanism for assessments of the abil-
ity to apply scientific methodology. In experi-
ments on over 300 middle school students, our
best automated grader improves by over 50%
relative to the closest system from previous
work in predicting grades supplied by human
judges.
