In a multilingual scenario, the classical
monolingual text categorization problem
can be reformulated as a cross language
TC task, in which we have to cope with
two or more languages (e.g. English and
Italian). In this setting, the system is
trained using labeled examples in a source
language (e.g. English), and it classifies
documents in a different target language
(e.g. Italian).
In this paper we propose a novel ap-
proach to solve the cross language text
categorization problem based on acquir-
ing Multilingual Domain Models from
comparable corpora in a totally unsuper-
vised way and without using any external
knowledge source (e.g. bilingual dictio-
naries). These Multilingual Domain Mod-
els are exploited to define a generalized
similarity function (i.e. a kernel function)
among documents in different languages,
which is used inside a Support Vector Ma-
chines classification framework. The re-
sults show that our approach is a feasi-
ble and cheap solution that largely outper-
forms a baseline.
