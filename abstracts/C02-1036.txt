 
We profile the occurrence of clausal 
extraposition in corpora from different 
domains and demonstrate that extraposition 
is a pervasive phenomenon in German that 
must be addressed in German sentence 
realization. We present two different 
approaches to the modeling of extraposition, 
both based on machine learned decision tree 
classifiers. The two approaches differ in their 
view of the movement operation: one 
approach models multi-step movement 
through intermediate nodes to the ultimate 
target node, while the other approach models 
one-step movement to the target node. We 
compare the resulting models, trained on data 
from two domains and discuss the 
differences between the two types of models 
and between the results obtained in the 
different domains.
