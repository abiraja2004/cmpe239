Summarization, like other natural language
processing tasks, is tackled with a range
of different techniques - particularly ma-
chine learning approaches, where human
intuition goes into attribute selection and
the choice and tuning of the learning algo-
rithm. Such techniques tend to apply dif-
ferently in different contexts, so in this pa-
per we describe a hybrid approach in which
a number of different summarization tech-
niques are combined in a rule-based sys-
tem using manual knowledge acquisition,
where human intuition, supported by data,
specifies not only attributes and algorithms,
but the contexts where these are best used.
We apply this approach to automatic sum-
marization of legal case reports. We show
how a preliminary knowledge base, com-
posed of only 23 rules, already outperforms
competitive baselines.
