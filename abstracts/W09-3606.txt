Practitioners and researchers need to stay
up-to-date with the latest advances in
their fields, but the constant growth in
the amount of literature available makes
this task increasingly difficult. We in-
vestigated the literature browsing task via
a user requirements analysis, and identi-
fied the information needs that biomed-
ical researchers commonly encounter in
this application scenario. Our analysis re-
veals that a number of literature-based re-
search tasks are preformed which can be
served by both generic and contextually
tailored preview summaries. Based on this
study, we describe the design of an im-
plemented literature browsing support tool
which helps readers of scientific literature
decide whether or not to pursue and read a
cited document. We present findings from
a preliminary user evaluation, suggesting
that our prototype helps users make rele-
vance judgements about cited documents.
