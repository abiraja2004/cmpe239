In this paper, we propose a simple and
effective approach to domain adaptation
for dependency parsing. This is a fea-
ture augmentation approach in which the
new features are constructed based on sub-
tree information extracted from the auto-
parsed target domain data. To demon-
strate the effectiveness of the proposed ap-
proach, we evaluate it on three pairs of
source-target data, compared with sever-
al common baseline systems and previous
approaches. Our approach achieves signif-
icant improvement on all the three pairs of
data sets.
