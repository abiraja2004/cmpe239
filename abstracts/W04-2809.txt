 
A scalable natural language generation (NLG) 
system called HYPERBUG 1  embedded in an 
agent-based, multimodal dialog system is pre-
sented. To motivate this presentation, several 
scenarios (including a domain shift) are iden-
tified where scalability in dialog systems is 
really needed, and NLG is argued to be one 
way of easing this desired scalability. There-
fore the novel approach to hybrid NLG in the 
HYPERBUG system is described and the scal-
ability of its parts and resources is investi-
gated. Concluding with a few remarks to 
discourse generation, we argue that NLG can 
both contribute to and benefit from scalability 
in dialog systems.
