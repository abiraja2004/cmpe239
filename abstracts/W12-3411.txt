Korean is a morphologically rich language in
which grammatical functions are marked by
inflections and affixes, and they can indicate
grammatical relations such as subject, object,
predicate, etc. A Korean sentence could be
thought as a sequence of eojeols. An eo-
jeol is a word or its variant word form ag-
glutinated with grammatical affixes, and eo-
jeols are separated by white space as in En-
glish written texts. Korean treebanks (Choi
et al, 1994; Han et al, 2002; Korean Lan-
guage Institute, 2012) use eojeol as their fun-
damental unit of analysis, thus representing
an eojeol as a prepreterminal phrase inside
the constituent tree. This eojeol-based an-
notating schema introduces various complex-
ity to train the parser, for example an en-
tity represented by a sequence of nouns will
be annotated as two or more different noun
phrases, depending on the number of spaces
used. In this paper, we propose methods to
transform eojeol-based Korean treebanks into
entity-based Korean treebanks. The methods
are applied to Sejong treebank, which is the
largest constituent treebank in Korean, and the
transformed treebank is used to train and test
various probabilistic CFG parsers. The experi-
mental result shows that the proposed transfor-
mation methods reduce ambiguity in the train-
ing corpus, increasing the overall F1 score up
to about 9 %.
