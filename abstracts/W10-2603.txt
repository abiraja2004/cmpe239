  We are interested in improving the sum-marization of conversations by using domain adaptation. Since very few email corpora have been annotated for summa-rization purposes, we attempt to leverage the labeled data available in the multi-party meetings domain for the summari-zation of email threads. In this paper, we compare several approaches to super-vised domain adaptation using out-of-domain labeled data, and also try to use unlabeled data in the target domain through semi-supervised domain adapta-tion. From the results of our experiments, we conclude that with some in-domain labeled data, training in-domain with no adaptation is most effective, but that when there is no labeled in-domain data, domain adaptation algorithms such as structural correspondence learning can improve summarization.  1
