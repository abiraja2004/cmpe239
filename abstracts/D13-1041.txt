Entity disambiguation works by linking am-
biguous mentions in text to their correspond-
ing real-world entities in knowledge base. Re-
cent collective disambiguation methods en-
force coherence among contextual decisions
at the cost of non-trivial inference processes.
We propose a fast collective disambiguation
approach based on stacking. First, we train a
local predictor g0 with learning to rank as base
learner, to generate initial ranking list of can-
didates. Second, top k candidates of related
instances are searched for constructing expres-
sive global coherence features. A global pre-
dictor g1 is trained in the augmented feature
space and stacking is employed to tackle the
train/test mismatch problem. The proposed
method is fast and easy to implement. Exper-
iments show its effectiveness over various al-
gorithms on several public datasets. By learn-
ing a rich semantic relatedness measure be-
tween entity categories and context document,
performance is further improved.
