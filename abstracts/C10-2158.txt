Empty categories represent an impor-
tant source of information in syntactic
parses annotated in the generative linguis-
tic tradition, but empty category recovery
has only started to receive serious atten-
tion until very recently, after substantial
progress in statistical parsing. This paper
describes a unified framework in recover-
ing empty categories in the Chinese Tree-
bank. Our results show that given skele-
tal gold standard parses, the empty cate-
gories can be detected with very high ac-
curacy. We report very promising results
for empty category recovery for automatic
parses as well.
