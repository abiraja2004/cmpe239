This paper presents latent semantic gram-
mars for the unsupervised induction of
English grammar. Latent semantic gram-
mars were induced by applying singu-
lar value decomposition to n-gram by
context-feature matrices. Parsing was
used to evaluate performance. Exper-
iments with context, projectivity, and
prior distributions show the relative per-
formance effects of these kinds of prior
knowledge. Results show that prior dis-
tributions, projectivity, and part of speech
information are not necessary to beat the
right branching baseline.
