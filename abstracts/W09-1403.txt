We describe the approach to event extrac-
tion which the JULIELab Team from FSU
Jena (Germany) pursued to solve Task 1 in
the ?BioNLP?09 Shared Task on Event Ex-
traction?. We incorporate manually curated
dictionaries and machine learning method-
ologies to sort out associated event triggers
and arguments on trimmed dependency graph
structures. Trimming combines pruning ir-
relevant lexical material from a dependency
graph and decorating particularly relevant lex-
ical material from that graph with more ab-
stract conceptual class information. Given
that methodological framework, the JULIELab
Team scored on 2nd rank among 24 competing
teams, with 45.8% precision, 47.5% recall and
46.7% F1-score on all 3,182 events.
