This paper describes a factored approach to
incorporating soft source syntactic constraints
into a hierarchical phrase-based translation
system. In contrast to traditional approaches
that directly introduce syntactic constraints to
translation rules by explicitly decorating them
with syntactic annotations, which often ex-
acerbate the data sparsity problem and cause
other problems, our approach keeps transla-
tion rules intact and factorizes the use of syn-
tactic constraints through two separate mod-
els: 1) a syntax mismatch model that asso-
ciates each nonterminal of a translation rule
with a distribution of tags that is used to
measure the degree of syntactic compatibil-
ity of the translation rule on source spans; 2)
a syntax-based reordering model that predicts
whether a pair of sibling constituents in the
constituent parse tree of the source sentence
should be reordered or not when translated to
the target language. The features produced
by both models are used as soft constraints
to guide the translation process. Experiments
on Chinese-English translation show that the
proposed approach significantly improves a
strong string-to-dependency translation sys-
tem on multiple evaluation sets.
