Phrasal segmentation models define a
mapping from the words of a sentence
to sequences of translatable phrases. We
discuss the estimation of these models
from large quantities of monolingual train-
ing text and describe their realization as
weighted finite state transducers for incor-
poration into phrase-based statistical ma-
chine translation systems. Results are re-
ported on the NIST Arabic-English trans-
lation tasks showing significant comple-
mentary gains in BLEU score with large
5-gram and 6-gram language models.
