Using finite-state automata for the text analysis
component in a text-to-speech system is problem-
atic in several respects: the rewrite rules from which
the automata are compiled are difficult to write and
maintain, and the resulting automata can become
very large and therefore inefficient. Converting the
knowledge represented explicitly in rewrite rules
into a more efficient format is difficult. We take an
indirect route, learning an efficient decision tree rep-
resentation from data and tapping information con-
tained in existing rewrite rules, which increases per-
formance compared to learning exclusively from a
pronunciation lexicon.
