 
We conduct a series of Part-of-Speech 
(POS) Tagging experiments using Ex-
pectation Maximization (EM), Varia-
tional Bayes (VB) and Gibbs Sampling 
(GS) against the Chinese Penn Tree-
bank.  We want to first establish a base-
line for unsupervised POS tagging in 
Chinese, which will facilitate future re-
search in this area.  Secondly, by com-
paring and analyzing the results between 
Chinese and English, we highlight some 
of the strengths and weaknesses of each 
of the algorithms in POS tagging task 
and attempt to explain the differences 
based on some preliminary linguistics 
analysis.  Comparing to English, we find 
that all algorithms perform rather poorly 
in Chinese in 1-to-1 accuracy result but 
are more competitive in many-to-1 accu-
racy.  We attribute one possible explana-
tion of this to the algorithms? inability to 
correctly produce tags that match the 
desired tag count distribution.
