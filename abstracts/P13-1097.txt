 
Sentiment Similarity of word pairs reflects the 
distance between the words regarding their 
underlying sentiments. This paper aims to in-
fer the sentiment similarity between word 
pairs with respect to their senses. To achieve 
this aim, we propose a probabilistic emotion-
based approach that is built on a hidden emo-
tional model. The model aims to predict a vec-
tor of basic human emotions for each sense of 
the words. The resultant emotional vectors are 
then employed to infer the sentiment similarity 
of word pairs. We apply the proposed ap-
proach to address two main NLP tasks, name-
ly, Indirect yes/no Question Answer Pairs in-
ference and Sentiment Orientation prediction. 
Extensive experiments demonstrate the effec-
tiveness of the proposed approach.
