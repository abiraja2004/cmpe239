We present a novel application of NLP
and text mining to the analysis of finan-
cial documents. In particular, we de-
scribe an implemented prototype, May-
tag, which combines information extrac-
tion and subject classification tools in an
interactive exploratory framework. We
present experimental results on their per-
formance, as tailored to the financial do-
main, and some forward-looking exten-
sions to the approach that enables users
to specify classifications on the fly.
