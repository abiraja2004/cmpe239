Statistical machine translation (SMT) mod-
els need large bilingual corpora for train-
ing, which are unavailable for some language
pairs. This paper provides the first serious ex-
perimental study of active learning for SMT.
We use active learning to improve the qual-
ity of a phrase-based SMT system, and show
significant improvements in translation com-
pared to a random sentence selection baseline,
when test and training data are taken from the
same or different domains. Experimental re-
sults are shown in a simulated setting using
three language pairs, and in a realistic situa-
tion for Bangla-English, a language pair with
limited translation resources.
