In this paper, we argue in favor of re-
considering models for word meaning, us-
ing as a basis results from cognitive sci-
ence on human concept representation.
More specifically, we argue for a more
flexible representation of word meaning
than the assignment of a single best-fitting
dictionary sense to each occurrence: Ei-
ther use dictionary senses, but view them
as having fuzzy boundaries, and assume
that an occurrence can activate multiple
senses to different degrees. Or move away
from dictionary senses completely, and
only model similarities between individ-
ual word usages. We argue that distri-
butional models provide a flexible frame-
work for experimenting with alternative
models of word meanings, and discuss ex-
ample models.
