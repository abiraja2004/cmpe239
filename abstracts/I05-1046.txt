. Converting questions to effective queries is crucial to open-domain 
question answering systems. In this paper, we present a web-based 
unsupervised learning approach for transforming a given natural-language 
question to an effective query. The method involves querying a search engine 
for Web passages that contain the answer to the question, extracting patterns 
that characterize fine-grained classification for answers, and linking these 
patterns with n-grams in answer passages. Independent evaluation on a set of 
questions shows that the proposed approach outperforms a naive keyword-
based approach in terms of mean reciprocal rank and human effort.
