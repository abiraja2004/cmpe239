In this paper, we present a method which, in
practice, allows to use parsers for languages
defined by very large context-free grammars
(over a million symbol occurrences). The
idea is to split the parsing process in two
passes. A first pass computes a sub-grammar
which is a specialized part of the large gram-
mar selected by the input text and various
filtering strategies. The second pass is a tra-
ditional parser which works with the sub-
grammar and the input text. This approach
is validated by practical experiments per-
formed on a Earley-like parser running on
a test set with two large context-free gram-
mars.
