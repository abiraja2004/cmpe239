 
Our aim in this paper is to identify genre- 
independent factors that influence the decision to 
pronominalize. Results based on the annotation of 
twelve texts from four genres show that only a few 
factors have a strong influence on pronominaliza- 
tion across genres, i.e. distance from last mention, 
agreement, and form of the antecedent. Finally, we 
describe aprobabilistic model of pronominalization 
derived from our data.
