 
In this paper we present validation tests 
that we have carried out on gestures that 
we have designed for an embodied conver-
sational agent (ECAs), to assess their 
soundness with a view to applying said 
gestures in a forthcoming experiment to 
explore the possibilities ECAs can offer to 
overcome typical robustness problems in 
spoken language dialogue systems 
(SLDSs). The paper is divided into two 
parts: First we carry our a literature review 
to acquire a sense of the extent to which 
ECAs can help overcome user frustration 
during human-machine interaction. Then 
we associate tentative, yet specific, ECA 
gestural behaviour with each of the main 
dialogue stages, with special emphasis on 
problem situations. In the second part we 
describe the tests we have carried out to 
validate our ECA?s gestural repertoire. The 
results obtained show that users generally 
understand and naturally accept the ges-
tures, to a reasonable degree. This encour-
ages us to proceed with the next stage of 
research: evaluating the gestural strategy in 
real dialogue situations with the aim of 
learning about how to favour a more effi-
cient and pleasant dialogue flow for the us-
ers.
