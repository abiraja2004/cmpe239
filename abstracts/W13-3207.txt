We introduce a new 50-dimensional em-
bedding obtained by spectral clustering of
a graph describing the conceptual struc-
ture of the lexicon. We use the embedding
directly to investigate sets of antonymic
pairs, and indirectly to argue that func-
tion application in CVSMs requires not
just vectors but two transformations (cor-
responding to subject and object) as well.
