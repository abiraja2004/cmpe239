Abstract
This paper summarizes IRST?s participation in
Senseval-3. We participated both in the English all-
words task and in some lexical sample tasks (En-
glish, Basque, Catalan, Italian, Spanish). We fol-
lowed two perspectives. On one hand, for the all-
words task, we tried to refine the Domain Driven
Disambiguation that we presented at Senseval-2.
The refinements consist of both exploiting a new
technique (Domain Relevance Estimation) for do-
main detection in texts, and experimenting with the
use of Latent Semantic Analysis to avoid reliance on
manually annotated domain resources (e.g. WORD-
NET DOMAINS). On the other hand, for the lexical
sample tasks, we explored the direction of pattern
abstraction and we demonstrated the feasibility of
leveraging external knowledge using kernel meth-
ods.
