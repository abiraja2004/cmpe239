 
In this paper, we will present an efficient 
method to compute the co-occurrence 
counts of any pair of substring in a paral-
lel corpus, and an algorithm that make 
use of these counts to create sub-
sentential alignments on such a corpus. 
This algorithm has the advantage of be-
ing as general as possible regarding the 
segmentation of text.
