In this paper we describe a new approach
to model long-range word reorderings in
statistical machine translation (SMT). Un-
til now, most SMT approaches are only
able to model local reorderings. But even
the word order of related languages like
German and English can be very different.
In recent years approaches that reorder the
source sentence in a preprocessing step
to better match target sentences according
to POS(Part-of-Speech)-based rules have
been applied successfully. We enhance
this approach to model long-range reorder-
ings by introducing discontinuous rules.
We tested this new approach on a German-
English translation task and could signifi-
cantly improve the translation quality, by
up to 0.8 BLEU points, compared to a sys-
tem which already uses continuous POS-
based rules to model short-range reorder-
ings.
