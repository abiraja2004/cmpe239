This paper presents results of using be-
lief functions to rank the list of candi-
date information provided in a noisy di-
alogue input. The information under con-
sideration is the intended task to be per-
formed and the information provided for
the completion of the task. As an exam-
ple, we use the task of information ac-
cess in a multi-domain dialogue system.
Currently, the system contains knowledge
of ten different domains. Callers calling
in are greeted with an open-ended ?How
may I help you?? prompt (Thomson and
Wisowaty, 1999; Chu-Carroll and Carpen-
ter, 1999; Gorin et al, 1997). After re-
ceiving a reply from the caller, we extract
word evidences from the recognized utter-
ances. By using transferable belief model
(TBM), we in turn determine the task that
the caller intends to perform as well as any
information provided.
