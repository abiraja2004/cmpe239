We present a fast query-based multi-document
summarizer called FastSum based solely on
word-frequency features of clusters, docu-
ments and topics. Summary sentences are
ranked by a regression SVM. The summa-
rizer does not use any expensive NLP tech-
niques such as parsing, tagging of names or
even part of speech information. Still, the
achieved accuracy is comparable to the best
systems presented in recent academic com-
petitions (i.e., Document Understanding Con-
ference (DUC)). Because of a detailed fea-
ture analysis using Least Angle Regression
(LARS), FastSum can rely on a minimal set of
features leading to fast processing times: 1250
news documents in 60 seconds.
