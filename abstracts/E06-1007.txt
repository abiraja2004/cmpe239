We present an implemented machine
learning system for the automatic detec-
tion of nonreferential it in spoken dialog.
The system builds on shallow features ex-
tracted from dialog transcripts. Our exper-
iments indicate a level of performance that
makes the system usable as a preprocess-
ing filter for a coreference resolution sys-
tem. We also report results of an annota-
tion study dealing with the classification of
it by naive subjects.
