The ability to request clarication
of utterances is a vital part of the
communicative process. In this pa-
per we discuss the range of possi-
ble forms for clarication requests,
together with the range of read-
ings they can convey. We present
the results of corpus analysis which
show a correlation between certain
forms and possible readings, to-
gether with some indication of maxi-
mum likely distance between request
and the utterance being claried.
We then explain the implications of
these results for a possible HPSG
analysis of clarication requests and
for an ongoing implementation of
a clarication-capable dialogue sys-
tem.
