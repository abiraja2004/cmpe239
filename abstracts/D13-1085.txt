Linking name mentions in microblog posts to
a knowledge base, namely microblog entity
linking, is useful for text mining tasks on mi-
croblog. Entity linking in long text has been
well studied in previous works. However few
work has focused on short text such as mi-
croblog post. Microblog posts are short and
noisy. Previous method can extract few fea-
tures from the post context. In this paper we
propose to use extra posts for the microblog
entity linking task. Experimental results show
that our proposed method significantly im-
proves the linking accuracy over traditional
methods by 8.3% and 7.5% respectively.
