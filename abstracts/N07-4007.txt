This demonstration will illustrate interac-
tive computer games intended to help a
native speaker of English learn Mandarin.
These systems provide users with human-
like conversational exercises with contex-
tualized help mechanisms. Two distinctly
different activities, a translation game and
a dialogue game are illustrated. The level
of difficulty can be manipulated, and the
sentence variations covered by the sys-
tems familiarize users with different ex-
pressions of the same meaning. The sys-
tems preserve the qualities of a typical
computer system, being infinitely patient
and available any time of day. Students
will be able to repeatedly practice conver-
sation with no embarrassment.
