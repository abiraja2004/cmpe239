 
In this paper we present KNOWA, an 
English/Italian word aligner, developed at ITC-irst, 
which relies mostly on information contained in 
bilingual dictionaries. The performances of 
KNOWA are compared with those of GIZA++, a 
state of the art statistics-based alignment algorithm. 
The two algorithms are evaluated on the EuroCor 
and MultiSemCor tasks, that is on two 
English/Italian publicly available parallel corpora. 
The results of the evaluation show that, given the 
nature and the size of the available English-Italian 
parallel corpora, a language-resource-based word 
aligner such as KNOWA can outperform a fully 
statistics-based algorithm such as GIZA++.
