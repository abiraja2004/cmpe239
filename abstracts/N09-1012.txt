Unsupervised grammar induction models tend
to employ relatively simple models of syntax
when compared to their supervised counter-
parts. Traditionally, the unsupervised mod-
els have been kept simple due to tractabil-
ity and data sparsity concerns. In this paper,
we introduce basic valence frames and lexi-
cal information into an unsupervised depen-
dency grammar inducer and show how this
additional information can be leveraged via
smoothing. Our model produces state-of-the-
art results on the task of unsupervised gram-
mar induction, improving over the best previ-
ous work by almost 10 percentage points.
