This paper proposes a nonparametric
Bayesian method for inducing Part-of-
Speech (POS) tags in dependency trees
to improve the performance of statistical
machine translation (SMT). In particular,
we extend the monolingual infinite tree
model (Finkel et al, 2007) to a bilin-
gual scenario: each hidden state (POS tag)
of a source-side dependency tree emits a
source word together with its aligned tar-
get word, either jointly (joint model), or
independently (independent model). Eval-
uations of Japanese-to-English translation
on the NTCIR-9 data show that our in-
duced Japanese POS tags for dependency
trees improve the performance of a forest-
to-string SMT system. Our independent
model gains over 1 point in BLEU by re-
solving the sparseness problem introduced
in the joint model.
