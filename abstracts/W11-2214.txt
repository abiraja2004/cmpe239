Word Sense Induction (WSI) is an unsuper-
vised learning approach to discovering the dif-
ferent senses of a word from its contextual
uses. A core challenge to WSI approaches
is distinguishing between related and possibly
similar senses of a word. Current WSI evalu-
ation techniques have yet to analyze the spe-
cific impact of similarity on accuracy. There-
fore, we present a new WSI evaluation that
quantifies the relationship between the relat-
edness of a word?s senses and the ability of a
WSI algorithm to distinguish between them.
Furthermore, we perform an analysis on sense
confusions in SemEval-2 WSI task according
to sense similarity. Both analyses for a rep-
resentative selection of clustering-based WSI
approaches reveals that performance is most
sensitive to the clustering algorithm and not
the lexical features used.
