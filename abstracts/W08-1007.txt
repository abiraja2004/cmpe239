We present a dependency-driven parser that
parses both dependency structures and con-
stituent structures. Constituency representa-
tions are automatically transformed into de-
pendency representations with complex arc la-
bels, which makes it possible to recover the
constituent structure with both constituent la-
bels and grammatical functions. We report a
labeled attachment score close to 90% for de-
pendency versions of the TIGER and Tu?Ba-
D/Z treebanks. Moreover, the parser is able to
recover both constituent labels and grammat-
ical functions with an F-Score over 75% for
Tu?Ba-D/Z and over 65% for TIGER.
