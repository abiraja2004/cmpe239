A semantic class is a collection of items 
(words or phrases) which have semantically 
peer or sibling relationship. This paper studies 
the employment of topic models to automati-
cally construct semantic classes, taking as the 
source data a collection of raw semantic 
classes (RASCs), which were extracted by ap-
plying predefined patterns to web pages. The 
primary requirement (and challenge) here is 
dealing with multi-membership: An item may 
belong to multiple semantic classes; and we 
need to discover as many as possible the dif-
ferent semantic classes the item belongs to. To 
adopt topic models, we treat RASCs as ?doc-
uments?, items as ?words?, and the final se-
mantic classes as ?topics?. Appropriate 
preprocessing and postprocessing are per-
formed to improve results quality, to reduce 
computation cost, and to tackle the fixed-k 
constraint of a typical topic model. Experi-
ments conducted on 40 million web pages 
show that our approach could yield better re-
sults than alternative approaches.
