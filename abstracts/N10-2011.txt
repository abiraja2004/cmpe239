 
SIMPLIFICA is an authoring tool for produc-
ing simplified texts in Portuguese. It provides 
functionalities for lexical and syntactic simpli-
fication and for readability assessment. This 
tool is the first of its kind for Portuguese; it 
brings innovative aspects for simplification 
tools in general, since the authoring process is 
guided by readability assessment based on the 
levels of literacy of the Brazilian population.
