Active learning has been applied to dif-
ferent NLP tasks, with the aim of limit-
ing the amount of time and cost for human
annotation. Most studies on active learn-
ing have only simulated the annotation
scenario, using prelabelled gold standard
data. We present the first active learning
experiment for Word Sense Disambigua-
tion with human annotators in a realistic
environment, using fine-grained sense dis-
tinctions, and investigate whether AL can
reduce annotation cost and boost classifier
performance when applied to a real-world
task.
