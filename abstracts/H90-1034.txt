 
In this paper we discuss recent results from our efforts 
to make SPHINX, the CMU continuous-speech speaker- 
independent recognition system, robust to changes in the 
environment. To deal with differences in noise level and 
spectral tilt between close-talking and desk-top 
microphones, we describe two novel methods based on ad- 
ditive corrections in the cepstral domain. In the first algo- 
rithm, an additive correction is imposed that depends on 
the instantaneous SNR of the signal. In the second tech- 
nique, EM techniques are used to best match the cepstral 
vectors of the input utterances tothe ensemble of codebook 
entries representing a standard acoustical mbience. Use of 
these algorithms dramatically improves recognition ac- 
curacy when the system is tested on a microphone other 
than the one on which it was trained.
