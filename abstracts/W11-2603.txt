Small, manually assembled corpora may be avail-
able for less dominant languages and dialects,
but producing web-scale resources remains a chal-
lenge. Even when considerable quantities of text
are present on the web, finding this text, and distin-
guishing it from related languages in the same region
can be difficult. For example less dominant vari-
ants of English (e.g. New Zealander, Singaporean,
Canadian, Irish, South African) may be found under
their respective national domains, but will be par-
tially mixed with Englishes of the British and US
varieties, perhaps through syndication of journalism,
or the local reuse of text by multinational compa-
nies. Less formal dialectal usage may be scattered
more widely over the internet through mechanisms
such as wiki or blog authoring. Here we automati-
cally construct a corpus of Hiberno-English (English
as spoken in Ireland) using a variety of methods: fil-
tering by national domain, filtering by orthographic
conventions, and bootstrapping from a set of Ireland-
specific terms (slang, place names, organisations).
We evaluate the national specificity of the resulting
corpora by measuring the incidence of topical terms,
and several grammatical constructions that are par-
ticular to Hiberno-English. The results show that
domain filtering is very effective for isolating text
that is topic-specific, and orthographic classification
can exclude some non-Irish texts, but that selected
seeds are necessary to extract considerable quanti-
ties of more informal, dialectal text.
