In this paper we describe an unsuper-
vised WordNet-based Word Sense Disam-
biguation system, which participated (as
UMND1) in the SemEval-2007 Coarse-
grained English Lexical Sample task. The
system disambiguates a target word by using
WordNet-based measures of semantic relat-
edness to find the sense of the word that
is semantically most strongly related to the
senses of the words in the context of the tar-
get word. We briefly describe this system,
the configuration options used for the task,
and present some analysis of the results.
