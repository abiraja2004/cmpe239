In this paper, we outline the develop-
ment of a system that automatically con-
structs ontologies by extracting knowledge
from dictionary definition sentences us-
ing Robust Minimal Recursion Semantics
(RMRS). Combining deep and shallow
parsing resource through the common for-
malism of RMRS allows us to extract on-
tological relations in greater quantity and
quality than possible with any of the meth-
ods independently. Using this method,
we construct ontologies from two differ-
ent Japanese lexicons and one English lex-
icon. We then link them to existing, hand-
crafted ontologies, aligning them at the
word-sense level. This alignment provides
a representative evaluation of the qual-
ity of the relations being extracted. We
present the results of this ontology con-
struction and discuss how our system was
designed to handle multiple lexicons and
languages.
