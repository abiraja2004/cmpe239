Language model information retrieval de-
pends on accurate estimation of document
models. In this paper, we propose a docu-
ment expansion technique to deal with the
problem of insufficient sampling of docu-
ments. We construct a probabilistic neigh-
borhood for each document, and expand
the document with its neighborhood infor-
mation. The expanded document provides
a more accurate estimation of the docu-
ment model, thus improves retrieval ac-
curacy. Moreover, since document expan-
sion and pseudo feedback exploit different
corpus structures, they can be combined to
further improve performance. The experi-
ment results on several different data sets
demonstrate the effectiveness of the pro-
posed document expansion method.
