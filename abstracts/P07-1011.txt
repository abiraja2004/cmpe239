This paper studies the problem of identify-
ing erroneous/correct sentences. The prob-
lem has important applications, e.g., pro-
viding feedback for writers of English as
a Second Language, controlling the quality
of parallel bilingual sentences mined from
the Web, and evaluating machine translation
results. In this paper, we propose a new
approach to detecting erroneous sentences
by integrating pattern discovery with super-
vised learning models. Experimental results
show that our techniques are promising.
