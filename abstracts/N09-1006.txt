In this paper we explore a learning-based ap-
proach to the problem of predicting language
impairment in children. We analyzed sponta-
neous narratives of children and extracted fea-
tures measuring different aspects of language
including morphology, speech fluency, lan-
guage productivity and vocabulary. Then, we
evaluated a learning-based approach and com-
pared its predictive accuracy against a method
based on language models. Empirical re-
sults on monolingual English-speaking chil-
dren and bilingual Spanish-English speaking
children show the learning-based approach is
a promising direction for automatic language
assessment.
