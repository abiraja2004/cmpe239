We propose a novel lexicon acquirer that
works in concert with the morphological ana-
lyzer and has the ability to run in online mode.
Every time a sentence is analyzed, it detects
unknown morphemes, enumerates candidates
and selects the best candidates by comparing
multiple examples kept in the storage. When
a morpheme is unambiguously selected, the
lexicon acquirer updates the dictionary of the
analyzer, and it will be used in subsequent
analysis. We use the constraints of Japanese
morphology and effectively reduce the num-
ber of examples required to acquire a mor-
pheme. Experiments show that unknown mor-
phemes were acquired with high accuracy and
improved the quality of morphological analy-
sis.
