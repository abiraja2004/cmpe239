Due to the lack of annotated data sets, 
there are few studies on machine learning 
based approaches to extract named enti-
ties (NEs) in clinical text. The 2009 i2b2 
NLP challenge is a task to extract six 
types of medication related NEs, includ-
ing medication names, dosage, mode, 
frequency, duration, and reason from 
hospital discharge summaries. Several 
machine learning based systems have 
been developed and showed good per-
formance in the challenge. Those systems 
often involve two steps: 1) recognition of 
medication related entities; and 2) deter-
mination of the relation between a medi-
cation name and its modifiers (e.g., do-
sage). A few machine learning algo-
rithms including Conditional Random 
Field (CRF) and Maximum Entropy have 
been applied to the Named Entity Recog-
nition (NER) task at the first step. In this 
study, we developed a Support Vector 
Machine (SVM) based method to recog-
nize medication related entities. In addi-
tion, we systematically investigated vari-
ous types of features for NER in clinical 
text. Evaluation on 268 manually anno-
tated discharge summaries from i2b2 
challenge showed that the SVM-based 
NER system achieved the best F-score of 
90.05% (93.20% Precision, 87.12% Re-
call), when semantic features generated 
from a rule-based system were included.
