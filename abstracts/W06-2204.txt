The requirement for large labelled training
corpora is widely recognized as a key bot-
tleneck in the use of learning algorithms for
information extraction. We present TPLEX,
a semi-supervised learning algorithm for in-
formation extraction that can acquire extrac-
tion patterns from a small amount of labelled
text in conjunction with a large amount of un-
labelled text. Compared to previous work,
TPLEX has two novel features. First, the al-
gorithm does not require redundancy in the
fragments to be extracted, but only redundancy
of the extraction patterns themselves. Second,
most bootstrapping methods identify the high-
est quality fragments in the unlabelled data and
then assume that they are as reliable as man-
ually labelled data in subsequent iterations.
In contrast, TPLEX?s scoring mechanism pre-
vents errors from snowballing by recording
the reliability of fragments extracted from un-
labelled data. Our experiments with several
benchmarks demonstrate that TPLEX is usu-
ally competitive with various fully-supervised
algorithms when very little labelled training
data is available.
