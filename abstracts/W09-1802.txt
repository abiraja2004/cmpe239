We present an Integer Linear Program for
exact inference under a maximum coverage
model for automatic summarization. We com-
pare our model, which operates at the sub-
sentence or ?concept?-level, to a sentence-
level model, previously solved with an ILP.
Our model scales more efficiently to larger
problems because it does not require a
quadratic number of variables to address re-
dundancy in pairs of selected sentences. We
also show how to include sentence compres-
sion in the ILP formulation, which has the
desirable property of performing compression
and sentence selection simultaneously. The
resulting system performs at least as well as
the best systems participating in the recent
Text Analysis Conference, as judged by a va-
riety of automatic and manual content-based
metrics.
