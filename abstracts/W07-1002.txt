This paper demonstrates a method for de-
termining the syntactic structure of medi-
cal terms. We use a model-fitting method
based on the Log Likelihood Ratio to clas-
sify three-word medical terms as right or
left-branching. We validate this method by
computing the agreement between the clas-
sification produced by the method and man-
ually annotated classifications. The results
show an agreement of 75% - 83%. This
method may be used effectively to enable
a wide range of applications that depend
on the semantic interpretation of medical
terms including automatic mapping of terms
to standardized vocabularies and induction
of terminologies from unstructured medical
text.
