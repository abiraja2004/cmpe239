 
By generalizing the notion of location of a constituent to allow 
discontinuous Ioctaions, one can describe the discontinuous consti- 
tuents of non-configurational l nguages. These discontinuous consti- 
tuents can be described by a variant of definite clause grammars, 
and these grammars can be used in conjunction with a proof pro- 
cedure to create a parser for non-configurational languages.
