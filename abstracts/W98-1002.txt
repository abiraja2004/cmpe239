 
We describe a fast, high-performance name rec- 
ognizer for Arabic texts. It combines a pattern- 
matching engine and supporting data with a mor- 
phological analysis component. The role of the mor- 
phological analysis in accurate name recognition is 
discussed. VCe also provide evaluations of both mor- 
phological analysis and name recognition.
