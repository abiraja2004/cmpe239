This paper introduces Chart Inference (CI),
an algorithm for deriving a CCG category
for an unknown word from a partial parse
chart. It is shown to be faster and more pre-
cise than a baseline brute-force method, and
to achieve wider coverage than a rule-based
system. In addition, we show the application
of CI to a domain adaptation task for ques-
tion words, which are largely missing in the
Penn Treebank. When used in combination
with self-training, CI increases the precision
of the baseline StatCCG parser over subject-
extraction questions by 50%. An error analy-
sis shows that CI contributes to the increase by
expanding the number of category types avail-
able to the parser, while self-training adjusts
the counts.
