Text Understanding systems often commit
to a single best interpretation of a sen-
tence before analyzing subsequent text.
This interpretation is chosen by resolv-
ing ambiguous alternatives to the one with
the highest confidence, given the context
available at the time of commitment. Sub-
sequent text, however, may contain infor-
mation that changes the confidence of al-
ternatives. This may especially be the
case with multiple redundant texts on the
same topic. Ideally, systems would de-
lay choosing among ambiguous alterna-
tives until more text has been read.
One solution is to maintain multiple can-
didate interpretations of each sentence un-
til the system acquires disambiguating ev-
idence. Unfortunately, the number of al-
ternatives explodes quickly. In this pa-
per, we propose a packed graphical (PG)
representation that can efficiently repre-
sent a large number of alternative interpre-
tations along with dependencies among
them. We also present an algorithm for
combining multiple PG representations to
help resolve ambiguity and prune alterna-
tives when the time comes to commit to a
single interpretation.
Our controlled experiments show that by
delaying ambiguity resolution until multi-
ple texts have been read, our prototype?s
accuracy is higher than when committing
to interpretations sentence-by-sentence.
