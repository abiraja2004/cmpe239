 
One of the main problems of many 
commercial Machine Translation (MT) and 
experimental systems is that they do not carry 
out a correct pronominal naphora generation. 
As mentioned in Mitkov (1996), solving the 
anaphora nd extracting the antecedent are 
key issues in a correct translation. 
In this paper, we propose an Interlingual 
mechanism that we have called lnterlingual 
Slot Structure (ISS) based on Slot Structure 
(SS) presented in Ferrfindez et al (1997). The 
SS stores the lexical, syntactic, morphologic 
and semantic information of every constituent 
of the grammar. The mechanism 1SS allows us 
to translate pronouns between different 
languages. In this paper, we have proposed 
and evaluated ISS for the translation between 
Spanish and English languages. We have 
compared pronominal anaphora resolution 
both in English and Spanish to accomplish a 
study of the existing discrepancies between 
two languages. 
This mechanism could be added to a MT 
system such as an additional module to solve 
anaphora generation problem.
