 
It is common opinion that current 
hypertextual systems do not allow to express 
objectively the information content of 
documents, but only the view of the "author". 
The hyperlink building requires an heavy and 
highly specialised human intervention: this 
task is very expensive whenever possible! 
A different approach, based on NLP 
methodologies, aiming at automatizing the 
development of an hypertext, is hereafter 
proposed. Anchorage points are inferred both 
from content and structure of documents. A 
semantic lexicon based on conceptual graph 
structures i used to guide text understanding. 
Contextual roles are introduced to model 
domain specific concepts relevant to the 
navigation. An off-line activation of useful 
links has been defined according to explicit 
user specifications. A simple declarative 
language (HyDeL) for the definition of such 
links is available to the user to create his own 
views on the document base. HERMES is a 
prototype system implementing our approach. 
The paper discusses the semantic processing of 
a document base and highlights the 
performance of different hypertextual systems 
derived by HERMES over different languages 
and knowledge domains.
