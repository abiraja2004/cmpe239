For natural language understanding, it is es-
sential to reveal semantic relations between
words. To date, only the IS-A relation
has been publicly available. Toward deeper
natural language understanding, we semi-
automatically constructed the domain dic-
tionary that represents the domain relation
between Japanese fundamental words. This
is the first Japanese domain resource that is
fully available. Besides, our method does
not require a document collection, which is
indispensable for keyword extraction tech-
niques but is hard to obtain. As a task-based
evaluation, we performed blog categoriza-
tion. Also, we developed a technique for es-
timating the domain of unknown words.
