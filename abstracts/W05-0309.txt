The Proposition Bank (PropBank) project
is aimed at creating a corpus of text an-
notated with information about seman-
tic propositions. The second phase of
the project, PropBank II adds additional
levels of semantic annotation which in-
clude eventuality variables, co-reference,
coarse-grained sense tags, and discourse
connectives. This paper presents the re-
sults of the parallel PropBank II project,
which adds these richer layers of semantic
annotation to the first 100K of the Chinese
Treebank and its English translation. Our
preliminary analysis supports the hypoth-
esis that this additional annotation recon-
ciles many of the surface differences be-
tween the two languages.
