We introduce a novel method to jointly parse
and detect disfluencies in spoken utterances.
Our model can use arbitrary features for pars-
ing sentences and adapt itself with out-of-
domain data. We show that our method, based
on transition-based parsing, performs at a high
level of accuracy for both the parsing and
disfluency detection tasks. Additionally, our
method is the fastest for the joint task, running
in linear time.
