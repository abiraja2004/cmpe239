Presupposition relations between verbs are
not very well covered in existing lexical
semantic resources. We propose a weakly
supervised algorithm for learning presup-
position relations between verbs that dis-
tinguishes five semantic relations: presup-
position, entailment, temporal inclusion,
antonymy and other/no relation. We start
with a number of seed verb pairs selected
manually for each semantic relation and
classify unseen verb pairs. Our algorithm
achieves an overall accuracy of 36% for
type-based classification.
