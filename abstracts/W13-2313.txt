 
This paper discusses the problem of annotating 
coreference relations with generic expressions 
in a large scale corpus. We present and ana-
lyze some existing theories of genericity, 
compare them to the approaches to generics 
that are used in the state-of-the-art coreference 
annotation guidelines and discuss how coref-
erence of generic expressions is processed in 
the manual annotation of the Prague Depend-
ency Treebank. After analyzing some typical 
problematic issues we propose some partial 
solutions that can be used to enhance the 
quality and consistency of the annotation.
