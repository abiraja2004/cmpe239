This paper presents a theoretical approach
to the characterization of requests bound-
aries and structure in general spoken di-
alogue. Emphasis is laid on the fracture
between the illocutionary act of requesting
(for which the term ?request? is kept) and
the locutionary elements that carry it out
(its ?instantiation?). This approach leads to
a representation of requests based on the
inclusion of a semantic level under a prag-
matic level via a structural level. These
distinctions are meant to benefit to the
semantic-pragmatic segmentation of dia-
logue and the study of request strategies.
