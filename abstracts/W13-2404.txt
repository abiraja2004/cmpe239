Aspect-oriented opinion mining aims to
identify product aspects (features of prod-
ucts) about which opinion has been ex-
pressed in the text. We present an approach
for aspect-oriented opinion mining from
user reviews in Croatian. We propose meth-
ods for acquiring a domain-specific opinion
lexicon, linking opinion clues to product
aspects, and predicting polarity and rating
of reviews. We show that a supervised ap-
proach to linking opinion clues to aspects
is feasible, and that the extracted clues and
aspects improve polarity and rating predic-
tions.
