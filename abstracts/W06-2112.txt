The correct attachment of prepositional
phrases (PPs) is a central disambigua-
tion problem in parsing natural languages.
This paper compares the baseline situation
in English, German and Swedish based
on manual PP attachments in various tree-
banks for these languages. We argue that
cross-language comparisons of the disam-
biguation results in previous research is
impossible because of the different selec-
tion procedures when building the training
and test sets. We perform uniform tree-
bank queries and show that English has the
highest noun attachment rate followed by
Swedish and German. We also show that
the high rate in English is dominated by
the preposition of. From our study we de-
rive a list of criteria for profiling data sets
for PP attachment experiments.
