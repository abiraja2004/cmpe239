We describe our experiments with
phrase-based machine translation for
the WMT 2013 Shared Task. We
trained one system for 18 translation
directions between English or Czech
on one side and English, Czech, Ger-
man, Spanish, French or Russian on
the other side. We describe a set of re-
sults with different training data sizes
and subsets. For the pairs containing
Russian, we describe a set of indepen-
dent experiments with slightly different
translation models.
