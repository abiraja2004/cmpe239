 
This paper shows how lexical choice during text generation 
depemls on linguistic context. We argue that muking c(Irrect 
lexieal choice in rite textual context requires distinguishing 
properties of concepts, which are ntme or less independent of 
file language, from language-specific representations of text 
where lexemes and their semantic and symantic relations are 
represented. In particular, l.exical Fnnctions are well-suited to 
tormalizing anaphoric lexical links in text, including the 
introduction of superordinates. This sheds new light on the 
notion of "basic level", which has recently been applied to 
lexieM selection in genaration. Some consh'aints governing rite 
generation of lexical nnd grammatical naphora re proposed 
for procedural text, using examples front tim sublanguage of
recipes.
