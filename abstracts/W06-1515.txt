This paper compares two approaches to
computational semantics, namely seman-
tic unification in Lexicalized Tree Ad-
joining Grammars (LTAG) and Lexical
Resource Semantics (LRS) in HPSG.
There are striking similarities between the
frameworks that make them comparable in
many respects. We will exemplify the dif-
ferences and similarities by looking at sev-
eral phenomena. We will show, first of all,
that many intuitions about the mechanisms
of semantic computations can be imple-
mented in similar ways in both frame-
works. Secondly, we will identify some
aspects in which the frameworks intrin-
sically differ due to more general differ-
ences between the approaches to formal
grammar adopted by LTAG and HPSG.
