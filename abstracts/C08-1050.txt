Almost all automatic semantic role label-
ing (SRL) systems rely on a preliminary
parsing step that derives a syntactic struc-
ture from the sentence being analyzed.
This makes the choice of syntactic repre-
sentation an essential design decision. In
this paper, we study the influence of syn-
tactic representation on the performance
of SRL systems. Specifically, we com-
pare constituent-based and dependency-
based representations for SRL of English
in the FrameNet paradigm.
Contrary to previous claims, our results
demonstrate that the systems based on de-
pendencies perform roughly as well as
those based on constituents: For the ar-
gument classification task, dependency-
based systems perform slightly higher on
average, while the opposite holds for the
argument identification task. This is re-
markable because dependency parsers are
still in their infancy while constituent pars-
ing is more mature. Furthermore, the re-
sults show that dependency-based seman-
tic role classifiers rely less on lexicalized
features, which makes them more robust
to domain changes and makes them learn
more efficiently with respect to the amount
of training data.
