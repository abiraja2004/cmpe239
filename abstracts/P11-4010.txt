We present BLAST, an open source tool for er-
ror analysis of machine translation (MT) out-
put. We believe that error analysis, i.e., to
identify and classify MT errors, should be an
integral part of MT development, since it gives
a qualitative view, which is not obtained by
standard evaluation methods. BLAST can aid
MT researchers and users in this process, by
providing an easy-to-use graphical user inter-
face. It is designed to be flexible, and can be
used with any MT system, language pair, and
error typology. The annotation task can be
aided by highlighting similarities with a ref-
erence translation.
