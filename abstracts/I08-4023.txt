This paper presents the Chinese lexical
analysis systems developed by Natural
Language Processing Laboratory at Dalian
University of Technology, which were
evaluated in the 4th International Chinese
Language Processing Bakeoff. The HMM
and CRF hybrid model, which combines
character-based model with word-based
model in a directed graph, is adopted in
system developing. Both the closed and
open tracks regarding to Chinese word
segmentation, POS tagging and Chinese
Named Entity Recognition are involved in
our systems? evaluation, and good per-
formance are achieved. Especially, in the
open track of Chinese word segmentation
on SXU, our system ranks 1st.
