 
In the ACRONYM Project, we have taken the 
Firthian view (e.g. Firth 1957) that context is part 
of the meaning of the word, and measured 
similarity of meaning between words through 
second-order collocation. Using large-scale, free 
text corpora of UK journalism, we have generated 
collocational data for all words except for high- 
frequency grammatical words, and have found 
that semantically related word pairings can be 
identified, whilst syntactic relations are 
disfavoured. We have then moved on to refine 
this system, to deal with multi-word terms and 
identify changing conceptual relationships across 
time. The system, conceived in the late 80's and 
developed in 1994-97, differs from others of the 
90's in purpose, scope, methodology and results, 
and comparisons will be drawn in the course of 
the paper.
