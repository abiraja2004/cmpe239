As supervised machine learning methods for
addressing tasks in natural language process-
ing (NLP) prove increasingly viable, the fo-
cus of attention is naturally shifted towards the
creation of training data. The manual annota-
tion of corpora is a tedious and time consum-
ing process. To obtain high-quality annotated
data constitutes a bottleneck in machine learn-
ing for NLP today. Active learning is one way
of easing the burden of annotation. This pa-
per presents a first probe into the NLP research
community concerning the nature of the anno-
tation projects undertaken in general, and the
use of active learning as annotation support in
particular.
