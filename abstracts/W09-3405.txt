This paper introduces a new corpus of con-
sulting dialogues, which is designed for
training a dialogue manager that can han-
dle consulting dialogues through sponta-
neous interactions from the tagged dia-
logue corpus. We have collected 130 h
of consulting dialogues in the tourist guid-
ance domain. This paper outlines our tax-
onomy of dialogue act annotation that can
describe two aspects of an utterances: the
communicative function (speech act), and
the semantic content of the utterance. We
provide an overview of the Kyoto tour
guide dialogue corpus and a preliminary
analysis using the dialogue act tags.
