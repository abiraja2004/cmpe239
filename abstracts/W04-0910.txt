Arguably, grammars which associate natural lan-
guage expressions not only with a syntactic but
also with a semantic representation, should do so in
a way that capture paraphrasing relations between
sentences whose core semantics are equivalent. Yet
existing semantic grammars fail to do so. In this pa-
per, we describe an ongoing project whose aim is
the production of a ?paraphrastic grammar? that is,
a grammar which associates paraphrases with iden-
tical semantic representations. We begin by propos-
ing a typology of paraphrases. We then show how
this typology can be used to simultaneously guide
the development of a grammar and of a testsuite de-
signed to support the evaluation of this grammar.
