  
In this paper, a framework for the develop-
ment of a fast, accurate, and highly portable 
semantic chunker is introduced. The frame-
work is based on a non-overlapping, shallow 
tree-structured language. The derivation of the 
tree is considered as a sequence of tagging ac-
tions in a predefined linguistic context, and a 
novel semantic chunker is accordingly devel-
oped. It groups the phrase chunks into the ar-
guments of a given predicate in a bottom-up 
fashion. This is quite different from current 
approaches to semantic parsing or chunking 
that depend on full statistical syntactic parsers 
that require tree bank style annotation. We 
compare it with a recently proposed word-by-
word semantic chunker and present results 
that show that the phrase-by-phrase approach 
performs better than its word-by-word coun-
terpart.
