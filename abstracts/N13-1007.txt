We propose a minimally supervised method
for multilingual paraphrase extraction from
definition sentences on the Web. Hashimoto
et al (2011) extracted paraphrases from
Japanese definition sentences on the Web, as-
suming that definition sentences defining the
same concept tend to contain paraphrases.
However, their method requires manually an-
notated data and is language dependent. We
extend their framework and develop a mini-
mally supervised method applicable to multi-
ple languages. Our experiments show that our
method is comparable to Hashimoto et al?s
for Japanese and outperforms previous unsu-
pervised methods for English, Japanese, and
Chinese, and that our method extracts 10,000
paraphrases with 92% precision for English,
82.5% precision for Japanese, and 82% preci-
sion for Chinese.
