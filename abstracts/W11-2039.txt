The semantic annotation of dialogue cor-
pora permits building efficient language un-
derstanding applications for supporting en-
joyable and effective human-machine interac-
tions. Nevertheless, the annotation process
could be costly, time-consuming and compli-
cated, particularly the more expressive is the
semantic formalism. In this work, we propose
a bootstrapping architecture for the semantic
annotation of dialogue corpora with rich struc-
tures, based on Dependency Syntax and Frame
Semantics.
