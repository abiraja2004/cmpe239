Previous incremental parsers have used
monotonic state transitions. However,
transitions can be made to revise previous
decisions quite naturally, based on further
information.
We show that a simple adjustment to the
Arc-Eager transition system to relax its
monotonicity constraints can improve ac-
curacy, so long as the training data in-
cludes examples of mistakes for the non-
monotonic transitions to repair. We eval-
uate the change in the context of a state-
of-the-art system, and obtain a statistically
significant improvement (p < 0.001) on
the English evaluation and 5/10 of the
CoNLL languages.
