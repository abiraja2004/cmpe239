Tweets have become a comprehensive repos-
itory for real-time information. However, it
is often hard for users to quickly get informa-
tion they are interested in from tweets, ow-
ing to the sheer volume of tweets as well as
their noisy and informal nature. We present
QuickView, an NLP-based tweet search plat-
form to tackle this issue. Specifically, it ex-
ploits a series of natural language process-
ing technologies, such as tweet normalization,
named entity recognition, semantic role label-
ing, sentiment analysis, tweet classification, to
extract useful information, i.e., named entities,
events, opinions, etc., from a large volume
of tweets. Then, non-noisy tweets, together
with the mined information, are indexed, on
top of which two brand new scenarios are en-
abled, i.e., categorized browsing and advanced
search, allowing users to effectively access
either the tweets or fine-grained information
they are interested in.
