We created a new Chinese morpholog-
ical analyzer, Achilles, by integrating
rule-based, dictionary-based, and statis-
tical machine learning method, condi-
tional random fields (CRF). The rule-
based method is used to recognize regular
expressions: numbers, time and alphabets.
The dictionary-based method is used to
find in-vocabulary (IV) words while out-
of-vocabulary (OOV) words are detected
by the CRFs. At last, confidence measure
based approach is used to weigh all the re-
sults and output the best ones. Achilles
was used and evaluated in the bakeoff.
We participated the closed tracks of word
segmentation and part-of-speech tagging
for all the provided corpus. In spite of
an unexpected file encoding errors, the
system exhibited a top level performance.
A higher word segmentation accuracy for
the corpus ckip and ncc were achieved.
We are ranked at the fifth and eighth po-
sition out of all 19 and 26 submissions
respectively for the two corpus. Achilles
uses a feature combined approach for part-
of-speech tagging. Our post-evaluation re-
sults prove the effectiveness of this ap-
proach for POS tagging.
