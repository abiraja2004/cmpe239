This paper presents Archivus, a multi-
modal language-enabled meeting brows-
ing and retrieval system. The prototype
is in an early stage of development, and
we are currently exploring the role of nat-
ural language for interacting in this rela-
tively unfamiliar and complex domain. We
briefly describe the design and implemen-
tation status of the system, and then focus
on how this system is used to elicit useful
data for supporting hypotheses about mul-
timodal interaction in the domain of meet-
ing retrieval and for developing NLP mod-
ules for this specific domain.
