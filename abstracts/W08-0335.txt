Chinese word segmentation (CWS) is a
necessary step in Chinese-English statisti-
cal machine translation (SMT) and its per-
formance has an impact on the results of
SMT. However, there are many settings in-
volved in creating a CWS system such as
various specifications and CWS methods.
This paper investigates the effect of these
settings to SMT. We tested dictionary-
based and CRF-based approaches and
found there was no significant difference
between the two in the qualty of the result-
ing translations. We also found the corre-
lation between the CWS F-score and SMT
BLEU score was very weak. This paper
also proposes two methods of combining
advantages of different specifications: a
simple concatenation of training data and
a feature interpolation approach in which
the same types of features of translation
models from various CWS schemes are
linearly interpolated. We found these ap-
proaches were very effective in improving
quality of translations.
