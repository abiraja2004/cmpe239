We introduce BLANC, a family of dy-
namic, trainable evaluation metrics for ma-
chine translation. Flexible, parametrized
models can be learned from past data and
automatically optimized to correlate well
with human judgments for different cri-
teria (e.g. adequacy, fluency) using dif-
ferent correlation measures. Towards this
end, we discuss ACS (all common skip-
ngrams), a practical algorithm with train-
able parameters that estimates reference-
candidate translation overlap by comput-
ing a weighted sum of all common skip-
ngrams in polynomial time. We show that
the BLEU and ROUGE metric families are
special cases of BLANC, and we compare
correlations with human judgments across
these three metric families. We analyze the
algorithmic complexity of ACS and argue
that it is more powerful in modeling both
local meaning and sentence-level structure,
while offering the same practicality as the
established algorithms it generalizes.
