This paper presents a graph-based method
for all-word word sense disambiguation of
biomedical texts using semantic relatedness as
edge weight. Semantic relatedness is derived
from a term-topic co-occurrence matrix. The
sense inventory is generated by the MetaMap
program. Word sense disambiguation is per-
formed on a disambiguation graph via a ver-
tex centrality measure. The proposed method
achieves competitive performance on a bench-
mark dataset.
