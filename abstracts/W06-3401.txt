This paper investigates the usefulness of
prosodic features in classifying rhetori-
cal relations between utterances in meet-
ing recordings. Five rhetorical relations
of contrast, elaboration, summary, ques-
tion and cause are explored. Three train-
ing methods - supervised, unsupervised,
and combined - are compared, and classi-
fication is carried out using support vector
machines. The results of this pilot study
are encouraging but mixed, with pairwise
classification achieving an average of 68%
accuracy in discerning between relation
pairs using only prosodic features, but
multi-class classification performing only
slightly better than chance.
