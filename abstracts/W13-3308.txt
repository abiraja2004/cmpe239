We present an approach to feature weight
optimization for document-level decoding.
This is an essential task for enabling future
development of discourse-level statistical
machine translation, as it allows easy inte-
gration of discourse features in the decod-
ing process. We extend the framework of
sentence-level feature weight optimization
to the document-level. We show experi-
mentally that we can get competitive and
relatively stable results when using a stan-
dard set of features, and that this frame-
work also allows us to optimize document-
level features, which can be used to model
discourse phenomena.
