Stochastic unification-based grammars
(SUBGs) define exponential distributions
over the parses generated by a unification-
based grammar (UBG). Existing algo-
rithms for parsing and estimation require
the enumeration of all of the parses of a
string in order to determine the most likely
one, or in order to calculate the statis-
tics needed to estimate a grammar from
a training corpus. This paper describes a
graph-based dynamic programming algo-
rithm for calculating these statistics from
the packed UBG parse representations of
Maxwell and Kaplan (1995) which does
not require enumerating all parses. Like
many graphical algorithms, the dynamic
programming algorithm?s complexity is
worst-case exponential, but is often poly-
nomial. The key observation is that by
using Maxwell and Kaplan packed repre-
sentations, the required statistics can be
rewritten as either the max or the sum of
a product of functions. This is exactly
the kind of problem which can be solved
by dynamic programming over graphical
models.
