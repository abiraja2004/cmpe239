 
Anaphora in multi-modal dialogues have 
different aspects compared to the 
anaphora in language-only dialogues. 
They often refer to the items signified by 
a gesture or by visual means. In this paper, 
we define two kinds of anaphora: screen 
anaphora and referring anaphora, and 
propose two general methods to resolve 
these anaphora. One is a simple mapping 
algorithm that can find items refetxed 
with/without pointing estures on a screen. 
The other is the centering algorithm with a 
dual cache model, which Walker's 
centering algorithm is extended to for a 
multi-modal dialogue system. The 
extended algorithm is appropriate to 
resolve various anaphora in a multi-modal 
dialogue .because it keeps utterances, 
visual information and screen switching- 
,.tim.e. In the experiments, the system. 
Correctly resolved 384 anaphora out of 
402 anaphom in 40 dialogues (0..54 
anaphom per utterance) showing 95.5% 
correctness.
