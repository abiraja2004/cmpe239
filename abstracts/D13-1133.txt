We investigate the value-add of topic model-
ing in text analysis for depression, and for neu-
roticism as a strongly associated personality
measure. Using Pennebaker?s Linguistic In-
quiry and Word Count (LIWC) lexicon to pro-
vide baseline features, we show that straight-
forward topic modeling using Latent Dirich-
let Allocation (LDA) yields interpretable, psy-
chologically relevant ?themes? that add value
in prediction of clinical assessments.
