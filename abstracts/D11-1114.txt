We describe a generative model for non-
projective dependency parsing based on a sim-
plified version of a transition system that has
recently appeared in the literature. We then
develop a dynamic programming parsing al-
gorithm for our model, and derive an inside-
outside algorithm that can be used for unsu-
pervised learning of non-projective depend-
ency trees.
