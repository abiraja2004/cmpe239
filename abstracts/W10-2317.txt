Using the technique of ?semantic mirror-
ing? a graph is obtained that represents
words and their translations from a paral-
lel corpus or a bilingual lexicon. The con-
nectedness of the graph holds information
about the different meanings of words that
occur in the translations. Spectral graph
theory is used to partition the graph, which
leads to a grouping of the words according
to different senses. We also report results
from an evaluation using a small sample of
seed words from a lexicon of Swedish and
English adjectives.
