 
We propose an effective approach to auto-
matically identify predicate heads in Chinese 
sentences based on statistical pre-processing 
and rule-based post-processing. In the pre-
processing stage, the maximal noun phrases in 
a sentence are recognized and replaced by 
?NP? labels to simplify the sentence structure. 
Then a CRF model is trained to recognize the 
predicate heads of this simplified sentence. In 
the post-processing stage, a rule base is built 
according to the grammatical features of 
predicate heads. It is then utilized to correct 
the preliminary recognition results. Experi-
mental results show that our approach is feasi-
ble and effective, and its accuracy achieves 
89.14% on Tsinghua Chinese Treebank.
