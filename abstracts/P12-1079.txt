Previous work using topic model for statis-
tical machine translation (SMT) explore top-
ic information at the word level. Howev-
er, SMT has been advanced from word-based
paradigm to phrase/rule-based paradigm. We
therefore propose a topic similarity model to
exploit topic information at the synchronous
rule level for hierarchical phrase-based trans-
lation. We associate each synchronous rule
with a topic distribution, and select desirable
rules according to the similarity of their top-
ic distributions with given documents. We
show that our model significantly improves
the translation performance over the baseline
on NIST Chinese-to-English translation ex-
periments. Our model also achieves a better
performance and a faster speed than previous
approaches that work at the word level.
