 
Linguistic access to uncertain quantita- 
tive knowledge about physical properties 
is provided by dimensional adjectives, 
e.g. long-short in the spatial and tempo- 
ral senses, near-far, fast-slow, etc. Seman- 
tic analyses of the dimensional djectives 
differ on whether the meaning of the dif- 
ferential comparative (6 cm shorter than) 
and the equative with factor term (three 
times as long as) is a compositional func- 
tion of the meanings the difference and fac- 
tor terms (6 cm and three times) and the 
meanings of the simple comparative and 
equative, respectively. The compositional 
treatment comes at the price of a meaning 
representation that some authors (\[Pinkal, 
1990\], \[Klein, 1991\]) find objectionally un- 
parsimonious. In this paper, I compare 
semantic approaches by investigating the 
complexity of reasoning that they entail; 
specifically, I show the complexity of con- 
straint propagation over real-valued inter- 
vals using the Waltz algorithm in a system 
where the meaning representations of sen- 
tences appear as constraints (cf. \[Davis, 
1987\]). It turns out that the compositional 
account is more complex on this measure. 
However, I argue that we face a tradeoff 
rather than a knock-down argument against 
compositionality, since the increased com- 
plexity of the compositional pproach may 
be manageable if certain assumptions about 
the application domain can be made.
