 
Native language identification (NLI) is the 
task to determine the native language of the 
author based on an essay written in a second 
language.  NLI is often treated as a classifica-
tion problem.  In this paper, we use the 
TOEFL11 data set which consists of more 
data, in terms of the amount of essays and 
languages, and less biased across prompts, i.e., 
topics, of essays.  We demonstrate that even 
using word level n-grams as features, and sup-
port vector machine (SVM) as a classifier can 
yield nearly 80% accuracy. We observe that 
the accuracy of a binary-based word level n-
gram representation (~80%) is much better 
than the performance of a frequency-based 
word level n-gram representation (~20%).  
Notably, comparable results can be achieved 
without removing punctuation marks, suggest-
ing a very simple baseline system for NLI.
