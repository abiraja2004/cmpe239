Given a parallel parsed corpus, statistical tree-
to-tree alignment attempts to match nodes in
the syntactic trees for a given sentence in
two languages. We train a probabilistic tree
transduction model on a large automatically
parsed Chinese-English corpus, and evaluate re-
sults against human-annotated word level align-
ments. We find that a constituent-based model
performs better than a similar probability model
trained on the same trees converted to a depen-
dency representation.
