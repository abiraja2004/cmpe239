Question classifiers are used within Question Answering to predict the expected answer type
for a given question. This paper describes the first steps towards applying a similar methodology to
identifying question classes in dialogue contexts, beginning with a study of questions drawn from the
Enron email corpus. Human-annotated data is used as a gold standard for assessing the output from
an existing, open-source question classifier (QA-SYS). Problem areas are identified and potential
solutions discussed.
