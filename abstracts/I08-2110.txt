This paper proposes a flexible matching
method that can assimilate the expressive
divergence. First, broad-coverage syn-
onymous expressions are automatically ex-
tracted from an ordinary dictionary, and
among them, those whose distributional
similarity in a Web corpus is high are used
for the flexible matching. Then, to overcome
the combinatorial explosion problem in the
combination of expressive divergence, an ID
is assigned to each synonymous group, and
SYNGRAPH data structure is introduced to
pack the expressive divergence. We con-
firmed the effectiveness of our method on
experiments of machine translation and in-
formation retrieval.
