The need for syntactically annotated data 
for use in natural language processing has 
increased dramatically in recent years. This 
is true especially for parallel treebanks, of 
which very few exist. The ones that exist 
are mainly hand-crafted and too small for 
reliable use in data-oriented applications. 
In this paper we introduce a novel platform 
for fast and robust automatic generation of 
parallel treebanks. The software we have 
developed based on this platform has been 
shown to handle large data sets. We also 
present evaluation results demonstrating 
the quality of the derived treebanks and 
discuss some possible modifications and 
improvements that can lead to even better 
results. We expect the presented platform 
to help boost research in the field of data-
oriented machine translation and lead to 
advancements in other fields where paral-
lel treebanks can be employed.
