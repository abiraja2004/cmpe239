 
Words and character-bigrams are both 
used as features in Chinese text process-
ing tasks, but no systematic comparison 
or analysis of their values as features for 
Chinese text categorization has been re-
ported heretofore. We carry out here a 
full performance comparison between 
them by experiments on various docu-
ment collections (including a manually 
word-segmented corpus as a golden stan-
dard), and a semi-quantitative analysis to 
elucidate the characteristics of their be-
havior; and try to provide some prelimi-
nary clue for feature term choice (in most 
cases, character-bigrams are better than 
words) and dimensionality setting in text 
categorization systems.
