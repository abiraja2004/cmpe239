 
This paper describes the multilingual semantic 
role labeling system of Computational Lin-
guistics Group, Trinity College Dublin, for the 
CoNLL-2009 SRLonly closed shared task. 
The system consists of two cascaded compo-
nents: one for disambiguating predicate word 
sense, and the other for identifying and classi-
fying arguments. Supervised learning tech-
niques are utilized in these two components. 
As each language has its unique characteris-
tics, different parameters and strategies have 
to be taken for different languages, either for 
providing functions required by a language or 
for meeting the tight deadline. The system ob-
tained labeled F1 69.26 averaging over seven 
languages (Catalan, Chinese, Czech, English, 
German, Japanese, and Spanish), which ranks 
the system fourth among the seven systems 
participating the SRLonly closed track.
