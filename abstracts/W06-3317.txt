Abstract 
We describe BioLiterate, a prototype software 
system which infers relationships involving re-
lationships between genes, proteins and ma-
lignancies from research abstracts, and has ini-
tially been tested in the domain of the molecu-
lar genetics of oncology. The architecture uses 
a natural language processing module to ex-
tract entities, dependencies and simple seman-
tic relationships from texts, and then feeds 
these features into a probabilistic reasoning 
module which combines the semantic relation-
ships extracted by the NLP module to form 
new semantic relationships.  One application 
of this system is the discovery of relationships 
that are not contained in any individual ab-
stract but are implicit in the combined knowl-
edge contained in two or more abstracts.
