We define the problem of recognizing entailed re-
lations ? given an open set of relations, find all oc-
currences of the relations of interest in a given doc-
ument set ? and pose it as a challenge to scalable
information extraction and retrieval. Existing ap-
proaches to relation recognition do not address well
problems with an open set of relations and a need
for high recall: supervised methods are not eas-
ily scaled, while unsupervised and semi-supervised
methods address a limited aspect of the problem, as
they are restricted to frequent, explicit, highly lo-
calized patterns. We argue that textual entailment
(TE) is necessary to solve such problems, propose
a scalable TE architecture, and provide preliminary
results on an Entailed Relation Recognition task.
