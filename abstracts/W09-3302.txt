Named entity recognition (NER) is used in
many domains beyond the newswire text
that comprises current gold-standard cor-
pora. Recent work has used Wikipedia?s
link structure to automatically generate
near gold-standard annotations. Until now,
these resources have only been evaluated
on newswire corpora or themselves.
We present the first NER evaluation on
a Wikipedia gold standard (WG) corpus.
Our analysis of cross-corpus performance
on WG shows that Wikipedia text may
be a harder NER domain than newswire.
We find that an automatic annotation of
Wikipedia has high agreement with WG
and, when used as training data, outper-
forms newswire models by up to 7.7%.
