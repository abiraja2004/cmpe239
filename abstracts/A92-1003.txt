 
Multilevel semantics has been proposed as a 
powerful architecture for semantic analysis. We 
propose a methodology that, while maintaining the 
generality of the multilevel approach, is able to 
establish formal constraints over the possible ways 
to organize the level hierarchy. More precisely, we 
propose a "strong" version of the multilevel 
approach in which a level can be defined if and only 
if it is possible to characterize a "meaningfulness" 
notion peculiar to that level. Within such an 
architecture each level reached uring the analysis 
computes its meaningfulness value; this result is 
then handled according to modalities that are peculiar 
to that level. 
The component described in this paper was 
designed to be portable with respect to the 
application domain and so far has been tested as the 
semantic analysis component of two multimedial 
dialog systems, ALFresco and MAIA.
