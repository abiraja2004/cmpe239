This paper describes experiments with
English-to-Czech phrase-based machine
translation. Additional annotation of input
and output tokens (multiple factors) is used
to explicitly model morphology. We vary
the translation scenario (the setup of multi-
ple factors) and the amount of information
in the morphological tags. Experimental
results demonstrate significant improvement
of translation quality in terms of BLEU.
