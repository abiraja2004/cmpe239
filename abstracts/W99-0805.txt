 
The subject matter of speech and hearing is 
packed full of phenomena and processes which 
lend themselves toor require auditory demon- 
stration. In the past, this has been achieved 
through passive media such as tape or CD (e.g. 
Houtsma et ai, 1987; Bregman & Ahad, 1995). 
The advent of languages such as MATLAB 
which suppor!s ound handling, modern inter- 
face elements and powerful signal processing 
routines, coupled with the availability of fast 
processors and ubiquitous oundcards allows 
tbr a more interactive style of demonstration. 
A significant effort is now underway in the 
speech and hearing community to exploit hese 
favourable conditions (see the MATISSE pro- 
ceedings (1999), for instance). 
Excitingly, it is now possible to allow explora- 
tory access to part or all of the parameter space 
underlying each phenomenon. Over the past 18 
months, more than 20 interactive auditory 
demonstrations have been produced at Shef- 
field as part of an ongoing project o provide 
teaching material for the diverse disciplines 
which contribute to speech and hearing. Many 
of the demonstrations are suitable for under- 
graduate courses, while others encode phe- 
nomena which are primarily of interest to 
researchers. 
The motivation for and design ethos behind 
this project has been described previously in 
Cooke & Brown (1999) and Wrigley, Cooke & 
Brown (1999). In this extended abstract, agal- 
lery of screenshots which focus on the auditory 
(as opposed to speech) demonstrations is pro- 
vided. The aim is to show the breadth of what 
is possible in a relatively short time and to 
encourage others to produce similar tools. 
The demonstrations can be freely downloaded
