Most existing information retrieval (IR)
systems do not take much advantage of
natural language processing (NLP) tech-
niques due to the complexity and limited
observed effectiveness of applying NLP
to IR. In this paper, we demonstrate that
substantial gains can be obtained over a
strong baseline using NLP techniques, if
properly handled. We propose a frame-
work for deriving semantic text matching
features from named entities identified in
Web queries; we then utilize these features
in a supervised machine-learned ranking
approach, applying a set of emerging ma-
chine learning techniques. Our approach
is especially useful for queries that contain
multiple types of concepts. Comparing to
a major commercial Web search engine,
we observe a substantial 4% DCG5 gain
over the affected queries.
