This paper describes the 2010 phrase-based
statistical machine translation system de-
veloped at the TALP Research Center of
the UPC
1
in cooperation with BMIC
2
and
VMU
3
. In phrase-based SMT, the phrase
table is the main tool in translation. It is
created extracting phrases from an aligned
parallel corpus and then computing trans-
lation model scores with them. Performing
a collocation segmentation over the source
and target corpus before the alignment
causes that different and larger phrases
are extracted from the same original doc-
uments. We performed this segmentation
and used the union of this phrase set with
the phrase set extracted from the non-
segmented corpus to compute the phrase
table. We present the configurations con-
sidered and also report results obtained
with internal and official test sets.
