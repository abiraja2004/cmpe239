While the resolution of term ambiguity is
important for information extraction (IE)
systems, the cost of resolving each in-
stance of an entity can be prohibitively
expensive on large datasets. To combat
this, this work looks at ambiguity detec-
tion at the term, rather than the instance,
level. By making a judgment about the
general ambiguity of a term, a system is
able to handle ambiguous and unambigu-
ous cases differently, improving through-
put and quality. To address the term
ambiguity detection problem, we employ
a model that combines data from lan-
guage models, ontologies, and topic mod-
eling. Results over a dataset of entities
from four product domains show that the
proposed approach achieves significantly
above baseline F-measure of 0.96.
