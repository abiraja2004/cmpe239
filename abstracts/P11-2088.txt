Identifying peer-review helpfulness is an im-
portant task for improving the quality of feed-
back that students receive from their peers. As
a first step towards enhancing existing peer-
review systems with new functionality based
on helpfulness detection, we examine whether
standard product review analysis techniques
also apply to our new context of peer reviews.
In addition, we investigate the utility of in-
corporating additional specialized features tai-
lored to peer review. Our preliminary results
show that the structural features, review uni-
grams and meta-data combined are useful in
modeling the helpfulness of both peer reviews
and product reviews, while peer-review spe-
cific auxiliary features can further improve
helpfulness prediction.
