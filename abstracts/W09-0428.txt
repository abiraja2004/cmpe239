 
In this article, we describe the machine 
translation systems we used to create 
MorphoLogic?s submissions to the 
WMT09 shared Hungarian to English 
and English to Hungarian shared transla-
tion tasks. We used our rule based 
MetaMorpho system to generate our pri-
mary submission. In addition, we created 
a hybrid system where the Moses de-
coder is used to rank translations or as-
semble partial translations created by 
MetaMorpho. Our third system was a 
purely statistical morpheme based system 
for the Hungarian to English task.
