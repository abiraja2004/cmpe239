This paper introduces GLARF, a frame-
work for predicate argument structure.
We report on converting the Penn Tree-
bank II into GLARF by automatic
methods that achieved about 90% pre-
cision/recall on test sentences from the
Penn Treebank. Plans for a corpus
of hand-corrected output, extensions of
GLARF to Japanese and applications
for MT are also discussed.
