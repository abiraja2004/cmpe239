 
This paper addresses the problem of clas-
sifying Chinese unknown words into 
fine-grained semantic categories defined 
in a Chinese thesaurus. We describe 
three novel knowledge-based models that 
capture the relationship between the se-
mantic categories of an unknown word 
and those of its component characters in 
three different ways. We then combine 
two of the knowledge-based models with 
a corpus-based model which classifies 
unknown words using contextual infor-
mation. Experiments show that the 
knowledge-based models outperform 
previous methods on the same task, but 
the use of contextual information does 
not further improve performance.
