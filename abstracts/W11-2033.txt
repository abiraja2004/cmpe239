We present a new approach to dialogue man-
agement based on the use of multiple, inter-
connected policies. Instead of capturing the
complexity of the interaction in a single large
policy, the dialogue manager operates with a
collection of small local policies combined
concurrently and hierarchically. The meta-
control of these policies relies on an activation
vector updated before and after each turn.
