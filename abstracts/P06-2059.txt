This paper proposes a novel method
of building polarity-tagged corpus from
HTML documents. The characteristics of
this method is that it is fully automatic and
can be applied to arbitrary HTML docu-
ments. The idea behind our method is
to utilize certain layout structures and lin-
guistic pattern. By using them, we can
automatically extract such sentences that
express opinion. In our experiment, the
method could construct a corpus consist-
ing of 126,610 sentences.
