Although first names and nicknames in the
United States have been well documented,
there has been almost no quantitative analysis
on the usage and association of these names
amongst themselves. In this paper we in-
troduce the Intelius Nickname Collection, a
quantitative compilation of millions of name-
nickname associations based on information
gathered from billions of public records. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the largest
collection of its kind, making it a natural re-
source for tasks such as coreference resolu-
tion, record linkage, named entity recogni-
tion, people and expert search, information ex-
traction, demographic and sociological stud-
ies, etc. The collection will be made freely
available.
