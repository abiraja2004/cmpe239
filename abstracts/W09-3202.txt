Indus Valley civilization (2500-1900 BCE) in 
Pakistan and northwestern India have un-
earthed a large number of artifacts with in-
scriptions made up of hundreds of distinct 
signs. To date, there is no generally accepted 
decipherment of these sign sequences, and 
there have been suggestions that the signs 
could be non-linguistic. Here we apply com-
plex network analysis techniques on the data-
base of available Indus inscriptions, with the 
aim of detecting patterns indicative of syntac-
tic structure in this sign system. Our results 
show the presence of regularities, e.g., in the 
segmentation trees of the sequences, that sug-
gest the existence of a grammar underlying the 
construction of the sequences.
