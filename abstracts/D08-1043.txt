Lexical gaps between queries and questions
(documents) have been a major issue in ques-
tion retrieval on large online question and
answer (Q&A) collections. Previous stud-
ies address the issue by implicitly expanding
queries with the help of translation models
pre-constructed using statistical techniques.
However, since it is possible for unimpor-
tant words (e.g., non-topical words, common
words) to be included in the translation mod-
els, a lack of noise control on the models can
cause degradation of retrieval performance.
This paper investigates a number of empirical
methods for eliminating unimportant words in
order to construct compact translation mod-
els for retrieval purposes. Experiments con-
ducted on a real world Q&A collection show
that substantial improvements in retrieval per-
formance can be achieved by using compact
translation models.
