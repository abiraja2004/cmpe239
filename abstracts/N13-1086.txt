In this paper we leverage methods from sub-
modular function optimization developed for
document summarization and apply them to
the problem of subselecting acoustic data. We
evaluate our results on data subset selection
for a phone recognition task. Our framework
shows significant improvements over random
selection and previously proposed methods us-
ing a similar amount of resources.
