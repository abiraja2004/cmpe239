Taking as a starting-point the development
on cooccurrence techniques for several lan-
guages, we focus on the aspects that should
be considered in a NV extraction task for
Basque. In Basque, NV expressions are con-
sidered those combinations in which a noun,
inflected or not, is co-occurring with a verb, as
erabakia hartu (?to make a decision?), kontuan
hartu (?to take into account?) and buruz jakin
(?to know by heart?). A basic extraction sys-
tem has been developed and evaluated against
two references: a) a reference which includes
NV entries from several lexicographic works;
and b) a manual evaluation by three experts of
a random sample from the n-best lists.
