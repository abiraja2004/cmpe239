 
Recently, with the huge amount of growing 
information in the web and the little 
available time to read and process all this 
information, automatic summaries have 
become very important resources. In this 
work, we evaluate deep content selection 
methods for multidocument summarization 
based on the CST model (Cross-document 
Structure Theory). Our methods consider 
summarization preferences and focus on the 
overall main problems of multidocument 
treatment: redundancy, complementarity, and 
contradiction among different information 
sources. We also evaluate the impact of the 
CST model over superficial summarization 
systems. Our results show that the use of 
CST model helps to improve informativeness 
and quality in automatic summaries.
