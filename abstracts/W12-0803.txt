In this paper we present the tree to tree
transduction language, TTT. We moti-
vate the overall ?template-to-template? ap-
proach to the design of the language, and
outline its constructs, also providing some
examples. We then show that TTT al-
lows transparent formalization of rules for
parse tree refinement and correction, log-
ical form refinement and predicate disam-
biguation, inference, and verbalization of
logical forms.
