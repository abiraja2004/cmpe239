This paper presents a discriminative reranking
model for the discourse segmentation task, the
first step in a discourse parsing system. Our
model exploits subtree features to rerank N-
best outputs of a base segmenter, which uses
syntactic and lexical features in a CRF frame-
work. Experimental results on the RST Dis-
course Treebank corpus show that our model
outperforms existing discourse segmenters in
both settings that use gold standard Penn Tree-
bank parse trees and Stanford parse trees.
