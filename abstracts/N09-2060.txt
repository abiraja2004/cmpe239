This paper presents methods for performing
graph-based semantic classification using ker-
nel functions defined on the WordNet lexi-
cal hierarchy. These functions are evaluated
on the SemEval Task 4 relation classification
dataset and their performance is shown to be
competitive with that of more complex sys-
tems. A number of possible future develop-
ments are suggested to illustrate the flexibility
of the approach.
