In this paper we describe the statistical
machine translation system of the Univer-
sita?t Karlsruhe developed for the transla-
tion task of the Fourth Workshop on Sta-
tistical Machine Translation. The state-of-
the-art phrase-based SMT system is aug-
mented with alternative word reordering
and alignment mechanisms as well as op-
tional phrase table modifications. We par-
ticipate in the constrained condition of
German-English and English-German as
well as in the constrained condition of
French-English and English-French.
