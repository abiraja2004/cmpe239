This demonstration introduces two new
multilingual translation services for mo-
bile phones. The first translation service
provides state-of-the-art text-to-text trans-
lations of Japanese as well as English con-
versational spoken language in the travel
domain into 17 languages using statistical
machine translation technologies trained
automatically from a large-scale multilin-
gual corpus. The second demonstration
is a speech translation service between
Japanese and English for real environ-
ments. It is based on distributed speech
recognition with noise suppression. Flexi-
ble interfaces between internal and exter-
nal speech translation resources ease the
portability of the system to other languages
and enable real-time location-free commu-
nication world-wide.
