the synthesis of personal pronouns in a system tlrat 
generates texts in Romance languages. It puts the 
emphasis first on the fact that fire morphological level has 
to betaken hire account early in the generation process, 
second on the numerous "cross dependency" phenomena 
which are to b,; found when the synthesis of an element X
depends upon that of another element Y and when the 
synthesis of "Y depends upon that of X. The linguistic 
examples are taken from French and Italian languages, for 
wlfich a robust generatiort system has been implemented.
