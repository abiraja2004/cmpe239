I present a novel approach to the determination
of recurrent sound correspondences in bilingual
wordlists. The idea is to relate correspondences be-
tween sounds in wordlists to translational equiva-
lences between words in bitexts (bilingual corpora).
My method induces models of sound correspon-
dence that are similar to models developed for sta-
tistical machine translation. The experiments show
that the method is able to determine recurrent sound
correspondences in bilingual wordlists in which less
than 30% of the pairs are cognates. By employ-
ing the discovered correspondences, the method can
identify cognates with higher accuracy than the pre-
viously reported algorithms.
