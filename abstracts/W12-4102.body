Most of the research on social networks has al-
most exclusively focused on positive links be-
tween entities. There are much more insights
that we may gain by generalizing social net-
works to the signed case where both positive
and negative edges are considered. One of the
reasons why signed social networks have re-
ceived less attention that networks based on
positive links only is the lack of an explicit
notion of negative relations in most social net-
work applications. However, most such appli-
cations have text embedded in the social net-
work. Applying linguistic analysis techniques
to this text enables us to identify both positive
and negative interactions. In this work, we
propose a new method to automatically con-
struct a signed social network from text. The
resulting networks have a polarity associated
with every edge. Edge polarity is a means for
indicating a positive or negative affinity be-
tween two individuals. We apply the proposed
method to a larger amount of online discus-
sion posts. Experiments show that the pro-
posed method is capable of constructing net-
works from text with high accuracy. We also
connect out analysis to social psychology the-
ories of signed network, namely the structural
balance theory.
