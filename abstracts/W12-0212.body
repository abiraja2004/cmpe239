The paper reports several studies about
quantifying language similarity via pho-
netic alignment of core vocabulary items
(taken from Wichman?s Automated Simi-
larity Judgement Program data base). It
turns out that weighted alignment accord-
ing to the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm
yields best results.
For visualization and data exploration pur-
poses, we used an implementation of the
Fruchterman-Reingold algorithm, a version
of force directed graph layout. This soft-
ware projects large amounts of data points
to a two- or three-dimensional structure in
such a way that groups of mutually similar
items form spatial clusters.
The exploratory studies conducted along
these ways lead to suggestive results that
provide evidence for historical relation-
ships beyond the traditionally recognized
language families.
