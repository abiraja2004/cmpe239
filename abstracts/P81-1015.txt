 
This paper presents an analysis of analogies based on 
observations of oatural conversations. People's 
spontaneous use of analogies provides Inslg~t into their 
implicit evaluation procedures for analogies. The 
treatment here, therefore, reveals aspects of analogical 
processing that is somewhat more difficult to see in an 
experimental context. The work involves explicit 
treatment of the discourse context in which analogy 
occurs. A major focus here is the formalization of the 
effects of analogy on discourse development. There is 
much rule-llke behavior in this process, both in 
underlying thematic development of the discourse and in 
the surface lir~ulstlc forms used in this development. 
Both these forms of regular behavior are discussed in 
terms of a hierarchical structurin6 of a discourse into 
distinct, but related and linked, context spaces.
