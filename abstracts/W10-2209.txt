Historical text presents numerous chal-
lenges for contemporary natural language
processing techniques. In particular, the
absence of consistent orthographic con-
ventions in historical text presents difficul-
ties for any system requiring reference to
a static lexicon accessed by orthographic
form. In this paper, we present three
methods for associating unknown histori-
cal word forms with synchronically active
canonical cognates and evaluate their per-
formance on an information retrieval task
over a manually annotated corpus of his-
torical German verse.
