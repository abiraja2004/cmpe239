The most accurate unsupervised word seg-
mentation systems that are currently avail-
able (Brent, 1999; Venkataraman, 2001;
Goldwater, 2007) use a simple unigram
model of phonotactics. While this sim-
plifies some of the calculations, it over-
looks cues that infant language acquisition
researchers have shown to be useful for
segmentation (Mattys et al, 1999; Mattys
and Jusczyk, 2001). Here we explore the
utility of using bigram and trigram phono-
tactic models by enhancing Brent?s (1999)
MBDP-1 algorithm. The results show
the improved MBDP-Phon model outper-
forms other unsupervised word segmenta-
tion systems (e.g., Brent, 1999; Venkatara-
man, 2001; Goldwater, 2007).
