 
In syntax, the trend nowadays is towards lexiealized 
grammar formalisms. It is now widely accepted that 
dividing words into wordclasses may serve as a 
labor-saving mechanism - but at the same time, it 
discards all detailed information on the idiosyncratic 
behavior of words. And that is exactly the type of 
information that may be necessary in order to parse 
a sentence. For learning approaches, however, 
lexicalized grammars represent a challenge for the 
very reason that they include so much detailed and 
specific information, which is difficult to learn. 
This paper will present an algorithm for learning a 
, link grammar of German. The problem of data spar- 
seness is tackled by using all the available infor- 
mation from partial parses as well as from an ex- 
isting grammar fragment and a tagger. This is a re- 
port about work in progress o there are no repre- 
sentative results available yet.
