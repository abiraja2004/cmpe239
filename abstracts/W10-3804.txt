 
A typical phrase-based machine transla-
tion (PBMT) system uses phrase pairs 
extracted from word-aligned parallel 
corpora. All phrase pairs that are consis-
tent with word alignments are collected. 
The resulting phrase table is very large 
and includes many non-syntactic phrases 
which may not be necessary. We propose 
to filter the phrase table based on source 
language syntactic constraints. Rather 
than filter out all non-syntactic phrases, 
we only apply syntactic constraints when 
there is phrase segmentation ambiguity 
arising from unaligned words. Our 
method is very simple and yields a 
24.38% phrase pair reduction and a 0.52 
BLEU point improvement when com-
pared to a baseline PBMT system with 
full-size tables.
