In this paper, we propose a system for biomed-
ical event extraction using multi-phase ap-
proach. It consists of event trigger detector,
event type classifier, and relation recognizer
and event compositor. The system firstly iden-
tifies triggers in a given sentence. Then, it
classifies the triggers into one of nine pre-
defined classes. Lastly, the system examines
each trigger whether it has a relation with
participant candidates, and composites events
with the extracted relations. The official score
of the proposed system recorded 61.65 preci-
sion, 9.40 recall and 16.31 f-score in approxi-
mate span matching. However, we found that
the threshold tuning for the third phase had
negative effect. Without the threshold tuning,
the system showed 55.32 precision, 16.18 re-
call and 25.04 f-score.
