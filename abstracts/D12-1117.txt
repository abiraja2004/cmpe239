Taxonomies can serve as browsing tools for
document collections. However, given an ar-
bitrary collection, pre-constructed taxonomies
could not easily adapt to the specific topic/task
present in the collection. This paper explores
techniques to quickly derive task-specific tax-
onomies supporting browsing in arbitrary
document collections. The supervised ap-
proach directly learns semantic distances from
users to propose meaningful task-specific tax-
onomies. The approach aims to produce glob-
ally optimized taxonomy structures by incor-
porating path consistency control and user-
generated task specification into the general
learning framework. A comparison to state-
of-the-art systems and a user study jointly
demonstrate that our techniques are highly ef-
fective.
