Document clustering and classification is
usually done by representing the documents
using a bag of words scheme. This scheme
ignores many of the linguistic and semantic
features contained in text documents. We
propose here an alternative representation
for documents using Lexical Chains. We
compare the performance of the new repre-
sentation against the old one on a cluster-
ing task. We show that Lexical Chain based
features give better results than the Bag of
Words based features, while achieving al-
most 30% reduction in the dimensionality of
the feature vectors resulting in faster execu-
tion of the algorithms.
