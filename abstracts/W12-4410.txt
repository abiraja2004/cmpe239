We consider the task of generating transliter-
ated word forms. To allow for a wide range of
interacting features, we use a conditional ran-
dom field (CRF) sequence labeling model. We
then present two innovations: a training objec-
tive that optimizes toward any of a set of possi-
ble correct labels (since more than one translit-
eration is often possible for a particular in-
put), and a k-best reranking stage to incorpo-
rate nonlocal features. This paper presents re-
sults on the Arabic-English transliteration task
of the NEWS 2012 workshop.
