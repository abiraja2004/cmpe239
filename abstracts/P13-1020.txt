We present a dual decomposition frame-
work for multi-document summarization,
using a model that jointly extracts and
compresses sentences. Compared with
previous work based on integer linear pro-
gramming, our approach does not require
external solvers, is significantly faster, and
is modular in the three qualities a sum-
mary should have: conciseness, informa-
tiveness, and grammaticality. In addition,
we propose a multi-task learning frame-
work to take advantage of existing data
for extractive summarization and sentence
compression. Experiments in the TAC-
2008 dataset yield the highest published
ROUGE scores to date, with runtimes that
rival those of extractive summarizers.
