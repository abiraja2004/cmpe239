We discuss how deep interpretation and
generation can be integrated with a know-
ledge representation designed for question
answering to build a tutorial dialogue sys-
tem. We use a knowledge representa-
tion known to perform well in answering
exam-type questions and show that to sup-
port tutorial dialogue it needs additional
features, in particular, compositional rep-
resentations for interpretation and struc-
tured explanation representations.
