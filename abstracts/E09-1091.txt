 
In this paper, we address the problem of min-
ing transliterations of Named Entities (NEs) 
from large comparable corpora. We leverage 
the empirical fact that multilingual news ar-
ticles with similar news content are rich in 
Named Entity Transliteration Equivalents 
(NETEs). Our mining algorithm, MINT, uses 
a cross-language document similarity model to 
align multilingual news articles and then 
mines NETEs from the aligned articles using a 
transliteration similarity model. We show that 
our approach is highly effective on 6 different 
comparable corpora between English and 4 
languages from 3 different language families. 
Furthermore, it performs substantially better 
than a state-of-the-art competitor.
