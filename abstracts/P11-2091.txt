The number of users on Twitter has drasti-
cally increased in the past years. However,
Twitter does not have an effective user group-
ing mechanism. Therefore tweets from other
users can quickly overrun and become in-
convenient to read. In this paper, we pro-
pose methods to help users group the peo-
ple they follow using their provided seeding
users. Two sources of information are used to
build sub-systems: textural information cap-
tured by the tweets sent by users, and social
connections among users. We also propose
a measure of fitness to determine which sub-
system best represents the seed users and use
it for target user ranking. Our experiments
show that our proposed framework works well
and that adaptively choosing the appropriate
sub-system for group suggestion results in in-
creased accuracy.
