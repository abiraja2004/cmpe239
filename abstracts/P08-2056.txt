We present a robust parser which is trained on
a treebank of ungrammatical sentences. The
treebank is created automatically by modify-
ing Penn treebank sentences so that they con-
tain one or more syntactic errors. We eval-
uate an existing Penn-treebank-trained parser
on the ungrammatical treebank to see how it
reacts to noise in the form of grammatical er-
rors. We re-train this parser on the training
section of the ungrammatical treebank, lead-
ing to an significantly improved performance
on the ungrammatical test sets. We show how
a classifier can be used to prevent performance
degradation on the original grammatical data.
