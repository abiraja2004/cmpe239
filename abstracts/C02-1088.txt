  
This paper proposes an unsupervised 
learning model for classifying named 
entities. This model uses a training set, built 
automatically by means of a small-scale 
named entity dictionary and an unlabeled 
corpus. This enables us to classify named 
entities without the cost for building a large 
hand-tagged training corpus or a lot of rules. 
Our model uses the ensemble of three 
different learning methods and repeats the 
learning with new training examples 
generated through the ensemble learning. 
The ensemble of various learning methods 
brings a better result than each individual 
learning method. The experimental result 
shows 73.16% in precision and 72.98% in 
recall for Korean news articles.
