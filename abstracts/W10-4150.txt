We present a new probabilistic model
based on the lexical PCFG model, which
can easily utilize the Chinese character in-
formation to solve the lexical information
sparseness in lexical PCFG model. We
discuss in particular some important fea-
tures that can improve the parsing perfor-
mance, and describe the strategy of mod-
ifying original label structure to reduce
the label ambiguities. Final experiment
demonstrates that the character informa-
tion and label modification improve the
parsing performance.
