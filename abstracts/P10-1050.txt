The Viterbi algorithm is the conventional
decoding algorithm most widely adopted
for sequence labeling. Viterbi decoding
is, however, prohibitively slow when the
label set is large, because its time com-
plexity is quadratic in the number of la-
bels. This paper proposes an exact decod-
ing algorithm that overcomes this prob-
lem. A novel property of our algorithm is
that it efficiently reduces the labels to be
decoded, while still allowing us to check
the optimality of the solution. Experi-
ments on three tasks (POS tagging, joint
POS tagging and chunking, and supertag-
ging) show that the new algorithm is sev-
eral orders of magnitude faster than the
basic Viterbi and a state-of-the-art algo-
rithm, CARPEDIEM (Esposito and Radi-
cioni, 2009).
