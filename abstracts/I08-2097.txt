The accuracy of parsing has exceeded 90%
recently, but this is not high enough to use
parsing results practically in natural lan-
guage processing (NLP) applications such as
paraphrase acquisition and relation extrac-
tion. We present a method for detecting re-
liable parses out of the outputs of a single
dependency parser. This technique is also
applied to domain adaptation of dependency
parsing. Our goal was to improve the per-
formance of a state-of-the-art dependency
parser on the data set of the domain adap-
tation track of the CoNLL 2007 shared task,
a formidable challenge.
