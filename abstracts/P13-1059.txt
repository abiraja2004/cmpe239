We propose a Name-aware Machine
Translation (MT) approach which can
tightly integrate name processing into MT
model, by jointly annotating parallel cor-
pora, extracting name-aware translation
grammar and rules, adding name phrase
table and name translation driven decod-
ing. Additionally, we also propose a new
MT metric to appropriately evaluate the
translation quality of informative words,
by assigning different weights to differ-
ent words according to their importance
values in a document. Experiments on
Chinese-English translation demonstrated
the effectiveness of our approach on en-
hancing the quality of overall translation,
name translation and word alignment over
a high-quality MT baseline1.
