Recent efforts in biomolecular event extrac-
tion have mainly focused on core event types
involving genes and proteins, such as gene
expression, protein-protein interactions, and
protein catabolism. The BioNLP?11 Shared
Task extended the event extraction approach
to sub-protein events and relations in the Epi-
genetics and Post-translational Modifications
(EPI) and Protein Relations (REL) tasks. In
this study, we apply the Turku Event Ex-
traction System, the best-performing system
for these tasks, to all PubMed abstracts and
all available PMC full-text articles, extract-
ing 1.4M EPI events and 2.2M REL relations
from 21M abstracts and 372K articles. We
introduce several entity normalization algo-
rithms for genes, proteins, protein complexes
and protein components, aiming to uniquely
identify these biological entities. This nor-
malization effort allows direct mapping of
the extracted events and relations with post-
translational modifications from UniProt, epi-
genetics from PubMeth, functional domains
from InterPro and macromolecular structures
from PDB. The extraction of such detailed
protein information provides a unique text
mining dataset, offering the opportunity to fur-
ther deepen the information provided by ex-
isting PubMed-scale event extraction efforts.
