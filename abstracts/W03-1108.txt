Recent years saw an increased interest
in the use and the construction of large
corpora. With this increased interest
and awareness has come an expansion
in the application to knowledge acqui-
sition and bilingual terminology extrac-
tion. The present paper will seek to
present an approach to bilingual lexi-
con extraction from non-aligned compa-
rable corpora, combination to linguistics-
based pruning and evaluations on Cross-
Language Information Retrieval. We pro-
pose and explore a two-stages translation
model for the acquisition of bilingual ter-
minology from comparable corpora, dis-
ambiguation and selection of best transla-
tion alternatives on the basis of their mor-
phological knowledge. Evaluations using
a large-scale test collection on Japanese-
English and different weighting schemes
of SMART retrieval system confirmed the
effectiveness of the proposed combina-
tion of two-stages comparable corpora
and linguistics-based pruning on Cross-
Language Information Retrieval.
