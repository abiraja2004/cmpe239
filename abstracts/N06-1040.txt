We present a method for induction of con-
cise and accurate probabilistic context-
free grammars for efficient use in early
stages of a multi-stage parsing technique.
The method is based on the use of statis-
tical tests to determine if a non-terminal
combination is unobserved due to sparse
data or hard syntactic constraints. Ex-
perimental results show that, using this
method, high accuracies can be achieved
with a non-terminal set that is orders
of magnitude smaller than in typically
induced probabilistic context-free gram-
mars, leading to substantial speed-ups in
parsing. The approach is further used in
combination with an existing reranker to
provide competitive WSJ parsing results.
