  
There is no blank to mark word boundaries in 
Chinese text. As a result, identifying words is 
difficult, because of segmentation ambiguities 
and occurrences of unknown words. 
Conventionally unknown words were extracted 
by statistical methods because statistical 
methods are simple and efficient. However the 
statistical methods without using linguistic 
knowledge suffer the drawbacks of low 
precision and low recall, since character strings 
with statistical significance might be phrases or 
partial phrases instead of words and low 
frequency new words are hardly identifiable by 
statistical methods. In addition to statistical 
information, we try to use as much information 
as possible, such as morphology, syntax, 
semantics, and world knowledge. The 
identification system fully utilizes the context 
and content information of unknown words in 
the steps of detection process, extraction process, 
and verification process. A practical unknown 
word extraction system was implemented which 
online identifies new words, including low 
frequency new words, with high precision and 
high recall rates.
