 
Some languages? orthographic properties 
allow written data to be used for phono-
logical research. This paper reports on an 
on-going project that uses a web-derived 
text corpus to study the phonology of 
Tagalog, a language for which large cor-
pora are not otherwise available. Novel 
findings concerning the phenomenon of 
intervocalic tapping are discussed in de-
tail, and an overview of other phonologi-
cal phenomena in the language that can 
be investigated through written data is 
given.
