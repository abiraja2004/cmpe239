In this work we revise the application
of discriminative learning to the problem
of phrase selection in Statistical Machine
Translation. Inspired by common tech-
niques used in Word Sense Disambiguation,
we train classifiers based on local context
to predict possible phrase translations. Our
work extends that of Vickrey et al (2005) in
two main aspects. First, we move from word
translation to phrase translation. Second, we
move from the ?blank-filling? task to the ?full
translation? task. We report results on a set
of highly frequent source phrases, obtaining
a significant improvement, specially with re-
spect to adequacy, according to a rigorous
process of manual evaluation.
