In this paper we present a method for unsuper-
vised semantic role induction which we for-
malize as a graph partitioning problem. Ar-
gument instances of a verb are represented as
vertices in a graph whose edge weights quan-
tify their role-semantic similarity. Graph par-
titioning is realized with an algorithm that it-
eratively assigns vertices to clusters based on
the cluster assignments of neighboring ver-
tices. Our method is algorithmically and con-
ceptually simple, especially with respect to
how problem-specific knowledge is incorpo-
rated into the model. Experimental results on
the CoNLL 2008 benchmark dataset demon-
strate that our model is competitive with other
unsupervised approaches in terms of F1 whilst
attaining significantly higher cluster purity.
