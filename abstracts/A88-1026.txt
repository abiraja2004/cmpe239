 
Luke is a knowledge editor designed to support two 
tasks; the first is editing the classes and relations in a 
knowledge base. The second is editing and maintaining the 
semantic mapping knowledge neccesery to allow a natural 
language interface to understand sentences with respect to 
that knowledge base. In order to emphasize design 
decisions shared between the two tasks, Luke provides 
facilities to concurrently debug the application and the 
natural language interface. Luke also makes natural 
language available in its own user interface. This makes it 
possible for a knowledge base builder to exploit natural 
language both as a way of locating desired concepts within 
the knowledge base and as a a way of doing consistency 
checking on the knowledge base as it is being built. 
base, Luke makes natural language available in 
its own interface. This makes it possible for the 
knowledge base builder to exploit natural 
language both as a way of referring to objects in 
the knowledge base and as a way of doing 
consistency checking on the objects themselves. 
In this paper, we will describe both what Luke 
does and how doing that supports this 
productive view of the interaction between 
building a knowledge based system and building 
an associated natural language interface.
