In this paper, we describe an approach based
on off-the-shelf parsers and semantic re-
sources for the Recognizing Textual Entail-
ment (RTE) challenge that can be generally
applied to any domain. Syntax is exploited
by means of tree kernels whereas lexical se-
mantics is derived from heterogeneous re-
sources, e.g. WordNet or distributional se-
mantics through Wikipedia. The joint syn-
tactic/semantic model is realized by means of
tree kernels, which can exploit lexical related-
ness to match syntactically similar structures,
i.e. whose lexical compounds are related. The
comparative experiments across different RTE
challenges and traditional systems show that
our approach consistently and meaningfully
achieves high accuracy, without requiring any
adaptation or tuning.
