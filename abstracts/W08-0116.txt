 
This paper presents a coding protocol that al-lows na?ve users to annotate dialogue tran-scripts for anaphora and ellipsis. Cohen's kappa statistic demonstrates that the protocol is sufficiently robust in terms of reliability. It is proposed that quantitative ellipsis data may be used as an index of mutual-engagement. Current and potential uses of ellipsis coding are described.
