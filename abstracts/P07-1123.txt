This paper explores methods for generating
subjectivity analysis resources in a new lan-
guage by leveraging on the tools and re-
sources available in English. Given a bridge
between English and the selected target lan-
guage (e.g., a bilingual dictionary or a par-
allel corpus), the methods can be used to
rapidly create tools for subjectivity analysis
in the new language.
