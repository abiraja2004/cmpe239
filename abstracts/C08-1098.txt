We present a HMM part-of-speech tag-
ging method which is particularly suited
for POS tagsets with a large number of
fine-grained tags. It is based on three ideas:
(1) splitting of the POS tags into attribute
vectors and decomposition of the contex-
tual POS probabilities of the HMM into a
product of attribute probabilities, (2) esti-
mation of the contextual probabilities with
decision trees, and (3) use of high-order
HMMs. In experiments on German and
Czech data, our tagger outperformed state-
of-the-art POS taggers.
