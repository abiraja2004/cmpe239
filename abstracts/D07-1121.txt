We present an adaptation of constraint satis-
faction inference (Canisius et al, 2006b) for
predicting dependency trees. Three differ-
ent classifiers are trained to predict weighted
soft-constraints on parts of the complex out-
put. From these constraints, a standard
weighted constraint satisfaction problem can
be formed, the solution to which is a valid
dependency tree.
