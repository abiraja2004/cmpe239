 
Acknowledgments are relatively rare in human- 
computer interaction. Are people unwilling to use 
this human convention when talking to a machine, 
or is their scarcity due to the way that spoken-lan- 
guage interfaces are designed? We found that, 
given a simple spoken-language interface that pro- 
vided opportunities for and responded to acknowl- 
edgments ,  about hal f  of our subjects  used 
acknowledgments at least once and nearly 30% 
used them extensively during the interaction.
