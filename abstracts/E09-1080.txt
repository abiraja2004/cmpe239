We present several algorithms for assign-
ing heads in phrase structure trees, based
on different linguistic intuitions on the role
of heads in natural language syntax. Start-
ing point of our approach is the obser-
vation that a head-annotated treebank de-
fines a unique lexicalized tree substitution
grammar. This allows us to go back and
forth between the two representations, and
define objective functions for the unsu-
pervised learning of head assignments in
terms of features of the implicit lexical-
ized tree grammars. We evaluate algo-
rithms based on the match with gold stan-
dard head-annotations, and the compar-
ative parsing accuracy of the lexicalized
grammars they give rise to. On the first
task, we approach the accuracy of hand-
designed heuristics for English and inter-
annotation-standard agreement for Ger-
man. On the second task, the implied lex-
icalized grammars score 4% points higher
on parsing accuracy than lexicalized gram-
mars derived by commonly used heuris-
tics.
