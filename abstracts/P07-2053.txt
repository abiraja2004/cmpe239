In the world of non-proprietary NLP soft-
ware the standard, and perhaps the best,
HMM-based POS tagger is TnT (Brants,
2000). We argue here that some of the crit-
icism aimed at HMM performance on lan-
guages with rich morphology should more
properly be directed at TnT?s peculiar li-
cense, free but not open source, since it is
those details of the implementation which
are hidden from the user that hold the key
for improved POS tagging across a wider
variety of languages. We present HunPos1,
a free and open source (LGPL-licensed) al-
ternative, which can be tuned by the user to
fully utilize the potential of HMM architec-
tures, offering performance comparable to
more complex models, but preserving the
ease and speed of the training and tagging
process.
