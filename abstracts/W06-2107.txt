This paper describes ongoing work, aimed
at producing a lexicon of prepositions, i.e.
relations denoted by prepositions, to be
used for information retrieval purposes.
The work is ontology based, which for this
project means that the ontological types of
the arguments of the preposition are con-
sidered, rather than the word forms. Thus,
sense distinctions are made based on onto-
logical constraints on the arguments.
