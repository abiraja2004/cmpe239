Sentence fusion enables summarization and
question-answering systems to produce out-
put by combining fully formed phrases from
different sentences. Yet there is little data
that can be used to develop and evaluate fu-
sion techniques. In this paper, we present a
methodology for collecting fusions of simi-
lar sentence pairs using Amazon?s Mechani-
cal Turk, selecting the input pairs in a semi-
automated fashion. We evaluate the results
using a novel technique for automatically se-
lecting a representative sentence from multi-
ple responses. Our approach allows for rapid
construction of a high accuracy fusion corpus.
