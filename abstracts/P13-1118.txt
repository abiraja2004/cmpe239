Derivational models are still an under-
researched area in computational morphol-
ogy. Even for German, a rather resource-
rich language, there is a lack of large-
coverage derivational knowledge. This pa-
per describes a rule-based framework for
inducing derivational families (i.e., clus-
ters of lemmas in derivational relation-
ships) and its application to create a high-
coverage German resource, DERIVBASE,
mapping over 280k lemmas into more than
17k non-singleton clusters. We focus on the
rule component and a qualitative and quan-
titative evaluation. Our approach achieves
up to 93% precision and 71% recall. We
attribute the high precision to the fact that
our rules are based on information from
grammar books.
