We describe a statistical approach to semantic
role labelling that employs only shallow infor-
mation. We use a Maximum Entropy learner,
augmented by EM-based clustering to model
the fit between a verb and its argument can-
didate. The instances to be classified are se-
quences of chunks that occur frequently as ar-
guments in the training corpus. Our best model
obtains an F score of 51.70 on the test set.
