Children acquire mental state verbs (MSVs)
much later than other, lower-frequency, words.
One factor proposed to contribute to this de-
lay is that children must learn various seman-
tic and syntactic cues that draw attention to the
difficult-to-observe mental content of a scene.
We develop a novel computational approach
that enables us to explore the role of such cues,
and show that our model can replicate aspects
of the developmental trajectory of MSV acqui-
sition.
