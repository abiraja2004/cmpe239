We present a two-stage multilingual de-
pendency parsing system submitted to the
Multilingual Track of CoNLL-2007. The
parser first identifies dependencies using a
deterministic parsing method and then labels
those dependencies as a sequence labeling
problem. We describe the features used in
each stage. For four languages with differ-
ent values of ROOT, we design some spe-
cial features for the ROOT labeler. Then we
present evaluation results and error analyses
focusing on Chinese.
