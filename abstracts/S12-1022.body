Over the past decade, several underspec-
ification frameworks have been proposed
that efficiently solve a big subset of scope-
underspecified semantic representations
within the realm of the most popular
constraint-based formalisms. However, there
exists a family of coherent natural language
sentences whose underspecified representa-
tion does not belong to this subset. It has
remained an open question whether there ex-
ists a tractable superset of these frameworks,
covering this family. In this paper, we show
that the answer to this question is yes. We
define a superset of the previous frameworks,
which is solvable by similar algorithms with
the same time and space complexity.
