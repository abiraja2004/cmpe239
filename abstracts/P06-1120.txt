This paper focuses on the use of advanced
techniques of text analysis as support for
collocation extraction. A hybrid system is
presented that combines statistical meth-
ods and multilingual parsing for detecting
accurate collocational information from
English, French, Spanish and Italian cor-
pora. The advantage of relying on full
parsing over using a traditional window
method (which ignores the syntactic in-
formation) is first theoretically motivated,
then empirically validated by a compara-
tive evaluation experiment.
