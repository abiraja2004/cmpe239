In this paper, we consider classifying word
positions by whether or not they can either
start or end multi-word constituents. This
provides a mechanism for ?closing? chart
cells during context-free inference, which
is demonstrated to improve efficiency and
accuracy when used to constrain the well-
known Charniak parser. Additionally, we
present a method for ?closing? a sufficient
number of chart cells to ensure quadratic
worst-case complexity of context-free in-
ference. Empirical results show that this
O(n
2
) bound can be achieved without im-
pacting parsing accuracy.
