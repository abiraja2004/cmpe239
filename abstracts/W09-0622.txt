The background for this paper is the aim
to build robotic assistants that can ?natu-
rally? interact with humans. One prereq-
uisite for this is that the robot can cor-
rectly identify objects or places a user
refers to, and produce comprehensible ref-
erences itself. As robots typically act
in environments that are larger than what
is immediately perceivable, the problem
arises how to identify the appropriate con-
text, against which to resolve or produce
a referring expression (RE). Existing al-
gorithms for generating REs generally by-
pass this problem by assuming a given
context. In this paper, we explicitly ad-
dress this problem, proposing a method for
context determination in large-scale space.
We show how it can be applied both for re-
solving and producing REs.
