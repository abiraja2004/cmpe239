This study addresses the problem of au-
tomatically detecting decisions in conver-
sational speech. We formulate the prob-
lem as classifying decision-making units
at two levels of granularity: dialogue acts
and topic segments. We conduct an em-
pirical analysis to determine the charac-
teristic features of decision-making dia-
logue acts, and train MaxEnt models using
these features for the classification tasks.
We find that models that combine lexi-
cal, prosodic, contextual and topical fea-
tures yield the best results on both tasks,
achieving 72% and 86% precision, respec-
tively. The study also provides a quantita-
tive analysis of the relative importance of
the feature types.
