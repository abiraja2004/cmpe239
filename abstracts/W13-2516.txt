 
Focusing on a systematic Latent Semantic 
Analysis (LSA) and Machine Learning (ML) 
approach, this research contributes to the de-
velopment of a methodology for the automatic 
compilation of comparable collections of doc-
uments. Its originality lies within the delinea-
tion of relevant comparability characteristics 
of similar documents in line with an estab-
lished definition of comparable corpora. These 
innovative characteristics are used to build a 
LSA vector-based representation of the texts. 
In accordance with this new reduced in dimen-
sionality document space, an unsupervised 
machine learning algorithm gathers similar 
texts into comparable clusters. On a monolin-
gual collection of less than 100 documents, the 
proposed approach assigns comparable docu-
ments to different comparable corpora with 
high confidence.
