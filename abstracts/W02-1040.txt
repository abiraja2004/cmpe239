We report on experiments in reference res-
olution using a decision tree approach. We
started with a standard feature set used in
previous work, which led to moderate re-
sults. A closer examination of the perfor-
mance of the features for different forms
of anaphoric expressions showed good re-
sults for pronouns, moderate results for
proper names, and poor results for definite
noun phrases. We then included a cheap,
language and domain independent feature
based on the minimum edit distance be-
tween strings. This feature yielded a sig-
nificant improvement for data sets consist-
ing of definite noun phrases and proper
names, respectively. When applied to
the whole data set the feature produced a
smaller but still significant improvement.
