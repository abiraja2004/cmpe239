We present BEETLE II, a tutorial dia-
logue system designed to accept unre-
stricted language input and support exper-
imentation with different tutorial planning
and dialogue strategies. Our first system
evaluation used two different tutorial poli-
cies and demonstrated that the system can
be successfully used to study the impact
of different approaches to tutoring. In the
future, the system can also be used to ex-
periment with a variety of natural language
interpretation and generation techniques.
