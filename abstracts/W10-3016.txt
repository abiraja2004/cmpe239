This paper describes the approach to
hedge detection we developed, in order to
participate in the shared task at CoNLL-
2010. A supervised learning approach is
employed in our implementation. Hedge
cue annotations in the training data are
used as the seed to build a reliable hedge
cue set. Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt)
model is used as the learning technique to
determine uncertainty. By making use of
Apache Lucene, we are able to do fuzzy
string match to extract hedge cues, and
to incorporate part-of-speech (POS) tags
in hedge cues. Not only can our system
determine the certainty of the sentence,
but is also able to find all the contained
hedges. Our system was ranked third on
the Wikipedia dataset. In later experi-
ments with different parameters, we fur-
ther improved our results, with a 0.612
F-score on the Wikipedia dataset, and a
0.802 F-score on the biological dataset.
