This paper proposes a framework for train-
ing Conditional Random Fields (CRFs)
to optimize multivariate evaluation mea-
sures, including non-linear measures such
as F-score. Our proposed framework is
derived from an error minimization ap-
proach that provides a simple solution for
directly optimizing any evaluation mea-
sure. Specifically focusing on sequential
segmentation tasks, i.e. text chunking and
named entity recognition, we introduce a
loss function that closely reflects the tar-
get evaluation measure for these tasks,
namely, segmentation F-score. Our ex-
periments show that our method performs
better than standard CRF training.
