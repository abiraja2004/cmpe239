The paper outlines the work carried out at
NTNU as part of the *SEM?13 shared task
on Semantic Textual Similarity, using an ap-
proach which combines shallow textual, dis-
tributional and knowledge-based features by
a support vector regression model. Feature
sets include (1) aggregated similarity based
on named entity recognition with WordNet
and Levenshtein distance through the calcula-
tion of maximum weighted bipartite graphs;
(2) higher order word co-occurrence simi-
larity using a novel method called ?Multi-
sense Random Indexing?; (3) deeper seman-
tic relations based on the RelEx semantic
dependency relationship extraction system;
(4) graph edit-distance on dependency trees;
(5) reused features of the TakeLab and DKPro
systems from the STS?12 shared task. The
NTNU systems obtained 9th place overall (5th
best team) and 1st place on the SMT data set.
