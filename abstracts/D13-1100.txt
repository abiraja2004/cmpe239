Temporal variations of text are usually ig-
nored in NLP applications. However, text use
changes with time, which can affect many
applications. In this paper we model peri-
odic distributions of words over time. Focus-
ing on hashtag frequency in Twitter, we first
automatically identify the periodic patterns.
We use this for regression in order to fore-
cast the volume of a hashtag based on past
data. We use Gaussian Processes, a state-of-
the-art bayesian non-parametric model, with
a novel periodic kernel. We demonstrate this
in a text classification setting, assigning the
tweet hashtag based on the rest of its text. This
method shows significant improvements over
competitive baselines.
