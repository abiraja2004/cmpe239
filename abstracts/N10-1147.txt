We present a novel approach to metaphor in-
terpretation and a system that produces lit-
eral paraphrases for metaphorical expressions.
Such a representation is directly transferable
to other applications that can benefit from a
metaphor processing component. Our method
is distinguished from the previous work in that
it does not rely on any hand-crafted knowl-
edge about metaphor, but in contrast employs
automatically induced selectional preferences.
Being the first of its kind, our system is capa-
ble of paraphrasing metaphorical expressions
with a high accuracy (0.81).
