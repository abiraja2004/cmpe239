This paper describes The University of Mel-
bourne NLP group submission to the Cross-
lingual Textual Entailment shared task, our
first tentative attempt at the task. The ap-
proach involves using parallel corpora and au-
tomatic word alignment to align text fragment
pairs, and statistics based on unaligned words
as features to classify items as forward and
backward before a compositional combination
into the final four classes, as well as exper-
iments with additional string similarity fea-
tures.
