We present the ADAMACH data centric dia-
log system, that allows to perform on- and off-
line mining of dialog context, speech recog-
nition results and other system-generated rep-
resentations, both within and across dialogs.
The architecture implements a ?fat pipeline?
for speech and language processing. We detail
how the approach integrates domain knowl-
edge and evolving empirical data, based on a
user study in the University Helpdesk domain.
