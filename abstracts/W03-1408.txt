The objective of this paper is to present a
new dimension of Game Theoretic Se-
mantics (GTS) using the idea of the coor-
dination problem game to explain the
semantics of metaphor. A metaphorical
expression

 such as ?man is a wolf? is a
contradictory statement that insists all
objects in the set of ?man? also falls under
?wolf?. The study of metaphorical expres-
sion should be on intentions of such con-
tradictory language use, their intended
effect, and the conditions to lead to the ef-
fects. This is the tradition of Rhetoric
since Aristotle. It may be natural to char-
acterize this approach as pragmatic in the
tradition of the late 20th century paradigm
of linguistics, which is the trichotomy of
syntax, semantics and pragmatics. How-
ever the pragmatic approach cannot ex-
plain what Richards (1936) called
?tension? between two thoughts in a meta-
phorical expression. GTS has been devel-

 In this paper, I say ?metaphorical expression? rather
than ?metaphor?. ?Metaphor? is commonly used as a
topic, but it is used at word level in traditional rhetoric
and at sentence level after Black. Also, ?metaphor? is
used for both metaphorical expression and a kind of
trope. So I use ?metaphorical expression? to refer lin-
guistic expression which is commonly called ?metaphor?.
oped as a possible substitute to the Tar-
skian truth conditional semantics. This
paper explores a new possibility of GTS
in the coordination problem game intro-
duced by Lewis (1961) for a semantics,
which admits the plurality of meanings.
