Automated identification of diverse sen-
timent types can be beneficial for many
NLP systems such as review summariza-
tion and public media analysis. In some of
these systems there is an option of assign-
ing a sentiment value to a single sentence
or a very short text.
In this paper we propose a supervised
sentiment classification framework which
is based on data from Twitter, a popu-
lar microblogging service. By utilizing
50 Twitter tags and 15 smileys as sen-
timent labels, this framework avoids the
need for labor intensive manual annota-
tion, allowing identification and classifi-
cation of diverse sentiment types of short
texts. We evaluate the contribution of dif-
ferent feature types for sentiment classifi-
cation and show that our framework suc-
cessfully identifies sentiment types of un-
tagged sentences. The quality of the senti-
ment identification was also confirmed by
human judges. We also explore dependen-
cies and overlap between different sen-
timent types represented by smileys and
Twitter hashtags.
