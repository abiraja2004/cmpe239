The paper presents a novel sentence pair ex-
traction algorithm for comparable data, where
a large set of candidate sentence pairs is scored
directly at the sentence-level. The sentence-
level extraction relies on a very efficient im-
plementation of a simple symmetric scoring
function: a computation speed-up by a fac-
tor of 30 is reported. On Spanish-English
data, the extraction algorithm finds the highest
scoring sentence pairs from close to 1 trillion
candidate pairs without search errors. Sig-
nificant improvements in BLEU are reported
by including the extracted sentence pairs into
the training of a phrase-based SMT (Statistical
Machine Translation) system.
