In this paper, we first analyze and classify the
empty categories in a Hindi dependency tree-
bank and then identify various discovery pro-
cedures to automatically detect the existence
of these categories in a sentence. For this we
make use of lexical knowledge along with the
parsed output from a constraint based parser.
Through this work we show that it is possi-
ble to successfully discover certain types of
empty categories while some other types are
more difficult to identify. This work leads to
the state-of-the-art system for automatic inser-
tion of empty categories in the Hindi sentence.
