Learning a tree substitution grammar is
very challenging due to derivational am-
biguity. Our recent approach used a
Bayesian non-parametric model to induce
good derivations from treebanked input
(Cohn et al, 2009), biasing towards small
grammars composed of small generalis-
able productions. In this paper we present
a novel training method for the model us-
ing a blocked Metropolis-Hastings sam-
pler in place of the previous method?s lo-
cal Gibbs sampler. The blocked sam-
pler makes considerably larger moves than
the local sampler and consequently con-
verges in less time. A core component
of the algorithm is a grammar transforma-
tion which represents an infinite tree sub-
stitution grammar in a finite context free
grammar. This enables efficient blocked
inference for training and also improves
the parsing algorithm. Both algorithms are
shown to improve parsing accuracy.
