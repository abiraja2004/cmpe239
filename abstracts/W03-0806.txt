Natural Language Processing (NLP) system de-
velopers face a number of new challenges. In-
terest is increasing for real-world systems that
use NLP tools and techniques. The quantity of
text now available for training and processing
is increasing dramatically. Also, the range of
languages and tasks being researched contin-
ues to grow rapidly. Thus it is an ideal time
to consider the development of new experimen-
tal frameworks. We describe the requirements,
initial design and exploratory implementation
of a high performance NLP infrastructure.
