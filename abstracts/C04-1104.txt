 
This paper describes the technology and an ex-
periment of subcategorization acquisition for 
Chinese verbs. The SCF hypotheses are gener-
ated by means of linguistic heuristic information 
and filtered via statistical methods. Evaluation 
on the acquisition of 20 multi-pattern verbs 
shows that our experiment achieved the similar 
precision and recall with former researches. Be-
sides, simple application of the acquired lexicon 
to a PCFG parser indicates great potentialities of 
subcategorization information in the fields of 
NLP.
