We describe two systems participating
in Semeval-2010?s Cross-Lingual Lexical
Substitution task: USPwlv and WLVusp.
Both systems are based on two main com-
ponents: (i) a dictionary to provide a num-
ber of possible translations for each source
word, and (ii) a contextual model to select
the best translation according to the con-
text where the source word occurs. These
components and the way they are inte-
grated are different in the two systems:
they exploit corpus-based and linguistic
resources, and supervised and unsuper-
vised learning methods. Among the 14
participants in the subtask to identify the
best translation, our systems were ranked
2nd and 4th in terms of recall, 3rd and 4th
in terms of precision. Both systems out-
performed the baselines in all subtasks ac-
cording to all metrics used.
