We present an automatic method for ana-
lyzing sentiment dynamics between char-
acters in plays. This literary format?s
structured dialogue allows us to make as-
sumptions about who is participating in a
conversation. Once we have an idea of
who a character is speaking to, the senti-
ment in his or her speech can be attributed
accordingly, allowing us to generate lists
of a character?s enemies and allies as well
as pinpoint scenes critical to a character?s
emotional development. Results of ex-
periments on Shakespeare?s plays are pre-
sented along with discussion of how this
work can be extended to unstructured texts
(i.e. novels).
