This paper summarizes our participation
in task #17 of SemEval?2 (All?words
WSD on a specific domain) using a su-
pervised class-based Word Sense Disam-
biguation system. Basically, we use Sup-
port Vector Machines (SVM) as learning
algorithm and a set of simple features to
build three different models. Each model
considers a different training corpus: Sem-
Cor (SC), examples from monosemous
words extracted automatically from back-
ground data (BG), and both SC and
BG (SCBG). Our system explodes the
monosemous words appearing as mem-
bers of a particular WordNet semantic
class to automatically acquire class-based
annotated examples from the domain text.
We use the class-based examples gathered
from the domain corpus to adapt our tra-
ditional system trained on SemCor. The
evaluation reveal that the best results are
achieved training with SemCor and the
background examples from monosemous
words, obtaining results above the first
sense baseline and the fifth best position
in the competition rank.
