The paper discuses problems in annotating
a corpus containing Polish clinical data with
low level linguistic information. We propose
an approach to tokenization and automatic
morphologic annotation of data that uses ex-
isting programs combined with a set of do-
main specific rules and vocabulary. Finally
we present the results of manual verification
of the annotation for a subset of data.
