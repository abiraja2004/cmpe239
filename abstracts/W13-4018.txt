Determining the quality of an ongoing in-
teraction in the field of Spoken Dialogue
Systems is a hard task. While existing
methods employing automatic estimation
already achieve reasonable results, still
there is a lot of room for improvement.
Hence, we aim at tackling the task by es-
timating the error of the applied statistical
classification algorithms in a two-stage ap-
proach. Correcting the hypotheses using
the estimated model error increases per-
formance by up to 4.1 % relative improve-
ment in Unweighted Average Recall.
