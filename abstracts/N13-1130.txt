In this paper we propose a new approach to
the generation of pseudowords, i.e., artificial
words which model real polysemous words.
Our approach simultaneously addresses the
two important issues that hamper the gener-
ation of large pseudosense-annotated datasets:
semantic awareness and coverage. We eval-
uate these pseudowords from three different
perspectives showing that they can be used as
reliable substitutes for their real counterparts.
