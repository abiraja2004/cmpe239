It is not clear a priori how well parsers
trained on the Penn Treebank will parse
significantly different corpora without
retraining. We carried out a compet-
itive evaluation of three leading tree-
bank parsers on an annotated corpus
from the human molecular biology do-
main, and on an extract from the Penn
Treebank for comparison, performing a
detailed analysis of the kinds of errors
each parser made, along with a quan-
titative comparison of syntax usage be-
tween the two corpora. Our results sug-
gest that these tools are becoming some-
what over-specialised on their training
domain at the expense of portability, but
also indicate that some of the errors en-
countered are of doubtful importance for
information extraction tasks.
Furthermore, our inital experiments
with unsupervised parse combination
techniques showed that integrating the
output of several parsers can ameliorate
some of the performance problems they
encounter on unfamiliar text, providing
accuracy and coverage improvements,
and a novel measure of trustworthiness.
