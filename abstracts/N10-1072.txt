This paper address the problem of entity link-
ing. Specifically, given an entity mentioned in
unstructured texts, the task is to link this entity
with an entry stored in the existing knowledge
base. This is an important task for informa-
tion extraction. It can serve as a convenient
gateway to encyclopedic information, and can
greatly improve the web users? experience.
Previous learning based solutions mainly fo-
cus on classification framework. However, it?s
more suitable to consider it as a ranking prob-
lem. In this paper, we propose a learning to
rank algorithm for entity linking. It effectively
utilizes the relationship information among
the candidates when ranking. The experi-
ment results on the TAC 20091 dataset demon-
strate the effectiveness of our proposed frame-
work. The proposed method achieves 18.5%
improvement in terms of accuracy over the
classification models for those entities which
have corresponding entries in the Knowledge
Base. The overall performance of the system
is also better than that of the state-of-the-art
methods.
