The main aim of this paper is
to analyse the eects of applying
pronominal anaphora resolution to
Question Answering (QA) systems.
For this task a complete QA system
has been implemented. System eval-
uation measures performance im-
provements obtained when informa-
tion that is referenced anaphorically
in documents is not ignored.
