This article presents the GETALP system for
the participation to SemEval-2013 Task 12,
based on an adaptation of the Lesk measure
propagated through an Ant Colony Algorithm,
that yielded good results on the corpus of Se-
meval 2007 Task 7 (WordNet 2.1) as well as
the trial data for Task 12 SemEval 2013 (Ba-
belNet 1.0). We approach the parameter es-
timation to our algorithm from two perspec-
tives: edogenous estimation where we max-
imised the sum the local Lesk scores; exoge-
nous estimation where we maximised the F1
score on trial data. We proposed three runs
of out system, exogenous estimation with Ba-
belNet 1.1.1 synset id annotations, endoge-
nous estimation with BabelNet 1.1.1 synset id
annotations and endogenous estimation with
WordNet 3.1 sense keys. A bug in our imple-
mentation led to incorrect results and here, we
present an amended version thereof. Our sys-
tem arrived third on this task and a more fine
grained analysis of our results reveals that the
algorithms performs best on general domain
texts with as little named entities as possible.
The presence of many named entities leads the
performance of the system to plummet greatly.
