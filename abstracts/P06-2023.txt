This paper proposes a new approach for
Multi-word Expression (MWE)extraction
on the motivation of gene sequence align-
ment because textual sequence is simi-
lar to gene sequence in pattern analy-
sis. Theory of Longest Common Subse-
quence (LCS) originates from computer
science and has been established as affine
gap model in Bioinformatics. We per-
form this developed LCS technique com-
bined with linguistic criteria in MWE ex-
traction. In comparison with traditional
n-gram method, which is the major tech-
nique for MWE extraction, LCS approach
is applied with great efficiency and per-
formance guarantee. Experimental results
show that LCS-based approach achieves
better results than n-gram.
