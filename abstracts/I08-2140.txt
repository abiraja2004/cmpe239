We present the Global Health Monitor, an 
online Web-based system for 
detecting and mapping infectious disease 
outbreaks that appear in news 
stories. The system analyzes English news 
stories from news feed providers, 
classifies them for topical relevance and 
plots them onto a Google map using 
geo-coding information, helping public 
health workers to monitor the spread 
of diseases in a geo-temporal context. The 
background knowledge for the 
system is contained in the BioCaster ontol-
ogy (BCO) (Collier et al, 2007a) 
which includes both information on infec-
tious diseases as well as 
geographical locations with their lati-
tudes/longitudes. The system consists 
of four main stages: topic classification, 
named entity recognition (NER), 
disease/location detection and visualiza-
tion. Evaluation of the system shows 
that it achieved high accuracy on a gold 
standard corpus. The system is now 
in practical use. Running on a cluster-
computer, it monitors more than 1500 
news feeds 24/7, updating the map every 
hour.
