 
This paper first presents a review of the 
options available for conveying maps and 
graphics to visually impaired and blind 
people. A novel audio-tactile methodology 
is described, and the results from its pilot 
study reported. Communication of spatial 
media, such as map, is problematic without 
sight. Tactile perception is serial rather 
than synoptic. By building a working 
model of the environment that is uses both 
tactile and auditory feedback, a map is 
made far more accessible. Results from the 
pilot study demonstrated simplicity and 
enjoyment of use of this novel approach 
which integrates speech, verbal andmarks, 
earcons and recorded environmental sound 
to build a small spatial hypermedia system.
