We briefly describe a two-way speech-to-
speech English-Farsi translation system
prototype developed for use in doctor-
patient interactions.  The overarching
philosophy of the developers has been to
create a system that enables effective
communication, rather than focusing on
maximizing component-level perform-
ance.  The discussion focuses on the gen-
eral approach and evaluation of the
system by an independent government
evaluation team.
