This paper compares a deep and a shallow
processing approach to the problem of clas-
sifying a sentence as grammatically well-
formed or ill-formed. The deep processing
approach uses the XLE LFG parser and En-
glish grammar: two versions are presented,
one which uses the XLE directly to perform
the classification, and another one which
uses a decision tree trained on features con-
sisting of the XLE?s output statistics. The
shallow processing approach predicts gram-
maticality based on n-gram frequency statis-
tics: we present two versions, one which
uses frequency thresholds and one which
uses a decision tree trained on the frequen-
cies of the rarest n-grams in the input sen-
tence. We find that the use of a decision tree
improves on the basic approach only for the
deep parser-based approach. We also show
that combining both the shallow and deep
decision tree features is effective. Our eval-
uation is carried out using a large test set of
grammatical and ungrammatical sentences.
The ungrammatical test set is generated au-
tomatically by inserting grammatical errors
into well-formed BNC sentences.
