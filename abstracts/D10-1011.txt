The PECO framework is a knowledge repre-
sentation for formulating clinical questions.
Queries are decomposed into four aspects,
which are Patient-Problem (P), Exposure (E),
Comparison (C) and Outcome (O). However,
no test collection is available to evaluate such
framework in information retrieval. In this
work, we first present the construction of a
large test collection extracted from system-
atic literature reviews. We then describe an
analysis of the distribution of PECO elements
throughout the relevant documents and pro-
pose a language modeling approach that uses
these distributions as a weighting strategy. In
our experiments carried out on a collection of
1.5 million documents and 423 queries, our
method was found to lead to an improvement
of 28% in MAP and 50% in P@5, as com-
pared to the state-of-the-art method.
