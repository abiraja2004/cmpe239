This paper describes a system for the un-
supervised learning of morphological suf-
fixes and stems from word lists. The sys-
tem is composed of a generative probabil-
ity model and a novel search algorithm.
By examining morphologically rich sub-
sets of an input lexicon, the search identi-
fies highly productive paradigms. Quanti-
tative results are shown by measuring the
accuracy of the morphological relations
identified. Experiments in English and
Polish, as well as comparisons with other
recent unsupervised morphology learning
algorithms demonstrate the effectiveness
of this technique.
