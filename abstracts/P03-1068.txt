We describe the ongoing construction of
a large, semantically annotated corpus
resource as reliable basis for the large-
scale acquisition of word-semantic infor-
mation, e.g. the construction of domain-
independent lexica. The backbone of the
annotation are semantic roles in the frame
semantics paradigm. We report expe-
riences and evaluate the annotated data
from the first project stage. On this ba-
sis, we discuss the problems of vagueness
and ambiguity in semantic annotation.
