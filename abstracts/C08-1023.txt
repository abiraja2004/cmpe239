 
This paper describes the design and 
evaluation of an extractive summarizer 
for educational science content called 
COGENT. COGENT extends MEAD 
based on strategies elicited from an em-
pirical study with science domain and in-
structional design experts. COGENT 
identifies sentences containing pedagogi-
cally relevant concepts for a specific sci-
ence domain. The algorithms pursue a 
hybrid approach integrating both domain 
independent bottom-up sentence scoring 
features and domain-aware top-down fea-
tures. Evaluation results indicate that 
COGENT outperforms existing summar-
izers and generates summaries that 
closely resemble those generated by hu-
man experts. COGENT concept invento-
ries appear to also support the computa-
tional identification of student miscon-
ceptions about earthquakes and plate tec-
tonics.
