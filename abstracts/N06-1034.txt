We investigate using the PARADISE
framework to develop predictive models
of system performance in our spoken di-
alogue tutoring system. We represent per-
formance with two metrics: user satis-
faction and student learning. We train
and test predictive models of these met-
rics in our tutoring system corpora. We
predict user satisfaction with 2 parameter
types: 1) system-generic, and 2) tutoring-
specific. To predict student learning, we
also use a third type: 3) user affect. Al-
hough generic parameters are useful pre-
dictors of user satisfaction in other PAR-
ADISE applications, overall our parame-
ters produce less useful user satisfaction
models in our system. However, generic
and tutoring-specific parameters do pro-
duce useful models of student learning in
our system. User affect parameters can in-
crease the usefulness of these models.
