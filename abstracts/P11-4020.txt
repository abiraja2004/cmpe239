In this demo, we present SciSumm, an inter-
active multi-document summarization system
for scientific articles. The document collec-
tion to be summarized is a list of papers cited
together within the same source article, oth-
erwise known as a co-citation. At the heart
of the approach is a topic based clustering of
fragments extracted from each article based on
queries generated from the context surround-
ing the co-cited list of papers. This analy-
sis enables the generation of an overview of
common themes from the co-cited papers that
relate to the context in which the co-citation
was found. SciSumm is currently built over
the 2008 ACL Anthology, however the gen-
eralizable nature of the summarization tech-
niques and the extensible architecture makes it
possible to use the system with other corpora
where a citation network is available. Evalu-
ation results on the same corpus demonstrate
that our system performs better than an exist-
ing widely used multi-document summariza-
tion system (MEAD).
