The standard PCFG approach to parsing is
quite successful on certain domains, but is
relatively inflexible in the type of feature
information we can include in its prob-
abilistic model. In this work, we dis-
cuss preliminary work in developing a new
probabilistic parsing model that allows us
to easily incorporate many different types
of features, including crosslingual infor-
mation. We show how this model can
be used to build a successful parser for a
small handmade gold-standard corpus of
188 sentences (in 3 languages) from the
Europarl corpus.
