Requiring only category names as user input
is a highly attractive, yet hardly explored, set-
ting for text categorization. Earlier bootstrap-
ping results relied on similarity in LSA space,
which captures rather coarse contextual sim-
ilarity. We suggest improving this scheme by
identifying concrete references to the category
name?s meaning, obtaining a special variant of
lexical expansion.
