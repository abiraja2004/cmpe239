This paper describes the approach of the
Hochschule Hannover to the SemEval 2013
Task Evaluating Phrasal Semantics. In or-
der to compare a single word with a two word
phrase we compute various distributional sim-
ilarities, among which a new similarity mea-
sure, based on Jensen-Shannon Divergence
with a correction for frequency effects. The
classification is done by a support vector ma-
chine that uses all similarities as features. The
approach turned out to be the most successful
one in the task.
