Just as programming is the traditional introduction to
computer science, writing grammars by hand is an ex-
cellent introduction to many topics in computational lin-
guistics. We present and justify a well-tested introductory
activity in which teams of mixed background compete
to write probabilistic context-free grammars of English.
The exercise brings together symbolic, probabilistic, al-
gorithmic, and experimental issues in a way that is acces-
sible to novices and enjoyable.
