Efficiency is a prime concern in syntactic MT de-
coding, yet significant developments in statisti-
cal parsing with respect to asymptotic efficiency
haven?t yet been explored in MT. Recently,
McDonald et al (2005b) formalized dependency
parsing as a maximum spanning tree (MST) prob-
lem, which can be solved in quadratic time relative
to the length of the sentence. They show that MST
parsing is almost as accurate as cubic-time depen-
dency parsing in the case of English, and that it
is more accurate with free word order languages.
This paper applies MST parsing to MT, and de-
scribes how it can be integrated into a phrase-based
decoder to compute dependency language model
scores. Our results show that augmenting a state-of-
the-art phrase-based system with this dependency
language model leads to significant improvements
in TER (0.92%) and BLEU (0.45%) scores on five
NIST Chinese-English evaluation test sets.
