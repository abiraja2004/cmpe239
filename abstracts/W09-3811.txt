We present an improved training strategy
for dependency parsers that use online re-
ordering to handle non-projective trees.
The new strategy improves both efficiency
and accuracy by reducing the number of
swap operations performed on non-project-
ive trees by up to 80%. We present state-of-
the-art results for five languages with the
best ever reported results for Czech.
