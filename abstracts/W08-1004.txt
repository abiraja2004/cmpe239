Recent parsing research has started addressing
the questions a) how parsers trained on differ-
ent syntactic resources differ in their perfor-
mance and b) how to conduct a meaningful
evaluation of the parsing results across such
a range of syntactic representations. Two Ger-
man treebanks, Negra and Tu?Ba-D/Z, consti-
tute an interesting testing ground for such re-
search given that the two treebanks make very
different representational choices for this lan-
guage, which also is of general interest given
that German is situated between the extremes
of fixed and free word order. We show that
previous work comparing PCFG parsing with
these two treebanks employed PARSEVAL
and grammatical function comparisons which
were skewed by differences between the two
corpus annotation schemes. Focusing on the
grammatical dependency triples as an essen-
tial dimension of comparison, we show that
the two very distinct corpora result in compa-
rable parsing performance.
