Identifying peer-review helpfulness is an im-
portant task for improving the quality of feed-
back received by students, as well as for help-
ing students write better reviews. As we tailor
standard product review analysis techniques to
our peer-review domain, we notice that peer-
review helpfulness differs not only between
students and experts but also between types
of experts. In this paper, we investigate how
different types of perceived helpfulness might
influence the utility of features for automatic
prediction. Our feature selection results show
that certain low-level linguistic features are
more useful for predicting student perceived
helpfulness, while high-level cognitive con-
structs are more effective in modeling experts?
perceived helpfulness.
