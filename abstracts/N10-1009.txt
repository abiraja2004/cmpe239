Extraction of entities from ad creatives is an
important problem that can benefit many com-
putational advertising tasks. Supervised and
semi-supervised solutions rely on labeled data
which is expensive, time consuming, and dif-
ficult to procure for ad creatives. A small
set of manually derived constraints on fea-
ture expectations over unlabeled data can be
used to partially and probabilistically label
large amounts of data. Utilizing recent work
in constraint-based semi-supervised learning,
this paper injects light weight supervision
specified as these ?constraints? into a semi-
Markov conditional random field model of en-
tity extraction in ad creatives. Relying solely
on the constraints, the model is trained on a set
of unlabeled ads using an online learning al-
gorithm. We demonstrate significant accuracy
improvements on a manually labeled test set
as compared to a baseline dictionary approach.
We also achieve accuracy that approaches a
fully supervised classifier.
