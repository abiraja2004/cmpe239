This paper explores the use of statisti-
cal machine translation (SMT) methods
for tactical natural language generation.
We present results on using phrase-based
SMT for learning to map meaning repre-
sentations to natural language. Improved
results are obtained by inverting a seman-
tic parser that uses SMT methods to map
sentences into meaning representations.
Finally, we show that hybridizing these
two approaches results in still more accu-
rate generation systems. Automatic and
human evaluation of generated sentences
are presented across two domains and four
languages.
