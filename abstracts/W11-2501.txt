We introduce BLESS, a data set specifically
designed for the evaluation of distributional
semantic models. BLESS contains a set of tu-
ples instantiating different, explicitly typed se-
mantic relations, plus a number of controlled
random tuples. It is thus possible to assess the
ability of a model to detect truly related word
pairs, as well as to perform in-depth analy-
ses of the types of semantic relations that a
model favors. We discuss the motivations for
BLESS, describe its construction and struc-
ture, and present examples of its usage in the
evaluation of distributional semantic models.
