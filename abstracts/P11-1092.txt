We present a novel approach to grammatical
error correction based on Alternating Struc-
ture Optimization. As part of our work, we
introduce the NUS Corpus of Learner En-
glish (NUCLE), a fully annotated one mil-
lion words corpus of learner English available
for research purposes. We conduct an exten-
sive evaluation for article and preposition er-
rors using various feature sets. Our exper-
iments show that our approach outperforms
two baselines trained on non-learner text and
learner text, respectively. Our approach also
outperforms two commercial grammar check-
ing software packages.
