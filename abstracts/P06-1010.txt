In this paper we investigate Chinese-
English name transliteration using compa-
rable corpora, corpora where texts in the
two languages deal in some of the same
topics ? and therefore share references
to named entities ? but are not transla-
tions of each other. We present two dis-
tinct methods for transliteration, one ap-
proach using phonetic transliteration, and
the second using the temporal distribu-
tion of candidate pairs. Each of these ap-
proaches works quite well, but by com-
bining the approaches one can achieve
even better results. We then propose a
novel score propagation method that uti-
lizes the co-occurrence of transliteration
pairs within document pairs. This prop-
agation method achieves further improve-
ment over the best results from the previ-
ous step.
