ment of clause identification and classi-
fication techniques for Bengali language. 
A syntactic rule based model has been 
used to identify the clause boundary. For 
clause type identification a Conditional 
random Field (CRF) based statistical 
model has been used. The clause identi-
fication system and clause classification 
system demonstrated 73% and 78% pre-
cision values respectively.
