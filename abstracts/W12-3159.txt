Minimum error rate training is often the pre-
ferred method for optimizing parameters of
statistical machine translation systems. MERT
minimizes error rate by using a surrogate rep-
resentation of the search space, such as N -
best lists or hypergraphs, which only offer
an incomplete view of the search space. In
our work, we instead minimize error rate di-
rectly by integrating the decoder into the min-
imizer. This approach yields two benefits.
First, the function being optimized is the true
error rate. Second, it lets us optimize param-
eters of translations systems other than stan-
dard linear model features, such as distortion
limit. Since integrating the decoder into the
minimizer is often too slow to be practical, we
also exploit statistical significance tests to ac-
celerate the search by quickly discarding un-
promising models. Experiments with a phrase-
based system show that our approach is scal-
able, and that optimizing the parameters that
MERT cannot handle brings improvements to
translation results.
