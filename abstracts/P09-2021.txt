 
The development of Dialog-Based Computer-
Assisted Language Learning (DB-CALL) sys-
tems requires research on the simulation of 
language learners. This paper presents a new 
method for generation of grammar errors, an 
important part of the language learner simula-
tor. Realistic errors are generated via Markov 
Logic, which provides an effective way to 
merge a statistical approach with expert know-
ledge about the grammar error characteristics 
of language learners. Results suggest that the 
distribution of simulated grammar errors gen-
erated by the proposed model is similar to that 
of real learners. Human judges also gave con-
sistently close judgments on the quality of the 
real and simulated grammar errors.
