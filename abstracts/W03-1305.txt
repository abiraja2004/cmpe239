Using SVMs for named entity recogni-
tion, we are often confronted with the
multi-class problem. Larger as the num-
ber of classes is, more severe the multi-
class problem is. Especially, one-vs-rest
method is apt to drop the performance by
generating severe unbalanced class distri-
bution. In this study, to tackle the prob-
lem, we take a two-phase named entity
recognition method based on SVMs and
dictionary; at the first phase, we try to
identify each entity by a SVM classifier
and post-process the identified entities by
a simple dictionary look-up; at the sec-
ond phase, we try to classify the seman-
tic class of the identified entity by SVMs.
By dividing the task into two subtasks, i.e.
the entity identification and the semantic
classification, the unbalanced class distri-
bution problem can be alleviated. Further-
more, we can select the features relevant
to each task and take an alternative classi-
fication method according to the task. The
experimental results on the GENIA cor-
pus show that the proposed method is ef-
fective not only in the reduction of train-
ing cost but also in performance improve-
ment: the identification performance is
about 79.9(F? = 1), the semantic clas-
sification accuracy is about 66.5(F? = 1).
