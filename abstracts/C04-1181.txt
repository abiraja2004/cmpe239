We use the interpretation of vague scalar predi-
cates like small as an illustration of how system-
atic semantic models of dialogue context en-
able the derivation of useful, fine-grained utter-
ance interpretations from radically underspeci-
fied semantic forms. Because dialogue context
suffices to determine salient alternative scales
and relevant distinctions along these scales,
we can infer implicit standards of comparison
for vague scalar predicates through completely
general pragmatics, yet closely constrain the in-
tended meaning to within a natural range.
