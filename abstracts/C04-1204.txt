This paper evaluates the accuracy of HPSG
parsing in terms of the identification of
predicate-argument relations. We could directly
compare the output of HPSG parsing with Prop-
Bank annotations, by assuming a unique map-
ping from HPSG semantic representation into
PropBank annotation. Even though PropBank
was not used for the training of a disambigua-
tion model, an HPSG parser achieved the ac-
curacy competitive with existing studies on the
task of identifying PropBank annotations.
