We show that question-based sentence fu-
sion is a better defined task than generic sen-
tence fusion (Q-based fusions are shorter, dis-
play less variety in length, yield more identi-
cal results and have higher normalized Rouge
scores). Moreover, we show that in a QA set-
ting, participants strongly prefer Q-based fu-
sions over generic ones, and have a preference
for union over intersection fusions.
