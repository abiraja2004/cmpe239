This paper presents pipeline iteration, an ap-
proach that uses output from later stages
of a pipeline to constrain earlier stages of
the same pipeline. We demonstrate sig-
nificant improvements in a state-of-the-art
PCFG parsing pipeline using base-phrase
constraints, derived either from later stages
of the parsing pipeline or from a finite-
state shallow parser. The best performance
is achieved by reranking the union of un-
constrained parses and relatively heavily-
constrained parses.
