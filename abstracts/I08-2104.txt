In this paper, we propose a novel ap-
proach for Cross-Lingual Question Answer-
ing (CLQA). In the proposed method, the
statistical machine translation (SMT) is
deeply incorporated into the question an-
swering process, instead of using it as the
pre-processing of the mono-lingual QA pro-
cess as in the previous work. The proposed
method can be considered as exploiting the
SMT-based passage retrieval for CLQA task.
We applied our method to the English-to-
Japanese CLQA system and evaluated the
performance by using NTCIR CLQA 1 and
2 test collections. The result showed that the
proposed method outperformed the previous
pre-translation approach.
