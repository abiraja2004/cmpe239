 
Models for predicting judgments about 
the quality of Spoken Dialog Systems 
have been used as overall evaluation 
metric or as optimization functions in 
adaptive systems. We describe a new 
approach to such models, using Hidden 
Markov Models (HMMs). The user?s 
opinion is regarded as a continuous 
process evolving over time. We present 
the data collection method and results 
achieved with the HMM model.
