This paper presents a supervised approach
for identifying generic noun phrases in
context. Generic statements express rule-
like knowledge about kinds or events.
Therefore, their identification is important
for the automatic construction of know-
ledge bases. In particular, the distinction
between generic and non-generic state-
ments is crucial for the correct encoding
of generic and instance-level information.
Generic expressions have been studied ex-
tensively in formal semantics. Building
on this work, we explore a corpus-based
learning approach for identifying generic
NPs, using selections of linguistically mo-
tivated features. Our results perform well
above the baseline and existing prior work.
