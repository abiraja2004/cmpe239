This paper addresses syntax-based para-
phrasing methods for Recognizing Textual
Entailment (RTE). In particular, we de-
scribe a dependency-based paraphrasing al-
gorithm, using the DIRT data set, and its
application in the context of a straightfor-
ward RTE system based on aligning depen-
dency trees. We find a small positive effect
of dependency-based paraphrasing on both
the RTE3 development and test sets, but the
added value of this type of paraphrasing de-
serves further analysis.
