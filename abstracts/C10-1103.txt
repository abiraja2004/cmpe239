The problem addressed in this paper is to
predict a user?s numeric rating in a prod-
uct review from the text of the review. Un-
igram and n-gram representations of text
are common choices in opinion mining.
However, unigrams cannot capture impor-
tant expressions like ?could have been bet-
ter?, which are essential for prediction
models of ratings. N-grams of words, on
the other hand, capture such phrases, but
typically occur too sparsely in the train-
ing set and thus fail to yield robust pre-
dictors. This paper overcomes the limita-
tions of these two models, by introducing
a novel kind of bag-of-opinions represen-
tation, where an opinion, within a review,
consists of three components: a root word,
a set of modifier words from the same sen-
tence, and one or more negation words.
Each opinion is assigned a numeric score
which is learned, by ridge regression,
from a large, domain-independent cor-
pus of reviews. For the actual test case
of a domain-dependent review, the re-
view?s rating is predicted by aggregat-
ing the scores of all opinions in the re-
view and combining it with a domain-
dependent unigram model. The paper
presents a constrained ridge regression al-
gorithm for learning opinion scores. Ex-
periments show that the bag-of-opinions
method outperforms prior state-of-the-art
techniques for review rating prediction.
