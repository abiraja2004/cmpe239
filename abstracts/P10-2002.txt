In hierarchical phrase-based SMT sys-
tems, statistical models are integrated to
guide the hierarchical rule selection for
better translation performance. Previous
work mainly focused on the selection of
either the source side of a hierarchical rule
or the target side of a hierarchical rule
rather than considering both of them si-
multaneously. This paper presents a joint
model to predict the selection of hierar-
chical rules. The proposed model is esti-
mated based on four sub-models where the
rich context knowledge from both source
and target sides is leveraged. Our method
can be easily incorporated into the prac-
tical SMT systems with the log-linear
model framework. The experimental re-
sults show that our method can yield sig-
nificant improvements in performance.
