We analyze the linguistic behaviour of par-
ticipants in bilateral electronic negotiations,
and discover that particular language char-
acteristics are in contrast with face-to-face
negotiations. Language patterns in the later
part of electronic negotiation are highly in-
dicative of the successful or unsuccessful
outcome of the process, whereas in face-to-
face negotiations, the first part of the nego-
tiation is more useful for predicting the out-
come. We formulate our problem in terms of
text classification on negotiation segments
of different sizes. The data are represented
by a variety of linguistic features that cap-
ture the gist of the discussion: negotiation-
or strategy-related words. We show that,
as we consider ever smaller final segments
of a negotiation transcript, the negotiation-
related words become more indicative of the
negotiation outcome, and give predictions
with higher Accuracy than larger segments
from the beginning of the process.
