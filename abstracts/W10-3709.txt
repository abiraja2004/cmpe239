 
In order to accomplish the deep semantic 
understanding of a language, it is essen-
tial to analyze the meaning of predicate 
phrases, a content word plus functional 
expressions. In agglutinating languages 
such as Japanese, however, sentential 
predicates are multi-morpheme expres-
sions and all the functional expressions 
including those unnecessary to the mean-
ing of the predicate are merged into one 
phrase. This triggers an increase in sur-
face forms, which is problematic for 
NLP systems. We solve this by introduc-
ing simplified surface forms of predi-
cates that retain only the crucial meaning 
of the functional expressions. We con-
struct paraphrasing rules based on syn-
tactic and semantic theories in linguistics. 
The results of experiments show that our 
system achieves the high accuracy of 
77% while reducing the differences in 
surface forms by 44%, which is quite 
close to the performance of manually 
simplified predicates.
