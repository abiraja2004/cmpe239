We report on a series of human evaluations of the
task of sentence fusion. In this task, a human is
given two sentences and asked to produce a single
coherent sentence that contains only the important
information from the original two. Thus, this is a
highly constrained summarization task. Our inves-
tigations show that even at this restricted level, there
is no measurable agreement between humans re-
garding what information should be considered im-
portant. We further investigate the ability of sepa-
rate evaluators to assess summaries, and find simi-
larly disturbing lack of agreement.
