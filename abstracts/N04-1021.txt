We describe a methodology for rapid exper-
imentation in statistical machine translation
which we use to add a large number of features
to a baseline system exploiting features from a
wide range of levels of syntactic representation.
Feature values were combined in a log-linear
model to select the highest scoring candidate
translation from an n-best list. Feature weights
were optimized directly against the BLEU eval-
uation metric on held-out data. We present re-
sults for a small selection of features at each
level of syntactic representation.
