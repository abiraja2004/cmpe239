This paper describes an incremental parser
based on an adjoining operation. By using
the operation, we can avoid the problem
of infinite local ambiguity in incremental
parsing. This paper further proposes a re-
stricted version of the adjoining operation,
which preserves lexical dependencies of
partial parse trees. Our experimental re-
sults showed that the restriction enhances
the accuracy of the incremental parsing.
