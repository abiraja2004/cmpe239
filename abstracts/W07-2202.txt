This paper describes an effective approach
to adapting an HPSG parser trained on the
Penn Treebank to a biomedical domain. In
this approach, we train probabilities of lex-
ical entry assignments to words in a tar-
get domain and then incorporate them into
the original parser. Experimental results
show that this method can obtain higher
parsing accuracy than previous work on do-
main adaptation for parsing the same data.
Moreover, the results show that the combi-
nation of the proposed method and the exist-
ing method achieves parsing accuracy that is
as high as that of an HPSG parser retrained
from scratch, but with much lower training
cost. We also evaluated our method in the
Brown corpus to show the portability of our
approach in another domain.
