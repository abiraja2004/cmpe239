This paper describes an implemented mono-
lingual Text-to-Text generation system. The
system takes monologue and transforms it to
two-participant dialogue. The system uses
mappings between discourse relations in text
and dialogue acts in dialogue. These map-
pings are extracted from a parallel monologue
and dialogue corpus.
