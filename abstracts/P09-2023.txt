Modeling of individual users is a promis-
ing way of improving the performance of
spoken dialogue systems deployed for the
general public and utilized repeatedly. We
define ?implicitly-supervised? ASR accu-
racy per user on the basis of responses
following the system?s explicit confirma-
tions. We combine the estimated ASR ac-
curacy with the user?s barge-in rate, which
represents how well the user is accus-
tomed to using the system, to predict in-
terpretation errors in barge-in utterances.
Experimental results showed that the es-
timated ASR accuracy improved predic-
tion performance. Since this ASR accu-
racy and the barge-in rate are obtainable
at runtime, they improve prediction perfor-
mance without the need for manual label-
ing.
