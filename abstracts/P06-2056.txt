We propose an unsupervised segmen-
tation method based on an assumption
about language data: that the increas-
ing point of entropy of successive char-
acters is the location of a word bound-
ary. A large-scale experiment was con-
ducted by using 200 MB of unseg-
mented training data and 1 MB of test
data, and precision of 90% was attained
with recall being around 80%. More-
over, we found that the precision was
stable at around 90% independently of
the learning data size.
