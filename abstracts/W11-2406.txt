Ambiguities are ubiquitous in natural lan-
guage and pose a major challenge for the au-
tomatic interpretation of natural language ex-
pressions. In this paper we focus on differ-
ent types of lexical ambiguities that play a role
in the context of ontology-based question an-
swering, and explore strategies for capturing
and resolving them. We show that by employ-
ing underspecification techniques and by us-
ing ontological reasoning in order to filter out
inconsistent interpretations as early as possi-
ble, the overall number of interpretations can
be effectively reduced by 44 %.
