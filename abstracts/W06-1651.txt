We present an approach for the joint ex-
traction of entities and relations in the con-
text of opinion recognition and analysis.
We identify two types of opinion-related
entities ? expressions of opinions and
sources of opinions ? along with the link-
ing relation that exists between them. In-
spired by Roth and Yih (2004), we employ
an integer linear programming approach
to solve the joint opinion recognition task,
and show that global, constraint-based in-
ference can significantly boost the perfor-
mance of both relation extraction and the
extraction of opinion-related entities. Per-
formance further improves when a seman-
tic role labeling system is incorporated.
The resulting system achieves F-measures
of 79 and 69 for entity and relation extrac-
tion, respectively, improving substantially
over prior results in the area.
