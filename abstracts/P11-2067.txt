There are a number of systems that use a
syntax-based reordering step prior to phrase-
based statistical MT. An early work proposing
this idea showed improved translation perfor-
mance, but subsequent work has had mixed re-
sults. Speculations as to cause have suggested
the parser, the data, or other factors. We sys-
tematically investigate possible factors to give
an initial answer to the question: Under what
conditions does this use of syntax help PSMT?
