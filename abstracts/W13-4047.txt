A challenge in dialogue act recognition
is the mapping from noisy user inputs to
dialogue acts. In this paper we describe
an approach for re-ranking dialogue act
hypotheses based on Bayesian classifiers
that incorporate dialogue history and Au-
tomatic Speech Recognition (ASR) N-best
information. We report results based on
the Let?s Go dialogue corpora that show
(1) that including ASR N-best information
results in improved dialogue act recogni-
tion performance (+7% accuracy), and (2)
that competitive results can be obtained
from as early as the first system dialogue
act, reducing the need to wait for subse-
quent system dialogue acts.
