Covering as many phenomena as possible is a
traditional goal of parser development, but the
broader a grammar is made, the blunter it may
become, as rare constructions influence the be-
haviour on simple sentences that were already
solved correctly. We observe the effects of in-
tentionally removing support for specific con-
structions from a broad-coverage grammar of
German. We show that accuracy of analysing
sentences from the NEGRA corpus can be im-
proved not only for sentences that do not need
the extra coverage, but even when including
those that do.
