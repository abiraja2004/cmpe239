This paper presents a bidirectional in-
ference algorithm for sequence label-
ing problems such as part-of-speech tag-
ging, named entity recognition and text
chunking. The algorithm can enumerate
all possible decomposition structures and
find the highest probability sequence to-
gether with the corresponding decomposi-
tion structure in polynomial time. We also
present an efficient decoding algorithm
based on the easiest-first strategy, which
gives comparably good performance to
full bidirectional inference with signifi-
cantly lower computational cost. Exper-
imental results of part-of-speech tagging
and text chunking show that the proposed
bidirectional inference methods consis-
tently outperform unidirectional inference
methods and bidirectional MEMMs give
comparable performance to that achieved
by state-of-the-art learning algorithms in-
cluding kernel support vector machines.
