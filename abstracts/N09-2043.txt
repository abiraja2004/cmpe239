This paper presents a new soft pattern match-
ing method which aims to improve the recall
with minimized precision loss in information
extraction tasks. Our approach is based on a
local tree alignment algorithm, and an effec-
tive strategy for controlling flexibility of the
pattern matching will be presented. The ex-
perimental results show that the method can
significantly improve the information extrac-
tion performance.
