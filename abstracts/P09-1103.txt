 
The tree sequence based translation model al-
lows the violation of syntactic boundaries in a 
rule to capture non-syntactic phrases, where a 
tree sequence is a contiguous sequence of sub-
trees. This paper goes further to present a trans-
lation model based on non-contiguous tree se-
quence alignment, where a non-contiguous tree 
sequence is a sequence of sub-trees and gaps. 
Compared with the contiguous tree sequence-
based model, the proposed model can well han-
dle non-contiguous phrases with any large gaps 
by means of non-contiguous tree sequence 
alignment. An algorithm targeting the non-
contiguous constituent decoding is also proposed. 
Experimental results on the NIST MT-05 Chi-
nese-English translation task show that the pro-
posed model statistically significantly outper-
forms the baseline systems.
