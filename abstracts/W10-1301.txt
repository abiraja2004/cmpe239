 
We are building a tool that helps children with 
Complex Communication Needs1 (CCN) to 
create stories about their day at school. The 
tool uses Natural Language Generation (NLG) 
technology to create a draft story based on 
sensor data of the child?s activities, which the 
child can edit. This work is still in its early 
stages, but we believe it has great potential to 
support interactive personal narrative which is 
not well supported by current Augmentative 
and Alternative Communication (AAC) tools.
