trate, using a few annotated examples, the 
static and dynamic knowledge resources of on-
tological semantics. We then present the main 
motivations and desiderata of our approach 
and then discuss issues related to making onto-
logical-semantic applications feasible through 
the judicious stepwise enhancement of static 
and dynamic knowledge sources while at all 
times maintaining a working system.
