We present an approach for generation of mor-
phologically rich languages using statistical
machine translation. Given a sequence of lem-
mas and any subset of morphological features,
we produce the inflected word forms. Testing
on Arabic, a morphologically rich language,
our models can reach 92.1% accuracy starting
only with lemmas, and 98.9% accuracy if all
the gold features are provided.
