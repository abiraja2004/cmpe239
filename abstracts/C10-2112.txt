We demonstrate the use of context fea-
tures, namely, names of places, and un-
labelled data for the detection of per-
sonal name language of origin.
While some early work used either
rule-based methods or n-gram statisti-
cal models to determine the name lan-
guage of origin, we use the discrimi-
native classification maximum entropy
model and view the task as a classifica-
tion task. We perform bootstrapping of
the learning using list of names out of
context but with known origin and then
using expectation-maximisation algo-
rithm to further train the model on
a large corpus of names of unknown
origin but with context features. Us-
ing a relatively small unlabelled cor-
pus we improve the accuracy of name
origin recognition for names written
in Chinese from 82.7% to 85.8%, a
significant reduction in the error rate.
The improvement in F -score for infre-
quent Japanese names is even greater:
from 77.4% without context features to
82.8% with context features.
