This paper compares several translation rep-
resentations for a synchronous context-free
grammar parse including CFGs/hypergraphs,
finite-state automata (FSA), and pushdown
automata (PDA). The representation choice is
shown to determine the form and complex-
ity of target LM intersection and shortest-path
algorithms that follow. Intersection, shortest
path, FSA expansion and RTN replacement al-
gorithms are presented for PDAs. Chinese-to-
English translation experiments using HiFST
and HiPDT, FSA and PDA-based decoders,
are presented using admissible (or exact)
search, possible for HiFST with compact
SCFG rulesets and HiPDT with compact LMs.
For large rulesets with large LMs, we intro-
duce a two-pass search strategy which we then
analyze in terms of search errors and transla-
tion performance.
