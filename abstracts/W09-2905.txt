 
We review lexical Association Measures 
(AMs) that have been employed by past 
work in extracting multiword expressions. 
Our work contributes to the understanding 
of these AMs by categorizing them into 
two groups and suggesting the use of rank 
equivalence to group AMs with the same 
ranking performance. We also examine 
how existing AMs can be adapted to better 
rank English verb particle constructions 
and light verb constructions. Specifically, 
we suggest normalizing (Pointwise) 
Mutual Information and using marginal 
frequencies to construct penalization 
terms.  We empirically validate the 
effectiveness of these modified AMs in 
detection tasks in English, performed on 
the Penn Treebank, which shows 
significant improvement over the original 
AMs.
