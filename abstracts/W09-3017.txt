The present paper outlines an ongoing project 
of annotation of the extended nominal corefer-
ence and the bridging anaphora in the Prague 
Dependency Treebank. We describe the anno-
tation  scheme  with  respect  to  the  linguistic 
classification of coreferential and bridging re-
lations and focus also on details of the annota-
tion process from the technical point of view. 
We present methods of helping the annotators 
?  by  a  pre-annotation  and  by  several  useful 
features  implemented  in  the  annotation  tool. 
Our method of the inter-annotator agreement 
is focused on the improvement of the annota-
tion  guidelines;  we  present  results  of  three 
subsequent measurements of the agreement.
