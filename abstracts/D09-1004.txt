We present an integrated dependency-
based semantic role labeling system for
English from both NomBank and Prop-
Bank. By introducing assistant argument
labels and considering much more fea-
ture templates, two optimal feature tem-
plate sets are obtained through an effec-
tive feature selection procedure and help
construct a high performance single SRL
system. From the evaluations on the date
set of CoNLL-2008 shared task, the per-
formance of our system is quite close to
the state of the art. As to our knowl-
edge, this is the first integrated SRL sys-
tem that achieves a competitive perfor-
mance against previous pipeline systems.
