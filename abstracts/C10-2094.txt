This paper investigates the new problem
of automatic sense induction for instance
names using automatically extracted at-
tribute sets. Several clustering strategies
and data sources are described and eval-
uated. We also discuss the drawbacks of
the evaluation metrics commonly used in
similar clustering tasks. The results show
improvements in most metrics with re-
spect to the baselines, especially for pol-
ysemous instances.
