 
In this paper we present a two-stage 
statistical word segmentation system for 
Chinese based on word bigram and word-
formation models. This system was 
evaluated on Peking University corpora at 
the First International Chinese Word 
Segmentation Bakeoff. We also give 
results and discussions on this evaluation.
