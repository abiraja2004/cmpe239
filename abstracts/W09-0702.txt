Research in data-driven methods for Ma-
chine Translation has greatly benefited
from the increasing availability of paral-
lel corpora. Processing the same text in
two different languages yields useful in-
formation on how words and phrases are
translated from a source language into a
target language. To investigate this, a par-
allel corpus is typically aligned by linking
linguistic tokens in the source language to
the corresponding units in the target lan-
guage. An aligned parallel corpus there-
fore facilitates the automatic development
of a machine translation system and can
also bootstrap annotation through projec-
tion. In this paper, we describe data col-
lection and annotation efforts and prelim-
inary experimental results with a parallel
corpus English - Swahili.
