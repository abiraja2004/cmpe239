In this paper we explore the variation of
sentences as a function of the sentence
number. We demonstrate that while the
entropy of the sentence increases with the
sentence number, it decreases at the para-
graph boundaries in accordance with the
Entropy Rate Constancy principle (intro-
duced in related work). We also demon-
strate that the principle holds for differ-
ent genres and languages and explore the
role of genre informativeness. We investi-
gate potential causes of entropy variation
by looking at the tree depth, the branch-
ing factor, the size of constituents, and the
occurrence of gapping.
