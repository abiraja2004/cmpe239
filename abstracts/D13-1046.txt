Bilingual lexicons are central components of
machine translation and cross-lingual infor-
mation retrieval systems. Their manual con-
struction requires strong expertise in both lan-
guages involved and is a costly process. Sev-
eral automatic methods were proposed as an
alternative but they often rely on resources
available in a limited number of languages
and their performances are still far behind
the quality of manual translations. We intro-
duce a novel approach to the creation of spe-
cific domain bilingual lexicon that relies on
Wikipedia. This massively multilingual en-
cyclopedia makes it possible to create lexi-
cons for a large number of language pairs.
Wikipedia is used to extract domains in each
language, to link domains between languages
and to create generic translation dictionaries.
The approach is tested on four specialized do-
mains and is compared to three state of the art
approaches using two language pairs: French-
English and Romanian-English. The newly in-
troduced method compares favorably to exist-
ing methods in all configurations tested.
