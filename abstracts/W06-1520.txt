Coordination of phrases of different syn-
tactic categories has posed a problem for
generative systems based only on syntactic
categories. Although some prefer to treat
them as exceptional cases that should re-
quire some extra mechanism (as for ellip-
tical constructions), or to allow for unre-
stricted cross-category coordination, they
can be naturally derived in a grammatic
functional generative approach. In this
paper we explore the ideia on how mix-
ing syntactic categories and grammatical
functions in the label set of a Tree Adjoin-
ing Grammar allows us to develop gram-
mars that elegantly handle both the cases
of same- and cross-category coordination
in an uniform way.
