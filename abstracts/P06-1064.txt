We present an algorithm which creates a
German CCGbank by translating the syn-
tax graphs in the German Tiger corpus into
CCG derivation trees. The resulting cor-
pus contains 46,628 derivations, covering
95% of all complete sentences in Tiger.
Lexicons extracted from this corpus con-
tain correct lexical entries for 94% of all
known tokens in unseen text.
