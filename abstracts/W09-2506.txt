We present a vector space model that sup-
ports the computation of appropriate vec-
tor representations for words in context,
and apply it to a paraphrase ranking task.
An evaluation on the SemEval 2007 lexical
substitution task data shows promising re-
sults: the model significantly outperforms
a current state of the art model, and our
treatment of context is effective.
