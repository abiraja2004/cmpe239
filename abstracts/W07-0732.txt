 
This article describes the combination of a 
SYSTRAN system with a ?statistical post-
editing? (SPE) system. We document 
qualitative analysis on two experiments 
performed in the shared task of the ACL 
2007 Workshop on Statistical Machine 
Translation. Comparative results and more 
integrated ?hybrid? techniques are dis-
cussed.
