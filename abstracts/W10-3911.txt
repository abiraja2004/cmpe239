 
The rapid spread of electronic health 
records raised an interest to large-scale 
information extraction from clinical 
texts. Considering such a background, 
we are developing a method that can 
extract adverse drug event and effect 
(adverse?effect) relations from massive 
clinical records. Adverse?effect rela-
tions share some features with relations 
proposed in previous relation extrac-
tion studies, but they also have unique 
characteristics. Adverse?effect rela-
tions are usually uncertain. Not even 
medical experts can usually determine 
whether a symptom that arises after a 
medication represents an adverse?
effect relation or not. We propose a 
method to extract adverse?effect rela-
tions using a machine-learning tech-
nique with dependency features. We 
performed experiments to extract ad-
verse?effect relations from 2,577 clini-
cal texts, and obtained F1-score of 
37.54 with an optimal parameters and 
F1-score of 34.90 with automatically 
tuned parameters. The results also 
show that dependency features increase 
the extraction F1-score by 3.59.
