Sentiment analysis systems can benefit
from the translation of sentiment informa-
tion. We present a novel, graph-based ap-
proach using SimRank, a well-established
graph-theoretic algorithm, to transfer sen-
timent information from a source lan-
guage to a target language. We evaluate
this method in comparison with semantic
orientation using pointwise mutual infor-
mation (SO-PMI), an established unsuper-
vised method for learning the sentiment of
phrases.
