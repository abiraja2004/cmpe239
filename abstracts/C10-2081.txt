Sentence-level aligned parallel texts are
important resources for a number of nat-
ural language processing (NLP) tasks and
applications such as statistical machine
translation and cross-language informa-
tion retrieval. With the rapid growth
of online parallel texts, efficient and ro-
bust sentence alignment algorithms be-
come increasingly important. In this
paper, we propose a fast and robust
sentence alignment algorithm, i.e., Fast-
Champollion, which employs a combi-
nation of both length-based and lexicon-
based algorithm. By optimizing the pro-
cess of splitting the input bilingual texts
into small fragments for alignment, Fast-
Champollion, as our extensive experi-
ments show, is 4.0 to 5.1 times as fast
as the current baseline methods such as
Champollion (Ma, 2006) on short texts
and achieves about 39.4 times as fast on
long texts, and Fast-Champollion is as ro-
bust as Champollion.
