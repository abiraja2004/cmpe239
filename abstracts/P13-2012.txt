We introduce PARMA, a system for cross-
document, semantic predicate and argu-
ment alignment. Our system combines a
number of linguistic resources familiar to
researchers in areas such as recognizing
textual entailment and question answering,
integrating them into a simple discrimina-
tive model. PARMA achieves state of the
art results on an existing and a new dataset.
We suggest that previous efforts have fo-
cussed on data that is biased and too easy,
and we provide a more difficult dataset
based on translation data with a low base-
line which we beat by 17% F1.
