In this paper, it is presented an unsuper-
vised approach to automatically discover
the latent keyphrases contained in scien-
tific articles. The proposed technique is
constructed on the basis of the combi-
nation of two techniques: maximal fre-
quent sequences and pageranking. We
evaluated the obtained results by using
micro-averaged precision, recall and F-
scores with respect to two different gold
standards: 1) reader?s keyphrases, and 2)
a combined set of author?s and reader?s
keyphrases. The obtained results were
also compared against three different base-
lines: one unsupervised (TF-IDF based)
and two supervised (Na??ve Bayes and
Maximum Entropy).
