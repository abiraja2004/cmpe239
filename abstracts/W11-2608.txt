This paper describes a method for selecting an
appropriate phone set in dialect speech synthe-
sis for a so far undescribed dialect by applying
hidden Markov model (HMM) based training
and clustering methods. In this pilot study we
show how a phone set derived from the pho-
netic surface can be optimized given a small
amount of dialect speech training data.
