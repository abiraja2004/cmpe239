When engaged in dialogues, people per-
form communicative actions to pursue specific
communicative goals. Speech acts recogni-
tion attracted computational linguistics since
long time and could impact considerably a
huge variety of application domains. We study
the task of automatic labeling dialogues with
the proper dialogue acts, relying on empiri-
cal methods and simply exploiting lexical se-
mantics of the utterances. In particular, we
present some experiments in supervised and
unsupervised framework on both an English
and an Italian corpus of dialogue transcrip-
tions. The evaluation displays encouraging re-
sults in both languages, especially in the unsu-
pervised version of the methodology.
