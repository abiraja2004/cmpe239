This paper presents a method for catego-
rizing named entities in Wikipedia. In
Wikipedia, an anchor text is glossed in a
linked HTML text. We formalize named en-
tity categorization as a task of categorizing
anchor texts with linked HTML texts which
glosses a named entity. Using this repre-
sentation, we introduce a graph structure in
which anchor texts are regarded as nodes.
In order to incorporate HTML structure on
the graph, three types of cliques are defined
based on the HTML tree structure. We pro-
pose a method with Conditional Random
Fields (CRFs) to categorize the nodes on
the graph. Since the defined graph may in-
clude cycles, the exact inference of CRFs is
computationally expensive. We introduce an
approximate inference method using Tree-
based Reparameterization (TRP) to reduce
computational cost. In experiments, our pro-
posed model obtained significant improve-
ments compare to baseline models that use
Support Vector Machines.
