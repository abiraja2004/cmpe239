 
This paper presents a word support 
model (WSM). The WSM can effec-
tively perform homophone selection 
and syllable-word segmentation to im-
prove Chinese input systems. The ex-
perimental results show that: (1) the 
WSM is able to achieve tonal (sylla-
bles input with four tones) and tone-
less (syllables input without four tones) 
syllable-to-word (STW) accuracies of 
99% and 92%, respectively, among the 
converted words; and (2) while apply-
ing the WSM as an adaptation proc-
essing, together with the Microsoft 
Input Method Editor 2003 (MSIME) 
and an optimized bigram model, the 
average tonal and toneless STW im-
provements are 37% and 35%, respec-
tively.
