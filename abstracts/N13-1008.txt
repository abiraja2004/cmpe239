Traditional relation extraction predicts rela-
tions within some fixed and finite target
schema. Machine learning approaches to this
task require either manual annotation or, in
the case of distant supervision, existing struc-
tured sources of the same schema. The need
for existing datasets can be avoided by us-
ing a universal schema: the union of all in-
volved schemas (surface form predicates as in
OpenIE, and relations in the schemas of pre-
existing databases). This schema has an al-
most unlimited set of relations (due to surface
forms), and supports integration with existing
structured data (through the relation types of
existing databases). To populate a database of
such schema we present matrix factorization
models that learn latent feature vectors for en-
tity tuples and relations. We show that such
latent models achieve substantially higher ac-
curacy than a traditional classification ap-
proach. More importantly, by operating simul-
taneously on relations observed in text and in
pre-existing structured DBs such as Freebase,
we are able to reason about unstructured and
structured data in mutually-supporting ways.
By doing so our approach outperforms state-
of-the-art distant supervision.
