 
The importance of machine translation (MT) 
in the stream of text-handling processes has 
become readily apparent in many current 
production settings as well as in research 
programs such as the Translingual 
Information Detection, Extraction, and 
Summarization (TIDES) program. The MT 
Proficiency Scale project has developed a 
means of baselining the inherent "tolerance" 
that a text-handling task has for raw MT 
output, and thus how good the output must be 
in order to be of use to that task. This method 
allows for a prediction of how useful a 
particular system can be in a text-handling 
process stream, whether in integrated, MT- 
embedded processes, or less integrated user- 
intensive processes.
