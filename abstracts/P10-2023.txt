We propose a novel method to automati-
cally acquire a term-frequency-based tax-
onomy from a corpus using an unsuper-
vised method. A term-frequency-based
taxonomy is useful for application do-
mains where the frequency with which
terms occur on their own and in combi-
nation with other terms imposes a natural
term hierarchy. We highlight an applica-
tion for our approach and demonstrate its
effectiveness and robustness in extracting
knowledge from real-world data.
