 
This paper aims to introduce a new pars-
ing strategy for large dictionary (thesauri) 
parsing, called Dictionary Sense Segmen-
tation & Dependency (DSSD), devoted to 
obtain the sense tree, i.e. the hierarchy of 
the defined meanings, for a dictionary en-
try. The real novelty of the proposed ap-
proach is that, contrary to dictionary 
?standard? parsing, DSSD looks for and 
succeeds to separate the two essential 
processes within a dictionary entry pars-
ing: sense tree construction and sense 
definition parsing. The key tools to ac-
complish the task of (autonomous) sense 
tree building consist in defining the dic-
tionary sense marker classes, establishing 
a tree-like hierarchy of these classes, and 
using a proper searching procedure of 
sense markers within the DSSD parsing 
algorithm. A similar but more general 
approach, using the same techniques and 
data structures for (Romanian) free text 
parsing is SCD (Segmentation-Cohesion-
Dependency) (Curteanu; 1988, 2006), 
which DSSD is inspired from. A DSSD-
based parser is implemented in Java, 
building currently 91% correct sense 
trees from DTLR (Dic?ionarul Tezaur al
