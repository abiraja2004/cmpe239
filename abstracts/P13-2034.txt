We present an efficient approach for
broadcast news story segmentation using a
manifold learning algorithm on latent top-
ic distributions. The latent topic distribu-
tion estimated by Latent Dirichlet Alloca-
tion (LDA) is used to represent each text
block. We employ Laplacian Eigenmap-
s (LE) to project the latent topic distribu-
tions into low-dimensional semantic rep-
resentations while preserving the intrinsic
local geometric structure. We evaluate t-
wo approaches employing LDA and prob-
abilistic latent semantic analysis (PLSA)
distributions respectively. The effects of
different amounts of training data and dif-
ferent numbers of latent topics on the two
approaches are studied. Experimental re-
sults show that our proposed LDA-based
approach can outperform the correspond-
ing PLSA-based approach. The proposed
approach provides the best performance
with the highest F1-measure of 0.7860.
