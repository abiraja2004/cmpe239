 
Comparing one thing with another is a typical 
part of human decision making process. How-
ever, it is not always easy to know what to 
compare and what are the alternatives. To ad-
dress this difficulty, we present a novel way to 
automatically mine comparable entities from 
comparative questions that users posted on-
line. To ensure high precision and high recall, 
we develop a weakly-supervised bootstrapping 
method for comparative question identification 
and comparable entity extraction by leveraging 
a large online question archive. The experi-
mental results show our method achieves F1-
measure of 82.5% in comparative question 
identification and 83.3% in comparable entity 
extraction. Both significantly outperform an 
existing state-of-the-art method.
