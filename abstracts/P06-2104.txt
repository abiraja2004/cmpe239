 The integration of sophisticated infer-ence-based techniques into natural lan-guage processing applications first re-quires a reliable method of encoding the predicate-argument structure of the pro-positional content of text. Recent statisti-cal approaches to automated predicate-argument annotation have utilized parse tree paths as predictive features, which encode the path between a verb predicate and a node in the parse tree that governs its argument. In this paper, we explore a number of alternatives for how these parse tree paths are encoded, focusing on the difference between automatically generated constituency parses and de-pendency parses. After describing five al-ternatives for encoding parse tree paths, we investigate how well each can be aligned with the argument substrings in annotated text corpora, their relative pre-cision and recall performance, and their comparative learning curves. Results in-dicate that constituency parsers produce parse tree paths that can more easily be aligned to argument substrings, perform better in precision and recall, and have more favorable learning curves than those produced by a dependency parser. 1
