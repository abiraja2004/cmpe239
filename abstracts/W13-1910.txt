The Biological expres-sion language (BEL) encodes the data in form of causal relationships, which describe the as-sociation between biological events. BEL can successfully be applied to large data and sup-port causal reasoning and hypothesis genera-tion. With the rapid growth of biomedical litera-ture, automated methods are a crucial prereq-uisite for handling and encoding the available knowledge. The BioNLP shared tasks support the development of such tools and provide a linguistically motivated format for the anno-tation of relations. On the other hand, BEL statements and the corresponding evidence sentences might be a valuable resource for fu-ture BioNLP shared task training data genera-tion. In this paper, we briefly introduce BEL and investigate how far BioNLP-shared task an-notations could be converted to BEL state-ments and in such a way directly support  BEL statement generation. We present the first results of the automatic BEL statement generation and emphasize the need for more training data that captures the underlying bio-logical meaning.   1
