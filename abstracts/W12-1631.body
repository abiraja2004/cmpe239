We propose a dialog system that creates re-
sponses based on a large-scale dialog corpus
retrieved from Twitter and real-time crowd-
sourcing. Instead of using complex dialog
management, our system replies with the ut-
terance from the database that is most simi-
lar to the user input. We also propose a real-
time crowdsourcing framework for handling
the case in which there is no adequate re-
sponse in the database.
