 
This paper details a software architecture for 
discourse processing in spoken dialogue 
systems, where the three component tasks of 
discourse processing are (1) Dialogue Man- 
agement, (2) Context Tracking, and (3) 
Pragmatic Adaptation. We define these three 
component tasks and describe their roles in a 
complex, near-future scenario in which 
multiple humans interact with each other 
and with computers in multiple, simulta- 
neous dialogue exchanges. This paper 
reports on the software modules that accom- 
plish the three component tasks of discourse 
processing, and an architecture for the inter- 
action among these modules and with other 
modules of the spoken dialogue system. A 
motivation of this work is reusable discourse 
processing software for integration with 
non-discourse modules in spoken dialogue 
systems. We document the use of this ar- 
chitecture and its components in several 
prototypes, and also discuss its potential ap- 
plication to spoken dialogue systems defined 
in the near-future scenario.
