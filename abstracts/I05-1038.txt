. Conventional QA systems cannot answer to the questions
composed of two or more sentences. Therefore, we aim to construct a
QA system that can answer such multiple-sentence questions. As the first
stage, we propose a method for classifying multiple-sentence questions
into question types. Specifically, we first extract the core sentence from
a given question text. We use the core sentence and its question focus in
question classification. The result of experiments shows that the proposed
method improves F-measure by 8.8% and accuracy by 4.4%.
