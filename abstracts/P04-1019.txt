We use machine learning techniques to find the
best combination of local focus and lexical distance
features for identifying the anchor of mereological
bridging references. We find that using first men-
tion, utterance distance, and lexical distance com-
puted using either Google or WordNet results in an
accuracy significantly higher than obtained in pre-
vious experiments.
