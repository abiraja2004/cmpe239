 
Within two European projects metadata 
interoperability is one of the central top-
ics. While the INTERA project has as 
one of its goals to achieve an interopera-
bility between two widely used metadata 
sets for the domain of language re-
sources, the ECHO project created an in-
tegrated metadata domain of in total nine 
data providers from five different disci-
plines from the humanities. In both pro-
jects ad hoc techniques are used to 
achieve results. In the INTERA project, 
however, machine readable and ISO 
compliant concept definitions are created 
as a first step towards the Semantic Web. 
In the ECHO project a complex ontology 
was realized purely relying on XML. It is 
argued that concept definitions should be 
registered in open Data Category Reposi-
tories and that relations between them 
should be described as RDF assertions. 
Yet we are missing standards that would 
allow us to overcome the ad hoc solu-
tions.
