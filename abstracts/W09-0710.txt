 
Setswana, a Bantu language in the Sotho 
group, is one of the eleven official languages 
of South Africa.  The language is character-
ised by a disjunctive orthography, mainly af-
fecting the important word category of verbs. 
In particular, verbal prefixal morphemes are 
usually written disjunctively, while suffixal 
morphemes follow a conjunctive writing 
style. Therefore, Setswana tokenisation can-
not be based solely on whitespace, as is the 
case in many alphabetic, segmented lan-
guages, including the conjunctively written 
Nguni group of South African Bantu lan-
guages. This paper shows how a combination 
of two tokeniser transducers and a finite-state 
(rule-based) morphological analyser may be 
combined to effectively solve the Setswana 
tokenisation problem. The approach has the 
important advantage of bringing the process-
ing of Setswana beyond the morphological 
analysis level in line with what is appropriate 
for the Nguni languages. This means that the 
challenge of the disjunctive orthography is 
met at the tokenisation/morphological analy-
sis level and does not in principle propagate 
to subsequent levels of analysis such as POS 
tagging and shallow parsing, etc. Indeed, the 
approach ensures that an aspect such as or-
thography does not obfuscate sound linguis-
tics and, ultimately, proper semantic analysis, 
which remains the ultimate aim of linguistic 
analysis and therefore also computational lin-
guistic analysis.
