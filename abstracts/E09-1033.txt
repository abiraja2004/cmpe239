Many different types of features have
been shown to improve accuracy in parse
reranking. A class of features that thus far
has not been considered is based on a pro-
jection of the syntactic structure of a trans-
lation of the text to be parsed. The intu-
ition for using this type of bitext projec-
tion feature is that ambiguous structures
in one language often correspond to un-
ambiguous structures in another. We show
that reranking based on bitext projection
features increases parsing accuracy signif-
icantly.
