Summarising georeferenced (can be iden-
tified according to it?s location) data in
natural language is challenging because it
requires linking events describing its non-
geographic attributes to their underlying
geography. This mapping is not straightfor-
ward as often the only explicit geographic
information such data contains is latitude
and longitude. In this paper we present an
approach to generating textual summaries
of georeferenced data based on spatial ref-
erence frames. This approach has been im-
plemented in a data-to-text system we have
deployed in the weather forecasting domain.
