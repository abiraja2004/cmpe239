 
Both full-text information retrieval and large scale 
parsing require text preprocessing to identify 
strong lexical associations in textual databases. In
order to associate linguistic felicity with 
computational efficiency, we have conceived 
FASTR a unification-based parser supporting 
large textual and grammatical databases. The 
grammar is composed of term rules obtained by 
tagging and lemmatizing term lists with an on- 
line dictionary. Through FASTR,  large 
terminological data can be recycled for text 
processing purposes. Great stress is placed on the 
handling of term variations through metarules 
which relate basic terms to their semantically 
close morphosyntactic variants. 
The quality of terminological extraction and 
the computational efficiency of FASTR are 
evaluated through a joint experiment with an 
industrial documentation center. The processing 
of two large technical corpora shows that the 
application is scalable to such industrial data and 
that accounting for term variants results in an 
increase of recall by 20%. 
Although automatic indexing is the most 
straightforward application of FASTR, it can be 
extended fruitfully to terminological cquisition 
and compound interpretation.
