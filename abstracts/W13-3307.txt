We present a novel approach to the trans-
lation of the English personal pronoun it
to Czech. We conduct a linguistic analysis
on how the distinct categories of it are usu-
ally mapped to their Czech counterparts.
Armed with these observations, we design
a discriminative translation model of it,
which is then integrated into the TectoMT
deep syntax MT framework. Features in
the model take advantage of rich syntac-
tic annotation TectoMT is based on, exter-
nal tools for anaphoricity resolution, lex-
ical co-occurrence frequencies measured
on a large parallel corpus and gold coref-
erence annotation. Even though the new
model for it exhibits no improvement in
terms of BLEU, manual evaluation shows
that it outperforms the original solution in
8.5% sentences containing it.
