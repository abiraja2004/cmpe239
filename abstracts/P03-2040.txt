 
This paper describes a Web-based Eng-
lish-Chinese concordance system, Total-
Recall, developed to promote translation 
reuse and encourage authentic and idio-
matic use in second language writing. We 
exploited and structured existing high-
quality translations from the bilingual Si-
norama Magazine to build the concor-
dance of authentic text and translation. 
Novel approaches were taken to provide 
high-precision bilingual alignment on the 
sentence, phrase and word levels. A 
browser-based user interface (UI) is also 
developed for ease of access over the 
Internet. Users can search for word, 
phrase or expression in English or Chi-
nese. The Web-based user interface facili-
tates the recording of the user actions to 
provide data for further research.
