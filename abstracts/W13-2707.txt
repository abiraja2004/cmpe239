In this paper we describe an application
of language technology to policy formula-
tion, where it can support policy makers
assess the acceptance of a yet-unpublished
policy before the policy enters public con-
sultation. One of the key concepts is that
instead of relying on thematic similarity,
we extract arguments expressed in support
or opposition of positions that are general
statements that are, themselves, consistent
with the policy or not. The focus of this
paper in this overall pipeline, is identify-
ing arguments in text: we present and em-
pirically evaluate the hypothesis that ver-
bal tense and mood are good indicators of
arguments that have not been explored in
the relevant literature.
