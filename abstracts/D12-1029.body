In this paper, we show that significant im-
provements in the accuracy of well-known
transition-based parsers can be obtained, with-
out sacrificing efficiency, by enriching the
parsers with simple transitions that act on
buffer nodes.
First, we show how adding a specific tran-
sition to create either a left or right arc of
length one between the first two buffer nodes
produces improvements in the accuracy of
Nivre?s arc-eager projective parser on a num-
ber of datasets from the CoNLL-X shared
task. Then, we show that accuracy can also be
improved by adding transitions involving the
topmost stack node and the second buffer node
(allowing a limited form of non-projectivity).
None of these transitions has a negative im-
pact on the computational complexity of the
algorithm. Although the experiments in this
paper use the arc-eager parser, the approach is
generic enough to be applicable to any stack-
based dependency parser.
