Discontinuities occur especially frequently in
languages with a relatively free word order,
such as German. Generally, due to the long-
distance dependencies they induce, they lie
beyond the expressivity of Probabilistic CFG,
i.e., they cannot be directly reconstructed by
a PCFG parser. In this paper, we use a
parser for Probabilistic Linear Context-Free
Rewriting Systems (PLCFRS), a formalism
with high expressivity, to directly parse the
German NeGra and TIGER treebanks. In both
treebanks, discontinuities are annotated with
crossing branches. Based on an evaluation us-
ing different metrics, we show that an output
quality can be achieved which is comparable
to the output quality of PCFG-based systems.
