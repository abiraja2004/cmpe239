 
Prepositional phrase attachment is a ma- 
jor cause of stru(:tural alnbiguity in nat- 
ural language. Recent work has been 
dependent on corpus-based approaches 
to deal with this problem. However, 
corpus-based approaches suffer from the 
sparse-data problem. To cope with this 
problem, we introduce a hybrid method 
of integrating corpus-based approach 
with knowledge-based techniques, using 
a wide-variety of information that comes 
from annotated corpora and a machine- 
readable dictionary. When the occur- 
rence frequency on the corpora is low, we 
use preference rules to determine PP at- 
tachment based on clues from conceptual 
information. An experiment has proven 
that our hybrid method is both effective 
and applicable in practice.
