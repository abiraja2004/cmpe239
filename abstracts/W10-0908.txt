 
In this paper, we present empirical results on 
the challenge of learning to read. That is, giv-
en a handful of examples of the concepts and 
relations in an ontology and a large corpus, 
the system should learn to map from text to 
the concepts/relations of the ontology. In this 
paper, we report contrastive experiments on 
the recall, precision, and F-measure (F) of the 
mapping in the following conditions: (1) em-
ploying word-based patterns, employing se-
mantic structure, and combining the two; and 
(2) fully automatic learning versus allowing 
minimal questions of a human informant.
