Parallel Multiple Context-Free Grammar
(PMCFG) is an extension of context-free
grammar for which the recognition problem is
still solvable in polynomial time. We describe
a new parsing algorithm that has the advantage
to be incremental and to support PMCFG
directly rather than the weaker MCFG formal-
ism. The algorithm is also top-down which
allows it to be used for grammar based word
prediction.
