Base Phrase Chunking (BPC) or shallow
syntactic parsing is proving to be a task of
interest to many natural language processing
applications. In this paper, A BPC system
is introduced that improves over state of the
art performance in BPC using a new part of
speech tag (POS) set. The new POS tag set,
ERTS, reflects some of the morphological
features specific to Modern Standard Ara-
bic. ERTS explicitly encodes definiteness,
number and gender information increasing
the number of tags from 25 in the standard
LDC reduced tag set to 75 tags. For the BPC
task, we introduce a more language specific
set of definitions for the base phrase anno-
tations. We employ a support vector ma-
chine approach for both the POS tagging and
the BPC processes. The POS tagging per-
formance using this enriched tag set, ERTS,
is at 96.13% accuracy. In the BPC exper-
iments, we vary the feature set alng two
factors: the POS tag set and a set of explic-
itly encoded morphological features. Us-
ing the ERTS POS tagset, BPC achieves the
highest overall F?=1 of 96.33% on 10 dif-
ferent chunk types outperforming the use of
the standard POS tag set even when explicit
morphological features are present.
