We present a scalable joint language
model designed to utilize fine-grain syn-
tactic tags. We discuss challenges such
a design faces and describe our solutions
that scale well to large tagsets and cor-
pora. We advocate the use of relatively
simple tags that do not require deep lin-
guistic knowledge of the language but pro-
vide more structural information than POS
tags and can be derived from automati-
cally generated parse trees ? a combina-
tion of properties that allows easy adop-
tion of this model for new languages. We
propose two fine-grain tagsets and evalu-
ate our model using these tags, as well as
POS tags and SuperARV tags in a speech
recognition task and discuss future direc-
tions.
