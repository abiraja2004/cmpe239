We present an approach for automatically
learning paraphrases from aligned mono-
lingual corpora. Our algorithm works
by generalizing the syntactic paths be-
tween corresponding anchors in aligned
sentence pairs. Compared to previous
work, structural paraphrases generated by
our algorithm tend to be much longer
on average, and are capable of captur-
ing long-distance dependencies. In ad-
dition to a standalone evaluation of our
paraphrases, we also describe a question
answering application currently under de-
velopment that could immensely bene-
fit from automatically-learned structural
paraphrases.
