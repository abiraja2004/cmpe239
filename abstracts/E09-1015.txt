This paper describes a method using mor-
phological rules and heuristics, for the au-
tomatic extraction of large-coverage lexi-
cons of stems and root word-forms from
a raw text corpus. We cast the problem
of high-coverage lexicon extraction as one
of stemming followed by root word-form
selection. We examine the use of POS
tagging to improve precision and recall of
stemming and thereby the coverage of the
lexicon. We present accuracy, precision
and recall scores for the system on a Hindi
corpus.
