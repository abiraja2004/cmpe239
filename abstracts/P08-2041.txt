This paper presents a partial matching strat-
egy for phrase-based statistical machine trans-
lation (PBSMT). Source phrases which do not
appear in the training corpus can be trans-
lated by word substitution according to par-
tially matched phrases. The advantage of this
method is that it can alleviate the data sparse-
ness problem if the amount of bilingual corpus
is limited. We incorporate our approach into
the state-of-the-art PBSMT system Moses and
achieve statistically significant improvements
on both small and large corpora.
