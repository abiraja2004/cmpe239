 
Unification is often the appropriate method for 
expressing relations between representations i  
the form of feature structures; however, there 
are circumstances in which a different 
approach is desirable. A declarative formalism 
is presented which permits direct mappings of 
one feature structure into another, and illustra- 
tive examples are given of its application to 
areas of current interest.
