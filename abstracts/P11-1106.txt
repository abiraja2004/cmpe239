A system making optimal use of available in-
formation in incremental language compre-
hension might be expected to use linguistic
knowledge together with current input to re-
vise beliefs about previous input. Under some
circumstances, such an error-correction capa-
bility might induce comprehenders to adopt
grammatical analyses that are inconsistent
with the true input. Here we present a for-
mal model of how such input-unfaithful gar-
den paths may be adopted and the difficulty
incurred by their subsequent disconfirmation,
combining a rational noisy-channel model of
syntactic comprehension under uncertain in-
put with the surprisal theory of incremental
processing difficulty. We also present a behav-
ioral experiment confirming the key empirical
predictions of the theory.
