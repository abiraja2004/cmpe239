Markov logic is a highly expressive language
recently introduced to specify the connec-
tivity of a Markov network using first-order
logic. While Markov logic is capable of
constructing arbitrary first-order formulae
over the data, the complexity of these for-
mulae is often limited in practice because
of the size and connectivity of the result-
ing network. In this paper, we present ap-
proximate inference and estimation meth-
ods that incrementally instantiate portions
of the network as needed to enable first-
order existential and universal quantifiers
in Markov logic networks. When applied
to the problem of identity uncertainty, this
approach results in a conditional probabilis-
tic model that can reason about objects,
combining the expressivity of recently in-
troduced BLOG models with the predic-
tive power of conditional training. We vali-
date our algorithms on the tasks of citation
matching and author disambiguation.
