We describe a simple approach for integrating
shallow and deep parsing. We use phrase struc-
ture bracketing obtained from the Collins parser
as filters to guide deep parsing. Our exper-
iments demonstrate that our technique yields
substantial gains in speed along with modest
improvements in accuracy.
