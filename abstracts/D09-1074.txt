Current statistical machine translation
(SMT) systems are trained on sentence-
aligned and word-aligned parallel text col-
lected from various sources. Translation
model parameters are estimated from the
word alignments, and the quality of the
translations on a given test set depends
on the parameter estimates. There are
at least two factors affecting the parame-
ter estimation: domain match and training
data quality. This paper describes a novel
approach for automatically detecting and
down-weighing certain parts of the train-
ing corpus by assigning a weight to each
sentence in the training bitext so as to op-
timize a discriminative objective function
on a designated tuning set. This way, the
proposed method can limit the negative ef-
fects of low quality training data, and can
adapt the translation model to the domain
of interest. It is shown that such discrim-
inative corpus weights can provide sig-
nificant improvements in Arabic-English
translation on various conditions, using a
state-of-the-art SMT system.
