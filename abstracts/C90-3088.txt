 
In machine translation, parsing of long 
English sentences still causes some problems, 
whereas for short sentences a good machine 
translation system usually can generate 
readable translations. In this paper a 
practical method is presented for parsing 
long English sentences of some patterns. The 
rules for the patterns are treated separately 
from the augmented context free grammar, 
where each context free grammar rule is 
augmented by some syntactic functions and 
semantic functions. The rules for patterns 
and augmented context free grammar are 
complimentary to each other. In this way 
long English sentences covered by the 
patterns can be parsed efficiently.
