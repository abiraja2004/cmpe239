 
As the web content becomes more accessible 
to the Vietnamese community across the 
globe, there is a need to process Vietnamese 
query texts properly to find relevant informa-
tion. The recent deployment of a Vietnamese 
translation tool on a well-known search en-
gine justifies its importance in gaining popu-
larity with the World Wide Web. There are 
still problems in the translation and retrieval 
of Vietnamese language as its word recogni-
tion is not fully addressed. In this paper we 
introduce a semi-supervised approach in 
building a general scalable web corpus for 
Vietnamese using search engine to facilitate 
the word segmentation process. Moreover, 
we also propose a segmentation algorithm 
which recognizes effectively Out-Of-
Vocabulary (OOV) words. The result indi-
cates that our solution is scalable and can be 
applied for real time translation program and 
other linguistic applications.  This work is 
here is a continuation of the work of Nguyen 
D. (2008).
