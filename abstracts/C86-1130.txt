 
The development of natural language interfaces to Artifi- 
cial Intelligence systems is dependent on the representation of 
knowledge. A major impediment to building such systems has 
been the difficulty in adding sufficient linguistic and concep- 
tual knowledge to extend and adapt their capabilities. This 
difficulty has been apparent in systems which perform the 
task of language production, i. e. the generation of natural 
language output to satisfy the communicative requirements 
of a system. 
The Ace framework applies knowledge representation fun- 
damentals to the task of encoding knowledge about language. 
Within this framework, linguistic and conceptual knowledge 
are organized into hierarchies, and structured associations are 
used to join knowledge structures that are metaphorically 
or referentially related. These structured associations per- 
mit specialized linguistic knowledge to derive partially from 
more abstract knowledge, facilitating the use of abstractions 
in generating specialized phrases. Thls organization, used by 
a generator called KING (Knowledge INtensive Generator), 
promotes the extenslbility and adaptability of the generation 
system.
