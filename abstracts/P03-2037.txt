This paper proposes an automatic method
of detecting grammar elements that de-
crease readability in a Japanese sentence.
The method consists of two components:
(1) the check list of the grammar elements
that should be detected; and (2) the de-
tector, which is a search program of the
grammar elements from a sentence. By
defining a readability level for every gram-
mar element, we can find which part of the
sentence is difficult to read.
