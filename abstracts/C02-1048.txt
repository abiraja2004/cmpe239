A methodology is proposed for taking queries and
requests expressed in natural language as input and
answering them in charts through organizing that in-
teraction into felicitous dialogue. Charts and graph-
ics, as well as languages, are important modes of
communication. This is especially true of those
which are used frequently when people analyze
huge amount of data interactively, in order to find
out its characteristics or to resolve questions about
it. This paper raises the problem that in such situ-
ations the correctness of the charts depends on the
context, and proposes a framework to resolve it. The
core of the framework is a logical form that includes
the specifications of the user?s perspective and the
proper treatment of the logical form for handling
utterance fragments. The framework has been im-
plemented and confirmed to be appropriate.
