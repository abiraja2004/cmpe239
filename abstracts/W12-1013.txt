Over the past years large digital cultural
heritage collections have become increas-
ingly available. While these provide ad-
equate search functionality for the expert
user, this may not offer the best support for
non-expert or novice users. In this paper
we propose a novel mechanism for intro-
ducing new users to the items in a collection
by allowing them to browse Wikipedia arti-
cles, which are augmented with items from
the cultural heritage collection. Using Eu-
ropeana as a case-study we demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach for encourag-
ing users to spend longer exploring items
in Europeana compared with the existing
search provision.
