Extracting semantic relationships between entities
is challenging because of a paucity of annotated
data and the errors induced by entity detection mod-
ules. We employ Maximum Entropy models to
combine diverse lexical, syntactic and semantic fea-
tures derived from the text. Our system obtained
competitive results in the Automatic Content Ex-
traction (ACE) evaluation. Here we present our gen-
eral approach and describe our ACE results.
