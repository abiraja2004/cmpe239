There are some chronic critics who al-
ways complain about the entity in social
media. We are working to automatically
detect these chronic critics to prevent the
spread of bad rumors about the reputation
of the entity. In social media, most com-
ments are informal, and, there are sarcas-
tic and incomplete contexts. This means
that it is difficult for current NLP technol-
ogy such as opinion mining to recognize
the complaints. As an alternative approach
for social media, we can assume that users
who share the same opinions will link to
each other. Thus, we propose a method
that combines opinion mining with graph
analysis for the connections between users
to identify the chronic critics. Our ex-
perimental results show that the proposed
method outperforms analysis based only
on opinion mining techniques.
