 
In this work we present psycholinguisti-
cally motivated computational models for 
the organization and processing of Ban-
gla morphologically complex words in 
the mental lexicon. Our goal is to identify 
whether morphologically complex words 
are stored as a whole or are they orga-
nized along the morphological line. For 
this, we have conducted a series of psy-
cholinguistic experiments to build up hy-
pothesis on the possible organizational 
structure of the mental lexicon. Next, we 
develop computational models based on 
the collected dataset. We observed that 
derivationally suffixed Bangla words are 
in general decomposed during processing 
and compositionality between the stem 
and the suffix plays an important role in 
the decomposition process. We observed 
the same phenomena for Bangla verb se-
quences where experiments showed non-
compositional verb sequences are in gen-
eral stored as a whole in the ML and low 
traces of compositional verbs are found 
in the mental lexicon.
