of a machine translation system and other 
related NLP applications where an 
appropriate POS tag will be assigned to 
individual words in a collection of texts. 
There is not enough POS tagged corpus 
available in Manipuri language ruling out 
machine learning approaches for a POS 
tagger in the language. A morphology 
driven Manipuri POS tagger that uses three 
dictionaries containing root words, prefixes 
and suffixes has been designed and 
implemented using the affix information 
irrespective of the context of the words. We 
have tested the current POS tagger on 3784 
sentences containing 10917 unique words. 
The POS tagger demonstrated an accuracy 
of 69%. Among the incorrectly tagged 31% 
words, 23% were unknown words (includes 
9% named entities) and 8% known words 
were wrongly tagged.
