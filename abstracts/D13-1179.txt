Cross-lingual topic modelling has applications
in machine translation, word sense disam-
biguation and terminology alignment. Multi-
lingual extensions of approaches based on la-
tent (LSI), generative (LDA, PLSI) as well as
explicit (ESA) topic modelling can induce an
interlingual topic space allowing documents
in different languages to be mapped into the
same space and thus to be compared across
languages. In this paper, we present a novel
approach that combines latent and explicit
topic modelling approaches in the sense that
it builds on a set of explicitly defined top-
ics, but then computes latent relations between
these. Thus, the method combines the ben-
efits of both explicit and latent topic mod-
elling approaches. We show that on a cross-
lingual mate retrieval task, our model signif-
icantly outperforms LDA, LSI, and ESA, as
well as a baseline that translates every word in
a document into the target language.
