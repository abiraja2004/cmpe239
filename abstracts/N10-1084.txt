This paper describes a method for checking
the acceptability of paraphrases in context.
We use the Google n-gram data and a CCG
parser to certify the paraphrasing grammati-
cality and fluency. We collect a corpus of hu-
man judgements to evaluate our system. The
ultimate goal of our work is to integrate text
paraphrasing into a Linguistic Steganography
system, by using paraphrases to hide informa-
tion in a cover text. We propose automati-
cally generated paraphrases as a new and use-
ful source of transformations for Linguistic
Steganography, and show that our method for
checking paraphrases is effective at maintain-
ing a high level of imperceptibility, which is
crucial for effective steganography.
