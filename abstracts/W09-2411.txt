 
This paper presents the task ?Coreference 
Resolution in Multiple Languages? to be run 
in SemEval-2010 (5th International Workshop 
on Semantic Evaluations). This task aims to 
evaluate and compare automatic coreference 
resolution systems for three different lan-
guages (Catalan, English, and Spanish) by 
means of two alternative evaluation metrics, 
thus providing an insight into (i) the portabil-
ity of coreference resolution systems across 
languages, and (ii) the effect of different scor-
ing metrics on ranking the output of the par-
ticipant systems.
