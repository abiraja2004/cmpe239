 
We take the first steps towards augmenting a lexical 
resource, VerbNet, with probabilistic information 
about coercive constructions. We focus on CAUSED-
MOTION as an example construction occurring with 
verbs for which it is a typical usage or for which it 
must be interpreted as extending the event semantics 
through coercion, which occurs productively and adds 
substantially to the relational semantics of a verb. 
However, through annotation we find that VerbNet 
fails to accurately capture all usages of the 
construction. We use unsupervised methods to 
estimate  probabilistic measures from corpus data for 
predicting usage of the construction across verb 
classes in the lexicon and evaluate against VerbNet. 
We discuss how these methods will form the basis for 
enhancements for VerbNet supporting more accurate 
analysis of the relational semantics of a verb across 
productive usages.
