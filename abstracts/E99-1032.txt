 
I will argue in this paper that the standard 
notions of affectedness,  change-of-state and 
result state are too coarse-grained, and will 
revise and enrich substantially their content, 
increasing their role in a compositional spect 
construal procedure. I will claim in particular 
that a proper theory of event structure requires 
that enriched result states should be lexically 
represented, and will base on them a 
computational treatment of event structure 
within a feature-structure-based lexicon.
