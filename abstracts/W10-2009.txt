This paper investigates whether surprisal
theory can account for differential pro-
cessing difficulty in the NP-/S-coordina-
tion ambiguity in Dutch. Surprisal is es-
timated using a Probabilistic Context-Free
Grammar (PCFG), which is induced from
an automatically annotated corpus. We
find that our lexicalized surprisal model
can account for the reading time data from
a classic experiment on this ambiguity by
Frazier (1987). We argue that syntactic
and lexical probabilities, as specified in a
PCFG, are sufficient to account for what is
commonly referred to as an NP-coordina-
tion preference.
