Efficient and precise comparison of parser
results across frameworks will require a
negotiated agreement on a target represen-
tation which embodies a good balance of
three competing dimensions: consistency,
clarity, and flexibility. The various annota-
tions provided in the COLING-08 shared
task for the ten ?required? Wall Street Jour-
nal sentences can serve as a useful ba-
sis for these negotations. While there is
of course substantial overlap in the con-
tent of the various schemes for these sen-
tences, no one of the schemes is ideal.
This paper presents some desiderata for
a negotiated target annotation scheme for
which straightforward mappings can be
constructed from each of the supplied an-
notation schemes.
