 
An increasing number of NLP tasks re-
quire semantic labels to be assigned, not 
only to entities that appear in textual ele-
ments, but to the relationships between 
those entities.  Interest is growing in shal-
low semantic role labeling as well as in 
deep semantic distance metrics grounded 
in ontologies, as each of these contributes 
to better understanding and organization 
of text.  In this work I apply knowledge-
based techniques to identify and explore 
deep semantic relationships in several 
styles of English text: nominal com-
pounds, full sentences in the domain of 
knowledge acquisition, and phrase-level 
labels for images in a collection.  I also 
present work on a graphical tool for ex-
ploring the relationship between domain 
text and deep domain knowledge.
