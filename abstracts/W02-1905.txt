This paper presents a novel approach to
extracting phrase-level answers in a question 
answering system. This approach uses
structural support provided by an integrated 
Natural Language Processing (NLP) and
Information Extraction (IE) system. Both
questions and the sentence-level candidate
answer strings are parsed by this NLP/IE
system into binary dependency structures.
Phrase-level answer extraction is modelled by 
comparing the structural similarity involving 
the question-phrase and the candidate answer-
phrase.
There are two types of structural support. The 
first type involves predefined, specific entity 
associa tions such as Affiliation, Position, Age 
for a person entity. If a question asks about 
one of these associations, the answer-phrase
can be determined as long as the system
decodes such pre-defined dependency links 
correctly, despite the syntactic difference
used in expressions between the question and 
the candidate answer string. The second type 
involves generic grammatical relationships
such as V-S (verb-subject), V-O (verb-
object).
Preliminary experimental results show an
improvement in both precision and recall in 
extracting phrase-level answers, compared
with a baseline system which only uses Named 
Entity constraints. The proposed methods are 
particularly effective in cases where the
question-phrase does not correspond to a
known named entity type and in cases where 
there are multiple candidate answer-phrases
satisfying the named entity constraints.
