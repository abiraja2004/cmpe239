This paper is an analysis of the claim that a
universal ban on certain (?anti-markedness?)
grammars is necessary in order to explain their
non-occurrence in the languages of the world.
To assess the validity of this hypothesis I ex-
amine the implications of one sound change (a
> ?) for learning in a specific phonological
domain (stress assignment), making explicit
assumptions about the type of data that results,
and the learning function that computes over
that data.  The preliminary conclusion is that
restrictions on possible end-point languages
are unneeded, and that the most likely outcome
of change is a lexicon that is inconsistent with
respect to a single generating rule.
