This paper reports translation results for
the ?Exploiting Parallel Texts for Statis-
tical Machine Translation? (HLT-NAACL
Workshop on Parallel Texts 2006). We
have studied different techniques to im-
prove the standard Phrase-Based transla-
tion system. Mainly we introduce two re-
ordering approaches and add morphologi-
cal information.
