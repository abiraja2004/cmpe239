 
Originating from a multidisciplinary research 
project that gathers, around the Semantic 
Web standards and principles, Social 
Networking and Natural Language 
Processing along with some Bioinformatics 
notions, this paper sheds the light on some of 
the most critical aspects of the 
correspondingly adopted framework and real-
time knowledge architecture and modeling 
platform. It recognizes the considerable 
profits of an appropriate fusion between the 
aforementioned disciplines, especially via the 
proper exploitation of OWL 2 (Web 
Ontology Language) features and novelties, 
typically OWL 2 language profiles. 
Accordingly, it proposes a distinctive 
workflow with well-defined strategies for an 
ontology-aware user and NLP-assisted 
flexible and multidimensional approach for 
the management of the abundantly available 
Social data. Application scenarios related to 
awareness and orientation recommender 
systems based on biomedical domain 
ontologies for childhood obesity prevention 
and surveillance are explored as typical proof 
of concept application areas.
