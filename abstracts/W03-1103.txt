 
In this work, we apply a clustering tech-
nique to integrate the contents of items 
into the item-based collaborative filtering 
framework. The group rating information 
that is obtained from the clustering result 
provides a way to introduce content in-
formation into collaborative recommenda-
tion and solves the cold start problem. 
Extensive experiments have been con-
ducted on MovieLens data to analyze the 
characteristics of our technique. The re-
sults show that our approach contributes 
to the improvement of prediction quality 
of the item-based collaborative filtering, 
especially for the cold start problem.
