Despite the existence of several noun phrase coref-
erence resolution data sets as well as several for-
mal evaluations on the task, it remains frustratingly
difficult to compare results across different corefer-
ence resolution systems. This is due to the high cost
of implementing a complete end-to-end coreference
resolution system, which often forces researchers
to substitute available gold-standard information in
lieu of implementing a module that would compute
that information. Unfortunately, this leads to incon-
sistent and often unrealistic evaluation scenarios.
With the aim to facilitate consistent and realis-
tic experimental evaluations in coreference resolu-
tion, we present Reconcile, an infrastructure for the
development of learning-based noun phrase (NP)
coreference resolution systems. Reconcile is de-
signed to facilitate the rapid creation of corefer-
ence resolution systems, easy implementation of
new feature sets and approaches to coreference res-
olution, and empirical evaluation of coreference re-
solvers across a variety of benchmark data sets and
standard scoring metrics. We describe Reconcile
and present experimental results showing that Rec-
oncile can be used to create a coreference resolver
that achieves performance comparable to state-of-
the-art systems on six benchmark data sets.
