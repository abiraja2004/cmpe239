Machine-learned ranking techniques au-
tomatically learn a complex document
ranking function given training data.
These techniques have demonstrated the
effectiveness and flexibility required of a
commercial web search. However, man-
ually labeled training data (with multiple
absolute grades) has become the bottle-
neck for training a quality ranking func-
tion, particularly for a new domain. In
this paper, we explore the adaptation of
machine-learned ranking models across
a set of geographically diverse markets
with the market-specific pairwise prefer-
ence data, which can be easily obtained
from clickthrough logs. We propose
a novel adaptation algorithm, Pairwise-
Trada, which is able to adapt ranking
models that are trained with multi-grade
labeled training data to the target mar-
ket using the target-market-specific pair-
wise preference data. We present results
demonstrating the efficacy of our tech-
nique on a set of commercial search en-
gine data.
