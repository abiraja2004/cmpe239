The quality of Arabic-English statistical ma-
chine translation often suffers as a result of
standard phrase-based SMT systems? inabil-
ity to perform long-range re-orderings, specif-
ically those needed to translate VSO-ordered
Arabic sentences. This problem is further ex-
acerbated by the low performance of Arabic
parsers on subject and subject span detection.
In this paper, we present two parse ?fuzzi-
fication? techniques which allow the transla-
tion system to select among a range of pos-
sible S?V re-orderings. With this approach,
we demonstrate a 0.3-point improvement in
BLEU score (69% of the maximum possible
using gold parses), and a corresponding im-
provement in the percentage of syntactically
well-formed subjects under a manual evalua-
tion.
