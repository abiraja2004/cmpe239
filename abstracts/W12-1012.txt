A significant amount of information about
Cultural Heritage artefacts is now available
in digital format and has been made avail-
able in digital libraries. Being able to iden-
tify items that are similar would be use-
ful for search and navigation through these
data sets. Information about items in these
repositories is often multimodal, such as
pictures of the artefact and an accompa-
nying textual description. This paper ex-
plores the use of information from these
various media for computing similarity be-
tween Cultural Heritage artefacts. Results
show that combining information from im-
ages and text produces better estimates of
similarity than when only a single medium
is considered.
