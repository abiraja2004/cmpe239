In a headed tree, each terminal word
can be uniquely labeled with a gov-
erning word and grammatical relation.
This labeling is a summary of a syn-
tactic analysis which eliminates detail,
reflects aspects of semantics, and for
some grammatical relations (such as
subject of finite verb) is nearly un-
controversial. We define a notion
of expected governor markup, which
sums vectors indexed by governors and
scaled by probabilistic tree weights.
The quantity is computed in a parse for-
est representation of the set of tree anal-
yses for a given sentence, using vector
sums and scaling by inside probability
and flow.
