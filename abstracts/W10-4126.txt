 
The CIPS-SIGHAN CLP 2010 Chinese 
Word Segmentation Bakeoff was held 
in the summer of 2010 to evaluate the 
current state of the art in word 
segmentation. It focused on the cross-
domain performance of Chinese word 
segmentation algorithms. Eighteen 
groups submitted 128 results over two 
tracks (open training and closed 
training), four domains (literature, 
computer science, medicine and finance) 
and two subtasks (simplified Chinese 
and traditional Chinese).  We found that 
compared with the previous Chinese 
word segmentation bakeoffs, the 
performance of cross-domain Chinese 
word segmentation is not much lower, 
and the out-of-vocabulary recall is 
improved.
