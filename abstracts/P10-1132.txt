We present a novel fully unsupervised al-
gorithm for POS induction from plain text,
motivated by the cognitive notion of proto-
types. The algorithm first identifies land-
mark clusters of words, serving as the
cores of the induced POS categories. The
rest of the words are subsequently mapped
to these clusters. We utilize morpho-
logical and distributional representations
computed in a fully unsupervised manner.
We evaluate our algorithm on English and
German, achieving the best reported re-
sults for this task.
