In this paper we present a technique to
reveal definitions and hypernym relations
from text. Instead of using pattern match-
ing methods that rely on lexico-syntactic
patterns, we propose a technique which
only uses syntactic dependencies between
terms extracted with a syntactic parser.
The assumption is that syntactic informa-
tion are more robust than patterns when
coping with length and complexity of the
sentences. Afterwards, we transform such
syntactic contexts in abstract representa-
tions, that are then fed into a Support
Vector Machine classifier. The results on
an annotated dataset of definitional sen-
tences demonstrate the validity of our ap-
proach overtaking current state-of-the-art
techniques.
