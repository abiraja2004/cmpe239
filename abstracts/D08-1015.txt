 
This paper presents two approaches to ranking 
reader emotions of documents. Past studies 
assign a document to a single emotion cate-
gory, so their methods cannot be applied di-
rectly to the emotion ranking problem. 
Furthermore, whereas previous research ana-
lyzes emotions from the writer?s perspective, 
this work examines readers? emotional states. 
The first approach proposed in this paper 
minimizes pairwise ranking errors. In the sec-
ond approach, regression is used to model 
emotional distributions. Experiment results 
show that the regression method is more ef-
fective at identifying the most popular emo-
tion, but the pairwise loss minimization 
method produces ranked lists of emotions that 
have better correlations with the correct lists.
