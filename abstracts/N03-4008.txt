Columbia?s Newsblaster tracking and summa-
rization system is a robust system that clus-
ters news into events, categorizes events into
broad topics and summarizes multiple articles
on each event. Here we outline our most cur-
rent work on tracking events over days, produc-
ing summaries that update a user on new infor-
mation about an event, outlining the perspec-
tives of news coming from different countries
and clustering and summarizing non-English
sources.
