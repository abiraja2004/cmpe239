Older adults are a challenging user group
because their behaviour can be highly vari-
able. To the best of our knowledge, this
is the first study where dialogue strategies
are learned and evaluated with both sim-
ulated younger users and simulated older
users. The simulated users were derived
from a corpus of interactions with a strict
system-initiative spoken dialogue system
(SDS). Learning from simulated younger
users leads to a policy which is close to
one of the dialogue strategies of the under-
lying SDS, while the simulated older users
allow us to learn more flexible dialogue
strategies that accommodate mixed initia-
tive. We conclude that simulated users are
a useful technique for modelling the be-
haviour of new user groups.
