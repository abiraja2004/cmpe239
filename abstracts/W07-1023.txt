At present, most biomedical Information
Retrieval and Extraction tools process ab-
stracts rather than full-text articles. The in-
creasing availability of full text will allow
more knowledge to be extracted with greater
reliability. To investigate the challenges of
full-text processing, we manually annotated
a corpus of cited articles from a Molecular
Interaction Map (Kohn, 1999).
Our analysis demonstrates the necessity of
full-text processing; identifies the article
sections where interactions are most com-
monly stated; and quantifies both the amount
of external knowledge required and the pro-
portion of interactions requiring multiple or
deeper inference steps. Further, it identi-
fies a range of NLP tools required, including:
identifying synonyms, and resolving coref-
erence and negated expressions. This is im-
portant guidance for researchers engineering
biomedical text processing systems.
