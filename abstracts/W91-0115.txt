to handle not orily syntactic and semantic 
information but also pragmatic nformation. 
? I Existing architectures cannot represent prag- 
matic informatioil explicitly, and lack rea- 
soning capability;given insufficient informa- 
tion. I argue that he techniques ofplan rep- 
resentation and approximate r asoning are, 
in the enhanced argumentation system pro- 
posed here, effective for solving these prob- 
lems.
