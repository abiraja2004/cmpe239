We introduce improvements to statistical word
alignment based on the Hidden Markov
Model. One improvement incorporates syntac-
tic knowledge. Results on the workshop data
show that alignment performance exceeds that
of a state-of-the art system based on more com-
plex models, resulting in over a 5.5% absolute
reduction in error on Romanian-English.
