Similarity measures for text have histor-
ically been an important tool for solving
information retrieval problems. In this pa-
per we consider extended similarity met-
rics for documents and other objects em-
bedded in graphs, facilitated via a lazy
graph walk. We provide a detailed in-
stantiation of this framework for email
data, where content, social networks and
a timeline are integrated in a structural
graph. The suggested framework is evalu-
ated for the task of disambiguating names
in email documents. We show that rerank-
ing schemes based on the graph-walk sim-
ilarity measures often outperform base-
line methods, and that further improve-
ments can be obtained by use of appropri-
ate learning methods.
