 
As an alternative to requiring substantial su-
pervised relation training data, many have ex-
plored bootstrapping relation extraction from 
a few seed examples. Most techniques assume 
that the examples are based on easily spotted 
anchors, e.g., names or dates. Sentences in a 
corpus which contain the anchors are then 
used to induce alternative ways of expressing 
the relation. We explore whether coreference 
can improve the learning process. That is, if 
the algorithm considered examples such as his 
sister, would accuracy be improved? With co-
reference, we see on average a 2-fold increase 
in F-Score. Despite using potentially errorful 
machine coreference, we see significant in-
crease in recall on all relations. Precision in-
creases in four cases and decreases in six.
