This paper presents a comparative study of
spelling errors that are corrected as you type,
vs. those that remain uncorrected. First,
we generate naturally occurring online error
correction data by logging users? keystrokes,
and by automatically deriving pre- and post-
correction strings from them. We then per-
form an analysis of this data against the errors
that remain in the final text as well as across
languages. Our analysis shows a clear distinc-
tion between the types of errors that are gen-
erated and those that remain uncorrected, as
well as across languages.
