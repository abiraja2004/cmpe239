In this paper we present a novel approach
of utilizing Semantic Role Labeling (SRL)
information to improve Hierarchical Phrase-
based Machine Translation. We propose an
algorithm to extract SRL-aware Synchronous
Context-Free Grammar (SCFG) rules. Con-
ventional Hiero-style SCFG rules will also be
extracted in the same framework. Special con-
version rules are applied to ensure that when
SRL-aware SCFG rules are used in deriva-
tion, the decoder only generates hypotheses
with complete semantic structures. We per-
form machine translation experiments using 9
different Chinese-English test-sets. Our ap-
proach achieved an average BLEU score im-
provement of 0.49 as well as 1.21 point reduc-
tion in TER.
