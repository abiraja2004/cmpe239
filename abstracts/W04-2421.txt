We present a system submitted to the CoNLL-
2004 shared task for semantic role labeling.
The system is composed of a set of classifiers
and an inference procedure used both to clean
the classification results and to ensure struc-
tural integrity of the final role labeling. Lin-
guistic information is used to generate features
during classification and constraints for the in-
ference process.
