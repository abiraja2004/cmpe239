Abstract
This paper describes experiments in classi-
fying sentences of medical abstracts into a
number of semantic classes given by section
headings in structured abstracts. Using con-
ditional random fields, we obtain F -scores
ranging from 0.72 to 0.97. By using a small
set of sentences that appear under the PAR-
TICPANTS heading, we demonstrate that it is
possible to recognize sentences that describe
population characteristics of a study. We
present a detailed study of the structure of
abstracts of randomized clinical trials, and
examine how sentences labeled under PAR-
TICIPANTS could be used to summarize the
population group.
