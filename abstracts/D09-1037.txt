Tree based translation models are a com-
pelling means of integrating linguistic in-
formation into machine translation. Syn-
tax can inform lexical selection and re-
ordering choices and thereby improve
translation quality. Research to date has
focussed primarily on decoding with such
models, but less on the difficult problem of
inducing the bilingual grammar from data.
We propose a generative Bayesian model
of tree-to-string translation which induces
grammars that are both smaller and pro-
duce better translations than the previous
heuristic two-stage approach which em-
ploys a separate word alignment step.
