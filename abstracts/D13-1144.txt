In this paper, we propose a walk-based graph
kernel that generalizes the notion of tree-
kernels to continuous spaces. Our proposed
approach subsumes a general framework for
word-similarity, and in particular, provides a
flexible way to incorporate distributed repre-
sentations. Using vector representations, such
an approach captures both distributional se-
mantic similarities among words as well as the
structural relations between them (encoded as
the structure of the parse tree). We show an ef-
ficient formulation to compute this kernel us-
ing simple matrix operations. We present our
results on three diverse NLP tasks, showing
state-of-the-art results.
