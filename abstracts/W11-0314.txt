In this paper we present ULISSE, an unsu-
pervised linguistically?driven algorithm to se-
lect reliable parses from the output of a de-
pendency parser. Different experiments were
devised to show that the algorithm is robust
enough to deal with the output of different
parsers and with different languages, as well
as to be used across different domains. In
all cases, ULISSE appears to outperform the
baseline algorithms.
