 
An overview is provided of six information visualization systems designed specifically for gaining an overview of electronic health re-cords (EHR). The systems discussed all make use of timelines: Lifelines, Lifelines2, KNAVE II, CLEF Visual Navigator, Time-line, and AsbruView. With the exception of Lifelines2, the main user groups targeted are physicians involved in direct patient care. Lit-tle attention has been paid towards supporting true secondary use of EHR contents, for ac-tivities such as assessing quality of care, pa-tient health and safety monitoring, and clinical trial recruitment. Future work on such systems needs to address the complexity of EHR data, missing and incomplete information, and dif-ficulties in displaying data with differing lev-els of granularity.
