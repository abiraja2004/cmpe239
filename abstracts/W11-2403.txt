This paper addresses context matching in tex-
tual inference. We formulate the task under
the Contextual Preferences framework which
broadly captures contextual aspects of infer-
ence. We propose a generic classification-
based scheme under this framework which co-
herently attends to context matching in infer-
ence and may be employed in any inference-
based task. As a test bed for our scheme we use
the Name-based Text Categorization (TC) task.
We define an integration of Contextual Prefer-
ences into the TC setting and present a concrete
self-supervised model which instantiates the
generic scheme and is applied to address con-
text matching in the TC task. Experiments on
standard TC datasets show that our approach
outperforms the state of the art in context mod-
eling for Name-based TC.
