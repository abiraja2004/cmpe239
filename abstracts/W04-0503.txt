 
This paper discusses some main difficulties of 
restricted-domain question-answering systems, 
in particular the problem of precision 
performance. We propose methods for 
improving the precision, which can be 
classified into two main approaches: 
improving the Information Retrieval module, 
and improving its results. We present the 
application of these methods in a real QA 
system for a large company, which yielded 
very good results.
