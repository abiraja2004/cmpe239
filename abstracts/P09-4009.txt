This paper presents a system for querying
treebanks. The system consists of a pow-
erful query language with natural support
for cross-layer queries, a client interface
with a graphical query builder and visual-
izer of the results, a command-line client
interface, and two substitutable query en-
gines: a very efficient engine using a re-
lational database (suitable for large static
data), and a slower, but paralel-computing
enabled, engine operating on treebank files
(suitable for ?live? data).
