We describe a graph-based generation sys-
tem that participated in the TUNA attribute se-
lection and realisation task of the REG 2008
Challenge. Using a stochastic cost function
(with certain properties for free), and trying
attributes from cheapest to more expensive,
the system achieves overall .76 DICE and .54
MASI scores for attribute selection on the de-
velopment set. For realisation, it turns out
that in some cases higher attribute selection
accuracy leads to larger differences between
system-generated and human descriptions.
