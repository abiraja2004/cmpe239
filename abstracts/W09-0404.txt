We present two regression models for the prediction
of pairwise preference judgments among MT hy-
potheses. Both models are based on feature sets that
are motivated by textual entailment and incorporate
lexical similarity as well as local syntactic features
and specific semantic phenomena. One model pre-
dicts absolute scores; the other one direct pairwise
judgments. We find that both models are compet-
itive with regression models built over the scores
of established MT evaluation metrics. Further data
analysis clarifies the complementary behavior of the
two feature sets.
