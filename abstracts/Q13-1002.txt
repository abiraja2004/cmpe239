Dependency parsing algorithms capable of
producing the types of crossing dependencies
seen in natural language sentences have tra-
ditionally been orders of magnitude slower
than algorithms for projective trees. For 95.8-
99.8% of dependency parses in various nat-
ural language treebanks, whenever an edge
is crossed, the edges that cross it all have a
common vertex. The optimal dependency tree
that satisfies this 1-Endpoint-Crossing prop-
erty can be found with an O(n4) parsing al-
gorithm that recursively combines forests over
intervals with one exterior point. 1-Endpoint-
Crossing trees also have natural connections
to linguistics and another class of graphs that
has been studied in NLP.
