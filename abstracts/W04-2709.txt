 
This paper describes a multi-site project to 
annotate six sizable bilingual parallel corpora 
for interlingual content. After presenting the 
background and objectives of the effort, we 
describe the data set that is being annotated, 
the interlingua representation language used, 
an interface environment that supports the an-
notation task and the annotation process itself. 
We will then present a preliminary version of 
our evaluation methodology and conclude 
with a summary of the current status of the 
project along with a number of issues which 
have arisen.
