We examine various string distance mea-
sures for suitability in modeling dialect
distance, especially its perception. We find
measures superior which do not normalize
for word length, but which are are sensi-
tive to order. We likewise find evidence for
the superiority of measures which incor-
porate a sensitivity to phonological con-
text, realized in the form of n-grams?
although we cannot identify which form
of context (bigram, trigram, etc.) is best.
However, we find no clear benefit in us-
ing gradual as opposed to binary segmen-
tal difference when calculating sequence
distances.
