We predict entity type distributions in Web
search queries via probabilistic inference in
graphical models that capture how entity-
bearing queries are generated. We jointly
model the interplay between latent user in-
tents that govern queries and unobserved en-
tity types, leveraging observed signals from
query formulations and document clicks. We
apply the models to resolve entity types in new
queries and to assign prior type distributions
over an existing knowledge base. Our mod-
els are efficiently trained using maximum like-
lihood estimation over millions of real-world
Web search queries. We show that modeling
user intent significantly improves entity type
resolution for head queries over the state of the
art, on several metrics, without degradation in
tail query performance.
