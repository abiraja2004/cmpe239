Random Indexing is a vector space tech-
nique that provides an efficient and scal-
able approximation to distributional simi-
larity problems. We present experiments
showing Random Indexing to be poor at
handling large volumes of data and evalu-
ate the use of weighting functions for im-
proving the performance of Random In-
dexing. We find that Random Index is ro-
bust for small data sets, but performance
degrades because of the influence high fre-
quency attributes in large data sets. The
use of appropriate weight functions im-
proves this significantly.
