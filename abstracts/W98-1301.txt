. This paper presents a novel formalization of optimality theory. Unlike pre- 
vious treatments of optimality in computational linguistics, starting with EUison (1994), 
the new approach does not require any explicit marking and counting of constraint vi- 
olations. It is based on the notion of "lenient composition", defined as the combination 
of ordinary composition and priority union. If an underlying form has outputs that can 
meet a given constraint, lenient composition enforces the constraint; if none of the output 
candidates meets the constraint, lenient composition allows all of them. For the sake of 
greater efficiency, we may "leniently compose" the GEN relation and all the constraints 
into a single finite-state transducer that maps each underlying form directly into its op- 
timal surface realizations, and vice versa. Seen f~om this perspective, optimality theolT 
is surprisingly similar to the two older strains of finite-state phonology: classical rewrite 
systems and two-level models. In particular, the ranking of optimality constraints corre- 
sponds to the ordering of rewrite rules.
