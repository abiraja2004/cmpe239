The possibility of deleting a word from a sen-
tence without violating its syntactic correct-
ness belongs to traditionally known manifes-
tations of syntactic dependency. We introduce
a novel unsupervised parsing approach that is
based on a new n-gram reducibility measure.
We perform experiments across 18 languages
available in CoNLL data and we show that
our approach achieves better accuracy for the
majority of the languages then previously re-
ported results.
