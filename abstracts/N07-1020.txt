 
This paper introduces an unsupervised 
morphological segmentation algorithm 
that shows robust performance for four 
languages with different levels of mor-
phological complexity. In particular, our 
algorithm outperforms Goldsmith?s Lin-
guistica and Creutz and Lagus?s Mor-
phessor for English and Bengali, and 
achieves performance that is comparable 
to the best results for all three PASCAL 
evaluation datasets. Improvements arise 
from (1) the use of relative corpus fre-
quency and suffix level similarity for de-
tecting incorrect morpheme attachments 
and (2) the induction of orthographic rules 
and allomorphs for segmenting words 
where roots exhibit spelling changes dur-
ing morpheme attachments.
