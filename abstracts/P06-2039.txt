Example-based parsing has already been
proposed in literature. In particular, at-
tempts are being made to develop tech-
niques for language pairs where the source
and target languages are different, e.g.
Direct Projection Algorithm (Hwa et al,
2005). This enables one to develop parsed
corpus for target languages having fewer
linguistic tools with the help of a resource-
rich source language. The DPA algo-
rithm works on the assumption of Di-
rect Correspondence which simply means
that the relation between two words of
the source language sentence can be pro-
jected directly between the correspond-
ing words of the parallel target language
sentence. However, we find that this as-
sumption does not hold good all the time.
This leads to wrong parsed structure of the
target language sentence. As a solution
we propose an algorithm called pseudo
DPA (pDPA) that can work even if Direct
Correspondence assumption is not guaran-
teed. The proposed algorithm works in a
recursive manner by considering the em-
bedded phrase structures from outermost
level to the innermost. The present work
discusses the pDPA algorithm, and illus-
trates it with respect to English-Hindi lan-
guage pair. Link Grammar based pars-
ing has been considered as the underlying
parsing scheme for this work.
