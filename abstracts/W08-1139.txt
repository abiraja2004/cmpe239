 
This paper presents a Prefix Tree based model 
of Generation of Referring Expression (RE). 
Our algorithm PTBSGRE works in two phas-
es. First, an encoded prefix tree is constructed 
describing the domain structure. Subsequent-
ly, RE is generated using that structure. We 
evaluated our system using Dice, MASI, Ac-
curacy, Minimality and Uniqueness scoring 
method using standard TEVAl tool and the re-
sult is encouraging.
