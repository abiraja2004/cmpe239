This paper describes how external resources
can be used to improve parser performance for
heavily lexicalised grammars, looking at both
robustness and efficiency. In terms of robust-
ness, we try using different types of external
data to increase lexical coverage, and find that
simple POS tags have the most effect, increas-
ing coverage on unseen data by up to 45%. We
also show that filtering lexical items in a su-
pertagging manner is very effective in increas-
ing efficiency. Even using vanilla POS tags we
achieve some efficiency gains, but when us-
ing detailed lexical types as supertags weman-
age to halve parsing time with minimal loss of
coverage or precision.
