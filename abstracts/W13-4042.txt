In many environments (e. g. sports com-
mentary), situations incrementally unfold
over time and often the future appearance
of a relevant event can be predicted, but not
in all its details or precise timing. We have
built a simulation framework that uses our
incremental speech synthesis component
to assemble in a timely manner complex
commentary utterances. In our evaluation,
the resulting output is preferred over that
from a baseline system that uses a simpler
commenting strategy. Even in cases where
the incremental system overcommits tem-
porally and requires a filled pause to wait
for the upcoming event, the system is pre-
ferred over the baseline.
