We report on an active learning experi-
ment for named entity recognition in the
astronomy domain. Active learning has
been shown to reduce the amount of la-
belled data required to train a supervised
learner by selectively sampling more in-
formative data points for human annota-
tion. We inspect double annotation data
from the same domain and quantify poten-
tial problems concerning annotators? per-
formance. For data selectively sampled
according to different selection metrics,
we find lower inter-annotator agreement
and higher per token annotation times.
However, overall results confirm the util-
ity of active learning.
