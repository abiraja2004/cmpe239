This paper introduces the problem of gen-
erating descriptions of n-dimensional spa-
tial data by decomposing it via model-
based clustering. I apply the approach
to the error function of supervised clas-
sification algorithms, a practical problem
that uses Natural Language Generation for
understanding the behaviour of a trained
classifier. I demonstrate my system on a
dataset taken from CoNLL shared tasks.
