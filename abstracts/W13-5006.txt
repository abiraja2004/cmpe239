After recasting the computation of a distribu-
tional thesaurus in a graph-based framework
for term similarity, we introduce a new con-
textualization method that generates, for each
term occurrence in a text, a ranked list of terms
that are semantically similar and compatible
with the given context. The framework is in-
stantiated by the definition of term and con-
text, which we derive from dependency parses
in this work. Evaluating our approach on a
standard data set for lexical substitution, we
show substantial improvements over a strong
non-contextualized baseline across all parts of
speech. In contrast to comparable approaches,
our framework defines an unsupervised gener-
ative method for similarity in context and does
not rely on the existence of lexical resources as
a source for candidate expansions.
