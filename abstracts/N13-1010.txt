The frequency of words and syntactic con-
structions has been observed to have a sub-
stantial effect on language processing. This
begs the question of what causes certain con-
structions to be more or less frequent. A the-
ory of grounding (Phillips, 2010) would sug-
gest that cognitive limitations might cause lan-
guages to develop frequent constructions in
such a way as to avoid processing costs. This
paper studies how current theories of working
memory fit into theories of language process-
ing and what influence memory limitations
may have over reading times. Measures of
such limitations are evaluated on eye-tracking
data and the results are compared with predic-
tions made by different theories of processing.
