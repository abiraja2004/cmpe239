This paper describes a method for utterance
classification that does not require manual
transcription of training data. The method
combines domain independent acoustic models
with off-the-shelf classifiers to give utterance
classification performance that is surprisingly
close to what can be achieved using conven-
tional word-trigram recognition requiring man-
ual transcription. In our method, unsupervised
training is first used to train a phone n-gram
model for a particular domain; the output of
recognition with this model is then passed to
a phone-string classifier. The classification ac-
curacy of the method is evaluated on three dif-
ferent spoken language system domains.
