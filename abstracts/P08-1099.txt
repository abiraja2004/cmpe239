This paper presents a semi-supervised train-
ing method for linear-chain conditional ran-
dom fields that makes use of labeled features
rather than labeled instances. This is accom-
plished by using generalized expectation cri-
teria to express a preference for parameter set-
tings in which the model?s distribution on un-
labeled data matches a target distribution. We
induce target conditional probability distribu-
tions of labels given features from both anno-
tated feature occurrences in context and ad-
hoc feature majority label assignment. The
use of generalized expectation criteria allows
for a dramatic reduction in annotation time
by shifting from traditional instance-labeling
to feature-labeling, and the methods presented
outperform traditional CRF training and other
semi-supervised methods when limited human
effort is available.
