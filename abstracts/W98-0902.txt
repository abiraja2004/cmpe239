 
This paper describes a computational, declarative 
approach to prosodic morphology that uses invio- 
lable constraints o denote small finite candidate sets 
which are filtered by a restrictive incremental opti- 
mization mechanism. The new approach is illustrated 
with an implemented fragment of Modern Hebrew 
verbs couched in MicroCUF, an expressive con- 
straint logic formalism. For generation and parsing 
of word forms, I propose anovel off-line technique to 
eliminate run-time optimization. It produces a finite- 
state oracle that efficiently restricts the constraint in- 
terpreter's search space. As a byproduct, unknown 
words can be analyzed without special mechanisms. 
Unlike pure finite-state transducer approaches, this 
hybrid setup allows for more expressivity in con- 
straints to specify e.g. token identity for reduplica- 
tion or arithmetic constraints for phonetics.
