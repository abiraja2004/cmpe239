In this paper we present a quantitative
and qualitative analysis of annotation in
the Hinoki treebank of Japanese, and in-
vestigate a method of speeding annotation
by using part-of-speech tags. The Hinoki
treebank is a Redwoods-style treebank of
Japanese dictionary definition sentences.
5,000 sentences are annotated by three dif-
ferent annotators and the agreement evalu-
ated. An average agreement of 65.4% was
found using strict agreement, and 83.5%
using labeled precision. Exploiting POS
tags allowed the annotators to choose the
best parse with 19.5% fewer decisions.
