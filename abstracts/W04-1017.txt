Most approaches to extractive summarization define
a set of features upon which selection of sentences
is based, using algorithms independent of the fea-
tures themselves. We propose a new set of features
based on low-level, atomic events that describe rela-
tionships between important actors in a document or
set of documents. We investigate the effect this new
feature has on extractive summarization, compared
with a baseline feature set consisting of the words
in the input documents, and with state-of-the-art
summarization systems. Our experimental results
indicate that not only the event-based features of-
fer an improvement in summary quality over words
as features, but that this effect is more pronounced
for more sophisticated summarization methods that
avoid redundancy in the output.
