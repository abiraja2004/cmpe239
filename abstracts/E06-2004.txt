We demonstrate a new development environ-
ment1 ?Information State Update? dialogue
systems which allows non-expert developers
to produce complete spoken dialogue sys-
tems based only on a Business Process Model
(BPM) describing their application (e.g. bank-
ing, cinema booking, shopping, restaurant in-
formation). The environment includes au-
tomatic generation of Grammatical Frame-
work (GF) grammars for robust interpretation
of spontaneous speech, and uses application
databases to generate lexical entries and gram-
mar rules. The GF grammar is compiled to
an ATK or Nuance language model for speech
recognition. The demonstration system allows
users to create and modify spoken dialogue
systems, starting with a definition of a Busi-
ness ProcessModel and ending with a working
system. This paper describes the environment,
its main components, and some of the research
issues involved in its development.
