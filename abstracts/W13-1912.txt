Sentence types typical to Swedish clini-
cal text were extracted by comparing sen-
tence part-of-speech tag sequences in clin-
ical and in standard Swedish text. Parsings
by a syntactic dependency parser, trained
on standard Swedish, were manually ana-
lysed for the 33 sentence types most typ-
ical to clinical text. This analysis re-
sulted in the identification of eight error
types, and for two of these error types, pre-
processing rules were constructed to im-
prove the performance of the parser. For
all but one of the ten sentence types af-
fected by these two rules, the parsing was
improved by pre-processing.
