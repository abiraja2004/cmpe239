We refine the most frequent sense baseline
for word sense disambiguation using a num-
ber of novel word sense disambiguation tech-
niques. Evaluating on the S???????-3 English
all words task, our combined system focuses
on improving every stage of word sense dis-
ambiguation: starting with the lemmatization
and part of speech tags used, through the ac-
curacy of the most frequent sense baseline, to
highly targeted individual systems. Our super-
vised systems include a ranking algorithm and
a Wikipedia similarity measure.
