 
In this paper, we present a new word alignment 
combination approach on language pairs where 
one language has no explicit word boundaries. 
Instead of combining word alignments of dif-
ferent models (Xiang et al, 2010), we try to 
combine word alignments over multiple mono-
lingually motivated word segmentation. Our 
approach is based on link confidence score de-
fined over multiple segmentations, thus the 
combined alignment is more robust to inappro-
priate word segmentation. Our combination al-
gorithm is simple, efficient, and easy to 
implement. In the Chinese-English experiment, 
our approach effectively improved word align-
ment quality as well as translation performance 
on all segmentations simultaneously, which 
showed that word alignment can benefit from 
complementary knowledge due to the diversity 
of multiple and monolingually motivated seg-
mentations.
