We propose a computational model of text
reuse tailored for ancient literary texts, avail-
able to us often only in small and noisy sam-
ples. The model takes into account source
alternation patterns, so as to be able to align
even sentences with low surface similarity.
We demonstrate its ability to characterize
text reuse in the Greek New Testament.
