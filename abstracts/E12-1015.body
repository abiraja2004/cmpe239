In this paper we investigate the use of
character-level translation models to sup-
port the translation from and to under-
resourced languages and textual domains
via closely related pivot languages. Our ex-
periments show that these low-level models
can be successful even with tiny amounts
of training data. We test the approach on
movie subtitles for three language pairs and
legal texts for another language pair in a do-
main adaptation task. Our pivot translations
outperform the baselines by a large margin.
