 
A coding scheme for inputting Chinese 
characters by means of a conventional 
keyboard has been developed. The code 
for each Chinese character is composed 
of two strings of keys, one corresponds 
to the spell ing and the other the ideo- 
graphic property of the character. Each 
code requires no more than seven keys 
(average five and a half keys) and 99.5% 
of the ten thousand characters in a 
dictionary 'XianDai HanYu CiDian' have 
unique codes. Each input code can be 
packed into 32 bits for internal 
representation.
