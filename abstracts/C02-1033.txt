We present in this paper a method for achiev-
ing in an integrated way two tasks of topic
analysis: segmentation and link detection. This
method combines word repetition and the lexi-
cal cohesion stated by a collocation network to
compensate for the respective weaknesses of
the two approaches. We report an evaluation
of our method for segmentation on two cor-
pora, one in French and one in English, and
we propose an evaluation measure that spe-
cifically suits that kind of systems.
