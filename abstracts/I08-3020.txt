Speech-to-speech machine translation is in
some ways the peak of natural language pro-
cessing, in that it deals directly with our
original, oral mode of communication (as
opposed to derived written language). As
such, it presents challenges that are not to be
taken lightly. Although existing technology
covers each of the steps in the process, from
speech recognition to synthesis, deriving a
model of translation that is effective in the
domain of spoken language is an interesting
and challenging task. If we could teach our
algorithms to learn as children acquire lan-
guage, the result would be useful both for
language technology and cognitive science.
We propose several potential approaches, an
implementation of a multi-path model that
translates recognized morphemes alongside
words, and a web-interface to test our speech
translation tool as trained for Finnish to En-
glish. We also discuss current approaches to
machine translation and the problems they
face in adapting simultaneously to morpho-
logically rich languages and to the spoken
modality.
