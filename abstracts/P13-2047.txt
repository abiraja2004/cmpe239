This paper presents the settings and the re-
sults of the ROMIP 2013 MT shared task
for the English?Russian language direc-
tion. The quality of generated translations
was assessed using automatic metrics and
human evaluation. We also discuss ways
to reduce human evaluation efforts using
pairwise sentence comparisons by human
judges to simulate sort operations.
