Classification and learning algorithms use
syntactic structures as proxies between
source sentences and feature vectors. In
this paper, we explore an alternative path
to use syntax in feature spaces: the Dis-
tributed Representation ?Parsers? (DRP).
The core of the idea is straightforward:
DRPs directly obtain syntactic feature vec-
tors from sentences without explicitly pro-
ducing symbolic syntactic interpretations.
Results show that DRPs produce feature
spaces significantly better than those ob-
tained by existing methods in the same
conditions and competitive with those ob-
tained by existing methods with lexical in-
formation.
