 
This paper proposes to solve the bottle-
neck of finding training data for word 
sense disambiguation (WSD) in the do-
main of web queries, where a complete set 
of ambiguous word senses are unknown. 
In this paper, we present a combination of 
active learning and semi-supervised learn-
ing method to treat the case when positive 
examples, which have an expected word 
sense in web search result, are only given. 
The novelty of our approach is to use 
?pseudo negative examples? with reliable 
confidence score estimated by a classifier 
trained with positive and unlabeled exam-
ples. We show experimentally that our 
proposed method achieves close enough 
WSD accuracy to the method with the 
manually prepared negative examples in 
several Japanese Web search data.
