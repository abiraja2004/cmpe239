Active learning is an effective method for cre-
ating training sets cheaply, but it is a biased
sampling process and fails to explore large
regions of the instance space in many appli-
cations. This can result in a missed cluster
effect, which signficantly lowers recall and
slows down learning for infrequent classes.
We show that missed clusters can be avoided
in sequence classification tasks by using sen-
tences as natural multi-instance units for label-
ing. Co-selection of other tokens within sen-
tences provides an implicit exploratory com-
ponent since we found for the task of named
entity recognition on two corpora that en-
tity classes co-occur with sufficient frequency
within sentences.
