We introduce a word alignment framework
that facilitates the incorporation of syntax en-
coded in bilingual dependency tree pairs. Our
model consists of two sub-models: an anchor
word alignment model which aims to find a set
of high-precision anchor links and a syntax-
enhanced word alignment model which fo-
cuses on aligning the remaining words relying
on dependency information invoked by the ac-
quired anchor links. We show that our syntax-
enhanced word alignment approach leads to a
10.32% and 5.57% relative decrease in align-
ment error rate compared to a generative word
alignment model and a syntax-proof discrim-
inative word alignment model respectively.
Furthermore, our approach is evaluated ex-
trinsically using a phrase-based statistical ma-
chine translation system. The results show
that SMT systems based on our word align-
ment approach tend to generate shorter out-
puts. Without length penalty, using our word
alignments yields statistically significant im-
provement in Chinese?English machine trans-
lation in comparison with the baseline word
alignment.
