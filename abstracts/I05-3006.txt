A hierarchical hidden Markov model
(HHMM) based approach of product
named entity recognition (NER) from
Chinese free text is presented in this pa-
per. Characteristics and challenges in
product NER is also investigated and
analyzed deliberately compared with
general NER. Within a unified statis-
tical framework, the approach we pro-
posed is able to make probabilistically
reasonable decisions to a global opti-
mization by leveraging diverse range
of linguistic features and knowledge
sources. Experimental results show that
our approach performs quite well in two
different domains.
