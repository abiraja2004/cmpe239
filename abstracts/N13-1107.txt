Traditional relation extraction seeks to iden-
tify pre-specified semantic relations within
natural language text, while open Information
Extraction (Open IE) takes a more general ap-
proach, and looks for a variety of relations
without restriction to a fixed relation set. With
this generalization comes the question, what
is a relation? For example, should the more
general task be restricted to relations medi-
ated by verbs, nouns, or both? To help answer
this question, we propose two levels of sub-
tasks for Open IE. One task is to determine if
a sentence potentially contains a relation be-
tween two entities? The other task looks to
confirm explicit relation words for two enti-
ties. We propose multiple SVM models with
dependency tree kernels for both tasks. For
explicit relation extraction, our system can ex-
tract both noun and verb relations. Our results
on three datasets show that our system is su-
perior when compared to state-of-the-art sys-
tems like REVERB and OLLIE for both tasks.
For example, in some experiments our system
achieves 33% improvement on nominal rela-
tion extraction over OLLIE. In addition we
propose an unsupervised rule-based approach
which can serve as a strong baseline for Open
IE systems.
