 
The goal of this research is to increase the 
value of each individual student's vocabulary 
by finding words that the student doesn?t 
know, needs to, and is ready to learn. To help 
identify such words, a better model of how 
well any given word is expected to be known 
was created. This is accomplished by using a 
semantic language model, LSA, to track how 
every word changes with the addition of more 
and more text from an appropriate corpus. We 
define the ?maturity? of a word as the degree 
to which it has become similar to that after 
training on the entire corpus. 
An individual student?s average vocabu-
lary level can then be placed on the word-
maturity scale by an adaptive test. Finally, the 
words that the student did or did not know on 
the test can be used to predict what other 
words the same student knows by using mul-
tiple maturity models trained on random sam-
ples of typical educational readings. This 
detailed information can be used to generate 
highly customized vocabulary teaching and 
testing exercises, such as Cloze tests.
