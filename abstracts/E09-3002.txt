CCG, one of the most prominent grammar
frameworks, efficiently deals with deletion
under coordination in natural languages.
However, when we expand our attention
to more analytic languages whose degree
of pro-dropping is more free, CCG?s de-
composition rule for dealing with gapping
becomes incapable of parsing some pat-
terns of intra-sentential ellipses in serial
verb construction. Moreover, the decom-
position rule might also lead us to over-
generation problem. In this paper the
composition rule is replaced by the use
of memory mechanism, calledCCG-MM.
Fillers can be memorized and gaps can be
induced from an input sentence in func-
tional application rules, while fillers and
gaps are associated in coordination and se-
rialization. Multimodal slashes, which al-
low or ban memory operations, are utilized
for ease of resource management. As a
result, CCG-MM is more powerful than
canonical CCG, but its generative power
can be bounded by partially linear indexed
grammar.
