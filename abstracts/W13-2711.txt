In this paper, we argue that compara-
ble collections of historical written re-
sources can help overcoming typical chal-
lenges posed by heritage texts enhanc-
ing spelling normalization, POS-tagging
and subsequent diachronic linguistic anal-
yses. Thus, we present a comparable cor-
pus of historical German recipes and show
how such a comparable text collection to-
gether with the application of innovative
MT inspired strategies allow us (i) to ad-
dress the word form normalization prob-
lem and (ii) to automatically generate a
diachronic dictionary of spelling variants.
Such a diachronic dictionary can be used
both for spelling normalization and for ex-
tracting new ?translation? (word forma-
tion/change) rules for diachronic spelling
variants. Moreover, our approach can be
applied virtually to any diachronic collec-
tion of texts regardless of the time span
they represent. A first evaluation shows
that our approach compares well with
state-of-art approaches.
