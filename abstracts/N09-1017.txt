Nominals frequently surface without overtly
expressed arguments. In order to measure the
potential benefit of nominal SRL for down-
stream processes, such nominals must be ac-
counted for. In this paper, we show that a
state-of-the-art nominal SRL system with an
overall argument F1 of 0.76 suffers a perfor-
mance loss of more than 9% when nominals
with implicit arguments are included in the
evaluation. We then develop a system that
takes implicit argumentation into account, im-
proving overall performance by nearly 5%.
Our results indicate that the degree of implicit
argumentation varies widely across nominals,
making automated detection of implicit argu-
mentation an important step for nominal SRL.
