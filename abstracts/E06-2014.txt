The problem we address in this paper is
that of providing contextual examples of
translation equivalents for words from the
general lexicon using comparable corpora
and semantic annotation that is uniform
for the source and target languages. For
a sentence, phrase or a query expression in
the source language the tool detects the se-
mantic type of the situation in question and
gives examples of similar contexts from
the target language corpus.
