We report on an investigation of the prag-
matic category of topic in Danish dia-
log and its correlation to surface features
of NPs. Using a corpus of 444 utter-
ances, we trained a decision tree system
on 16 features. The system achieved near-
human performance with success rates of
84?89% and F1-scores of 0.63?0.72 in 10-
fold cross validation tests (human perfor-
mance: 89% and 0.78). The most im-
portant features turned out to be prever-
bal position, definiteness, pronominalisa-
tion, and non-subordination. We discov-
ered that NPs in epistemic matrix clauses
(e.g. ?I think . . . ?) were seldom topics and
we suspect that this holds for other inter-
personal matrix clauses as well.
