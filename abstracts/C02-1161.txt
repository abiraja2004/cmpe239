We describe a mechanism for the generation of
lexical paraphrases of queries posed to an Inter-
net resource. These paraphrases are generated us-
ing WordNet and part-of-speech information to pro-
pose synonyms for the content words in the queries.
Statistical information, obtained from a corpus, is
then used to rank the paraphrases. We evaluated
our mechanism using 404 queries whose answers
reside in the LA Times subset of the TREC-9 cor-
pus. There was a 14% improvement in perfor-
mance when paraphrases were used for document
retrieval.
