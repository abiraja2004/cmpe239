Open-class semantic lexicon induction is of
great interest for current knowledge harvest-
ing algorithms. We propose a general frame-
work that uses patterns in bootstrapping fash-
ion to learn open-class semantic lexicons for
different kinds of relations. These patterns re-
quire seeds. To estimate the goodness (the po-
tential yield) of new seeds, we introduce a re-
gression model that considers the connectiv-
ity behavior of the seed during bootstrapping.
The generalized regression model is evaluated
on six different kinds of relations with over
10000 different seeds for English and Span-
ish patterns. Our approach reaches robust per-
formance of 90% correlation coefficient with
15% error rate for any of the patterns when
predicting the goodness of seeds.
