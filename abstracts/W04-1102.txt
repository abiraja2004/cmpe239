 
Chinese abbreviations are widely used in 
the modern Chinese texts. They are a 
special form of unknown words, including 
many named entities. This results in 
difficulty for correct Chinese processing. 
In this study, the Chinese abbreviation 
problem is regarded as an error recovery 
problem in which the suspect root words 
are the ?errors? to be recovered from a set 
of candidates. Such a problem is mapped
to an HMM-based generation model for 
both abbreviation identification and root
word recovery, and is integrated as part of
a unified word segmentation model when 
the input extends to a complete sentence. 
Two major experiments are conducted to 
test the abbreviation models. In the first 
experiment, an attempt is made to guess 
the abbreviations of the root words. An 
accuracy rate of 72% is observed. In 
contrast, a second experiment is 
conducted to guess the root words from 
abbreviations. Some submodels could 
achieve as high as 51% accuracy with the 
simple HMM-based model. Some 
quantitative observations against heuristic 
abbreviation knowledge about Chinese 
are also observed.
