The joint probability model proposed by
Marcu and Wong (2002) provides a strong
probabilistic framework for phrase-based
statistical machine translation (SMT). The
model?s usefulness is, however, limited by
the computational complexity of estimat-
ing parameters at the phrase level. We
present the first model to use word align-
ments for constraining the space of phrasal
alignments searched during Expectation
Maximization (EM) training. Constrain-
ing the joint model improves performance,
showing results that are very close to state-
of-the-art phrase-based models. It also al-
lows it to scale up to larger corpora and
therefore be more widely applicable.
