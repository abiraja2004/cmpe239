NERSSEAL-2008. Building a statistical 
based Named entity Recognition (NER) 
system requires huge data set. A rule based 
system needs linguistic analysis to formu-
late rules. Enriching the language specific 
rules can give better results than the statis-
tical methods of named entity recognition.  
A Hybrid model proved to be better in 
identifying Named Entities (NE) in Indian 
Language where the task of identifying 
named entities is far more complicated 
compared to English because of variation 
in the lexical and grammatical features of 
Indian languages.
