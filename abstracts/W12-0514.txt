Prepositions are hard to translate, because
their meaning is often vague, and the choice
of the correct preposition is often arbitrary.
At the same time, making the correct choice
is often critical to the coherence of the out-
put text. In the context of statistical ma-
chine translation, this difficulty is enhanced
due to the possible long distance between
the preposition and the head it modifies, as
opposed to the local nature of standard lan-
guage models. In this work we use mono-
lingual language resources to determine the
set of prepositions that are most likely to
occur with each verb. We use this informa-
tion in a transfer-based Arabic-to-Hebrew
statistical machine translation system. We
show that incorporating linguistic knowl-
edge on the distribution of prepositions sig-
nificantly improves the translation quality.
