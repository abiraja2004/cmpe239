 
This paper presents the results of an experiment 
usiug machine-readable dictionaries (Mill)s) and 
corpora for building concatenativc units for text 
to speech (T'PS) systems. Theoretical questions 
concerning the nature of t)honemic data in dic- 
tionaries are raised; phonemic dictionary data is 
viewed as a representative corpus over which to 
extract n- gram phonemic frequencies in the lan- 
guage. Dictionary data are compared to corpus 
data, and phoneme inventories arc evaluated for 
coverage. A methodology is defined to compute 
I)honemic n-grams for incorporation into a TTS 
system.
