This paper presents a two-stage approach to
summarizing multiple contrastive viewpoints
in opinionated text. In the first stage, we
use an unsupervised probabilistic approach to
model and extract multiple viewpoints in text.
We experiment with a variety of lexical and
syntactic features, yielding significant perfor-
mance gains over bag-of-words feature sets.
In the second stage, we introduce Compara-
tive LexRank, a novel random walk formula-
tion to score sentences and pairs of sentences
from opposite viewpoints based on both their
representativeness of the collection as well as
their contrastiveness with each other. Exper-
imental results show that the proposed ap-
proach can generate informative summaries of
viewpoints in opinionated text.
