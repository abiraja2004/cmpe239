This paper describes Acorn, a sentence planner and
surface realizer for dialogue systems. Improve-
ments to previous stochastic word-forest based ap-
proaches are described, countering recent criticism
of this class of algorithms for their slow speed.
An evaluation of the approach with semantic in-
put shows runtimes of a fraction of a second and
presents results that suggest it is also portable
across domains.
