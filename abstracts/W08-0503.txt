Experiments in natural language processing
and machine learning typically involve run-
ning a complicated network of programs to
create, process, and evaluate data. Re-
searchers often write one or more UNIX shell
scripts to ?glue? together these various pieces,
but such scripts are suboptimal for several rea-
sons. Without significant additional work, a
script does not handle recovering from fail-
ures, it requires keeping track of complicated
filenames, and it does not support running pro-
cesses in parallel. In this paper, we present
zymake as a solution to all these problems.
zymake scripts look like shell scripts, but
have semantics similar to makefiles. Using
zymake improves repeatability and scalabil-
ity of running experiments, and provides a
clean, simple interface for assembling compo-
nents. A zymake script also serves as doc-
umentation for the complete workflow. We
present a zymake script for a published set
of NLP experiments, and demonstrate that it
is superior to alternative solutions, including
shell scripts and makefiles, while being far
simpler to use than scientific grid computing
systems.
