This paper describes an exponential family
model of word sense which captures both
occurrences and co-occurrences of words
and senses in a joint probability distribution.
This statistical framework lends itself to the
task of word sense disambiguation. We eval-
uate the performance of the model in its par-
ticipation on the SemEval-2007 coarse- and
fine-grained all-words tasks under a variety
of parameters.
