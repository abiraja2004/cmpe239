We argue in favor of the the use of la-
beled directed graph to represent various
types of linguistic structures, and illustrate
how this allows one to view NLP tasks as
graph transformations. We present a gen-
eral method for learning such transforma-
tions from an annotated corpus and de-
scribe experiments with two applications
of the method: identification of non-local
depenencies (using Penn Treebank data)
and semantic role labeling (using Propo-
sition Bank data).
