 
In this paper, we argue for the need to dis- 
tinguish between task and dialogue initiatives, 
and present a model for tracking shifts in both 
types of initiatives in dialogue interactions. 
Our model predicts the initiative holders in the 
next dialogue turn based on the current initia- 
tive holders and the effect that observed cues 
have on changing them. Our evaluation across 
various corpora shows that he use of cues con- 
sistently improves the accuracy in the system' s 
prediction of task and dialogue initiative hold- 
ers by 2-4 and 8-13 percentage points, respec- 
tively, thus illustrating the generality of our 
model.
