In this paper, we describe our system submit-
ted for the semantic textual similarity (STS)
task at SemEval 2012. We implemented two
approaches to calculate the degree of simi-
larity between two sentences. First approach
combines corpus-based semantic relatedness
measure over the whole sentence with the
knowledge-based semantic similarity scores
obtained for the words falling under the same
syntactic roles in both the sentences. We fed
all these scores as features to machine learn-
ing models to obtain a single score giving the
degree of similarity of the sentences. Lin-
ear Regression and Bagging models were used
for this purpose. We used Explicit Semantic
Analysis (ESA) as the corpus-based seman-
tic relatedness measure. For the knowledge-
based semantic similarity between words, a
modified WordNet based Lin measure was
used. Second approach uses a bipartite based
method over the WordNet based Lin measure,
without any modification. This paper shows
a significant improvement in calculating the
semantic similarity between sentences by the
fusion of the knowledge-based similarity mea-
sure and the corpus-based relatedness measure
against corpus based measure taken alone.
