We describe the WHY2-ATLAS intelligent
tutoring system for qualitative physics that
interacts with students via natural lan-
guage dialogue. We focus on the is-
sue of analyzing and responding to multi-
sentential explanations. We explore an ap-
proach that combines a statistical classi-
fier, multiple semantic parsers and a for-
mal reasoner for achieving a deeper under-
standing of these explanations in order to
provide appropriate feedback on them.
