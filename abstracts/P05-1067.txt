 
Syntax-based statistical machine transla-
tion (MT) aims at applying statistical 
models to structured data. In this paper, 
we present a syntax-based statistical ma-
chine translation system based on a prob-
abilistic synchronous dependency 
insertion grammar. Synchronous depend-
ency insertion grammars are a version of 
synchronous grammars defined on de-
pendency trees. We first introduce our 
approach to inducing such a grammar 
from parallel corpora. Second, we de-
scribe the graphical model for the ma-
chine translation task, which can also be 
viewed as a stochastic tree-to-tree trans-
ducer. We introduce a polynomial time 
decoding algorithm for the model. We 
evaluate the outputs of our MT system us-
ing the NIST and Bleu automatic MT 
evaluation software. The result shows that 
our system outperforms the baseline sys-
tem based on the IBM models in both 
translation speed and quality.
