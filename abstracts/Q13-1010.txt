In this paper, we present the first incremental
parser for Tree Substitution Grammar (TSG).
A TSG allows arbitrarily large syntactic frag-
ments to be combined into complete trees;
we show how constraints (including lexical-
ization) can be imposed on the shape of the
TSG fragments to enable incremental process-
ing. We propose an efficient Earley-based al-
gorithm for incremental TSG parsing and re-
port an F-score competitive with other incre-
mental parsers. In addition to whole-sentence
F-score, we also evaluate the partial trees that
the parser constructs for sentence prefixes;
partial trees play an important role in incre-
mental interpretation, language modeling, and
psycholinguistics. Unlike existing parsers, our
incremental TSG parser can generate partial
trees that include predictions about the up-
coming words in a sentence. We show that
it outperforms an n-gram model in predicting
more than one upcoming word.
