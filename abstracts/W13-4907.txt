The inclusion of morphological features pro-
vides very useful information that helps to en-
hance the results when parsing morphologi-
cally rich languages. MaltOptimizer is a tool,
that given a data set, searches for the opti-
mal parameters, parsing algorithm and opti-
mal feature set achieving the best results that
it can find for parsers trained with MaltParser.
In this paper, we present an extension of Mal-
tOptimizer that explores, one by one and in
combination, the features that are geared to-
wards morphology. From our experiments
in the context of the Shared Task on Parsing
Morphologically Rich Languages, we extract
an in-depth study that shows which features
are actually useful for transition-based pars-
ing and we provide competitive results, in a
fast and simple way.
