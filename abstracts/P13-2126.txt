We present results from our study of which
uses syntactically and semantically moti-
vated information to group segments of
sentences into unbreakable units for the
purpose of typesetting those sentences in
a region of a fixed width, using an other-
wise standard dynamic programming line
breaking algorithm, to minimize ragged-
ness. In addition to a rule-based base-
line segmenter, we use a very modest size
text, manually annotated with positions of
breaks, to train a maximum entropy clas-
sifier, relying on an extensive set of lexi-
cal and syntactic features, which can then
predict whether or not to break after a cer-
tain word position in a sentence. We also
use a simple genetic algorithm to search
for a subset of the features optimizing F1,
to arrive at a set of features that deliv-
ers 89.2% Precision, 90.2% Recall (89.7%
F1) on a test set, improving the rule-based
baseline by about 11 points and the classi-
fier trained on all features by about 1 point
in F1.
