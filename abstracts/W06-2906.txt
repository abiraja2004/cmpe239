We demonstrate an original and success-
ful approach for both resolving and gen-
erating definite anaphora. We propose
and evaluate unsupervised models for ex-
tracting hypernym relations by mining co-
occurrence data of definite NPs and po-
tential antecedents in an unlabeled cor-
pus. The algorithm outperforms a stan-
dard WordNet-based approach to resolv-
ing and generating definite anaphora. It
also substantially outperforms recent re-
lated work using pattern-based extraction
of such hypernym relations for corefer-
ence resolution.
