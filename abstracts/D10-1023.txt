Automated essay scoring is one of the most
important educational applications of natural
language processing. Recently, researchers
have begun exploring methods of scoring es-
says with respect to particular dimensions of
quality such as coherence, technical errors,
and relevance to prompt, but there is rela-
tively little work on modeling organization.
We present a new annotated corpus and pro-
pose heuristic-based and learning-based ap-
proaches to scoring essays along the organi-
zation dimension, utilizing techniques that in-
volve sequence alignment, alignment kernels,
and string kernels.
