The volumes of digitized literary collec-
tions in various languages increase at a
rapid pace, which results also in a growing
demand for computational support to ana-
lyze such linguistic data. This paper com-
bines robust text analysis with advanced
visual analytics and brings a new set of
tools to literature analysis. Visual ana-
lytics techniques can offer new and unex-
pected insights and knowledge to the liter-
ary scholar. We analyzed a small subset of a
large literary collection, the Swedish Liter-
ature Bank, by focusing on the extraction of
persons? names, their gender and their nor-
malized, linked form, including mentions
of theistic beings (e.g., Gods? names and
mythological figures), and examined their
appearance over the course of the novel. A
case study based on 13 novels, from the
aforementioned collection, shows a number
of interesting applications of visual analyt-
ics methods to literature problems, where
named entities can play a prominent role,
demonstrating the advantage of visual liter-
ature analysis. Our work is inspired by the
notion of distant reading or macroanalysis
for the analyses of large literature collec-
tions.
