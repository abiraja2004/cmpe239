In this paper, we introduce and compare
between two novel approaches, supervised
and unsupervised, for identifying the key-
words to be used in extractive summa-
rization of text documents. Both our ap-
proaches are based on the graph-based
syntactic representation of text and web
documents, which enhances the traditional
vector-space model by taking into account
some structural document features. In the
supervised approach, we train classifica-
tion algorithms on a summarized collec-
tion of documents with the purpose of
inducing a keyword identification model.
In the unsupervised approach, we run the
HITS algorithm on document graphs under
the assumption that the top-ranked nodes
should represent the document keywords.
Our experiments on a collection of bench-
mark summaries show that given a set of
summarized training documents, the su-
pervised classification provides the highest
keyword identification accuracy, while the
highest F-measure is reached with a sim-
ple degree-based ranking. In addition, it is
sufficient to perform only the first iteration
of HITS rather than running it to its con-
vergence.
