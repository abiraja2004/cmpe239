An automatic generation of multiple-
choice questions is one of the promising
examples of educational applications of
NLP techniques. A machine learning ap-
proach seems to be useful for this pur-
pose because some of the processes can
be done by classification. Using basic ma-
chine learning algorithms as Naive Bayes
and K-Nearest Neighbors, we have devel-
oped a real-time system which generates
questions on English grammar and vocab-
ulary from on-line news articles. This pa-
per describes the current version of our
system and discusses some of the issues
on constructing this kind of system.
