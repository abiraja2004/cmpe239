NLP methods and applications need to take
account not only of ?classical? lexical rela-
tions, as found in WordNet, but the less-
structural, more context-dependent ?non-
classical? relations that readers intuit in text.
In a reader-based study of lexical relations in
text, most were found to be of the latter type.
The relationships themselves are analyzed,
and consequences for NLP are discussed.
