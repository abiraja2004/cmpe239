This paper describes the English?Hindi Multilingual
lexical sample task in SENSEVAL?3. Rather than
tagging an English word with a sense from an En-
glish dictionary, this task seeks to assign the most
appropriate Hindi translation to an ambiguous tar-
get word. Training data was solicited via the Open
Mind Word Expert (OMWE) from Web users who
are fluent in English and Hindi.
