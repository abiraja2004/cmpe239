For SENSEVAL-2, we disambiguated the lexical
sample using two different sense inventories.
Official SENSEVAL-2 results were generated
using WordNet, and separately using the New
Oxford Dictionary of English (NODE). Since
our initial submission, we have implemented
additional routines and have now examined the
differences in the features used for making sense
selections. We report here the contribution of
default sense selection, idiomatic usage, syntactic
and semantic clues, subcategorization patterns,
word forms, syntactic usage, context, selectional
preferences, and topics or subject fields. We also
compare the differences between WordNet and
NODE. Finally, we compare these features to
those identified as significant in supervised
learning approaches.
