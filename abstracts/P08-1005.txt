Linguistically  annotated treebanks play an 
essential part in the modern computational 
linguistics.  The  more  complex  the  tree-
banks become, the more sophisticated tools 
are  required  for  using  them,  namely  for 
searching in the data.  We study linguistic 
phenomena annotated in the Prague Depen-
dency Treebank 2.0 and create a list of re-
quirements  these  phenomena  set  on  a 
search  tool,  especially  on  its  query  lan-
guage.
