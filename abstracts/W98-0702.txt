 
In this paper, I demonstrate that verbs can be dis- 
ambiguated according to aspect by rules that exam? 
hue the WordNet category of the direct object. First, 
when evaluated over a corpus of medical reports, I 
show that WordNet categories correlate with aspec- 
tual class. Then, I develop a rule for distinguishing 
between stative and event occurrences of have by the 
WordNet category of the direct object. This rule, 
which is motivated by both linguistic and statisti- 
cal analysis, is evaluated over an unrestricted set of 
nouns. I also show that WordNet categories improve 
a system that performs aspectual classification with 
linguistically-based numerical indicators.
