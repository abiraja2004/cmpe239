Transition-based dependency parsers are
often forced to make attachment deci-
sions at a point when only partial infor-
mation about the relevant graph configu-
ration is available. In this paper, we de-
scribe a model that takes into account com-
plete structures as they become available
to rescore the elements of a beam, com-
bining the advantages of transition-based
and graph-based approaches. We also pro-
pose an efficient implementation that al-
lows for the use of sophisticated features
and show that the completion model leads
to a substantial increase in accuracy. We
apply the new transition-based parser on ty-
pologically different languages such as En-
glish, Chinese, Czech, and German and re-
port competitive labeled and unlabeled at-
tachment scores.
