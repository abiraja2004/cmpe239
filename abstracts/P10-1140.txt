Music Recommendation Systems often
recommend individual songs, as opposed
to entire albums. The challenge is to gen-
erate reviews for each song, since only full
album reviews are available on-line. We
developed a summarizer that combines in-
formation extraction and generation tech-
niques to produce summaries of reviews of
individual songs. We present an intrinsic
evaluation of the extraction components,
and of the informativeness of the sum-
maries; and a user study of the impact of
the song review summaries on users? de-
cision making processes. Users were able
to make quicker and more informed deci-
sions when presented with the summary as
compared to the full album review.
