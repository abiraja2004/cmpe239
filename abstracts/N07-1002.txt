The immense prosodic variation of natural con-
versational speech makes it challenging to pre-
dict which words are prosodically prominent in
this genre. In this paper, we examine a new fea-
ture, accent ratio, which captures how likely it is
that a word will be realized as prominent or not.
We compare this feature with traditional accent-
prediction features (based on part of speech and
N -grams) as well as with several linguistically mo-
tivated and manually labeled information structure
features, such as whether a word is given, new, or
contrastive. Our results show that the linguistic fea-
tures do not lead to significant improvements, while
accent ratio alone can yield prediction performance
almost as good as the combination of any other sub-
set of features. Moreover, this feature is useful even
across genres; an accent-ratio classifier trained only
on conversational speech predicts prominence with
high accuracy in broadcast news. Our results sug-
gest that carefully chosen lexicalized features can
outperform less fine-grained features.
