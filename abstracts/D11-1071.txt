In this paper, we present a new ranking
scheme, collaborative ranking (CR). In con-
trast to traditional non-collaborative ranking
scheme which solely relies on the strengths
of isolated queries and one stand-alone rank-
ing algorithm, the new scheme integrates the
strengths from multiple collaborators of a
query and the strengths from multiple ranking
algorithms. We elaborate three specific forms
of collaborative ranking, namely, micro col-
laborative ranking (MiCR), macro collabora-
tive ranking (MaCR) and micro-macro collab-
orative ranking (MiMaCR). Experiments on
entity linking task show that our proposed
scheme is indeed effective and promising.
