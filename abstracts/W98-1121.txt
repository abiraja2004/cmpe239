 
Language models for speech recognition concen- 
Irate solely on recognizing the words that were spo- 
ken. In this paper, we advocate redefining the 
speech recognition problem so that its goal is to find 
both the best sequence of words and their POS tags, 
and thus incorporate POS tagging. The use of POS 
tags allows more sophisticated generalizations than 
are afforded by using a class-based approach. Fur- 
thermore, if we want to incorporate speech repair 
and intonational phrase modeling into the language 
model, using POS tags rather than classes gives bet- 
ter performance in this task.
