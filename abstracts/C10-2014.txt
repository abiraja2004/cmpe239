 
As unlexicalized parsing lacks word to-
ken information, it is important to inves-
tigate novel parsing features to improve 
the accuracy. This paper studies a set of 
tree topological (TT) features. They 
quantitatively describe the tree shape 
dominated by each non-terminal node. 
The features are useful in capturing lin-
guistic notions such as grammatical 
weight and syntactic branching, which 
are factors important to syntactic proc-
essing but overlooked in the parsing lit-
erature. By using an ensemble classifier-
based model, TT features can signifi-
cantly improve the parsing accuracy of 
our unlexicalized parser. Further, the 
ease of estimating TT feature values 
makes them easy to be incorporated into 
virtually any mainstream parsers.
