Finding allowable places in words to insert
hyphens is an important practical prob-
lem. The algorithm that is used most of-
ten nowadays has remained essentially un-
changed for 25 years. This method is the
TEX hyphenation algorithm of Knuth and
Liang. We present here a hyphenation
method that is clearly more accurate. The
new method is an application of condi-
tional random fields. We create new train-
ing sets for English and Dutch from the
CELEX European lexical resource, and
achieve error rates for English of less than
0.1% for correctly allowed hyphens, and
less than 0.01% for Dutch. Experiments
show that both the Knuth/Liang method
and a leading current commercial alterna-
tive have error rates several times higher
for both languages.
