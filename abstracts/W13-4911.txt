In this paper we use statistical dependency
parsing techniques to detect NULL or Empty
categories in the Hindi sentences. We have
currently worked on Hindi dependency tree-
bank which is released as part of COLING-
MTPIL 2012 Workshop. Earlier Rule based
approaches are employed to detect Empty
heads for Hindi language but statistical learn-
ing for automatic prediction is not explored.
In this approach we used a technique of in-
troducing complex labels into the data to pre-
dict Empty categories in sentences. We have
also discussed about shortcomings and diffi-
culties in this approach and evaluated the per-
formance of this approach on different Empty
categories.
