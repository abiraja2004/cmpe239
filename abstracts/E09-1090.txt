This paper presents a chunking-based dis-
criminative approach to full parsing. We
convert the task of full parsing into a series
of chunking tasks and apply a conditional
random field (CRF) model to each level
of chunking. The probability of an en-
tire parse tree is computed as the product
of the probabilities of individual chunk-
ing results. The parsing is performed in a
bottom-up manner and the best derivation
is efficiently obtained by using a depth-
first search algorithm. Experimental re-
sults demonstrate that this simple parsing
framework produces a fast and reasonably
accurate parser.
