 
Any large language processing software 
relies in its operation on heuristic decisions 
concerning the strategy of processing. 
These decisions are usually "hard-wired" 
into the software in the form of hand- 
crafted heuristic rules, independent of the 
nature of the processed texts. We propose 
an alternative, adaptive approach in which 
machine learning techniques learn the rules 
from examples of sentences in each class. 
We have experimented with a variety of 
learning techniques on a representative in-
stance of this problem within the realm of 
parsing. Our approach lead to the discovery 
of new heuristics that perform significantly 
better than the current hand-crafted heuris- 
tic. We discuss the entire cycle of applica- 
tion of machine learning and suggest a 
methodology for the use of machine learn- 
ing as a technique for the adaptive optimi- 
sation of language-processing software.
