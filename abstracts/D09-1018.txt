This work investigates design choices in
modeling a discourse scheme for im-
proving opinion polarity classification.
For this, two diverse global inference
paradigms are used: a supervised collec-
tive classification framework and an un-
supervised optimization framework. Both
approaches perform substantially better
than baseline approaches, establishing the
efficacy of the methods and the underlying
discourse scheme. We also present quan-
titative and qualitative analyses showing
how the improvements are achieved.
