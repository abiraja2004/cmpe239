We examine a number of objective, au-
tomatically computable TURN-YIELDING
CUES ? distinct prosodic, acoustic and
syntactic events in a speaker?s speech that
tend to precede a smooth turn exchange ?
in the Columbia Games Corpus, a large
corpus of task-oriented dialogues. We
show that the likelihood of occurrence of
a turn-taking attempt from the interlocu-
tor increases linearly with the number of
cues conjointly displayed by the speaker.
Our results are important for improving
the coordination of speaking turns in in-
teractive voice-response systems, so that
systems can correctly estimate when the
user is willing to yield the conversational
floor, and so that they can produce their
own turn-yielding cues appropriately.
