Phrase reordering is of great importance 
for statistical machine translation. Ac-
cording to the movement of phrase trans-
lation, the pattern of phrase reordering 
can be divided into three classes: mono-
tone, BTG (Bracket Transduction 
Grammar) and hierarchy. It is a good 
way to use different styles of reordering 
models to reorder different phrases ac-
cording to the characteristics of both the 
reordering models and phrases itself.  In 
this paper a novel reordering model 
based on multi-layer phrase (PRML) is 
proposed, where the source sentence is 
segmented into different layers of phras-
es on which different reordering models 
are applied to get the final translation.  
This model has some advantages: differ-
ent styles of phrase reordering models 
are easily incorporated together; when a 
complicated reordering model is em-
ployed, it can be limited in a smaller 
scope and replaced with an easier reor-
dering model in larger scope. So this 
model better trade-offs the translation 
speed and performance simultaneously.
