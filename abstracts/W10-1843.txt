 
We present a syntactic annotation scheme for 
spoken French that is currently used in the 
Rhapsodie project. This annotation is depend-
ency-based and includes coordination and dis-
fluency as analogously encoded types of para-
digmatic phenomena. Furthermore, we attempt 
a thorough definition of the discourse units re-
quired by the systematic annotation of other 
phenomena beyond usual sentence boundaries, 
which are typical for spoken language. This 
includes so called ?macrosyntactic? phenom-
ena such as dislocation, parataxis, insertions, 
grafts, and epexegesis.
