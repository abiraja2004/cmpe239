This paper  presents  an electronic  diction-
ary  of  Spanish  adverbial  frozen  expres-
sions. It focuses on their formal description
in view of natural language processing and
presents  an  experiment  on  the  automatic
application of this data to real texts using
finite-state techniques. The paper makes an
assessment  of  the  advantages  and
limitations  of  this  method  for  the
identification  of  these  multiword  units  in
texts.
