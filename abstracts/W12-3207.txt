Collocation is a well-known linguistic phe-
nomenon which has a long history of research
and use. In this study I employ collocation
segmentation to extract terms from the large
and complex ACL Anthology Reference Cor-
pus, and also briefly research and describe
the history of the ACL. The results of the
study show that until 1986, the most signifi-
cant terms were related to formal/rule based
methods. Starting in 1987, terms related to
statistical methods became more important.
For instance, language model, similarity mea-
sure, text classification. In 1990, the terms
Penn Treebank, Mutual Information , statis-
tical parsing, bilingual corpus, and depen-
dency tree became the most important, show-
ing that newly released language resources ap-
peared together with many new research areas
in computational linguistics. Although Penn
Treebank was a significant term only tem-
porarily in the early nineties, the corpus is still
used by researchers today. The most recent
significant terms are Bleu score and semantic
role labeling. While machine translation as a
term is significant throughout the ACL ARC
corpus, it is not significant for any particu-
lar time period. This shows that some terms
can be significant globally while remaining in-
significant at a local level.
