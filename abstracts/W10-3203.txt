 
This paper presents an automatic map-
ping method among large-scale hetero-
geneous language resources: Sejong 
Semantic Classes (SJSC) and KorLex. 
KorLex is a large-scale Korean Word-
Net, but  it lacks specific syntactic & 
semantic information. Sejong Electron-
ic Dictionary (SJD), of which semantic 
segmentation depends on SJSC, has 
much lower lexical coverage than 
KorLex, but shows refined syntactic & 
semantic information. The goal of this 
study is to build a rich language re-
source for improving Korean semanti-
co-syntactic parsing technology. There-
fore, we consider integration of them 
and propose automatic mapping me-
thod with three approaches: 1) Infor-
mation of Monosemy/Polysemy of 
Word senses (IMPW), 2) Instances be-
tween Nouns of SJD and Word senses 
of KorLex (INW), and 3) Semantically 
Related words between Nouns of SJD 
and Synsets of KorLex (SRNS). We 
obtain good performance using com-
bined three approaches: recall 0.837, 
precision 0.717, and F1 0.773.
