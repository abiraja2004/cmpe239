This paper present a new readability formula
for French as a foreign language (FFL), which
relies on 46 textual features representative of
the lexical, syntactic, and semantic levels as
well as some of the specificities of the FFL
context. We report comparisons between sev-
eral techniques for feature selection and var-
ious learning algorithms. Our best model,
based on support vector machines (SVM), sig-
nificantly outperforms previous FFL formulas.
We also found that semantic features behave
poorly in our case, in contrast with some pre-
vious readability studies on English as a first
language.
