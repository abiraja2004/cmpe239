This paper describes a method for automati-
cally extracting and classifying multiword ex-
pressions (MWEs) for Urdu on the basis of a
relatively small unannotated corpus (around
8.12 million tokens). The MWEs are extracted
by an unsupervised method and classified into
two distinct classes, namely locations and per-
son names. The classification is based on sim-
ple heuristics that take the co-occurrence of
MWEs with distinct postpositions into account.
The resulting classes are evaluated against a
hand-annotated gold standard and achieve an
f-score of 0.5 and 0.746 for locations and
persons, respectively. A target application is
the Urdu ParGram grammar, where MWEs are
needed to generate a more precise syntactic
and semantic analysis.
