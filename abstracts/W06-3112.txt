 
In this paper we present a novel method 
for deriving paraphrases during automatic 
MT evaluation using only the source and 
reference texts, which are necessary for 
the evaluation, and word and phrase 
alignment software. Using target language 
paraphrases produced through word and 
phrase alignment a number of alternative 
reference sentences are constructed auto-
matically for each candidate translation. 
The method produces lexical and low-
level syntactic paraphrases that are rele-
vant to the domain in hand, does not use 
external knowledge resources, and can be 
combined with a variety of automatic MT 
evaluation system.
