 
This paper mainly describes a Chinese 
named entity recognition (NER) system 
NER@ISCAS, which integrates text, 
part-of-speech and a small-vocabulary-
character-lists feature for MSRA NER 
open track under the framework of Con-
ditional Random Fields (CRFs) model. 
The techniques used for the close NER 
and word segmentation tracks are also 
presented.
