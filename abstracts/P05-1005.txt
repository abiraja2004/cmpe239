Word Sense Disambiguation suffers from
a long-standing problem of knowledge ac-
quisition bottleneck. Although state of the
art supervised systems report good accu-
racies for selected words, they have not
been shown to be promising in terms of
scalability. In this paper, we present an ap-
proach for learning coarser and more gen-
eral set of concepts from a sense tagged
corpus, in order to alleviate the knowl-
edge acquisition bottleneck. We show that
these general concepts can be transformed
to fine grained word senses using simple
heuristics, and applying the technique for
recent SENSEVAL data sets shows that our
approach can yield state of the art perfor-
mance.
