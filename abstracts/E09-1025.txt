In this paper, we explore ways of improv-
ing an inference rule collection and its ap-
plication to the task of recognizing textual
entailment. For this purpose, we start with
an automatically acquired collection and
we propose methods to refine it and ob-
tain more rules using a hand-crafted lex-
ical resource. Following this, we derive
a dependency-based structure representa-
tion from texts, which aims to provide a
proper base for the inference rule appli-
cation. The evaluation of our approach
on the recognizing textual entailment data
shows promising results on precision and
the error analysis suggests possible im-
provements.
