This paper explores the large-scale acquisition of
sense-tagged examples for Word Sense Disam-
biguation (WSD). We have applied the ?WordNet
monosemous relatives? method to construct auto-
matically a web corpus that we have used to train
disambiguation systems. The corpus-building pro-
cess has highlighted important factors, such as the
distribution of senses (bias). The corpus has been
used to train WSD algorithms that include super-
vised methods (combining automatic and manually-
tagged examples), minimally supervised (requiring
sense bias information from hand-tagged corpora),
and fully unsupervised. These methods were tested
on the Senseval-2 lexical sample test set, and com-
pared successfully to other systems with minimum
or no supervision.
