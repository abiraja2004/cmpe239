Several incompatible syntactic annotation
schemes are currently used by parsers and
corpora in biomedical information extrac-
tion. The recently introduced Stanford de-
pendency scheme has been suggested to be
a suitable unifying syntax formalism. In this
paper, we present a step towards such uni-
fication by creating a conversion from the
Link Grammar to the Stanford scheme. Fur-
ther, we create a version of the BioInfer cor-
pus with syntactic annotation in this scheme.
We present an application-oriented evalua-
tion of the transformation and assess the
suitability of the scheme and our conversion
to the unification of the syntactic annotations
of BioInfer and the GENIA Treebank.
We find that a highly reliable conversion is
both feasible to create and practical, increas-
ing the applicability of both the parser and
the corpus to information extraction.
