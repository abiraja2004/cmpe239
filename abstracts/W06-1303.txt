In this paper, we describe methods for
building and evaluation of limited do-
main question-answering characters. Sev-
eral classification techniques are tested, in-
cluding text classification using support
vector machines, language-model based
retrieval, and cross-language information
retrieval techniques, with the latter having
the highest success rate. We also evalu-
ated the effect of speech recognition errors
on performance with users, finding that re-
trieval is robust until recognition reaches
over 50% WER.
