We present an evaluation framework for
plagiarism detection.1 The framework
provides performance measures that ad-
dress the specifics of plagiarism detec-
tion, and the PAN-PC-10 corpus, which
contains 64 558 artificial and 4 000 sim-
ulated plagiarism cases, the latter gener-
ated via Amazon?s Mechanical Turk. We
discuss the construction principles behind
the measures and the corpus, and we com-
pare the quality of our corpus to exist-
ing corpora. Our analysis gives empirical
evidence that the construction of tailored
training corpora for plagiarism detection
can be automated, and hence be done on a
large scale.
