Efficiently incorporating entity-level in-
formation is a challenge for coreference
resolution systems due to the difficulty of
exact inference over partitions. We de-
scribe an end-to-end discriminative prob-
abilistic model for coreference that, along
with standard pairwise features, enforces
structural agreement constraints between
specified properties of coreferent men-
tions. This model can be represented as
a factor graph for each document that ad-
mits efficient inference via belief propaga-
tion. We show that our method can use
entity-level information to outperform a
basic pairwise system.
