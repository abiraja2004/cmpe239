In this paper we present a semantic archi-
tecture that was employed for processing
two different SemEval 2007 tasks: Task
4 (Classification of Semantic Relations be-
tween Nominals) and Task 8 (Metonymy
Resolution). The architecture uses multi-
ple forms of syntactic, lexical, and semantic
information to inform a classification-based
approach that generates a different model for
each machine learning algorithm that imple-
ments the classification. We used decision
trees, decision rules, logistic regression and
lazy classifiers. A voting module selects the
best performing module for each task evalu-
ated in SemEval 2007. The paper details the
results obtained when using the semantic ar-
chitecture.
