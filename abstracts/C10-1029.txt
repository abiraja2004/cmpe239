This paper investigates the impact of us-
ing different temporal algebras for learn-
ing temporal relations between events.
Specifically, we compare three interval-
based algebras: Allen (1983) algebra,
Bruce (1972) algebra, and the algebra de-
rived from the TempEval-07 campaign.
These algebras encode different granular-
ities of relations and have different infer-
ential properties. They in turn behave dif-
ferently when used to enforce global con-
sistency constraints on the building of a
temporal representation. Through various
experiments on the TimeBank/AQUAINT
corpus, we show that although the TempE-
val relation set leads to the best classifica-
tion accuracy performance, it is too vague
to be used for enforcing consistency. By
contrast, the other two relation sets are
similarly harder to learn, but more use-
ful when global consistency is important.
Overall, the Bruce algebra is shown to
give the best compromise between learn-
ability and expressive power.
