 
In this paper, we concentrate on the 3 of 
the tracks proposed in the NTCIR 8 
MOAT, concerning the classification of 
sentences according to their 
opinionatedness, relevance and polarity. 
We propose a method for the detection of 
opinions, relevance, and polarity 
classification, based on ISR-WN (a 
resource for the multidimensional analysis 
with Relevant Semantic Trees of sentences 
using different WordNet-based information 
sources). Based on the results obtained, we 
can conclude that the resource and methods 
we propose are appropriate for the task, 
reaching the level of state-of-the-art 
approaches.
