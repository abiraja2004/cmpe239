In this paper, a variant of a spectral clus-
tering algorithm is proposed for bilingual
word clustering. The proposed algorithm
generates the two sets of clusters for both
languages efficiently with high seman-
tic correlation within monolingual clus-
ters, and high translation quality across
the clusters between two languages. Each
cluster level translation is considered as
a bilingual concept, which generalizes
words in bilingual clusters. This scheme
improves the robustness for statistical ma-
chine translation models. Two HMM-
based translation models are tested to use
these bilingual clusters. Improved per-
plexity, word alignment accuracy, and
translation quality are observed in our ex-
periments.
