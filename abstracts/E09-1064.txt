Lexical-semantic resources are used ex-
tensively for applied semantic inference,
yet a clear quantitative picture of their
current utility and limitations is largely
missing. We propose system- and
application-independent evaluation and
analysis methodologies for resources? per-
formance, and systematically apply them
to seven prominent resources. Our find-
ings identify the currently limited recall of
available resources, and indicate the po-
tential to improve performance by exam-
ining non-standard relation types and by
distilling the output of distributional meth-
ods. Further, our results stress the need
to include auxiliary information regarding
the lexical and logical contexts in which
a lexical inference is valid, as well as its
prior validity likelihood.
