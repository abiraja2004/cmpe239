 
We explore the role of redundancy, both in 
anticipation of and in response to listener 
confusion, in task-oriented dialogue. We 
find that direction-givers provide redundant 
utterances in response to both verbal and 
non-verbal signals of listener confusion. 
We also examine the effects of prior ac-
quaintance and visibility upon redundancy. 
As expected, givers use more redundant ut-
terances overall, and more redundant utter-
ances in response to listener questions, 
when communicating with strangers. We 
discuss our findings in relation to theories 
of redundancy, the balance of speaker and 
listener effort, and potential applications.
