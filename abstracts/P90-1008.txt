 
A compositional semantics for focusing subjuncts-- 
words such as only, even, and also--is developed 
from Rooth's theory of association with focus. By 
adapting the theory so that it can be expressed in 
terms of a frame-based semantic formalism, a seman- 
tics that is more computationally practical is arrived 
at. This semantics captures pragmatic subtleties by 
incorporating a two-part representation, and recog- 
nizes the contribution of intonation to meaning.
