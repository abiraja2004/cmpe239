However large a hand-crafted wide-
coverage grammar is, there are always go-
ing to be words and constructions that
are not included in it and are going to
cause parse failure. Due to their hetero-
geneous and flexible nature, Multiword
Expressions (MWEs) provide an endless
source of parse failures. As the number
of such expressions in a speaker?s lexi-
con is equiparable to the number of single
word units (Jackendoff, 1997), one ma-
jor challenge for robust natural language
processing systems is to be able to deal
with MWEs. In this paper we propose
to semi-automatically detect MWE can-
didates in texts using some error mining
techniques and validating them using a
combination of the World Wide Web as a
corpus and some statistical measures. For
the remaining candidates possible lexico-
syntactic types are predicted, and they are
subsequently added to the grammar as new
lexical entries. This approach provides
a significant increase in the coverage of
these expressions.
