We consider the problem of answering com-
plex questions that require inferencing and
synthesizing information from multiple doc-
uments and can be seen as a kind of topic-
oriented, informative multi-document summa-
rization. The stochastic, graph-based method
for computing the relative importance of tex-
tual units (i.e. sentences) is very successful
in generic summarization. In this method,
a sentence is encoded as a vector in which
each component represents the occurrence fre-
quency (TF*IDF) of a word. However, the
major limitation of the TF*IDF approach is
that it only retains the frequency of the words
and does not take into account the sequence,
syntactic and semantic information. In this pa-
per, we study the impact of syntactic and shal-
low semantic information in the graph-based
method for answering complex questions.
