Korean Word Associations (KorWA) were 
collected to build a semantic network for the 
Korean language. A graphic representation 
approach of applying coefficients to complex 
networks allows us to discern the semantic 
structures within words. A semantic network 
of the KorWA was found to exhibit the scale-
free property in its degree distribution. The 
growth of the network around hub words was 
also confirmed through two experimental 
phases. As an issue for further research, we 
suggest that the present results may yield in-
sights for computational neurolinguistics, as a 
semantic network of word association norms 
can bridge the gap between information about 
lexical co-occurrences derived from a corpora 
and anatomical networks as a basis for map-
ping out neural activations.
