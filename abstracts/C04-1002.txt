We present a novel algorithm for Japanese dependency
analysis. The algorithm allows us to analyze dependency
structures of a sentence in linear-time while keeping a
state-of-the-art accuracy. In this paper, we show a formal
description of the algorithm and discuss it theoretically
with respect to time complexity. In addition, we eval-
uate its efficiency and performance empirically against
the Kyoto University Corpus. The proposed algorithm
with improved models for dependency yields the best ac-
curacy in the previously published results on the Kyoto
University Corpus.
