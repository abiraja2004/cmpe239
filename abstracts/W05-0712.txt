 
Translation of named entities (NEs), 
such as person names, organization names 
and location names is crucial for cross lin-
gual information retrieval, machine trans-
lation, and many other natural language 
processing applications. Newly named en-
tities are introduced on daily basis in 
newswire and this greatly complicates the 
translation task. Also, while some names 
can be translated, others must be transliter-
ated, and, still, others are mixed. In this 
paper we introduce an integrated approach 
for named entity translation deploying 
phrase-based translation, word-based trans-
lation, and transliteration modules into a 
single framework.  While Arabic based, 
the approach introduced here is a unified 
approach that can be applied to NE transla-
tion for any language pair.
