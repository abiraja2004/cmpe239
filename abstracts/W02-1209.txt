 
Ideograph characters are often formed by some 
smaller functional units, which we call character 
components. These character components can be 
ideograph radicals, ideographs proper, or some 
pure components which must be used with 
others to form characters. Decomposition of 
ideographs can be used in many applications. It 
is particularly important in the study of Chinese 
character formation, phonetics and semantics.  
However, the way a character is decomposed 
depends on the definition of components as well 
as the decomposition rules. The 12 Ideographic 
Description Characters (IDCs) introduced in ISO 
10646 are designed to describe characters using 
components. The Hong Kong SAR Government 
recently published two sets of glyph standards 
for ISO10646 characters. The standards, being 
the first of its kind, make use of character 
decomposition to specify a character glyph using 
its components. In this paper, we will first 
introduce the IDCs and how they can be used 
with components to describe two dimensional 
ideograph characters in a linear fashion. Next we 
will briefly discuss the basic references and 
character decomposition rules. We will then 
describe the data structure and algorithms to 
decompose Chinese characters into components 
and, vice versa. We have also implemented our 
database and algorithms as an internet 
application, called  the Chinese Character 
Search System, available at website 
http://www.iso10646hk.net/. With this tool, 
people can easily search characters and 
components in ISO 10646.
