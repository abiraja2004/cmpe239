This paper presents Domain Relevance Estima-
tion (DRE), a fully unsupervised text categorization
technique based on the statistical estimation of the
relevance of a text with respect to a certain cate-
gory. We use a pre-defined set of categories (we
call them domains) which have been previously as-
sociated to WORDNET word senses. Given a cer-
tain domain, DRE distinguishes between relevant
and non-relevant texts by means of a Gaussian Mix-
ture model that describes the frequency distribution
of domain words inside a large-scale corpus. Then,
an Expectation Maximization algorithm computes
the parameters that maximize the likelihood of the
model on the empirical data.
The correct identification of the domain of the
text is a crucial point for Domain Driven Dis-
ambiguation, an unsupervised Word Sense Disam-
biguation (WSD) methodology that makes use of
only domain information. Therefore, DRE has been
exploited and evaluated in the context of a WSD
task. Results are comparable to those of state-of-
the-art unsupervised WSD systems and show that
DRE provides an important contribution.
