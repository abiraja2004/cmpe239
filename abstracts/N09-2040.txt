 
Answer Validation is a topic of significant in-
terest within the Question Answering commu-
nity.  In this paper, we propose the use of 
language modeling methodologies for Answer 
Validation, using corpus-based methods that do 
not require the use of external sources.  Specifi-
cally, we propose a model for Answer Credibil-
ity which quantifies the reliability of a source 
document that contains a candidate answer and 
the Question?s Context Model.
