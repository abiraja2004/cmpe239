 
We describe MSR SPLAT, a toolkit for lan-
guage analysis that allows easy access to the 
linguistic analysis tools produced by the NLP 
group at Microsoft Research. The tools in-
clude both traditional linguistic analysis tools 
such as part-of-speech taggers, constituency 
and dependency parsers, and more recent de-
velopments such as sentiment detection and 
linguistically valid morphology. As we ex-
pand the tools we develop for our own re-
search, the set of tools available in MSR 
SPLAT will be extended. The toolkit is acces-
sible as a web service, which can be used 
from a broad set of programming languages.
