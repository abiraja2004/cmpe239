This research aims to automatically ex-
tract Know-Why from documents on the 
website to contribute knowledge sources 
to support the question-answering sys-
tem, especially What-Question, for dis-
ease treatment.  This paper is concerned 
about extracting Know-Why based on 
multiple EDUs (Elementary Discourse 
Units). There are two problems in ex-
tracting Know-Why: an identification 
problem and an effect boundary determi-
nation problem.  We propose using Na?ve 
Bayes with three verb features, a causa-
tive-verb-phrase concept set, a supporting 
causative verb set, and the effect-verb-
phrase concept set.  The Know-Why ex-
traction results show the success rate of 
85.5% precision and 79.8% recall.
