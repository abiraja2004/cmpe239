 
In this paper, we present an algorithm for ex-
tracting translations of any given multiword 
expression from parallel corpora. Given a 
multiword expression to be translated, the 
method involves extracting a short list of tar-
get candidate words from parallel corpora 
based on scores of normalized frequency, 
generating possible translations and filtering 
out common subsequences, and selecting the 
top-n possible translations using the Dice 
coefficient. Experiments show that our ap-
proach outperforms the word alignment-
based and other naive association-based me-
thods. We also demonstrate that adopting the 
extracted translations can significantly im-
prove the performance of the Moses machine 
translation system.
