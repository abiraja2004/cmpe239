In this paper we present a Markov Logic Net-
work for Semantic Role Labelling that jointly
performs predicate identification, frame dis-
ambiguation, argument identification and ar-
gument classification for all predicates in a
sentence. Empirically we find that our ap-
proach is competitive: our best model would
appear on par with the best entry in the
CoNLL 2008 shared task open track, and at
the 4th place of the closed track?right be-
hind the systems that use significantly better
parsers to generate their input features. More-
over, we observe that by fully capturing the
complete SRL pipeline in a single probabilis-
tic model we can achieve significant improve-
ments over more isolated systems, in particu-
lar for out-of-domain data. Finally, we show
that despite the joint approach, our system is
still efficient.
