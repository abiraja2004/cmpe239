 
We derive the rhetorical structures of texts 
by means of two new, surface-form-based 
algorithms: one that identifies discourse 
usages of cue phrases and breaks sen- 
tences into clauses, and one that produces 
valid rhetorical structure trees for unre- 
stricted natural language texts. The algo- 
rithms use information that was derived 
from a corpus analysis of cue phrases.
