The paper presents an approach to ellipsis
resolution in a framework of scope under-
specification (Underspecified Discourse
Representation Theory). It is argued that
the approach improves on previous pro-
posals to integrate ellipsis resolution and
scope underspecification (Crouch, 1995;
Egg et al, 2001) in that application pro-
cesses like anaphora resolution do not re-
quire full disambiguation but can work
directly on the underspecified representa-
tion. Furthermore it is shown that the ap-
proach presented can cope with the exam-
ples discussed by Dalrymple et al (1991)
as well as a problem noted recently by
Erk and Koller (2001).
