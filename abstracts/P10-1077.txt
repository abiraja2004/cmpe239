Prior use of machine learning in genre
classification used a list of labels as clas-
sification categories. However, genre
classes are often organised into hierar-
chies, e.g., covering the subgenres of fic-
tion. In this paper we present a method
of using the hierarchy of labels to improve
the classification accuracy. As a testbed
for this approach we use the Brown Cor-
pus as well as a range of other corpora, in-
cluding the BNC, HGC and Syracuse. The
results are not encouraging: apart from the
Brown corpus, the improvements of our
structural classifier over the flat one are
not statistically significant. We discuss the
relation between structural learning per-
formance and the visual and distributional
balance of the label hierarchy, suggesting
that only balanced hierarchies might profit
from structural learning.
