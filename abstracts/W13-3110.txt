 
This paper describes the architecture of 
UAIC1?s Summarization system participating 
at MultiLing ? 2013. The architecture includes 
language independent text processing mod-
ules, but also modules that are adapted for one 
language or another. In our experiments, the 
languages under consideration are Bulgarian, 
German, Greek, English, and Romanian. Our 
method exploits the cohesion and coherence 
properties of texts to build discourse struc-
tures. The output of the parsing process is used 
to extract general summaries.
