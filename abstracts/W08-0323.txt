Our participation in the shared translation task
at WMT-08 focusses on news translation from
English to French. Our main goal is to con-
trast a baseline version of the phrase-based
MATRAX system, with a version that incor-
porates syntactic ?coupling? features in order
to discriminate translations produced by the
baseline system. We report results comparing
different feature combinations.
