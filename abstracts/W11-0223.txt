Word sense disambiguation (WSD) is an inter-
mediate task within information retrieval and
information extraction, attempting to select
the proper sense of ambiguous words. Due to
the scarcity of training data, semi-supervised
learning, which profits from seed annotated
examples and a large set of unlabeled data,
are worth researching. We present preliminary
results of two semi-supervised learning algo-
rithms on biomedical word sense disambigua-
tion. Both methods add relevant unlabeled ex-
amples to the training set, and optimal param-
eters are similar for each ambiguous word.
