One of the main obstacles to high-
performance Word Sense Disambigua-
tion (WSD) is the knowledge acquisi-
tion bottleneck. In this paper, we present
a methodology to automatically extend
WordNet with large amounts of seman-
tic relations from an encyclopedic re-
source, namely Wikipedia. We show
that, when provided with a vast amount
of high-quality semantic relations, sim-
ple knowledge-lean disambiguation algo-
rithms compete with state-of-the-art su-
pervisedWSD systems in a coarse-grained
all-words setting and outperform them on
gold-standard domain-specific datasets.
