Our aim is to acquire the attributes of con-
cepts denoted by unknown words from
users during dialogues. A word unknown
to spoken dialogue systems can appear in
user utterances, and systems should be ca-
pable of acquiring information on it from
the conversation partner as a kind of self-
learning process. As a first step, we pro-
pose a method for generating more spe-
cific questions than simple wh-questions
to acquire the attributes, as such ques-
tions can narrow down the variation of
the following user response and accord-
ingly avoid possible speech recognition er-
rors. Specifically, we obtain an appropri-
ately distributed confidence measure (CM)
on the attributes to generate more specific
questions. Two basic CMs are defined us-
ing (1) character and word distributions in
the target database and (2) frequency of
occurrence of restaurant attributes on Web
pages. These are integrated to comple-
ment each other and used as the final CM.
We evaluated distributions of the CMs by
average errors from the reference. Re-
sults showed that the integrated CM out-
performed the two basic CMs.
