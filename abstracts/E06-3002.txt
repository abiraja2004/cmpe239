Many verbal jokes, like garden path sen-
tences, pose difficulties to models of dis-
course since the initially primed interpre-
tation needs to be discarded and a new one
created based on subsequent statements.
The effect of the joke depends on the
fact that the second (correct) interpretation
was not visible earlier. Existing models
of discourse semantics in principle gen-
erate all interpretations of discourse frag-
ments and carry these until contradicted,
and thus the dissonance criteria in humour
cannot be met. Computationally, main-
taining all possible worlds in a discourse
is very inefficient, thus computing only the
maximum-likelihood interpretation seems
to be a more efficient choice on average.
In this work we outline a probabilistic
lexicon based lexical semantics approach
which seems to be a reasonable construct
for discourse in general and use some ex-
amples from humour to demonstrate its
working.
