We have developed a novel, publicly avail-
able annotation tool for the semantic en-
coding of texts, especially those in the
narrative domain. Users can create for-
mal propositions to represent spans of text,
as well as temporal relations and other
aspects of narrative. A built-in natural-
language generation component regener-
ates text from the formal structures, which
eases the annotation process. We have
run collection experiments with the tool
and shown that non-experts can easily cre-
ate semantic encodings of short fables.
We present this tool as a stand-alone, re-
usable resource for research in semantics
in which formal encoding of text, espe-
cially in a narrative form, is required.
