This paper defines a normal form for MCFGs
that includes strongly equivalent representa-
tions of many MG variants, and presents
an incremental priority-queue-based TD rec-
ognizer for these MCFGs. After introduc-
ing MGs with overt phrasal movement, head
movement and simple adjunction are added
without change in the recognizer. The MG
representation can be used directly, so that
even rather sophisticated analyses of properly
non-CF languages can be defined very suc-
cinctly. As with the similar stack-based CF-
methods, finite memory suffices for the recog-
nition of infinite languages, and a fully con-
nected left context for probabilistic analysis is
available at every point.
