I show that the semantic structure for dis-
courses, understood as a dependency represen-
tation, can be mathematically characterized as
DAGs, but these DAGs present heavy structural
constraints. The argumentation is based on a
simple case, i.e. discourses with three clauses
and two discourse connectives. I show that
only four types of DAGs are needed for these
discourses.
