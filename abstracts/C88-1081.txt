 
This paper describes a system for representing knowledge 
about conventional metaphors for use by natural language 
analysis, generation and acquisition systems. A system of 
hierarchically related structured associations i used. These 
associations are implemented as a part of the KODIAK 
representation language. Particular attention is paid in this 
paper to representational mechanisms that can capture general- 
izations over the system of conventional metaphors as a whole.
