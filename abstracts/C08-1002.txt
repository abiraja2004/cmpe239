VerbNet (VN) is a major large-scale En-
glish verb lexicon. Mapping verb instances
to their VN classes has been proven use-
ful for several NLP tasks. However, verbs
are polysemous with respect to their VN
classes. We introduce a novel supervised
learning model for mapping verb instances
to VN classes, using rich syntactic features
and class membership constraints. We
evaluate the algorithm in both in-domain
and corpus adaptation scenarios. In both
cases, we use the manually tagged Sem-
link WSJ corpus as training data. For in-
domain (testing on Semlink WSJ data), we
achieve 95.9% accuracy, 35.1% error re-
duction (ER) over a strong baseline. For
adaptation, we test on the GENIA corpus
and achieve 72.4% accuracy with 10.7%
ER. This is the first large-scale experimen-
tation with automatic algorithms for this
task.
