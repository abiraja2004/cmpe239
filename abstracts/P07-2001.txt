This paper describes MIMUS, a multimodal
and multilingual dialogue system for the in?
home scenario, which allows users to con-
trol some home devices by voice and/or
clicks. Its design relies on Wizard of Oz ex-
periments and is targeted at disabled users.
MIMUS follows the Information State Up-
date approach to dialogue management, and
supports English, German and Spanish, with
the possibility of changing language on?the?
fly. MIMUS includes a gestures?enabled
talking head which endows the system with
a human?like personality.
