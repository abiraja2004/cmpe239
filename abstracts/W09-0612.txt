Alignment of interlocutors is a well known
psycholinguistic phenomenon of great rel-
evance for dialogue systems in general and
natural language generation in particular.
In this paper, we present the alignment-
capable microplanner SPUD prime. Us-
ing a priming-based model of interactive
alignment, it is flexible enough to model
the alignment behaviour of human speak-
ers to a high degree. This will allow for
further investigation of which parameters
are important to model alignment and how
the human?computer interaction changes
when the computer aligns to its users.
