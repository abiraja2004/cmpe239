In human?computer interaction sys-
tems using natural language, the
recognition of the topic from user?s
utterances is an important task. We
examine two different perspectives
to the problem of topic analysis
needed for carrying out a success-
ful dialogue. First, we apply self-
organized document maps for mod-
eling the broader subject of dis-
course based on the occurrence of
content words in the dialogue con-
text. On a Finnish corpus of 57
dialogues the method is shown to
work well for recognizing subjects of
longer dialogue segments, whereas
for individual utterances the sub-
ject recognition history should per-
haps be taken into account. Sec-
ond, we attempt to identify topically
relevant words in the utterances
and thus locate the old information
(?topic words?) and new information
(?focus words?). For this we define a
probabilistic model and compare dif-
ferent methods for model parameter
estimation on a corpus of 189 dia-
logues. Moreover, the utilization of
information regarding the position
of the word in the utterance is found
to improve the results.
