We describe our contribution to the SemEval
task on Frame-Semantic Structure Extrac-
tion. Unlike most previous systems de-
scribed in literature, ours is based on depen-
dency syntax. We also describe a fully auto-
matic method to add words to the FrameNet
lexical database, which gives an improve-
ment in the recall of frame detection.
