This paper presents an exponential model
for translation into highly inflected languages
which can be scaled to very large datasets. As
in other recent proposals, it predicts target-
side phrases and can be conditioned on source-
side context. However, crucially for the task
of modeling morphological generalizations, it
estimates feature parameters from the entire
training set rather than as a collection of sepa-
rate classifiers. We apply it to English-Czech
translation, using a variety of features captur-
ing potential predictors for case, number, and
gender, and one of the largest publicly avail-
able parallel data sets. We also describe gen-
eration and modeling of inflected forms un-
observed in training data and decoding proce-
dures for a model with non-local target-side
feature dependencies.
