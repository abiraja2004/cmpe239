This paper presents the novel task of best
topic word selection, that is the selection
of the topic word that is the best label for
a given topic, as a means of enhancing the
interpretation and visualisation of topic
models. We propose a number of features
intended to capture the best topic word,
and show that, in combination as inputs to
a reranking model, we are able to consis-
tently achieve results above the baseline of
simply selecting the highest-ranked topic
word. This is the case both when training
in-domain over other labelled topics for
that topic model, and cross-domain, us-
ing only labellings from independent topic
models learned over document collections
from different domains and genres.
