We propose three enhancements to the tree-
to-string (TTS) transducer for machine trans-
lation: first-level expansion-based normaliza-
tion for TTS templates, a syntactic align-
ment framework integrating the insertion of
unaligned target words, and subtree-based n-
gram model addressing the tree decomposi-
tion probability. Empirical results show that
these methods improve the performance of a
TTS transducer based on the standard BLEU-
4 metric. We also experiment with semantic
labels in a TTS transducer, and achieve im-
provement over our baseline system.
