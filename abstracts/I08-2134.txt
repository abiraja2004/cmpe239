This paper exploits unlabeled text data
to improve new word identification and
Chinese word segmentation performance.
Our contributions are twofold. First,
for new words that lack semantic trans-
parency, such as person, location, or
transliteration names, we calculate as-
sociation metrics of adjacent character
segments on unlabeled data and encode
this information as features. Second, we
construct an internal dictionary by using
an initial model to extract words from
both the unlabeled training and test set
to maintain balanced coverage on the
training and test set. In comparison
to the baseline model which only uses
n-gram features, our approach increases
new word recall up to 6.0%. Addition-
ally, our approaches reduce segmenta-
tion errors up to 32.3%. Our system
achieves state-of-the-art performance for
both the closed and open tasks of the
2006 SIGHAN bakeoff.
