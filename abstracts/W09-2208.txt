We present a simple semi-supervised learning
algorithm for named entity recognition (NER)
using conditional random fields (CRFs). The
algorithm is based on exploiting evidence that
is independent from the features used for a
classifier, which provides high-precision la-
bels to unlabeled data. Such independent ev-
idence is used to automatically extract high-
accuracy and non-redundant data, leading to a
much improved classifier at the next iteration.
We show that our algorithm achieves an aver-
age improvement of 12 in recall and 4 in pre-
cision compared to the supervised algorithm.
We also show that our algorithm achieves high
accuracy when the training and test sets are
from different domains.
