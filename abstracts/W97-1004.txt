 
In this paper, we study the problem of 
"learning new compositions of words from 
given ones with a specific syntactic struc- 
ture, e.g., A-N or V-N structures. We first 
cluster words according to the given com- 
positions, then construct a cluster-based 
compositional frame for each word cluster, 
which contains both new and given compo- 
sitions relevant with the words in the clus- 
ter. In contrast o other methods, we don't 
pre-define the number of clusters, and for- 
malize the problem of clustering words as 
a non-linear optimization one, in which we 
specify the environments ofwords based on 
word clusters to be determined, rather than 
their neighboring words. To solve the prob- 
lem, we make use of a kind of cooperative 
evolution strategy to design an evolution- 
ary algorithm.
