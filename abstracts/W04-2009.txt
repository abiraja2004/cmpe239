This paper describes a chunk-based parser/semantic
analyzer used by a language learning model. The
language learning model requires an analyzer that
robustly responds to extragrammaticality, ungram-
maticality and other problems associated with tran-
scribed language. The analyzer produces globally
coherent analyses by semantically integrating the
partial parses. Each resulting semantically inte-
grated analysis is ranked by its semantic compati-
bility using a novel metric called semantic density.
