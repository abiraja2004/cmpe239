 
We present in this paper a series of 
induced methods to assign domain tags to 
WordNet entries. Our prime objective is 
to enrich the contextual information in 
WordNet specific to each synset entry. By 
using the available lexical sources such as 
Far East Dictionary and the contextual 
information in WordNet itself, we can 
find a foundation upon which we can base 
our categorization. Next we further 
examine the similarity between common 
lexical taxonomy and the semantic 
hierarchy of WordNet. Based on this 
observation and the knowledge of other 
semantic relations we enlarge the 
coverage of our findings in a systematic 
way. Evaluation of the results shows that 
we achieved reasonable and satisfactory 
accuracy. We propose this as the first step 
of wordnet expansion into a bona fide 
semantic network linked to real-world 
knowledge.
