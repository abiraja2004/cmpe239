 
In this paper, we present the JUCSE system, 
designed for the TempEval-3 shared task. The 
system extracts events and temporal infor-
mation from natural text in English. We have 
participated in all the tasks of TempEval-3, 
namely Task A, Task B & Task C. We have 
primarily utilized the Conditional Random 
Field (CRF) based machine learning tech-
nique, for all the above tasks. Our system 
seems to perform quite competitively in Task 
A and Task B. In Task C, the system?s per-
formance is comparatively modest at the ini-
tial stages of system development. We have 
incorporated various features based on differ-
ent lexical, syntactic and semantic infor-
mation, using Stanford CoreNLP and Wordnet 
based tools.
