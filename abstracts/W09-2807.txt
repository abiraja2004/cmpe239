We investigate the problem of generating
the structure of short domain independent
abstracts. We apply a supervised machine
learning approach trained over a set of ab-
stracts collected from abstracting services
and automatically annotated with a text
analysis tool. We design a set of features
for learning inspired from past research
in content selection, information order-
ing, and rhetorical analysis for training
an algorithm which then predicts the dis-
course structure of unseen abstracts. The
proposed approach to the problem which
combines local and contextual features is
able to predict the local structure of the ab-
stracts in just over 60% of the cases.
