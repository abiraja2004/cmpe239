Current statistical machine translation sys-
tems usually extract rules from bilingual
corpora annotated with 1-best alignments.
They are prone to learn noisy rules due
to alignment mistakes. We propose a new
structure called weighted alignment matrix
to encode all possible alignments for a par-
allel text compactly. The key idea is to as-
sign a probability to each word pair to in-
dicate how well they are aligned. We de-
sign new algorithms for extracting phrase
pairs from weighted alignment matrices
and estimating their probabilities. Our ex-
periments on multiple language pairs show
that using weighted matrices achieves con-
sistent improvements over using n-best
lists in significant less extraction time.
