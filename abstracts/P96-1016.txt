 
In synchronous rewriting, the productions 
of two rewriting systems are paired and 
applied synchronously in the derivation of 
a pair of strings. We present a new syn- 
chronous rewriting system and argue that 
it can handle certain phenomena that are 
not covered by existing synchronous ys- 
tems. We also prove some interesting for- 
mal/computational properties of our sys- 
tem.
