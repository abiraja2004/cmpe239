We present an effective training al-
gorithm for linearly-scored dependency
parsers that implements online large-
margin multi-class training (Crammer and
Singer, 2003; Crammer et al, 2003) on
top of efficient parsing techniques for de-
pendency trees (Eisner, 1996). The trained
parsers achieve a competitive dependency
accuracy for both English and Czech with
no language specific enhancements.
