 
This paper qualifies what a true term- 
recognition systems would have to recog- 
nize. The exact bracketing of the maximal 
termform is then proposed as an achieve- 
able goal upon which current system per- 
formance should be measured. How recall 
and precision metrics are best adapted for 
measuring term recognition is suggested.
