This paper describes an empirical study of the ?In-
formation Synthesis? task, defined as the process of
(given a complex information need) extracting, or-
ganizing and inter-relating the pieces of information
contained in a set of relevant documents, in order to
obtain a comprehensive, non redundant report that
satisfies the information need.
Two main results are presented: a) the creation
of an Information Synthesis testbed with 72 reports
manually generated by nine subjects for eight com-
plex topics with 100 relevant documents each; and
b) an empirical comparison of similarity metrics be-
tween reports, under the hypothesis that the best
metric is the one that best distinguishes between
manual and automatically generated reports. A met-
ric based on key concepts overlap gives better re-
sults than metrics based on n-gram overlap (such as
ROUGE) or sentence overlap.
