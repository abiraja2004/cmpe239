 
Progress in Question Answering can be 
achieved by (1) combining multiple strategies 
that optimally resolve different question 
classes of various degrees of complexity; (2) 
enhancing the precision of question interpreta-
tion and answer extraction; and (3) question 
decomposition and answer fusion. In this pa-
per we also present the impact of modeling 
the user background on Q/A and discuss the 
pragmatics pf processing negation in Q/A.
