We introduce an error mining technique
for automatically detecting errors in re-
sources that are used in parsing systems.
We applied this technique on parsing re-
sults produced on several million words by
two distinct parsing systems, which share
the syntactic lexicon and the pre-parsing
processing chain. We were thus able to
identify missing and erroneous informa-
tion in these resources.
