To speed up the process of categorizing
learner errors and obtaining data for lan-
guages which lack error-annotated data,
we describe a linguistically-informed
method for generating learner-like mor-
phological errors, focusing on Russian.
We outline a procedure to select likely er-
rors, relying on guiding stem and suffix
combinations from a segmented lexicon to
match particular error categories and rely-
ing on grammatical information from the
original context.
