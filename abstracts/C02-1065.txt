This paper presents a method that measures the
similarity between compound nouns in different
languages to locate translation equivalents from
corpora. The method uses information from un-
related corpora in different languages that do
not have to be parallel. This means that many
corpora can be used. The method compares the
contexts of target compound nouns and trans-
lation candidates in the word or semantic at-
tribute level. In this paper, we show how this
measuring method can be applied to select the
best English translation candidate for Japanese
compound nouns in more than 70% of the cases.
