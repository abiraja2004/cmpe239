 
This paper introduces a scheme, which we call 
the baseline method, to define a measure of term 
representativeness and measures defined by using 
the scheme. The representativeness of a term is 
measured by a normalized characteristic value 
defined for a set of all documents that contain the 
term. Normalization is done by comparing the 
original characteristic value with the 
characteristic value defined for a randomly 
chosen document set of the same size. The latter 
value is estimated by a baseline function obtained 
by random sampling and logarithmic linear 
approximation. We found that the distance 
between the word distribution in a document set 
and the word distribution in a whole corpus is an 
effective characteristic value to use for the 
baseline method. Measures defined by the 
baseline method have several advantages 
including that they can be used to compare the 
representativeness of two terms with very 
different frequencies, and that they have 
well-defined threshold values of being 
representative. In addition, the baseline function 
for a corpus is robust against differences in 
corpora; that is, it can be used for normalization 
in a different corpus that has a different size or is 
in a different domain.
