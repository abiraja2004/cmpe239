 
As Electronic Health Records are growing ex-ponentially along with large quantities of un-structured clinical information that could be used for research purposes, protecting patient privacy becomes a challenge that needs to be met. In this paper, we present a novel hybrid system designed to improve the current strate-gies used for person names de-identification. To overcome this task, our system comprises several components designed to accomplish two separate goals: 1) achieve the highest re-call (no patient data can be exposed); and 2) create methods to filter out false positives. As a result, our system reached 92.6% F2-measure when de-identifying person names in Veteran?s Health Administration clinical notes, and considerably outperformed other existing ?out-of-the-box? de-identification or named entity recognition systems.
