We participated in SemEval-1 English
coarse-grained all-words task (task 7), En-
glish fine-grained all-words task (task 17,
subtask 3) and English coarse-grained lex-
ical sample task (task 17, subtask 1). The
same method with different labeled data is
used for the tasks; SemCor is the labeled
corpus used to train our system for the all-
words tasks while the labeled corpus that
is provided is used for the lexical sam-
ple task. The knowledge sources include
part-of-speech of neighboring words, single
words in the surrounding context, local col-
locations, and syntactic patterns. In addi-
tion, we constructed a topic feature, targeted
to capture the global context information,
using the latent dirichlet alocation (LDA)
algorithm with unlabeled corpus. A modi-
fied na??ve Bayes classifier is constructed to
incorporate all the features. We achieved
81.6%, 57.6%, 88.7% for coarse-grained all-
words task, fine-grained all-words task and
coarse-grained lexical sample task respec-
tively.
