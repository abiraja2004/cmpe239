Subjectivity word sense disambiguation
(SWSD) is automatically determining which
word instances in a corpus are being used with
subjective senses, and which are being used
with objective senses. SWSD has been shown
to improve the performance of contextual
opinion analysis, but only on a small scale and
using manually developed integration rules.
In this paper, we scale up the integration of
SWSD into contextual opinion analysis and
still obtain improvements in performance,
by successfully gathering data annotated by
non-expert annotators. Further, by improving
the method for integrating SWSD into con-
textual opinion analysis, even greater benefits
from SWSD are achieved than in previous
work. We thus more firmly demonstrate the
potential of SWSD to improve contextual
opinion analysis.
