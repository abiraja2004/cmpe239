Unlike static documents, version con-
trolled documents are continuously edited
by one or more authors. Such collabo-
rative revision process makes traditional
modeling and visualization techniques in-
appropriate. In this paper we propose a
new representation based on local space-
time smoothing that captures important
revision patterns. We demonstrate the ap-
plicability of our framework using experi-
ments on synthetic and real-world data.
