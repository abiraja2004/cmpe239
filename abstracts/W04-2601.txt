 
This paper describes various types of semantic 
ellipsis and underspecification in natural lan-
guage, and the ways in which the meaning of 
semantically elided elements is reconstructed 
in the Ontological Semantics (OntoSem) text 
processing environment. The description cov-
ers phenomena whose treatment in OntoSem 
has reached various levels of advancement: 
fully implemented, partially implemented, and 
described algorithmically outside of imple-
mentation. We present these research results 
at this point ? prior to full implementation and 
extensive evaluation ? for two reasons: first, 
new descriptive material is being reported; 
second, some subclasses of the phenomena in 
question will require a truly long-term effort 
whose results are best reported in installments.
