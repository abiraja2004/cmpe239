This paper presents the current status of de-
velopment of a finite state transducer gram-
mar for the verbal-chain transfer module in
Matxin, a Rule Based Machine Translation
system between Spanish and Basque. Due to
the distance between Spanish and Basque, the
verbal-chain transfer is a very complex mod-
ule in the overall system. The grammar is
compiled with foma, an open-source finite-
state toolkit, and yields a translation execution
time of 2000 verb chains/second.
