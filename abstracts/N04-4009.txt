We describe a system for pronoun interpre-
tation that is self-trained from raw data,
that is, using no annotated training data.
The result outperforms a Hobbsian baseline
algorithm and is only marginally inferior to
an essentially identical, state-of-the-art su-
pervised model trained from a substantial
manually-annotated coreference corpus.
