This study presents a method that assesses
ESL learners? vocabulary usage to improve
an automated scoring system of sponta-
neous speech responses by non-native English
speakers. Focusing on vocabulary sophistica-
tion, we estimate the difficulty of each word
in the vocabulary based on its frequency in
a reference corpus and assess the mean diffi-
culty level of the vocabulary usage across the
responses (vocabulary profile).
Three different classes of features were gen-
erated based on the words in a spoken re-
sponse: coverage-related, average word rank
and the average word frequency and the extent
to which they influence human-assigned lan-
guage proficiency scores was studied. Among
these three types of features, the average word
frequency showed the most predictive power.
We then explored the impact of vocabulary
profile features in an automated speech scor-
ing context, with particular focus on the im-
pact of two factors: genre of reference corpora
and the characteristics of item-types.
The contribution of the current study lies in
the use of vocabulary profile as a measure of
lexical sophistication for spoken language as-
sessment, an aspect heretofore unexplored in
the context of automated speech scoring.
