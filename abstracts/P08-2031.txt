We use an EM algorithm to learn user mod-
els in a spoken dialog system. Our method
requires automatically transcribed (with ASR)
dialog corpora, plus a model of transcription
errors, but does not otherwise need any man-
ual transcription effort. We tested our method
on a voice-controlled telephone directory ap-
plication, and show that our learned models
better replicate the true distribution of user ac-
tions than those trained by simpler methods
and are very similar to user models estimated
from manually transcribed dialogs.
