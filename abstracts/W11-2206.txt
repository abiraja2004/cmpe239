The automatic generation of entity profiles
from unstructured text, such as Knowledge
Base Population, if applied in a multi-lingual
setting, generates the need to align such pro-
files from multiple languages in an unsuper-
vised manner. This paper describes an unsu-
pervised and language-independent approach
to mine name translation pairs from entity pro-
files, using Wikipedia Infoboxes as a stand-in
for high quality entity profile extraction. Pairs
are initially found using expressions that are
written in language-independent forms (such
as dates and numbers), and new translations
are then mined from these pairs. The algo-
rithm then iteratively bootstraps from these
translations to learn more pairs and more
translations. The algorithm maintains a high
precision, over 95%, for the majority of its
iterations, with a slightly lower precision of
85.9% and an f-score of 76%. A side effect
of the name mining algorithm is the unsuper-
vised creation of a translation lexicon between
the two languages, with an accuracy of 64%.
We also duplicate three state-of-the-art name
translation mining methods and use two ex-
isting name translation gazetteers to compare
with our approach. Comparisons show our
approach can effectively augment the results
from each of these alternative methods and re-
sources.
