In this paper we describe our Semeval-2013
task on Word Sense Induction and Dis-
ambiguation within an end-user application,
namely Web search result clustering and diver-
sification. Given a target query, induction and
disambiguation systems are requested to clus-
ter and diversify the search results returned by
a search engine for that query. The task en-
ables the end-to-end evaluation and compari-
son of systems.
