Most traditional summarization methods treat
their outputs as static and plain texts, which
fail to capture user interests during summa-
rization because the generated summaries are
the same for different users. However, users
have individual preferences on a particular
source document collection and obviously a
universal summary for all users might not al-
ways be satisfactory. Hence we investigate
an important and challenging problem in sum-
mary generation, i.e., Interactive Personalized
Summarization (IPS), which generates sum-
maries in an interactive and personalized man-
ner. Given the source documents, IPS captures
user interests by enabling interactive clicks
and incorporates personalization by model-
ing captured reader preference. We develop
experimental systems to compare 5 rival al-
gorithms on 4 instinctively different datasets
which amount to 5197 documents. Evalua-
tion results in ROUGE metrics indicate the
comparable performance between IPS and the
best competing system but IPS produces sum-
maries with much more user satisfaction ac-
cording to evaluator ratings. Besides, low
ROUGE consistency among these user pre-
ferred summaries indicates the existence of
personalization.
