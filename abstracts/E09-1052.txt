One way to construct semantic represen-
tations in a robust manner is to enhance
shallow language processors with seman-
tic components. Here, we provide a model
theory for a semantic formalism that is de-
signed for this, namely Robust Minimal
Recursion Semantics (RMRS). We show
that RMRS supports a notion of entailment
that allows it to form the basis for compar-
ing the semantic output of different parses
of varying depth.
