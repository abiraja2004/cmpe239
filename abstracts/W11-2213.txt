Resolving ambiguity associated with names
found on the Web, Wikipedia or medical texts
is a very challenging task, which has been
of great interest to the research community.
We propose a novel approach to disambiguat-
ing names using Latent Dirichlet Allocation,
where the learned topics represent the under-
lying senses of the ambiguous name. We con-
duct a detailed evaluation on multiple data sets
containing ambiguous person, location and or-
ganization names and for multiple languages
such as English, Spanish, Romanian and Bul-
garian. We conduct comparative studies with
existing approaches and show a substantial
improvement of 15 to 35% in task accuracy.
