 
Various strategies are proposed to identify 
and classify three types of proper nouns in 
Chinese texts. Clues from character, 
sentence and paragraph levels are employed 
to resolve Chinese personal names. 
Character, Syllable and Frequency 
Conditions are presented to treat 
transliterated personal names, To deal with 
organization ames, keywords, prefix, word 
association and parts-of-speech are applied. 
For fair evaluation, large scale test data are 
selected from six sections of a newspaper. 
The precision and the recall for these three 
types are (88.04%, 92.56%), (50.62%, 
71.93%) and (61.79%, 54.50%), respectively. 
When the former two types are regarded as a 
category, the performance becomes (81.46%, 
91.22%). Compared with other approaches, 
our approach as better performance and our 
classification is automatic.
