With the widespread use of email, we now
have access to unprecedented amounts of text
that we ourselves have written. In this pa-
per, we show how sentiment analysis can be
used in tandem with effective visualizations to
quantify and track emotions in many types of
mail. We create a large word?emotion associ-
ation lexicon by crowdsourcing, and use it to
compare emotions in love letters, hate mail,
and suicide notes. We show that there are
marked differences across genders in how they
use emotion words in work-place email. For
example, women use many words from the
joy?sadness axis, whereas men prefer terms
from the fear?trust axis. Finally, we show vi-
sualizations that can help people track emo-
tions in their emails.
