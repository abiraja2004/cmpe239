Spoken dialogue is notoriously hard to
process with standard NLP technologies.
Natural spoken dialogue is replete with
disfluent, partial, elided or ungrammatical
utterances, all of which are very hard to
accommodate in a dialogue system. Fur-
thermore, speech recognition is known to
be a highly error-prone task, especially for
complex, open-ended discourse domains.
The combination of these two problems
? ill-formed and/or misrecognised speech
inputs ? raises a major challenge to the de-
velopment of robust dialogue systems.
We present an integrated approach for ad-
dressing these two issues, based on a in-
cremental parser for Combinatory Cate-
gorial Grammar. The parser takes word
lattices as input and is able to handle ill-
formed and misrecognised utterances by
selectively relaxing its set of grammati-
cal rules. The choice of the most rele-
vant interpretation is then realised via a
discriminative model augmented with con-
textual information. The approach is fully
implemented in a dialogue system for au-
tonomous robots. Evaluation results on a
Wizard of Oz test suite demonstrate very
significant improvements in accuracy and
robustness compared to the baseline.
