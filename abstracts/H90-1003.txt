 
We present two efficient search algorithms for real-time spo- 
ken language systems. The first called the Word-Dependent 
N-Best algorithm is an improved algorithm for finding the 
top N sentence hypotheses. The new algorithm is shown 
to perform as well as the Exact Sentence-Dependent al- 
gorithm presented previously but with an order of mag- 
nitude less computation. The second algorithm is a fast 
match scheme for continuous peech recognition called the 
Forward-Backward Search. This algorithm, which is directly 
motivated by the Baum-Welch Forward-Backward training 
algorithm, has been shown to reduce the computation of a 
time-synchronous beam search by a factor of 40 with no 
additional search errors.
