The definition of combinatory categorial
grammar (CCG) in the literature varies
quite a bit from author to author. How-
ever, the differences between the defini-
tions are important in terms of the lan-
guage classes of each CCG. We prove
that a wide range of CCGs are strongly
context-free, including the CCG of CCG-
bank and of the parser of Clark and Cur-
ran (2007). In light of these new results,
we train the PCFG parser of Petrov and
Klein (2007) on CCGbank and achieve
state of the art results in supertagging ac-
curacy, PARSEVAL measures and depen-
dency accuracy.
