 
Degree distributions for word forms co-
occurrences for large Russian text collec-
tions are obtained. Two power laws fit the 
distributions pretty good, thus supporting 
Dorogovtsev-Mendes model for Russian. 
Few different Russian text collections 
were studied, and statistical errors are 
shown to be negligible. The model expo-
nents for Russian are found to differ from 
those for English, the difference probably 
being due to the difference in the collec-
tions structure. On the contrary, the esti-
mated size of the supposed kernel lexicon 
appeared to be almost the same for the 
both languages, thus supporting the idea 
of importance of word forms for a percep-
tual lexicon of a human.
