This paper discusses the role of morpho-
logical and syntactic information in the
automatic acquisition of semantic classes
for Catalan adjectives, using decision trees
as a tool for exploratory data analysis.
We show that a simple mapping from
the derivational type to the semantic class
achieves 70.1% accuracy; syntactic func-
tion reaches a slightly higher accuracy of
73.5%. Although the accuracy scores are
quite similar with the two resulting classi-
fications, the kinds of mistakes are quali-
tatively very different. Morphology can be
used as a baseline classification, and syn-
tax can be used as a clue when there are
mismatches between morphology and se-
mantics.
