 
This article describes the results of a systematic in-
depth study of the criteria used for word sense 
disambiguation. Our study is based on 60 target 
words: 20 nouns, 20 adjectives and 20 verbs. Our 
results are not always in line with some practices in 
the field. For example, we show that omitting non-
content words decreases performance and that 
bigrams yield better results than unigrams.
