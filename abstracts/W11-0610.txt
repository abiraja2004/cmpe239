Atypical or idiosyncratic language is a char-
acteristic of autism spectrum disorder (ASD).
In this paper, we discuss previous work iden-
tifying language errors associated with atyp-
ical language in ASD and describe a proce-
dure for reproducing those results. We de-
scribe our data set, which consists of tran-
scribed data from a widely used clinical di-
agnostic instrument (the ADOS) for children
with autism, children with developmental lan-
guage disorder, and typically developing chil-
dren. We then present methods for automati-
cally extracting lexical and syntactic features
from transcripts of children?s speech to 1)
identify certain syntactic and semantic errors
that have previously been found to distinguish
ASD language from that of children with typ-
ical development; and 2) perform diagnostic
classification. Our classifiers achieve results
well above chance, demonstrating the poten-
tial for using NLP techniques to enhance neu-
rodevelopmental diagnosis and atypical lan-
guage analysis. We expect further improve-
ment with additional data, features, and clas-
sification techniques.
