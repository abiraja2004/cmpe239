This paper develops a minimally supervised
approach, based on focused distributional sim-
ilarity methods and discourse connectives,
for identifying of causality relations between
events in context. While it has been shown
that distributional similarity can help identify-
ing causality, we observe that discourse con-
nectives and the particular discourse relation
they evoke in context provide additional in-
formation towards determining causality be-
tween events. We show that combining dis-
course relation predictions and distributional
similarity methods in a global inference pro-
cedure provides additional improvements to-
wards determining event causality.
