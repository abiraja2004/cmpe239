 
Complex documents tored in a flat or partially 
marked up file format require layout sensitive pre- 
processing before any natural language processing 
can be carried out on their textual content. Con- 
temporary technology for the discovery of basic tex- 
tual units is based on either spatial or other con- 
tent insensitive methods. However, there are many 
cases where knowledge of both the language and lay- 
out is required in order to establish the boundaries 
of the basic textual blocks. This paper describes 
a number of these cases and proposes the applica- 
tion of a general method combining knowledge about 
language with knowledge about the spatial arrange- 
ment of text. We claim that the comprehensive un- 
derstanding of layout can only be achieved through 
the exploitation of layout knowledge and language 
knowledge in an inter-dependent maimer.
