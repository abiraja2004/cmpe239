 
In this paper, a novel semantic role labeler based 
on dependency trees is developed. This is ac-
complished by formulating the semantic role la-
beling as a classification problem of dependency 
relations into one of several semantic roles. A 
dependency tree is created from a constituency 
parse of an input sentence. The dependency tree 
is then linearized into a sequence of dependency 
relations. A number of features are extracted for 
each dependency relation using a predefined lin-
guistic context. Finally, the features are input to a 
set of one-versus-all support vector machine 
(SVM) classifiers to determine the corresponding 
semantic role label. We report results on 
CoNLL2004 shared task data using the represen-
tation and scoring scheme adopted for that task.
