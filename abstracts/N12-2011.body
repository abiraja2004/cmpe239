We study1 the problem of extracting all pos-
sible relations among named entities from un-
structured text, a task known as Open Infor-
mation Extraction (Open IE). A state-of-the-
art Open IE system consists of natural lan-
guage processing tools to identify entities and
extract sentences that relate such entities, fol-
lowed by using text clustering to identify the
relations among co-occurring entity pairs. In
particular, we study how the current weighting
scheme used for Open IE affects the clustering
results and propose a term weighting scheme
that significantly improves on the state-of-the-
art in the task of relation extraction both when
used in conjunction with the standard tf ? idf
scheme, and also when used as a pruning fil-
ter.
