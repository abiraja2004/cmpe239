This paper presents a framework for generating
locative expressions. The framework addresses
the issue of combinatorial explosion inherent in
the construction of relational context models by:
(a) contextually defining the set of objects in the
context that may function as a landmark, and (b)
sequencing the order in which spatial relations are
considered using a cognitively motivated hierar-
chy of relations.
