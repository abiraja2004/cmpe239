In this paper we present a confidence mea-
sure for word alignment based on the
posterior probability of alignment links.
We introduce sentence alignment confi-
dence measure and alignment link con-
fidence measure. Based on these mea-
sures, we improve the alignment qual-
ity by selecting high confidence sentence
alignments and alignment links from mul-
tiple word alignments of the same sen-
tence pair. Additionally, we remove
low confidence alignment links from the
word alignment of a bilingual training
corpus, which increases the alignment
F-score, improves Chinese-English and
Arabic-English translation quality and sig-
nificantly reduces the phrase translation
table size.
