Incorrect usage of prepositions and determin-
ers constitute the most common types of er-
rors made by non-native speakers of English.
It is not surprising, then, that there has been
a significant amount of work directed towards
the automated detection and correction of such
errors. However, to date, the use of differ-
ent data sets and different task definitions has
made it difficult to compare work on the topic.
This paper reports on the HOO 2012 shared
task on error detection and correction in the
use of prepositions and determiners, where
systems developed by 14 teams from around
the world were evaluated on the same previ-
ously unseen errorful text.
