Cross-Lingual Lexical Substitution (CLLS) is
the task that aims at providing for a target
word in context, several alternative substitute
words in another language. The proposed
sets of translations may come from external
resources or be extracted from textual data.
In this paper, we apply for the first time an
unsupervised cross-lingual WSD method to
this task. The method exploits the results of
a cross-lingual word sense induction method
that identifies the senses of words by cluster-
ing their translations according to their seman-
tic similarity. We evaluate the impact of using
clustering information for CLLS by applying
the WSD method to the SemEval-2010 CLLS
data set. Our system performs better on the
?out-of-ten? measure than the systems that par-
ticipated in the SemEval task, and is ranked
medium on the other measures. We analyze
the results of this evaluation and discuss av-
enues for a better overall integration of unsu-
pervised sense clustering in this setting.
