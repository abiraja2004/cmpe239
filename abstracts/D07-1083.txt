This paper proposes a framework for
semi-supervised structured output learning
(SOL), specifically for sequence labeling,
based on a hybrid generative and discrim-
inative approach. We define the objective
function of our hybrid model, which is writ-
ten in log-linear form, by discriminatively
combining discriminative structured predic-
tor(s) with generative model(s) that incor-
porate unlabeled data. Then, unlabeled
data is used in a generative manner to in-
crease the sum of the discriminant functions
for all outputs during the parameter estima-
tion. Experiments on named entity recogni-
tion (CoNLL-2003) and syntactic chunking
(CoNLL-2000) data show that our hybrid
model significantly outperforms the state-
of-the-art performance obtained with super-
vised SOL methods, such as conditional ran-
dom fields (CRFs).
