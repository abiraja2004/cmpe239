We outline problems with the interpreta-
tion of accuracy in the presence of bias,
arguing that the issue is a particularly
pressing concern for RTE evaluation. Fur-
thermore, we argue that average precision
scores are unsuitable for RTE, and should
not be reported. We advocate mutual in-
formation as a new evaluation measure
that should be reported in addition to ac-
curacy and confidence-weighted score.
