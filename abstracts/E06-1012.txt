This paper presents results from the first
statistical dependency parser for Turkish.
Turkish is a free-constituent order lan-
guage with complex agglutinative inflec-
tional and derivational morphology and
presents interesting challenges for statisti-
cal parsing, as in general, dependency re-
lations are between ?portions? of words
? called inflectional groups. We have
explored statistical models that use dif-
ferent representational units for parsing.
We have used the Turkish Dependency
Treebank to train and test our parser
but have limited this initial exploration
to that subset of the treebank sentences
with only left-to-right non-crossing depen-
dency links. Our results indicate that the
best accuracy in terms of the dependency
relations between inflectional groups is
obtained when we use inflectional groups
as units in parsing, and when contexts
around the dependent are employed.
