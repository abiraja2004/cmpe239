This paper presents observations on our ex-
perience with an annotation scheme that was
used in the training of a state-of-the-art noun
phrase semantic interpretation system. The
system relies on cross-linguistic evidence
from a set of five Romance languages: Span-
ish, Italian, French, Portuguese, and Roma-
nian. Given a training set of English noun
phrases in context along with their transla-
tions in the five Romance languages, our
algorithm automatically learns a classifica-
tion function that is later on applied to un-
seen test instances for semantic interpreta-
tion. As training and test data we used two
text collections of different genre: Europarl
and CLUVI. The training data was annotated
with contextual features based on two state-
of-the-art classification tag sets.
