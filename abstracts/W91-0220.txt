 
Explaining how the meaning of words relate to the meaning of the utterance in 
which they are used is of utmost importance. The most common approaches view 
the meaning of an utterance as a composition of the meanings of it parts, which 
of course include the words used to construct the utterance. This approach is suc- 
cessful for entailments. However, similar approaches to explain the presuppositionai 
behaviour of utterances have for the most part failed. In this paper we describe the 
application of Default Logic to the representation and the generation of natural lan- 
guage presuppositions. The view is taken that the presuppositions of an utterance 
are conjectures made by the hearer based upon the assumption that the speaker 
is following Grice's maxims of cooperative conversation. These conjectures repre- 
sent information implicitly contained in the utterance which cannot be generated by 
classicM techniques. The compositional framework is maintained. The difference is 
that functional units rather than predetermined semantic units axe inherited by the 
meaning structure. The function's meaning changes depending on the contents of 
the meaning structure. Hence, we view the study of these functional units as iexicai 
pragmatics rather than lexical semantics. Default Logic is one formal method for 
performing default reasoning in the area of Artificial Intelligence called Knowledge 
Representation. Default reasoning attempts to fill with conjectures the gaps left 
by classical forms of reasoning. We suggest that the use of non-classical inferenc- 
ing techniques such as default reasoning will prove fruitful in the realm of lexical 
reasoning.
