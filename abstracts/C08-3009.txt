 
The existence of two scripts for Punjabi 
language has created a script barrier be-
tween the Punjabi literature written in In-
dia and Pakistan. This research has de-
veloped a new system for the first time of 
its kind for Shahmukhi text without dia-
critical marks. The purposed system for 
Shahmukhi to Gurmukhi transliteration 
has been implemented with various re-
search techniques based on language cor-
pus. The corpus analysis of both scripts is 
performed for generating statistical data 
of different types like character and word 
frequencies and bi-gram frequencies. 
This statistical analysis is used in differ-
ent phases of transliteration. Potentially, 
all members of the substantial Punjabi 
community will benefit vastly from this 
transliteration system.
