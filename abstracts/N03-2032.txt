This paper presents our experiments in apply-
ing Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) to dia-
logue act classification. We employ both LSA
proper and LSA augmented in two ways. We
report results on DIAG, our own corpus of tu-
toring dialogues, and on the CallHome Spanish
corpus. Our work has the theoretical goal of as-
sessing whether LSA, an approach based only
on raw text, can be improved by using addi-
tional features of the text.
