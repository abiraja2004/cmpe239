As research on biomedical text mining is
shifting focus from simple binary relations
to more expressive event representations,
extraction performance drops due to the
increase in complexity. Recently intro-
duced data sets specifically targeting static
relations between named entities and do-
main terms have been suggested to enable
a better representation of the biological
processes underlying annotated events and
opportunities for addressing their com-
plexity. In this paper, we present the first
study of integrating these static relations
with event data with the aim of enhanc-
ing event extraction performance. While
obtaining promising results, we will argue
that an event extraction framework will
benefit most from this new data when tak-
ing intrinsic differences between various
event types into account.
