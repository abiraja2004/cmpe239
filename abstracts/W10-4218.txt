Critical software most often requires an
independent validation and verification
(IVV). IVV is usually performed by do-
main experts, who are not familiar with
specific, many times formal, development
technologies. In addition, model-based
testing (MBT) is a promising testing tech-
nique for the verification of critical soft-
ware. Test cases generated by MBT tools
are logical descriptions. The problem is,
then, to provide natural language (NL) de-
scriptions of these test cases, making them
accessible to domain experts. In this pa-
per, we present ongoing research aimed at
finding a suitable method for generating
NL descriptions from test cases in a for-
mal specification language. A first proto-
type has been developed and applied to a
real-world project in the aerospace sector.
