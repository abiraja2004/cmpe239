We consider here the task of linear the-
matic segmentation of text documents, by
using features based on word distributions
in the text. For this task, a typical and of-
ten implicit assumption in previous stud-
ies is that a document has just one topic
and therefore many algorithms have been
tested and have shown encouraging results
on artificial data sets, generated by putting
together parts of different documents. We
show that evaluation on synthetic data is
potentially misleading and fails to give an
accurate evaluation of the performance on
real data. Moreover, we provide a criti-
cal review of existing evaluation metrics in
the literature and we propose an improved
evaluation metric.
