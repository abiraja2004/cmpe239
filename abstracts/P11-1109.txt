We propose an automatic method of extracting
paraphrases from definition sentences, which
are also automatically acquired from the Web.
We observe that a huge number of concepts
are defined in Web documents, and that the
sentences that define the same concept tend
to convey mostly the same information using
different expressions and thus contain many
paraphrases. We show that a large number
of paraphrases can be automatically extracted
with high precision by regarding the sentences
that define the same concept as parallel cor-
pora. Experimental results indicated that with
our method it was possible to extract about
300,000 paraphrases from 6? 108 Web docu-
ments with a precision rate of about 94%.
