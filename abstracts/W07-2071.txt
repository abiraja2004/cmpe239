Words in the context of a target word
have long been used as features by su-
pervised word-sense classifiers. Moham-
mad and Hirst (2006a) proposed a way to
determine the strength of association be-
tween a sense or concept and co-occurring
words?the distributional profile of a con-
cept (DPC)?without the use of manually
annotated data. We implemented an unsu-
pervised na??ve Bayes word sense classifier
using these DPCs that was best or within
one percentage point of the best unsuper-
vised systems in the Multilingual Chinese?
English Lexical Sample Task (task #5) and
the English Lexical Sample Task (task #17).
We also created a simple PMI-based classi-
fier to attempt the English Lexical Substi-
tution Task (task #10); however, its perfor-
mance was poor.
