This paper proposes a method to improve
the robustness of a word sense disambigua-
tion (WSD) system for Japanese. Two
WSD classifiers are trained from a word
sense-tagged corpus: one is a classifier ob-
tained by supervised learning, the other is
a classifier using hypernyms extracted from
definition sentences in a dictionary. The for-
mer will be suitable for the disambiguation
of high frequency words, while the latter is
appropriate for low frequency words. A ro-
bust WSD system will be constructed by
combining these two classifiers. In our ex-
periments, the F-measure and applicability
of our proposed method were 3.4% and 10%
greater, respectively, compared with a single
classifier obtained by supervised learning.
