We study the complexity of uniform mem-
bership for Linear Context-Free Rewriting
Systems, i.e., the problem where we are
given a string w and a grammar G and are
asked whether w ? L(G). In particular,
we use parameterized complexity theory
to investigate how the complexity depends
on various parameters. While we focus
primarily on rank and fan-out, derivation
length is also considered.
