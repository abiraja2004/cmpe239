Why do few working spoken dialogue sys-
tems make use of dialogue models in their
dialogue management? We find out the
causes and propose a generic dialogue
model. It promises to bridge the gap be-
tween practical dialogue management and
(pattern-based) dialogue model through
integrating interaction patterns with the
underling tasks and modeling interaction
patterns via utterance groups using a high
level construct different from dialogue act.
