This paper presents ongoing work on the de-
tection of preposition errors of non-native
speakers of English. Since prepositions
account for a substantial proportion of all
grammatical errors by ESL (English as a
Second Language) learners, developing an
NLP application that can reliably detect
these types of errors will provide an invalu-
able learning resource to ESL students. To
address this problem, we use a maximum
entropy classifier combined with rule-based
filters to detect preposition errors in a corpus
of student essays. Although our work is pre-
liminary, we achieve a precision of 0.8 with
a recall of 0.3.
