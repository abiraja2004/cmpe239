Deploying an automatic speech recogni-
tion system with reasonable performance
requires expensive and time-consuming
in-domain transcription. Previous work
demonstrated that non-professional anno-
tation through Amazon?s Mechanical Turk
can match professional quality. We use
Mechanical Turk to transcribe conversa-
tional speech for as little as one thir-
tieth the cost of professional transcrip-
tion. The higher disagreement of non-
professional transcribers does not have a
significant effect on system performance.
While previous work demonstrated that
redundant transcription can improve data
quality, we found that resources are bet-
ter spent collecting more data. Finally, we
describe a quality control method without
needing professional transcription.
