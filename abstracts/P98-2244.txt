 
There exist several methods of calculating a similar- 
ity curve, or a sequence of similarity values, repre- 
senting the lexical cohesion of successive text con- 
stituents, e.g., paragraphs. Methods for deciding 
the locations of fragment boundaries are, however, 
scarce. We propose a fragmentation method based 
on dynamic programming. The method is theoret- 
ically sound and guaranteed to provide an optimal 
splitting on the basis of a similarity curve, a pre- 
ferred fragment length, and a cost function defined. 
The method is especially useful when control on 
fragment size is of importance.
