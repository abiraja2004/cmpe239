 
This paper proposes a unified 
Transformation Based Learning (TBL, 
Brill, 1995) framework for Chinese 
Entity Detection and Tracking (EDT). 
It consists of two sub models: a 
mention detection model and an entity 
tracking/coreference model. The first 
sub-model is used to adapt existing 
Chinese word segmentation and Named 
Entity (NE) recognition results to a 
specific EDT standard to find all the 
mentions. The second sub-model is 
used to find the coreference relation 
between the mentions. In addition, a 
feedback technique is proposed to 
further improve the performance of the 
system. We evaluated our methods on 
the Automatic Content Extraction 
(ACE, NIST, 2003) Chinese EDT 
corpus. Results show that it 
outperforms the baseline, and achieves 
comparable performance with the state-
of-the-art methods.
