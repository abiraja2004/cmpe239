Abstract
Despite early intuitions, semantic similarity
has not proven to be robust for splitting multi-
party interactions into separate conversations.
We discuss some initial successes with using
thesaural headwords to abstract the seman-
tics of an utterance. This simple profiling
technique showed improvements over base-
line conversation threading models.
