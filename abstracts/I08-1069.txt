For the majority of the world?s languages,
the number of linguistic resources (e.g., an-
notated corpora and parallel data) is very
limited. Consequently, supervised methods,
as well as many unsupervised methods, can-
not be applied directly, leaving these lan-
guages largely untouched and unnoticed. In
this paper, we describe the construction of a
resource that taps the large body of linguisti-
cally analyzed language data that has made
its way to the Web, and propose using this
resource to bootstrap NLP tool development.
