Recent work has shown how a parallel
corpus can be leveraged to build syntac-
tic parser for a target language by project-
ing automatic source parse onto the target
sentence using word alignments. The pro-
jected target dependency parses are not al-
ways fully connected to be useful for train-
ing traditional dependency parsers. In this
paper, we present a greedy non-directional
parsing algorithm which doesn?t need a
fully connected parse and can learn from
partial parses by utilizing available struc-
tural and syntactic information in them.
Our parser achieved statistically signifi-
cant improvements over a baseline system
that trains on only fully connected parses
for Bulgarian, Spanish and Hindi. It also
gave a significant improvement over pre-
viously reported results for Bulgarian and
set a benchmark for Hindi.
