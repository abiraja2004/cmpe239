In this paper, we introduce a new parser,
called SXLFG, based on the Lexical-
Functional Grammars formalism (LFG).
We describe the underlying context-free
parser and how functional structures are
efficiently computed on top of the CFG
shared forest thanks to computation shar-
ing, lazy evaluation, and compact data
representation. We then present vari-
ous error recovery techniques we imple-
mented in order to build a robust parser.
Finally, we offer concrete results when
SXLFG is used with an existing gram-
mar for French. We show that our parser
is both efficient and robust, although the
grammar is very ambiguous.
