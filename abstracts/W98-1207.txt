 
This paper describes applications of stochastic 
and symbolic NLP methods to treebank anno- 
tation. In paxticular we focus on (1) the au- 
tomation of treebank annotation, (2) the com- 
parison of conflicting annotations for the same 
sentence and (3) the automatic detection of in- 
consistencies. These techniques are currently 
employed for building a German treebank.
