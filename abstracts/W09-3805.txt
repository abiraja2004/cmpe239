Empirical lower bounds studies in which
the frequency of alignment configurations
that cannot be induced by a particular for-
malism is estimated, have been important
for the development of syntax-based ma-
chine translation formalisms. The for-
malism that has received most attention
has been inversion transduction grammars
(ITGs) (Wu, 1997). All previous work
on the coverage of ITGs, however, con-
cerns parse failure rates (PFRs) or sen-
tence level coverage, which is not di-
rectly related to any of the evaluation mea-
sures used in machine translation. S?gaard
and Kuhn (2009) induce lower bounds on
translation unit error rates (TUERs) for a
number of formalisms, incl. normal form
ITGs, but not for the full class of ITGs.
Many of the alignment configurations that
cannot be induced by normal form ITGs
can be induced by unrestricted ITGs, how-
ever. This paper estimates the difference
and shows that the average reduction in
lower bounds on TUER is 2.48 in absolute
difference (16.01 in average parse failure
rate).
