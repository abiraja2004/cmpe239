We study a number of natural language deci-
pherment problems using unsupervised learn-
ing. These include letter substitution ciphers,
character code conversion, phonetic decipher-
ment, and word-based ciphers with relevance
to machine translation. Straightforward unsu-
pervised learning techniques most often fail on
the first try, so we describe techniques for un-
derstanding errors and significantly increasing
performance.
