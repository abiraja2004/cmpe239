 
Key phrases are usually among the most 
information-bearing linguistic structures. 
Translating them correctly will improve 
many natural language processing appli-
cations. We propose a new framework to 
mine key phrase translations from web 
corpora. We submit a source phrase to a 
search engine as a query, then expand 
queries by adding the translations of 
topic-relevant hint words from the re-
turned snippets. We retrieve mixed-
language web pages based on the ex-
panded queries.  Finally, we extract the 
key phrase translation from the second-
round returned web page snippets with 
phonetic, semantic and frequency-
distance features. We achieve 46% phrase 
translation accuracy when using top 10 re-
turned snippets, and 80% accuracy with 
165 snippets. Both results are signifi-
cantly better than several existing meth-
ods.
