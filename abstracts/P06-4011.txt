Abstract 
This paper introduces a method for 
computational analysis of move 
structures in abstracts of research articles. 
In our approach, sentences in a given 
abstract are analyzed and labeled with a 
specific move in light of various 
rhetorical functions. The method involves 
automatically gathering a large number 
of abstracts from the Web and building a 
language model of abstract moves. We 
also present a prototype concordancer, 
CARE, which exploits the move-tagged 
abstracts for digital learning. This system 
provides a promising approach to Web-
based computer-assisted academic 
writing.
