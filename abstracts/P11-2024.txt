Web search is an information-seeking activ-
ity. Often times, this amounts to a user seek-
ing answers to a question. However, queries,
which encode user?s information need, are
typically not expressed as full-length natural
language sentences ? in particular, as ques-
tions. Rather, they consist of one or more text
fragments. As humans become more search-
engine-savvy, do natural-language questions
still have a role to play in web search?
Through a systematic, large-scale study, we
find to our surprise that as time goes by, web
users are more likely to use questions to ex-
press their search intent.
