We investigate a series of targeted modifi-
cations to a data-driven dependency parser
of German and show that these can be
highly effective even for a relatively well
studied language like German if they are
made on a (linguistically and methodolog-
ically) informed basis and with a parser
implementation that allows for fast and
robust training and application. Mak-
ing relatively small changes to a range
of very different system components, we
were able to increase labeled accuracy on
a standard test set (from the CoNLL 2009
shared task), ignoring gold standard part-
of-speech tags, from 87.64% to 89.40%.
The study was conducted in less than five
weeks and as a secondary project of all
four authors. Effective modifications in-
clude the quality and combination of auto-
assigned morphosyntactic features enter-
ing machine learning, the internal feature
handling as well as the inclusion of global
constraints and a combination of different
parsing strategies.
