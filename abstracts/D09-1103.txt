 
In this paper, we employ the centering the-
ory in pronoun resolution from the seman-
tic perspective. First, diverse semantic role 
features with regard to different predicates 
in a sentence are explored. Moreover, given 
a pronominal anaphor, its relative ranking 
among all the pronouns in a sentence, ac-
cording to relevant semantic role informa-
tion and its surface position, is incorporated. 
In particular, the use of both the semantic 
role features and the relative pronominal 
ranking feature in pronoun resolution is 
guided by extending the centering theory 
from the grammatical level to the semantic 
level in tracking the local discourse focus. 
Finally, detailed pronominal subcategory 
features are incorporated to enhance the 
discriminative power of both the semantic 
role features and the relative pronominal 
ranking feature. Experimental results on the 
ACE 2003 corpus show that the centering-
motivated features contribute much to pro-
noun resolution.
