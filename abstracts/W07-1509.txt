We investigate a way to partially automate
corpus annotation for named entity recogni-
tion, by requiring only binary decisions from
an annotator. Our approach is based on a lin-
ear sequence model trained using a k-best
MIRA learning algorithm. We ask an an-
notator to decide whether each mention pro-
duced by a high recall tagger is a true men-
tion or a false positive. We conclude that our
approach can reduce the effort of extending
a seed training corpus by up to 58%.
