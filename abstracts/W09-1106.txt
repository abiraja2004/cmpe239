The combination of Support Vector Machines
with very high dimensional kernels, such as
string or tree kernels, suffers from two ma-
jor drawbacks: first, the implicit representa-
tion of feature spaces does not allow us to un-
derstand which features actually triggered the
generalization; second, the resulting compu-
tational burden may in some cases render un-
feasible to use large data sets for training. We
propose an approach based on feature space
reverse engineering to tackle both problems.
Our experiments with Tree Kernels on a Se-
mantic Role Labeling data set show that the
proposed approach can drastically reduce the
computational footprint while yielding almost
unaffected accuracy.
