We present a maximum entropy classifier
that significantly improves the accuracy of
Argumentative Zoning in scientific litera-
ture. We examine the features used to
achieve this result and experiment with
Argumentative Zoning as a sequence tag-
ging task, decoded with Viterbi using up
to four previous classification decisions.
The result is a 23% F-score increase on the
Computational Linguistics conference pa-
pers marked up by Teufel (1999).
Finally, we demonstrate the performance
of our system in different scientific do-
mains by applying it to a corpus of As-
tronomy journal articles annotated using a
modified Argumentative Zoning scheme.
