 
This paper presents a method for learning 
phonological rules from sample pairs of un- 
derlying and surface forms, without negative 
evidence. The learned rules are represented as
finite state transducers that accept underlying 
forms as input and generate surface forms as 
output. The algorithm for learning them is an 
extension of the OSTIA algorithm for learn- 
ing general subsequential finite state transduc- 
ers. Although OSTIA is capable of learning 
arbitrary s.-f.s.t's in the limit, large dictionaries 
of actual English pronunciations did not give 
enough samples to correctly induce phonolog- 
ical rules. We then augmented OSTIA with 
two kinds of knowledge specific to natural lan- 
guage phonology, biases from "universal gram- 
mar". One bias is that underlying phones are 
often realized as phonetically similar or iden- 
tical surface phones. The other biases phono- 
logical rules to apply across natural phonolog- 
ical classes. The additions helped in learning 
more compact, accurate, and general transduc- 
ers than the unmodified OSTIA algorithm. An 
implementation f the algorithm successfully 
learns a number of English postlexical rules.
