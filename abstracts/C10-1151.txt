There often exist multiple corpora for the
same natural language processing (NLP)
tasks. However, such corpora are gen-
erally used independently due to distinc-
tions in annotation standards. For the pur-
pose of full use of readily available hu-
man annotations, it is significant to simul-
taneously utilize multiple corpora of dif-
ferent annotation standards. In this pa-
per, we focus on the challenge of con-
stituent syntactic parsing with treebanks
of different annotations and propose a col-
laborative decoding (or co-decoding) ap-
proach to improve parsing accuracy by
leveraging bracket structure consensus be-
tween multiple parsing decoders trained
on individual treebanks. Experimental re-
sults show the effectiveness of the pro-
posed approach, which outperforms state-
of-the-art baselines, especially on long
sentences.
