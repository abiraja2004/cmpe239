This article discusses metaphor annotation in
a corpus of argumentative essays written by
test-takers during a standardized examination
for graduate school admission. The quality of
argumentation being the focus of the project,
we developed a metaphor annotation proto-
col that targets metaphors that are relevant
for the writer?s arguments. The reliability of
the protocol is ?=0.58, on a set of 116 es-
says (the total of about 30K content-word to-
kens). We found a moderate-to-strong correla-
tion (r=0.51-0.57) between the percentage of
metaphorically used words in an essay and the
writing quality score. We also describe en-
couraging findings regarding the potential of
metaphor identification to contribute to auto-
mated scoring of essays.
