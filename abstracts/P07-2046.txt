Data sparseness is one of the factors that de-
grade statistical machine translation (SMT).
Existing work has shown that using morpho-
syntactic information is an effective solu-
tion to data sparseness. However, fewer ef-
forts have been made for Chinese-to-English
SMT with using English morpho-syntactic
analysis. We found that while English is
a language with less inflection, using En-
glish lemmas in training can significantly
improve the quality of word alignment that
leads to yield better translation performance.
We carried out comprehensive experiments
on multiple training data of varied sizes to
prove this. We also proposed a new effec-
tive linear interpolation method to integrate
multiple homologous features of translation
models.
