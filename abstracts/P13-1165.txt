 
Social media platforms have enabled people to 
freely express their views and discuss issues of 
interest with others. While it is important to dis-
cover the topics in discussions, it is equally use-
ful to mine the nature of such discussions or de-
bates and the behavior of the participants. There 
are many questions that can be asked. One key 
question is whether the participants give rea-
soned arguments with justifiable claims via 
constructive debates or exhibit dogmatism and 
egotistic clashes of ideologies. The central idea 
of this question is tolerance, which is a key 
concept in the field of communications. In this 
work, we perform a computational study of tol-
erance in the context of online discussions. We 
aim to identify tolerant vs. intolerant partici-
pants and investigate how disagreement affects 
tolerance in discussions in a quantitative 
framework. To the best of our knowledge, this 
is the first such study. Our experiments using 
real-life discussions demonstrate the effective-
ness of the proposed technique and also provide 
some key insights into the psycholinguistic 
phenomenon of tolerance in online discussions.
