 
This paper studies the problem of identifying 
users who use multiple userids to post in so-
cial media. Since multiple userids may belong 
to the same author, it is hard to directly apply 
supervised learning to solve the problem. This 
paper proposes a new method, which still uses 
supervised learning but does not require train-
ing documents from the involved userids. In-
stead, it uses documents from other userids 
for classifier building. The classifier can be 
applied to documents of the involved userids. 
This is possible because we transform the 
document space to a similarity space and 
learning is performed in this new space. Our 
evaluation is done in the online review do-
main. The experimental results using a large 
number of userids and their reviews show that 
the proposed method is highly effective.
