 
We investigate the logical structure of concepts 
generated by conjunction and disjunction over 
a monotonic multiple inheritance network where 
concept nodes represent linguistic categories and 
links indicate basic inclusion (ISA) and disjoint- 
hess (ISNOTA) relations. We model the distinction 
between primitive and defined concepts as well as 
between closed- and open-world reasoning. We ap- 
ply our logical analysis to the sort inheritance and 
unification system of HPSG and also to classifica- 
tion in systemic hoice systems.
