Despite their flat, semantics-free structure, on-
tology identifiers are often given names or la-
bels corresponding to natural language words
or phrases which are very dense with informa-
tion as to their intended referents. We argue
that by taking advantage of this information
density, NLG systems applied to ontologies
can guide the choice and construction of sen-
tences to express useful ontological informa-
tion, solely through the verbalisations of iden-
tifier names, and that by doing so, they can re-
place the extremely fussy and repetitive texts
produced by ontology verbalisers with shorter
and simpler texts which are clearer and eas-
ier for human readers to understand. We spec-
ify which axioms in an ontology are ?defin-
ing axioms? for linguistically-complex identi-
fiers and analyse a large corpus of OWL on-
tologies to identify common patterns among
all defining axioms. By generating texts from
ontologies, and selectively including or omit-
ting these defining axioms, we show by sur-
veys that human readers are typically capable
of inferring information implicitly encoded in
identifier phrases, and that texts which do not
make such ?obvious? information explicit are
preferred by readers and yet communicate the
same information as the longer texts in which
such information is spelled out explicitly.
