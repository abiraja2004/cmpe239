This paper presents PATTY: a large resource
for textual patterns that denote binary relations
between entities. The patterns are semanti-
cally typed and organized into a subsumption
taxonomy. The PATTY system is based on ef-
ficient algorithms for frequent itemset mining
and can process Web-scale corpora. It har-
nesses the rich type system and entity popu-
lation of large knowledge bases. The PATTY
taxonomy comprises 350,569 pattern synsets.
Random-sampling-based evaluation shows a
pattern accuracy of 84.7%. PATTY has 8,162
subsumptions, with a random-sampling-based
precision of 75%. The PATTY resource
is freely available for interactive access and
download.
