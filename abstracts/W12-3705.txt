In this work, we present SAMAR, a sys-
tem for Subjectivity and Sentiment Analysis
(SSA) for Arabic social media genres. We
investigate: how to best represent lexical in-
formation; whether standard features are use-
ful; how to treat Arabic dialects; and, whether
genre specific features have a measurable im-
pact on performance. Our results suggest that
we need individualized solutions for each do-
main and task, but that lemmatization is a fea-
ture in all the best approaches.
