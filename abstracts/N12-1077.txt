Noticing that different information sources of-
ten provide complementary coverage of word
sense and meaning, we propose a simple and
yet effective strategy for measuring lexical se-
mantics. Our model consists of a committee
of vector space models built on a text cor-
pus, Web search results and thesauruses, and
measures the semantic word relatedness us-
ing the averaged cosine similarity scores. De-
spite its simplicity, our system correlates with
human judgements better or similarly com-
pared to existing methods on several bench-
mark datasets, including WordSim353.
