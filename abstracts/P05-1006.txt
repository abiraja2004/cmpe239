We describe an automatic Word Sense
Disambiguation (WSD) system that dis-
ambiguates verb senses using syntactic
and semantic features that encode infor-
mation about predicate arguments and se-
mantic classes. Our system performs at
the best published accuracy on the English
verbs of Senseval-2. We also experiment
with using the gold-standard predicate-
argument labels from PropBank for dis-
ambiguating fine-grained WordNet senses
and course-grained PropBank framesets,
and show that disambiguation of verb
senses can be further improved with bet-
ter extraction of semantic roles.
