A central issue for making the content
of a scientific document quickly acces-
sible to a potential reader is the extrac-
tion of keyphrases, which capture the main
topic of the document. Keyphrases can
be extracted automatically by generating a
list of keyphrase candidates, ranking these
candidates, and selecting the top-ranked
candidates as keyphrases. We present the
KeyWE system, which uses an adapted
nominal group chunker for candidate ex-
traction and a supervised ranking algo-
rithm based on support vector machines
for ranking the extracted candidates. The
system was evaluated on data provided
for the SemEval 2010 Shared Task on
Keyphrase Extraction.
