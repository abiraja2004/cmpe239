We extend the Blum and Chawla
(2001) graph min-cut algorithm to
structured problems. This extension
can alternatively be viewed as a joint
inference method over a set of train-
ing and test instances where parts of
the instances interact through a pre-
specified associative network. The
method has has an efficient approxima-
tion through a linear-programming re-
laxation. On small training data sets,
the method achieves up to 34.8% rela-
tive error reduction.
