Research on coreference resolution and sum-
marization has modeled the way entities are
realized as concrete phrases in discourse. In
particular there exist models of the noun
phrase syntax used for discourse-new versus
discourse-old referents, and models describ-
ing the likely distance between a pronoun and
its antecedent. However, models of discourse
coherence, as applied to information ordering
tasks, have ignored these kinds of information.
We apply a discourse-new classifier and pro-
noun coreference algorithm to the information
ordering task, and show significant improve-
ments in performance over the entity grid, a
popular model of local coherence.
