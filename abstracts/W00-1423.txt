 
We describe the generation of communicative ac- 
tions in an implemented embodied conversational 
agent. Our agent plans each utterance so that mul- 
tiple communicative goals may be realized oppor- 
tunistically by a composite action including not only 
speech but also coverbal gesture that fits the con- 
text and the ongoing speech in ways representative 
of natural human conversation. We accomplish this 
by reasoning from a grammar which describes ges- 
ture declaratively in terms of its discourse function, 
semantics and synchrony with speech.
