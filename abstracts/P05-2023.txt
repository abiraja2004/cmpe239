We present an unsupervised system that
exploits linguistic knowledge resources,
namely English and German lexical
databases and the World Wide Web, to
identify English inclusions in German
text. We describe experiments with this
system and the corpus which was devel-
oped for this task. We report the classifi-
cation results of our system and compare
them to the performance of a trained ma-
chine learner in a series of in- and cross-
domain experiments.
