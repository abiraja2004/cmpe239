 
This paper presents the lessons learned in 
experimenting with Thetis1, an EC project 
focusing on the creation and localization 
of enhanced on-line pedagogical content 
for language learning in tourism industry. 
It is based on a general innovative ap-
proach to language learning that allows 
employees to acquire practical oral and 
written skills while navigating a relevant 
professional scenario. The approach is en-
abled by an underlying platform 
(EXILLS) that integrates virtual reality 
with a set of linguistic, technologies to 
create a new form of dynamic, extensible, 
goal-directed e-content.
