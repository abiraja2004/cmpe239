In this paper we present an evaluation of new 
techniques for automatically detecting emo-
tions in text. The study estimates categorical 
model and dimensional model for the recogni-
tion of four affective states: Anger, Fear, Joy, 
and Sadness that are common emotions in 
three datasets: SemEval-2007 ?Affective 
Text?, ISEAR (International Survey on Emo-
tion Antecedents and Reactions), and child-
ren?s fairy tales. In the first model, WordNet-
Affect is used as a linguistic lexical resource 
and three dimensionality reduction techniques 
are evaluated: Latent Semantic Analysis 
(LSA), Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis 
(PLSA), and Non-negative Matrix Factoriza-
tion (NMF). In the second model, ANEW (Af-
fective Norm for English Words), a normative 
database with affective terms, is employed. 
Experiments show that a categorical model us-
ing NMF results in better performances for 
SemEval and fairy tales, whereas a dimension-
al model performs better with ISEAR.
