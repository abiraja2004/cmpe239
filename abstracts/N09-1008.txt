We present an unsupervised approach to re-
constructing ancient word forms. The present
work addresses three limitations of previous
work. First, previous work focused on faith-
fulness features, which model changes be-
tween successive languages. We add marked-
ness features, which model well-formedness
within each language. Second, we introduce
universal features, which support generaliza-
tions across languages. Finally, we increase
the number of languages to which these meth-
ods can be applied by an order of magni-
tude by using improved inference methods.
Experiments on the reconstruction of Proto-
Oceanic, Proto-Malayo-Javanic, and Classical
Latin show substantial reductions in error rate,
giving the best results to date.
