We present an automatic multi-document
summarization system for Dutch based on
the MEAD system. We focus on redun-
dancy detection, an essential ingredient of
multi-document summarization. We in-
troduce a semantic overlap detection tool,
which goes beyond simple string match-
ing. Our results so far do not confirm
our expectation that this tool would out-
perform the other tested methods.
