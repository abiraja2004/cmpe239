We relate the problem of finding the best
application of a Synchronous Context-
Free Grammar (SCFG) rule during pars-
ing to a Markov Random Field. This
representation allows us to use the the-
ory of expander graphs to show that the
complexity of SCFG parsing of an input
sentence of length N is ?(N cn), for a
grammar with maximum rule length n and
some constant c. This improves on the
previous best result of ?(N c
?n).
