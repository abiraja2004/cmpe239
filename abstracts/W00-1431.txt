" . . . . . . . . . . . . .  We+will discuss the:somi-reeursiveaigorithm for ....... -+-+,~he~GTAG.?ovmalismdescrihes.th~domain_ 
text generation, as defined for the GTAG model used to specify the input of the generator, 
formalism, and its implementation in the CLEF 
project. We will show how to use iexical choice 
constraints and properties of the LTAG grammar 
to minimize the backtracking of the semi- 
recursive algorithm.
