Structural information in language is im-
portant for obtaining a better understand-
ing of a human communication (e.g., sen-
tence segmentation, speaker turns, and
topic segmentation). Human communica-
tion involves a variety of multimodal be-
haviors that signal both propositional con-
tent and structure, e.g., gesture, gaze, and
body posture. These non-verbal signals
have tight temporal and semantic links to
spoken content. In my thesis, I am work-
ing on incorporating non-verbal cues into
a multimodal model to better predict the
structural events to further improve the
understanding of human communication.
Some research results are summarized in
this document and my future research plan
is described.
