While world knowledge has been shown to
improve learning-based coreference resolvers,
the improvements were typically obtained by
incorporating world knowledge into a fairly
weak baseline resolver. Hence, it is not clear
whether these benefits can carry over to a
stronger baseline. Moreover, since there has
been no attempt to apply different sources of
world knowledge in combination to corefer-
ence resolution, it is not clear whether they of-
fer complementary benefits to a resolver. We
systematically compare commonly-used and
under-investigated sources of world knowl-
edge for coreference resolution by applying
them to two learning-based coreference mod-
els and evaluating them on documents anno-
tated with two different annotation schemes.
