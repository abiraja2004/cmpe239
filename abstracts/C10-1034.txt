 
Twitter, as one of the most popular 
micro-blogging services, provides large 
quantities of fresh information including 
real-time news, comments, conversation, 
pointless babble and advertisements. 
Twitter presents tweets in chronological 
order. Recently, Twitter introduced a 
new ranking strategy that considers 
popularity of tweets in terms of number 
of retweets.  This ranking method, 
however, has not taken into account 
content relevance or the twitter account. 
Therefore a large amount of pointless 
tweets inevitably flood the relevant 
tweets. This paper proposes a new 
ranking strategy which uses not only the 
content relevance of a tweet, but also the 
account authority and tweet-specific 
features such as whether a URL link is 
included in the tweet. We employ 
learning to rank algorithms to determine 
the best set of features with a series of 
experiments. It is demonstrated that 
whether a tweet contains URL or not, 
length of tweet and account authority are 
the best conjunction.1
