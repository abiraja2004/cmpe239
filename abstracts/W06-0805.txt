 
In this paper, we explore the use of struc-
tured content as semantic constraints for 
enhancing the performance of traditional 
term-based document retrieval in special 
domains. First, we describe a method for 
automatic extraction of semantic content 
in the form of attribute-value (AV) pairs 
from natural language texts based on 
domain models constructed from a semi-
structured web resource. Then, we ex-
plore the effect of combining a state-of-
the-art term-based IR system and a sim-
ple constraint-based search system that 
uses the extracted AV pairs. Our evalua-
tion results have shown that such combi-
nation produces some improvement in IR 
performance over the term-based IR sys-
tem on our test collection.
