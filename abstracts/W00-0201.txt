 
In this paper we outline an interlingual- 
based procedure for resolving reference 
and suggest a practical approach to 
implementing it. We assume a two-stage 
language analysis system. First, a 
syntactic analysis of an input text results 
in a functional structure in which certain 
cases of pronominal reference are 
resolved. Second, the f-structure is 
mapped onto an interlingual 
representation. As part of this mapping, 
the reference of the various f-structure 
elements is resolved resulting in the 
addition of information to certain 
existing IL objects (coreference) or in 
the creation of new IL objects which are 
added to the domain of discourse (initial 
reference). 
For this effort, we adopt Text Meaning 
Representation forour IL and rely on the 
ONTOS ontology (Mahesh & Nirenburg, 
1995) as a general knowledge base. 
Since the central barrier to developing 
such a system today is the 
incompleteness of the knowledge base, 
we outline a strategy starting with the 
implementation f a series of form-based 
resolution algorithms that are applied 
directly to the referring expressions of 
the input text. These are initially 
supplemented by a knowledge-based 
resolution procedure which, as the 
knowledge base grows and the adequacy 
of the f-structure and IL-representation 
increases, takes on more and more of the 
processing load. 
We examine the operation of the form- 
based algorithms on a sample Spanish 
text and show their limitations. We then 
demonstrate how an IL-based approach 
can be used to resolve the problematic 
cases of reference. This research effort is 
part of the CREST project at the CRL 
funded by DARPA 1.
