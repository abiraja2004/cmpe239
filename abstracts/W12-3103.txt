 
This paper describes the system used for our participation in the WMT12 Machine Transla-tion evaluation shared task.  We also present a new approach to Machine Translation evaluation based on the recently defined task Semantic Textual Similarity. This problem is addressed using a textual entail-ment engine entirely based on WordNet se-mantic features. We described results for the Spanish-English, Czech-English and German-English language pairs according to our submission on the Eight Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation. Our first experiments reports a competitive score to system level. 1
