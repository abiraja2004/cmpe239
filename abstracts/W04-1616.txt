 
  In natural language, a stem is the 
morphological base of a word to which affixes can 
be attached to form derivatives. Stemming is a 
process of assigning morphological variants of 
words to equivalence classes such that each class 
corresponds to a single stem. Different stemmers 
have been developed for a wide range of languages 
and for a variety of purposes. Arabic, a highly 
inflected language with complex orthography, 
requires good stemming for effective text analysis. 
Preliminary investigation indicates that existing 
approaches to Arabic stemming fail to provide 
effective and accurate equivalence classes when 
applied to a text like the Qur?an written in 
Classical Arabic. Therefore, I propose a new 
stemming approach based on a light stemming 
technique that uses a transliterated version of the 
Qur?an in western script.
