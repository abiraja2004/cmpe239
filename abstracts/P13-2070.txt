Machine Transliteration is an essential
task for many NLP applications. Howev-
er, names and loan words typically orig-
inate from various languages, obey dif-
ferent transliteration rules, and therefore
may benefit from being modeled inde-
pendently. Recently, transliteration mod-
els based on Bayesian learning have over-
come issues with over-fitting allowing for
many-to-many alignment in the training of
transliteration models. We propose a nov-
el coupled Dirichlet process mixture mod-
el (cDPMM) that simultaneously clusters
and bilingually aligns transliteration data
within a single unified model. The un-
ified model decomposes into two class-
es of non-parametric Bayesian component
models: a Dirichlet process mixture mod-
el for clustering, and a set of multino-
mial Dirichlet process models that perf-
orm bilingual alignment independently for
each cluster. The experimental results
show that our method considerably outper-
forms conventional alignment models.
