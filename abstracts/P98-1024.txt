 
A large spoken dialogue translation system imposes 
both engineering and linguistic constraints on the 
way in which linguistic information is communi- 
cated between modules. We describe the design and 
use of interface terms, whose formal, functional and 
communicative role has been tested in a sequence of 
integrated systems and which have proven adequate 
to these constraints.
