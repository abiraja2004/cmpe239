 
We herein introduce our project of realizing a 
framework for the development of a spoken 
dialogue system based on collaboratively con-
structed semantic resources. We demonstrate 
that a semantic Web-oriented approach based 
on collaboratively constructed semantic re-
sources significantly reduces troublesome rule 
descriptions and complex configurations, 
which are caused by the previous relational 
database-based approach, in the development 
process of spoken dialogue systems. In addi-
tion, we show that the proposed framework 
enables multilingual spoken dialogue system 
development due to clear separation of model, 
view and controller components.
