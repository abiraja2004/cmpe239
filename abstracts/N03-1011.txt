The discovery of semantic relations from text
becomes increasingly important for applica-
tions such as Question Answering, Informa-
tion Extraction, Text Summarization, Text Un-
derstanding, and others. The semantic rela-
tions are detected by checking selectional con-
straints. This paper presents a method and its
results for learning semantic constraints to de-
tect part-whole relations. Twenty constraints
were found. Their validity was tested on a
10,000 sentence corpus, and the targeted part-
whole relations were detected with an accuracy
of 83%.
