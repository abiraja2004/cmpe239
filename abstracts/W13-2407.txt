We describe GPKEX, a keyphrase extrac-
tion method based on genetic programming.
We represent keyphrase scoring measures
as syntax trees and evolve them to pro-
duce rankings for keyphrase candidates ex-
tracted from text. We apply and evalu-
ate GPKEX on Croatian newspaper arti-
cles. We show that GPKEX can evolve
simple and interpretable keyphrase scoring
measures that perform comparably to more
complex machine learning methods previ-
ously developed for Croatian.
