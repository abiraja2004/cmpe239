as directed, weighted graphs, modeling the 
range of influence of terms within the 
document as well as contextually deter-
mined semantic relatedness among terms. 
We then show the usefulness of this kind 
of representation in topic segmentation. 
Our boundary detection algorithm uses 
this graph to determine topical coherence 
and potential topic shifts, and does not re-
quire labeled data or training of parame-
ters. We show that this method yields im-
proved results on both concatenated pseu-
do-documents and on closed-captions for 
television programs.
