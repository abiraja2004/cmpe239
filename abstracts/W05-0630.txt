We present a four-step hierarchical SRL
strategy which generalizes the classical
two-level approach (boundary detection
and classification). To achieve this, we
have split the classification step by group-
ing together roles which share linguistic
properties (e.g. Core Roles versus Ad-
juncts). The results show that the non-
optimized hierarchical approach is com-
putationally more efficient than the tradi-
tional systems and it preserves their accu-
racy.
