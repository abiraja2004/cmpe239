bilingual corpora. The notions of supracontext and subcontext are extended to encompass bilingual 
information through simultaneous analogy on both source and target sentences and juxtaposition of 
corresponding results. Analogical modelling is performed uring the learning phase and translation 
patterns are projected in a multi-dimensional analogical network. The proposed fi'amework was evaluated 
on a small training corpus providing promising results. Suggestions to improve system performance are
