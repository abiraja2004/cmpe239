This paper presents a Function Word cen-
tered, Syntax-based (FWS) solution to ad-
dress phrase ordering in the context of
statistical machine translation (SMT). Mo-
tivated by the observation that function
words often encode grammatical relation-
ship among phrases within a sentence, we
propose a probabilistic synchronous gram-
mar to model the ordering of function words
and their left and right arguments. We im-
prove phrase ordering performance by lexi-
calizing the resulting rules in a small number
of cases corresponding to function words.
The experiments show that the FWS ap-
proach consistently outperforms the base-
line system in ordering function words? ar-
guments and improving translation quality
in both perfect and noisy word alignment
scenarios.
