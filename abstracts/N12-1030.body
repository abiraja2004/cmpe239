We apply Combinatory Categorial Grammar
to wide-coverage parsing in Chinese with the
new Chinese CCGbank, bringing a formalism
capable of transparently recovering non-local
dependencies to a language in which they are
particularly frequent.
We  train  two  state-of-the-art  English ???
parsers: the parser of Petrov and Klein (P&K),
and the Clark and Curran (C&C) parser, uncov-
ering a surprising performance gap between
them not observed in English ? 72.73 (P&K)
and 67.09 (C&C) F -score on ???? 6.
We explore the challenges of  Chinese ???
parsing through three novel  ideas: develop-
ing corpus variants rather than treating the cor-
pus as fixed; controlling noun/verb and other
??? ambiguities; and quantifying the impact
of constructions like pro-drop.
