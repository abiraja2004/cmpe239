 
Learning and improving natural turn-taking behaviors for dialogue systems is a topic of growing importance. In task-oriented dia-logue where the user can engage in task ac-tions in parallel with dialogue, unrestricted turn taking may be particularly important for dialogue success. This paper presents a novel Markov Decision Process (MDP) representa-tion of dialogue with unrestricted turn taking and a parallel task stream in order to automat-ically learn effective turn-taking policies for a tutorial dialogue system from a corpus. It also presents and evaluates an approach to auto-matically selecting features for an MDP state representation of this dialogue. The results suggest that the MDP formulation and the feature selection framework hold promise for learning effective turn-taking policies in task-oriented dialogue systems. 1
