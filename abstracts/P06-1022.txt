Spoken monologues feature greater sen-
tence length and structural complexity
than do spoken dialogues. To achieve high
parsing performance for spoken mono-
logues, it could prove effective to sim-
plify the structure by dividing a sentence
into suitable language units. This paper
proposes a method for dependency pars-
ing of Japanese monologues based on sen-
tence segmentation. In this method, the
dependency parsing is executed in two
stages: at the clause level and the sen-
tence level. First, the dependencies within
a clause are identified by dividing a sen-
tence into clauses and executing stochastic
dependency parsing for each clause. Next,
the dependencies over clause boundaries
are identified stochastically, and the de-
pendency structure of the entire sentence
is thus completed. An experiment using
a spoken monologue corpus shows this
method to be effective for efficient depen-
dency parsing of Japanese monologue sen-
tences.
