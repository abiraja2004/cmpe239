The goal of our research is to improve
event extraction by learning to identify sec-
ondary role filler contexts in the absence
of event keywords. We propose a multi-
layered event extraction architecture that pro-
gressively ?zooms in? on relevant informa-
tion. Our extraction model includes a docu-
ment genre classifier to recognize event nar-
ratives, two types of sentence classifiers, and
noun phrase classifiers to extract role fillers.
These modules are organized as a pipeline to
gradually zero in on event-related information.
We present results on the MUC-4 event ex-
traction data set and show that this model per-
forms better than previous systems.
