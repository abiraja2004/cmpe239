This paper introduces an unsupervised vector
approach to disambiguate words in biomedi-
cal text that can be applied to all-word dis-
ambiguation. We explore using contextual
information from the Unified Medical Lan-
guage System (UMLS) to describe the pos-
sible senses of a word. We experiment with
automatically creating individualized stoplists
to help reduce the noise in our dataset. We
compare our results to SenseClusters and
Humphrey et al (2006) using the NLM-WSD
dataset and with SenseClusters using con-
flated data from the 2005 Medline Baseline.
