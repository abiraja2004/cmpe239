We describe a process for automatically
detecting decision-making sub-dialogues
in multi-party, human-human meetings in
real-time. Our basic approach to decision
detection involves distinguishing between
different utterance types based on the roles
that they play in the formulation of a de-
cision. In this paper, we describe how this
approach can be implemented in real-time,
and show that the resulting system?s per-
formance compares well with other detec-
tors, including an off-line version.
