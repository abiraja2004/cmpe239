intricate and complex task. In natural languages, 
sentences are usually part of discourse units just as 
words are part of sentences. Anaphora resolution 
plays a significant role in discourse analysis for 
chopping larger discourse units into smaller ones. 
This process is done for the purpose of better 
understanding and making easier the further 
processing of text by computer. 
This paper is focused on the discussion of 
various factors and their optimal order that play an 
important role in personal anaphora resolution in 
Urdu. Algorithms are developed that resolves 
pronominal anaphoric devices with 77-80% 
success rate.
