This work describes the participation of the
WBI-DDI team on the SemEval 2013 ? Task
9.2 DDI extraction challenge. The task con-
sisted of extracting interactions between pairs
of drugs from two collections of documents
(DrugBank and MEDLINE) and their clas-
sification into four subtypes: advise, effect,
mechanism, and int. We developed a two-step
approach in which pairs are initially extracted
using ensembles of up to five different clas-
sifiers and then relabeled to one of the four
categories. Our approach achieved the sec-
ond rank in the DDI competition. For interac-
tion detection we achieved F1 measures rang-
ing from 73 % to almost 76 % depending on
the run. These results are on par or even higher
than the performance estimation on the train-
ing dataset. When considering the four inter-
action subtypes we achieved an F1 measure of
60.9 %.
