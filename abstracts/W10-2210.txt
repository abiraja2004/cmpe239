We consider morphology learning in a
semi-supervised setting, where a small
set of linguistic gold standard analyses is
available. We extend Morfessor Base-
line, which is a method for unsupervised
morphological segmentation, to this task.
We show that known linguistic segmenta-
tions can be exploited by adding them into
the data likelihood function and optimiz-
ing separate weights for unlabeled and la-
beled data. Experiments on English and
Finnish are presented with varying amount
of labeled data. Results of the linguis-
tic evaluation of Morpho Challenge im-
prove rapidly already with small amounts
of labeled data, surpassing the state-of-
the-art unsupervised methods at 1000 la-
beled words for English and at 100 labeled
words for Finnish.
