 
Community-based question answering 
(cQA) services have accumulated millions 
of questions and their answers over time. 
In the process of accumulation, cQA ser-
vices assume that questions always have 
unique best answers. However, with an in-
depth analysis of questions and answers 
on cQA services, we find that the assump-
tion cannot be true. According to the anal-
ysis, at least 78% of the cQA best answers 
are reusable when similar questions are 
asked again, but no more than 48% of 
them are indeed the unique best answers. 
We conduct the analysis by proposing 
taxonomies for cQA questions and an-
swers. To better reuse the cQA content, 
we also propose applying automatic sum-
marization techniques to summarize an-
swers. Our results show that question-type 
oriented summarization techniques can 
improve cQA answer quality significantly.
