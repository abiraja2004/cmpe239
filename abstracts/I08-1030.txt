We propose a general approach for trans-
lating Chinese unknown words (UNK) for
SMT. This approach takes advantage of
the properties of Chinese word composition
rules, i.e., all Chinese words are formed
by sequential characters. According to the
proposed approach, the unknown word is
re-split into a subword sequence followed
by subword translation with a subword-
based translation model. ?Subword? is a
unit between character and long word. We
found the proposed approach significantly
improved translation quality on the test data
of NIST MT04 and MT05. We also found
that the translation quality was further im-
proved if we applied named entity transla-
tion to translate parts of unknown words be-
fore using the subword-based translation.
