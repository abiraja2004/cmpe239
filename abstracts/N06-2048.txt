Abstract 
Images (i.e., figures or tables) are important ex-
perimental results that are typically reported in 
bioscience full-text articles. Biologists need to 
access the images to validate research facts and 
to formulate or to test novel research hypothe-
ses. We designed, evaluated, and implemented a 
novel user-interface, BioEx, that allows biolo-
gists to access images that appear in a full-text 
article directly from the abstract of the article.
