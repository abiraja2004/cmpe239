State-of-the-art computer-assisted transla-
tion engines are based on a statistical pre-
diction engine, which interactively pro-
vides completions to what a human trans-
lator types. The integration of human
speech into a computer-assisted system is
also a challenging area and is the aim of
this paper. So far, only a few methods
for integrating statistical machine transla-
tion (MT) models with automatic speech
recognition (ASR) models have been stud-
ied. They were mainly based on N -
best rescoring approach. N -best rescor-
ing is not an appropriate search method
for building a real-time prediction engine.
In this paper, we study the incorporation
of MT models and ASR models using
finite-state automata. We also propose
some transducers based on MT models for
rescoring the ASR word graphs.
