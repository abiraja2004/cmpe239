Automatically deriving semantic structures
from text is a challenging task for machine
learning. The flat feature representations, usu-
ally used in learning models, can only partially
describe structured data. This makes difficult
the processing of the semantic information that
is embedded into parse-trees.
In this paper a new kernel for automatic clas-
sification of predicate arguments has been de-
signed and experimented. It is based on sub-
parse-trees annotated with predicate argument
information from PropBank corpus. This ker-
nel, exploiting the convolution properties of
the parse-tree kernel, enables us to learn which
syntactic structures can be associated with the
arguments defined in PropBank. Support Vec-
tor Machines (SVMs) using such a kernel clas-
sify arguments with a better accuracy than
SVMs based on linear kernel.
