 
In this paper, we introduce our counseling dia-
log system. Our system interacts with users by 
recognizing what the users say, predicting the 
context, and following the users? feelings. For 
this interaction, our system follows three basic 
counseling techniques: paraphrasing, asking 
open questions, and reflecting feelings. To fol-
low counseling techniques, we extracted 
5W1H information and user emotions from 
user utterances, and we generated system ut-
terances while using the counseling techniques. 
We used the conditional random field algo-
rithm to extract 5W1H information, and con-
structed our counseling algorithm using a dia-
log strategy that was based on counseling 
techniques. A total of 16 adults tested our sys-
tem and rated it with a higher score as an in-
teractive communicator compared with the 
baseline system.
