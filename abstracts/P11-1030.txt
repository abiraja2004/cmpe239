This paper proposes the use of local his-
tograms (LH) over character n-grams for au-
thorship attribution (AA). LHs are enriched
histogram representations that preserve se-
quential information in documents; they have
been successfully used for text categorization
and document visualization using word his-
tograms. In this work we explore the suitabil-
ity of LHs over n-grams at the character-level
for AA. We show that LHs are particularly
helpful for AA, because they provide useful
information for uncovering, to some extent,
the writing style of authors. We report experi-
mental results in AA data sets that confirm that
LHs over character n-grams are more help-
ful for AA than the usual global histograms,
yielding results far superior to state of the art
approaches. We found that LHs are even more
advantageous in challenging conditions, such
as having imbalanced and small training sets.
Our results motivate further research on the
use of LHs for modeling the writing style of
authors for related tasks, such as authorship
verification and plagiarism detection.
