Regression testing of natural language sys-
tems is problematic for two main reasons:
component input and output is complex, and
system behaviour is context-dependent. We
have developed a generic approach which
solves both of these issues. We describe our
regression tool, CONTEST, which supports
context-dependent testing of dialogue system
components, and discuss the regression test
sets we developed, designed to effectively iso-
late components from changes and problems
earlier in the pipeline. We believe that the
same approach can be used in regression test-
ing for other dialogue systems, as well as in
testing any complex NLP system containing
multiple components.
