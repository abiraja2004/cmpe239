 
Idioms are not only interesting but also 
distinctive in a language for its continuity 
and metaphorical meaning in its context. 
This paper introduces the construction of 
a Chinese idiom knowledge base by the 
Institute of Computational Linguistics at 
Peking University and describes an 
experiment that aims at the automatic 
emotion classification of Chinese idioms. 
In the process, we expect to know more 
about how the constituents in a fossilized 
composition like an idiom function so as 
to affect its semantic or grammatical 
properties. As an important Chinese 
language resource, our idiom knowledge 
base will play a major role in applications 
such as linguistic research, teaching 
Chinese as a foreign language and even as 
a tool for preserving this non-material 
Chinese cultural and historical heritage.
