 
This paper summarizes a largely automated 
method that uses online post-editing feed-
back to automatically improve translation 
rules. As a starting point, bilingual speak-
ers? local fixes are collected through an 
online Translation Correction Tool. Next, 
the Rule Refinement Module attacks the 
problem at its core and uses the local fixes 
to detect incorrect rules that need to be re-
fined. Once the grammar and lexicon have 
been refined, the Machine Translation sys-
tem not only produces the correct transla-
tion as fixed by the bilingual speaker, but is 
also able to generalize and correctly trans-
lates similar sentences. Thus, this work 
constitutes a novel approach to improving 
translation quality. Enhanced by the reach-
ing power of the Internet, our approach be-
comes even more relevant to address the 
problem of how to automatically improve 
the quality of Machine Translation output.
