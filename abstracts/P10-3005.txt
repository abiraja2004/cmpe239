The translation of sentiment information
is a task from which sentiment analy-
sis systems can benefit. We present a
novel, graph-based approach using Sim-
Rank, a well-established vertex similar-
ity algorithm to transfer sentiment infor-
mation between a source language and a
target language graph. We evaluate this
method in comparison with SO-PMI.
