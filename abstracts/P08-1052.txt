We present a simple linguistically-motivated
method for characterizing the semantic rela-
tions that hold between two nouns. The ap-
proach leverages the vast size of the Web
in order to build lexically-specific features.
The main idea is to look for verbs, preposi-
tions, and coordinating conjunctions that can
help make explicit the hidden relations be-
tween the target nouns. Using these fea-
tures in instance-based classifiers, we demon-
strate state-of-the-art results on various rela-
tional similarity problems, including mapping
noun-modifier pairs to abstract relations like
TIME, LOCATION and CONTAINER, charac-
terizing noun-noun compounds in terms of ab-
stract linguistic predicates like CAUSE, USE,
and FROM, classifying the relations between
nominals in context, and solving SAT verbal
analogy problems. In essence, the approach
puts together some existing ideas, showing
that they apply generally to various semantic
tasks, finding that verbs are especially useful
features.
