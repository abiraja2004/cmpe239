This paper describes the two algorithms
we developed for the CoNLL 2008 Shared
Task ?Joint learning of syntactic and se-
mantic dependencies?. Both algorithms
start parsing the sentence using the same
syntactic parser. The first algorithm
uses machine learning methods to identify
the semantic dependencies in four stages:
identification and labeling of predicates,
identification and labeling of arguments.
The second algorithm uses a generative
probabilistic model, choosing the seman-
tic dependencies that maximize the proba-
bility with respect to the model. A hybrid
algorithm combining the best stages of
the two algorithms attains 86.62% labeled
syntactic attachment accuracy, 73.24% la-
beled semantic dependency F1 and 79.93%
labeled macro F1 score for the combined
WSJ and Brown test sets1.
