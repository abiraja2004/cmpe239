 
This paper presents a method to combine 
a set of unsupervised algorithms that can 
accurately disambiguate word senses in a 
large, completely untagged corpus. Al- 
though most of the techniques for word 
sense resolution have been presented as 
stand-alone, it is our belief that full-fledged 
lexical ambiguity resolution should com- 
bine several information sources and tech- 
niques. The set of techniques have been 
applied in a combined way to disambiguate 
the genus terms of two machine-readable 
dictionaries (MRD), enabling us to con- 
struct complete taxonomies for Spanish 
and French. Tested accuracy is above 80% 
overall and 95% for two-way ambiguous 
genus terms, showing that taxonomy build- 
ing is not limited to structured ictionaries 
such as LDOCE.
