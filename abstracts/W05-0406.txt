In this paper, we present a machine learn-
ing system for identifying non-referential
it. Types of non-referential it are ex-
amined to determine relevant linguistic
patterns. The patterns are incorporated
as features in a machine learning system
which performs a binary classification of
it as referential or non-referential in a
POS-tagged corpus. The selection of rel-
evant, generalized patterns leads to a sig-
nificant improvement in performance.
