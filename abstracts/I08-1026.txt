 
To relax the Term Independence Assump-
tion, Term Dependency is introduced and it 
has improved retrieval precision dramati-
cally. There are two kinds of term depend-
encies, one is defined by term proximity, 
and the other is defined by linguistic de-
pendencies. In this paper, we take a com-
parative study to re-examine these two 
kinds of term dependencies in dependence 
language model framework. Syntactic rela-
tionships, derived from a dependency 
parser, Minipar, are used as linguistic term 
dependencies. Our study shows: 1) Lin-
guistic dependencies get a better result than 
term proximity. 2) Dependence retrieval 
model achieves more improvement in sen-
tence-based verbose queries than keyword-
based short queries.
