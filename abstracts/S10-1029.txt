 
This paper provides a description of the Hong 
Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) System 
that participated in the task #5 of SemEval-2, 
i.e., the Automatic Keyphrase Extraction from 
Scientific Articles task. We followed a novel 
framework to develop our keyphrase 
extraction system, motivated by differentiating 
the roles of the words in a keyphrase. We first 
identified the core words which are defined as 
the most essential words in the article, and 
then expanded the identified core words to the 
target keyphrases by a word expansion 
approach.
