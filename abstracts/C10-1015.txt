We generalize the task of finding question
paraphrases in a question repository to a
novel formulation in which known ques-
tions are ranked based on their utility to
a new, reference question. We manually
annotate a dataset of 60 groups of ques-
tions with a partial order relation reflect-
ing the relative utility of questions inside
each group, and use it to evaluate mean-
ing and structure aware utility functions.
Experimental evaluation demonstrates the
importance of using structural informa-
tion in estimating the relative usefulness
of questions, holding the promise of in-
creased usability for social QA sites.
