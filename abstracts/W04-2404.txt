The success of supervised learning approaches
to word sense disambiguation is largely de-
pendent on the features used to represent the
context in which an ambiguous word occurs.
Previous work has reached mixed conclusions;
some suggest that combinations of syntactic
and lexical features will perform most effec-
tively. However, others have shown that sim-
ple lexical features perform well on their own.
This paper evaluates the effect of using differ-
ent lexical and syntactic features both individu-
ally and in combination. We show that it is pos-
sible for a very simple ensemble that utilizes a
single lexical feature and a sequence of part of
speech features to result in disambiguation ac-
curacy that is near state of the art.
