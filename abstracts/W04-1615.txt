 
FarsiSum is an attempt to create an automatic 
text summarization system for Persian. The 
system is implemented as a HTTP 
client/server application written in Perl. It uses 
modules implemented in an existing 
summarizer geared towards the Germanic 
languages, a Persian stop-list in Unicode 
format and a small set of heuristic rules.
