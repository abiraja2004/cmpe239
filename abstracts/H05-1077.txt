This paper uses human verb associations
as the basis for an investigation of verb
properties, focusing on semantic verb re-
lations and prominent nominal features.
First, the lexical semantic taxonymy Ger-
maNet is checked on the types of clas-
sic semantic relations in our data; verb-
verb pairs not covered by GermaNet can
help to detect missing links in the tax-
onomy, and provide a useful basis for
defining non-classical relations. Second,
a statistical grammar is used for determin-
ing the conceptual roles of the noun re-
sponses. We present prominent syntax-
semantic roles and evidence for the useful-
ness of co-occurrence information in dis-
tributional verb descriptions.
