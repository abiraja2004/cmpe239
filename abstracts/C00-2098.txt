 
This paper describes a hybrid approach to 
spontaneous speech parsing. The implelnented 
parser uses an extended probabilistic LR parsing 
model with rich context and its output is post- 
processed by a symbolic tree transformation routine 
that tries to eliminate systematic errors of the 
parser. The parser has been trained for three 
different languages and was successflflly integrated 
in tile Verbmobil speech-to-speech translation 
system. The parser achieves more than 90%/90% 
labeled precision/recall on pmsed Verbmobil 
utterances while 3% of German and 5% of all 
English input caunot be parsed.
