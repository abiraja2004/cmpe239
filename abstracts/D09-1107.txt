We present a new phrase-based con-
ditional exponential family translation
model for statistical machine translation.
The model operates on a feature repre-
sentation in which sentence level transla-
tions are represented by enumerating all
the known phrase level translations that
occur inside them. This makes the model
a good match with the commonly used
phrase extraction heuristics. The model?s
predictions are properly normalized prob-
abilities. In addition, the model automati-
cally takes into account information pro-
vided by phrase overlaps, and does not
suffer from reference translation reacha-
bility problems.
We have implemented an open source
translation system Sinuhe based on the
proposed translation model. Our experi-
ments on Europarl and GigaFrEn corpora
demonstrate that finding the unique MAP
parameters for the model on large scale
data is feasible with simple stochastic gra-
dient methods. Sinuhe is fast and mem-
ory efficient, and the BLEU scores ob-
tained by it are only slightly inferior to
those of Moses.
