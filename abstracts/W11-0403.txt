This paper makes two contributions. First, we
describe the Hindi Proposition Bank that con-
tains annotations of predicate argument struc-
tures of verb predicates. Unlike PropBanks
in most other languages, the Hind PropBank
is annotated on top of dependency structure,
the Hindi Dependency Treebank. We explore
the similarities between dependency and pred-
icate argument structures, so the PropBank an-
notation can be faster and more accurate. Sec-
ond, we present a probabilistic rule-based sys-
tem that maps syntactic dependents to seman-
tic arguments. With simple rules, we classify
about 47% of the entire PropBank arguments
with over 90% confidence. These preliminary
results are promising; they show how well
these two frameworks are correlated. This can
also be used to speed up our annotations.
