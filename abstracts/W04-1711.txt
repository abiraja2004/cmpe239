 
This paper looks at how Computational 
Linguistics (CL) and Natural Language Processing 
(NLP) resources can be deployed in Computer-
Assisted Language Learning (CALL) materials for 
primary school learners.  We draw a broad 
distinction between CL and NLP technology and 
briefly review the use of CL/NLP in e-Learning in 
general, how it has been deployed in CALL to date 
and specifically in the primary school context.  We 
outline how CL/NLP resources can be used in a 
project to teach Irish and German to primary 
school children in Ireland. This paper focuses on 
the use of Finite State morphological analysis 
(FST) resources for Irish and Part of Speech (POS) 
taggers for German.
