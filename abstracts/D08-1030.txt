The Named Entity Recognition (NER) task
has been garnering significant attention in
NLP as it helps improve the performance
of many natural language processing applica-
tions. In this paper, we investigate the im-
pact of using different sets of features in two
discriminative machine learning frameworks,
namely, Support Vector Machines and Condi-
tional Random Fields using Arabic data. We
explore lexical, contextual and morphological
features on eight standardized data-sets of dif-
ferent genres. We measure the impact of the
different features in isolation, rank them ac-
cording to their impact for each named entity
class and incrementally combine them in or-
der to infer the optimal machine learning ap-
proach and feature set. Our system yields a
performance of F?=1-measure=83.5 on ACE
2003 Broadcast News data.
