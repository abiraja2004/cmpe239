We address the rating-inference problem,
wherein rather than simply decide whether
a review is ?thumbs up? or ?thumbs
down?, as in previous sentiment analy-
sis work, one must determine an author?s
evaluation with respect to a multi-point
scale (e.g., one to five ?stars?). This task
represents an interesting twist on stan-
dard multi-class text categorization be-
cause there are several different degrees
of similarity between class labels; for ex-
ample, ?three stars? is intuitively closer to
?four stars? than to ?one star?.
We first evaluate human performance at
the task. Then, we apply a meta-
algorithm, based on a metric labeling for-
mulation of the problem, that alters a
given  -ary classifier?s output in an ex-
plicit attempt to ensure that similar items
receive similar labels. We show that
the meta-algorithm can provide signifi-
cant improvements over both multi-class
and regression versions of SVMs when we
employ a novel similarity measure appro-
priate to the problem.
