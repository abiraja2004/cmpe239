In this paper, we explore two extensions
to an existing statistical parsing model to
produce richer parse trees, annotated with
function labels. We achieve significant
improvements in parsing by modelling di-
rectly the specific nature of function la-
bels, as both expressions of the lexical se-
mantics properties of a constituent and as
syntactic elements whose distribution is
subject to structural locality constraints.
We also reach state-of-the-art accuracy
on function labelling. Our results sug-
gest that current statistical parsing meth-
ods are sufficiently robust to produce ac-
curate shallow functional or semantic an-
notation, if appropriately biased.
