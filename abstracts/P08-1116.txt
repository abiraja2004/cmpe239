This paper proposes a novel method that ex-
ploits multiple resources to improve statisti-
cal machine translation (SMT) based para-
phrasing. In detail, a phrasal paraphrase ta-
ble and a feature function are derived from
each resource, which are then combined in a
log-linear SMT model for sentence-level para-
phrase generation. Experimental results show
that the SMT-based paraphrasing model can
be enhanced using multiple resources. The
phrase-level and sentence-level precision of
the generated paraphrases are above 60% and
55%, respectively. In addition, the contribu-
tion of each resource is evaluated, which indi-
cates that all the exploited resources are useful
for generating paraphrases of high quality.
