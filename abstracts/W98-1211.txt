ments of linguistic theory are used in statisti- 
cal language learning, and why the extracted 
language models look like they do. The study 
indicates that some linguistic elements, uch as 
the notion of a word, are simply too useful to 
be ignored. The second most important factor 
seems to be features inherited from the origi- 
nal task for which the technique was used, for 
example using hidden Markov models for part- 
of-speech tagging, rather than speech recogni- 
tion. The two remaining important factors are 
properties of the runtime processing scheme 
employing the extracted language model, and 
the properties of the available corpus resources 
to which the statistical learning techniques are 
applied. Deliberate attempts to include lin- 
guistic theory seem to end up in a fifth place.
