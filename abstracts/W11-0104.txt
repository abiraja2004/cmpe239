This paper explores the role played by a multilingual feature representation for the task of word
sense disambiguation. We translate the context of an ambiguous word in multiple languages, and
show through experiments on standard datasets that by using a multilingual vector space we can
obtain error rate reductions of up to 25%, as compared to a monolingual classifier.
