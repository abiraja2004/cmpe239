We present Likey, a language-independent
keyphrase extraction method based on sta-
tistical analysis and the use of a reference
corpus. Likey has a very light-weight pre-
processing phase and no parameters to be
tuned. Thus, it is not restricted to any sin-
gle language or language family. We test
Likey having exactly the same configura-
tion with 11 European languages. Further-
more, we present an automatic evaluation
method based on Wikipedia intra-linking.
