This paper presents a corpus study that ex-
plores the extent to which captions con-
tribute to recognizing the intended mes-
sage of an information graphic. It then
presents an implemented graphic interpre-
tation system that takes into account a va-
riety of communicative signals, and an
evaluation study showing that evidence
obtained from shallow processing of the
graphic?s caption has a significant impact
on the system?s success. This work is part
of a larger project whose goal is to provide
sight-impaired users with effective access
to information graphics.
