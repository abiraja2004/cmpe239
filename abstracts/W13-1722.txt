We introduce a cognitive framework for mea-
suring reading comprehension that includes
the use of novel summary writing tasks. We
derive NLP features from the holistic rubric
used to score the summaries written by stu-
dents for such tasks and use them to design a
preliminary, automated scoring system. Our
results show that the automated approach per-
forms well on summaries written by students
for two different passages.
