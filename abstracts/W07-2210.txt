 
We try to improve the classifier-based de-
terministic dependency parsing in two 
ways: by introducing a better search 
method based on a non-deterministic nbest  
algorithm and by devising a series of lin-
guistically richer models. It is experimen-
tally shown on a ConLL 2007 shared task 
that this results in a system with higher per-
formance while still keeping it simple 
enough for an efficient implementation.
