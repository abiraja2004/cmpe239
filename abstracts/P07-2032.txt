Assessing the quality of user generated con-
tent is an important problem for many web
forums. While quality is currently assessed
manually, we propose an algorithm to as-
sess the quality of forum posts automati-
cally and test it on data provided by Nab-
ble.com. We use state-of-the-art classifi-
cation techniques and experiment with five
feature classes: Surface, Lexical, Syntactic,
Forum specific and Similarity features. We
achieve an accuracy of 89% on the task of
automatically assessing post quality in the
software domain using forum specific fea-
tures. Without forum specific features, we
achieve an accuracy of 82%.
