This paper describes three systems: the
Chinese word segmentation (WS) system,
the named entity recognition (NER) sys-
tem and the Part-of-Speech tagging (POS)
system, which are submitted to the Fourth
International Chinese Language Processing
Bakeoff. Here, Conditional Random Fields
(CRFs) are employed as the primary mod-
els. For the WS and NER tracks, the n-
gram language model is incorporated in our
CRFs based systems in order to take into ac-
count the higher level language information.
Furthermore, to improve the performances
of our submitted systems, a transformation-
based learning (TBL) technique is adopted
for post-processing.
