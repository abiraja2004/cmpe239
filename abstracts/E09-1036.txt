This paper presents an application of finite
state transducers weighted with feature
structure descriptions, following Amtrup
(2003), to the morphology of the Semitic
language Tigrinya. It is shown that
feature-structure weights provide an effi-
cient way of handling the templatic mor-
phology that characterizes Semitic verb
stems as well as the long-distance de-
pendencies characterizing the complex
Tigrinya verb morphotactics. A relatively
complete computational implementation
of Tigrinya verb morphology is described.
