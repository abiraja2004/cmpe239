We present two machine learning ap-
proaches to information extraction from
semi-structured documents that can be used
if no annotated training data are available,
but there does exist a database filled with
information derived from the type of docu-
ments to be processed. One approach em-
ploys standard supervised learning for infor-
mation extraction by artificially constructing
labelled training data from the contents of
the database. The second approach com-
bines unsupervised Hidden Markov mod-
elling with language models. Empirical
evaluation of both systems suggests that it is
possible to bootstrap a field segmenter from
a database alone. The combination of Hid-
den Markov and language modelling was
found to perform best at this task.
