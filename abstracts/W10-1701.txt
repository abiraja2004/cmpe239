We present a word alignment framework
that can incorporate partial manual align-
ments. The core of the approach is a
novel semi-supervised algorithm extend-
ing the widely used IBM Models with
a constrained EM algorithm. The par-
tial manual alignments can be obtained
by human labelling or automatically by
high-precision-low-recall heuristics. We
demonstrate the usages of both methods
by selecting alignment links from manu-
ally aligned corpus and apply links gen-
erated from bilingual dictionary on unla-
belled data. For the first method, we con-
duct controlled experiments on Chinese-
English and Arabic-English translation
tasks to compare the quality of word align-
ment, and to measure effects of two differ-
ent methods in selecting alignment links
from manually aligned corpus. For the
second method, we experimented with
moderate-scale Chinese-English transla-
tion task. The experiment results show an
average improvement of 0.33 BLEU point
across 8 test sets.
