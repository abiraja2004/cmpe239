 
The evaluative character of a word is called its 
semantic orientation (SO). A positive SO 
indicates desirability (e.g. Good, Honest) and 
a negative SO indicates undesirability (e.g., 
Bad, Ugly). This paper presents a method, 
based on Turney (2003), for inferring the SO 
of a word from its statistical association with 
strongly-polarized words and morphemes in 
Chinese. It is noted that morphemes are much 
less numerous than words, and that also a 
small number of fundamental morphemes may 
be used in the modified system to great 
advantage. The algorithm was tested on 1,249 
words (604 positive and 645 negative) in a 
corpus of 34 million words, and was run with 
20 and 40 polarized words respectively, giving 
a high precision (79.96% to 81.05%), but a 
low recall (45.56% to 59.57%). The algorithm 
was then run with 20 polarized morphemes, or 
single characters, in the same corpus, giving a 
high precision of 80.23% and a high recall of 
85.03%. We concluded that morphemes in 
Chinese, as in any language, constitute a dis-
tinct sub-lexical unit which, though small in 
number, has greater linguistic significance 
than words, as seen by the significant en-
hancement of results with a much smaller 
corpus than that required by Turney.
