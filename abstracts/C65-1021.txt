. The purpose of this paper is to help linguists contruct a consistent, 
sufficient and less redundant syntax of language. 
An acceptable string corresponds to an expression or an utterance: it may 
be a natural text, a string of morphemes, a tree structure or any kind of 
representation. A sharp distinction is made between the syntactic function 
which is an attrib trin s and the distribution class which is a set of 
strings. Syntactic function of a continuous or discontinuous string is defined 
as the set of all the acceptable contexts of the string, and is called a com- 
plete neighborhood. Two contexts are equivalent if they accept or reject any 
given string at the same time. An elementary neighborhood is the set of all 
contexts equivalent to one context. 
Four simple distribution classes are proposed and their properties are discussed. 
Concatenation rules of a language can be described in terms of concatenated 
complete neighborhoods or concatenated distribution classes. Some possible 
representations and their consequences are discussed. 
Transformational rules are also described in a similar way. However, 
there is another problem of correspondence of original strings to their trans- 
forms. It is useful to establish subsets of elementary neighborhoods and this 
subclassification may contribute to a simplification of the clumsy represent- 
ation of derivational history. 
Finally, some trivial but practically useful conventions are described.
