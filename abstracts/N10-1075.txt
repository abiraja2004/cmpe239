For millions of people in less resourced re-
gions of the world, text messages (SMS) pro-
vide the only regular contact with their doc-
tor. Classifying messages by medical labels
supports rapid responses to emergencies, the
early identification of epidemics and everyday
administration, but challenges include text-
brevity, rich morphology, phonological vari-
ation, and limited training data. We present
a novel system that addresses these, working
with a clinic in rural Malawi and texts in the
Chichewa language. We show that model-
ing morphological and phonological variation
leads to a substantial average gain of F=0.206
and an error reduction of up to 63.8% for spe-
cific labels, relative to a baseline system opti-
mized over word-sequences. By comparison,
there is no significant gain when applying the
same system to the English translations of the
same texts/labels, emphasizing the need for
subword modeling in many languages. Lan-
guage independent morphological models per-
form as accurately as language specific mod-
els, indicating a broad deployment potential.
