We discuss results on the shared task of
Romanian-English word alignment. The
baseline technique is that of symmetrizing
two word alignments automatically gener-
ated using IBM Model 4. A simple vo-
cabulary reduction technique results in an
improvement in performance. We also
report on a new alignment model and a
new training algorithm based on alternat-
ing maximization of likelihood with mini-
mization of error rate.
