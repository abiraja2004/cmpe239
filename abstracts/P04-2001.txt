 
This paper introduces new specificity de-
termining methods for terms using com-
positional and contextual information. 
Specificity of terms is the quantity of 
domain specific information that is con-
tained in the terms. The methods are 
modeled as information theory like meas-
ures. As the methods don?t use domain 
specific information, they can be applied 
to other domains without extra processes. 
Experiments showed very promising re-
sult with the precision of 82.0% when the 
methods were applied to the terms in 
MeSH thesaurus.
