 
When aligning texts in very different languages such 
as Korean and English, structural features beyond 
word or phrase give useful intbrmation. In this pa- 
per, we present a method for selecting struetm'al 
features of two languages, from which we construct 
a model that assigns the conditional probabilities 
to corresponding tag sequences in bilingual English- 
Korean corpora. For tag sequence mapl)ing 1)etween 
two langauges, we first, define a structural feature 
fllnction which represents tatistical prol)erties of 
elnpirical distribution of a set of training samples. 
The system, based on maximmn entrol)y coneet)t, se- 
le(:ts only ti;atures that pro(luee high increases in log- 
likelihood of training salnl)les. These structurally 
mat)ped features are more informative knowledge for 
statistical machine translation t)etween English and 
Korean. Also, the inforum.tion can help to reduce the 
1)arameter sl)ace of statisti('al alignment 1)y eliminat- 
ing synta(:tically uiflikely alignmenls.
