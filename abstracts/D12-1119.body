We present a systematic analysis of exist-
ing multi-domain learning approaches with re-
spect to two questions. First, many multi-
domain learning algorithms resemble ensem-
ble learning algorithms. (1) Are multi-domain
learning improvements the result of ensemble
learning effects? Second, these algorithms are
traditionally evaluated in a balanced class la-
bel setting, although in practice many multi-
domain settings have domain-specific class
label biases. When multi-domain learning
is applied to these settings, (2) are multi-
domain methods improving because they cap-
ture domain-specific class biases? An under-
standing of these two issues presents a clearer
idea about where the field has had success in
multi-domain learning, and it suggests some
important open questions for improving be-
yond the current state of the art.
