 
This paper presents a lexicon model for subjec-
tivity description of Dutch verbs that offers a 
framework for the development of sentiment 
analysis and opinion mining applications based 
on a deep syntactic-semantic approach. The 
model aims to describe the detailed subjectivity 
relations that exist between the participants of 
the verbs, expressing multiple attitudes for each 
verb sense.  Validation is provided by an anno-
tation study that shows that these subtle subjec-
tivity relations are reliably identifiable by 
human annotators.
