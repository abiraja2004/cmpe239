In this paper we investigate the automatic
acquisition of Arabic Multiword Expres-
sions (MWE). We propose three com-
plementary approaches to extract MWEs
from available data resources. The first
approach relies on the correspondence
asymmetries between Arabic Wikipedia
titles and titles in 21 different languages.
The second approach collects English
MWEs from Princeton WordNet 3.0,
translates the collection into Arabic us-
ing Google Translate, and utilizes differ-
ent search engines to validate the output.
The third uses lexical association mea-
sures to extract MWEs from a large unan-
notated corpus. We experimentally ex-
plore the feasibility of each approach and
measure the quality and coverage of the
output against gold standards.
