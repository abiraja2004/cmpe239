Translation systems are complex, and
most metrics do little to pinpoint causes of
error or isolate system differences. We use
a simple technique to discover induction
errors, which occur when good transla-
tions are absent from model search spaces.
Our results show that a common prun-
ing heuristic drastically increases induc-
tion error, and also strongly suggest that
the search spaces of phrase-based and hi-
erarchical phrase-based models are highly
overlapping despite the well known struc-
tural differences.
