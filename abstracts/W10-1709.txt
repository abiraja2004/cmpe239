We present the Carnegie Mellon Univer-
sity Stat-XFER group submission to the
WMT 2010 shared translation task. Up-
dates to our syntax-based SMT system
mainly fell in the areas of new feature for-
mulations in the translation model and im-
proved filtering of SCFG rules. Compared
to our WMT 2009 submission, we report
a gain of 1.73 BLEU by using the new
features and decoding environment, and a
gain of up to 0.52 BLEU from improved
grammar selection.
