We present results of a novel experiment to in-
vestigate speech production in conversational
data that links speech rate to information den-
sity. We provide the first evidence for an asso-
ciation between syntactic surprisal and word
duration in recorded speech. Using the AMI
corpus which contains transcriptions of focus
group meetings with precise word durations,
we show that word durations correlate with
syntactic surprisal estimated from the incre-
mental Roark parser over and above simpler
measures, such as word duration estimated
from a state-of-the-art text-to-speech system
and word frequencies, and that the syntac-
tic surprisal estimates are better predictors of
word durations than a simpler version of sur-
prisal based on trigram probabilities. This re-
sult supports the uniform information density
(UID) hypothesis and points a way to more re-
alistic artificial speech generation.
