 
We present a system for analyzing conver-
sational data. The system includes state-of-
the-art natural language processing compo-
nents that have been modified to accom-
modate the unique nature of conversational 
data. In addition, we leverage the added 
richness of conversational data by analyz-
ing various aspects of the participants and 
their relationships to each other. Our tool 
provides users with the ability to easily 
identify topics or persons of interest, in-
cluding who talked to whom, when, entities 
that were discussed, etc. Using this tool, 
one can also isolate more complex net-
works of information: individuals who may 
have discussed the same topics but never 
talked to each other. The tool includes a UI 
that plots information over time, and a se-
mantic graph that highlights relationships 
of interest.
