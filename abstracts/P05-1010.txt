This paper defines a generative probabilis-
tic model of parse trees, which we call
PCFG-LA. This model is an extension of
PCFG in which non-terminal symbols are
augmented with latent variables. Fine-
grained CFG rules are automatically in-
duced from a parsed corpus by training a
PCFG-LA model using an EM-algorithm.
Because exact parsing with a PCFG-LA is
NP-hard, several approximations are de-
scribed and empirically compared. In ex-
periments using the Penn WSJ corpus, our
automatically trained model gave a per-
formance of 86.6% (F  , sentences  40
words), which is comparable to that of an
unlexicalized PCFG parser created using
extensive manual feature selection.
