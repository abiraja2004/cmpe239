 
We propose a new formally syntax-based 
method for statistical machine translation. 
Transductions between parsing trees are 
transformed into a problem of sequence 
tagging, which is then tackled by a search-
based structured prediction method. This 
allows us to automatically acquire transla-
tion knowledge from a parallel corpus 
without the need of complex linguistic 
parsing. This method can achieve compa-
rable results with phrase-based method 
(like Pharaoh), however, only about ten 
percent number of translation table is used. 
Experiments show that the structured pre-
diction approach for SMT is promising for 
its strong ability at combining words.
