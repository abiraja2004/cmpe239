 
Typical al)proaches to XML authoring view a XML doc- 
urnent as a mixture of structure (the tags) and surlhce 
(texl between the tags). We advoeale a radical approach 
where the surface disappears from lhe XML documenl 
altogether to be handled exclusively by rendering mech- 
anisms. This move is based on the view that the author's 
choices when authoring XML docutnciHs are best seen 
as language-i~eutral semantic decisions, that lhe SlftlC- 
lure can then be viewed as inlerlingual content, and that 
the textual oulpul  should be derived from this co)lien\[ by 
language-sl~ecific realization mechanisms, lhus assimi-

at propagating semanlic dependencies belween dil'ferenl 
parts of the st,'ucture, and, (2) current XMI. rendering 
tools are ill-suited for handling the grammatical combi- 
nation of lextual units. We present two relalcd proposals
