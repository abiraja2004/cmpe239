Dependency Parsing domain adaptation
involves adapting a dependency parser,
trained on an annotated corpus from a given
domain (e.g., newspaper articles), to work
on a different target domain (e.g., legal doc-
uments), given only an unannotated corpus
from the target domain.
We present a shift/reduce dependency
parser that can handle unlabeled sentences
in its training set using a transductive SVM
as its action selection classifier.
We illustrate the the experiments we per-
formed with this parser on a domain adap-
tation task for the Italian language.
