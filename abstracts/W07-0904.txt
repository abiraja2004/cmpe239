relevant image metadata.  Our work is situ-
ated in the art and architecture domain, 
where highly specialized technical vocabu-
lary presents challenges for NLP tech-
niques.  To extract high quality metadata, 
the problem of word sense disambiguation 
must be addressed in order to avoid leading 
the searcher to the wrong image as a result 
of ambiguous ? and thus faulty ? meta-
data.  In this paper, we present a disam-
biguation algorithm that attempts to select 
the correct sense of nouns in textual de-
scriptions of art objects, with respect to a 
rich domain-specific thesaurus, the Art and 
Architecture Thesaurus (AAT).  We per-
formed a series of intrinsic evaluations us-
ing a data set of 600 subject terms ex-
tracted from an online National Gallery of 
Art (NGA) collection of images and text.  
Our results showed that the use of external 
knowledge sources shows an improvement 
over a baseline.
