Support Vector Machines have achieved
state of the art performance in several clas-
sification tasks. In this article we apply
them to the identification and semantic an-
notation of scientific and technical termi-
nology in the domain of molecular biol-
ogy. This illustrates the extensibility of
the traditional named entity task to spe-
cial domains with extensive terminologies
such as those in medicine and related dis-
ciplines. We illustrate SVM?s capabilities
using a sample of 100 journal abstracts
texts taken from the {human, blood cell,
transcription factor} domain of MED-
LINE. Approximately 3400 terms are an-
notated and the model performs at about
74% F-score on cross-validation tests. A
detailed analysis based on empirical ev-
idence shows the contribution of various
feature sets to performance.
