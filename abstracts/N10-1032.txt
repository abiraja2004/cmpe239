I briefly describe a system for automatically
creating an implemented grammar of a natu-
ral language based on answers to a web-based
questionnaire, then present a grammar of Sa-
haptin, a language of the Pacific Northwest
with complex argument-marking and agree-
ment patterns, that was developed to test the
system. The development of this grammar
has proved useful in three ways: (1) verifying
the correct functioning of the grammar cus-
tomization system, (2) motivating the addition
of a new pattern of agreement to the system,
and (3) making detailed predictions that un-
covered gaps in the linguistic descriptions of
Sahaptin.
