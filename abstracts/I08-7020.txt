 
This paper reports our recent work of tool 
development for language resource con-
struction. To make a revision of Asian 
WordNet which is automatically generated 
by using the existing English translation 
dictionary, we propose an online collabora-
tive tool which can organize multiple trans-
lations. To support the work of syntactic 
dependency tree annotation, we develop an 
editing suite which integrates the utilities 
for word segmentation, POS tagging and 
dependency tree into a sequence of editing.
