The part-whole relation is of special im-
portance in biomedicine: structure and
process are organised along partitive axes.
Anatomy, for example, is rich in part-
whole relations. This paper reports pre-
liminary experiments on part-whole ex-
traction from a corpus of anatomy defi-
nitions, using a fully automatic iterative
algorithm to learn simple lexico-syntactic
patterns from multiword terms. The ex-
periments show that meronyms can be ex-
tracted using these patterns. A failure
analysis points out factors that could con-
tribute to improvements in both precision
and recall, including pattern generalisa-
tion, pattern pruning, and term match-
ing. The analysis gives insights into the
relationship between domain terminology
and lexical relations, and into evaluation
strategies for relation learning.
