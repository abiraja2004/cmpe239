Statistical phrase-based machine translation
requires no linguistic information beyond
word-aligned parallel corpora (Zens et al,
2002; Koehn et al, 2003). Unfortunately,
this linguistic agnosticism often produces un-
grammatical translations. Syntax, or sentence
structure, could provide guidance to phrase-
based systems, but the ?non-constituent? word
strings that phrase-based decoders manipu-
late complicate the use of most recursive syn-
tactic tools. We address these issues by
using Combinatory Categorial Grammar, or
CCG, (Steedman, 2000), which has a much
more flexible notion of constituency, thereby
providing more labels for putative non-
constituent multiword translation phrases. Us-
ing CCG parse charts, we train a syntactic
analogue of a lexicalized reordering model by
labelling phrase table entries with multiword
labels and demonstrate significant improve-
ments in translating between Urdu and En-
glish, two language pairs with divergent sen-
tence structure.
