 
The Person Cross Document Coreference sys-tems depend on the context for making deci-sions on the possible coreferences between person name mentions. The amount of context required is a parameter that varies from cor-pora to corpora, which makes it difficult for usual disambiguation methods. In this paper we show that the amount of context required can be dynamically controlled on the basis of the prior probabilities of coreference and we present a new statistical model for the compu-tation of these probabilities. The experiment we carried on a news corpus proves that the prior probabilities of coreference are an impor-tant factor for maintaining a good balance be-tween precision and recall for cross document coreference systems. 1
