We propose a new segmentation evaluation
metric, called segmentation similarity (S), that
quantifies the similarity between two segmen-
tations as the proportion of boundaries that
are not transformed when comparing them us-
ing edit distance, essentially using edit dis-
tance as a penalty function and scaling penal-
ties by segmentation size. We propose several
adapted inter-annotator agreement coefficients
which use S that are suitable for segmenta-
tion. We show that S is configurable enough
to suit a wide variety of segmentation evalua-
tions, and is an improvement upon the state of
the art. We also propose using inter-annotator
agreement coefficients to evaluate automatic
segmenters in terms of human performance.
