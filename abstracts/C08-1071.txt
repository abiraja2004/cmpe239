Self-training has been shown capable of
improving on state-of-the-art parser per-
formance (McClosky et al, 2006) despite
the conventional wisdom on the matter and
several studies to the contrary (Charniak,
1997; Steedman et al, 2003). However, it
has remained unclear when and why self-
training is helpful. In this paper, we test
four hypotheses (namely, presence of a
phase transition, impact of search errors,
value of non-generative reranker features,
and effects of unknown words). From
these experiments, we gain a better un-
derstanding of why self-training works for
parsing. Since improvements from self-
training are correlated with unknown bi-
grams and biheads but not unknown words,
the benefit of self-training appears most in-
fluenced by seeing known words in new
combinations.
