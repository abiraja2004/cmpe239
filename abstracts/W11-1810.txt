We present two related tasks of the BioNLP
Shared Tasks 2011: Bacteria Gene Renam-
ing (Rename) and Bacteria Gene Interactions
(GI). We detail the objectives, the corpus spec-
ification, the evaluation metrics, and we sum-
marize the participants? results. Both issued
from PubMed scientific literature abstracts,
the Rename task aims at extracting gene name
synonyms, and the GI task aims at extracting
genic interaction events, mainly about gene
transcriptional regulations in bacteria.
