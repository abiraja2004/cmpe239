Optimising for one grammatical representa-
tion, but evaluating over a different one is
a particular challenge for parsers and n-best
CCG parsing. We find that this mismatch
causes many n-best CCG parses to be semanti-
cally equivalent, and describe a hashing tech-
nique that eliminates this problem, improving
oracle n-best F-score by 0.7% and reranking
accuracy by 0.4%. We also present a compre-
hensive analysis of errors made by the C&C
CCG parser, providing the first breakdown of
the impact of implementation decisions, such
as supertagging, on parsing accuracy.
