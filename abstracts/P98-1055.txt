 
This paper presents a practical foreign 
language writing support ool which makes it 
much easier to utilize dictionary and example 
sentence resources. Like a Kana-Kanji 
conversion front-end processor used to input 
Japanese language text, this tool is also 
implemented as a front-end processor and 
can be combined with a wide variety of 
applications. A morphological analyzer 
automatically extracts key words from text as 
it is being input into the tool, and these words 
are used to locate information relevant to the 
input text. This information is then 
automatically displayed to the user. With this 
tool, users can concentrate better on their 
writing because much less interruption of 
their work is required for the consulting of 
dictionaries or for the retrieval of reference 
sentences. Retrieval and display may be 
conducted in any of three ways: 1) relevant 
information is retrieved and displayed 
automatically; 2) information is retrieved 
automatically but displayed only on user 
command; 3) information is both retrieved 
and displayed only on user command. The 
extent o which the retrieval and display of 
information proceeds automatically depends 
on the type of information being referenced; 
this element of the design adds to system 
efficiency. Further, by combining this tool 
with a stepped-level interactive machine 
translation function, we have created a PC 
support ool to help Japanese people write in 
English.
