Higher-order dependency features are
known to improve dependency parser ac-
curacy. We investigate the incorporation
of such features into a cube decoding
phrase-structure parser. We find consid-
erable gains in accuracy on the range of
standard metrics. What is especially in-
teresting is that we find strong, statisti-
cally significant gains on dependency re-
covery on out-of-domain tests (Brown vs.
WSJ). This suggests that higher-order de-
pendency features are not simply over-
fitting the training material.
