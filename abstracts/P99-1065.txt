which differs radically from English in at least wo 
respects: (1) it is a highly inflected language, and 
(2) it has relatively free word order. These dif- 
ferences are likely to pose new problems for tech- 
niques that have been developed on English. We 
describe our experience in building on the parsing 
model of (Collins 97). Our final results - 80% de- 
pendency accuracy - represent good progress to- 
wards the 91% accuracy of the parser on English 
(Wall Street Journal) text.
