 
In this paper, we propose a method for ex- 
tracting key paragraphs in articles based 
on the degree of context dependency. Like 
Luhn's technique, our method assumes 
that the words related to theme in an arti- 
cle appear throughout paragraphs. Our ex- 
traction technique of keywords is based on 
the degree of context dependency that how 
strongly a word is related to a given con- 
text. The results of experiments demon- 
strate the applicability of our proposed 
method.
