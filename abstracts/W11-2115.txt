This paper describes the development op-
erated into MANY for the 2011 WMT
system combination evaluation campaign.
Hypotheses from French/English and En-
glish/French MT systems were combined
with a new version of MANY, an open
source system combination software based
on confusion networks decoding currently
developed at LIUM. MANY has been up-
dated in order to optimize decoder pa-
rameters with MERT, which proves to
find better weights. The system combi-
nation yielded significant improvements in
BLEU score when applied on system com-
bination data from two languages.
