In this paper we present a system submitted to the
CoNLL Shared Task 2009 performing the identifi-
cation and labeling of syntactic and semantic depen-
dencies in multiple languages. Dependencies are
truly jointly learned, i.e. as if they were a single
task. The system works in two phases: a classifica-
tion phase in which three classifiers predict different
types of information, and a ranking phase in which
the output of the classifiers is combined.
