Existing techniques for disambiguating named
entities in text mostly focus on Wikipedia as
a target catalog of entities. Yet for many
types of entities, such as restaurants and
cult movies, relational databases exist that
contain far more extensive information than
Wikipedia. This paper introduces a new task,
called Open-Database Named-Entity Disam-
biguation (Open-DB NED), in which a system
must be able to resolve named entities to sym-
bols in an arbitrary database, without requir-
ing labeled data for each new database. We
introduce two techniques for Open-DB NED,
one based on distant supervision and the other
based on domain adaptation. In experiments
on two domains, one with poor coverage by
Wikipedia and the other with near-perfect cov-
erage, our Open-DB NED strategies outper-
form a state-of-the-art Wikipedia NED system
by over 25% in accuracy.
