 
The normal method for representing ana- 
phoric dependencies in Unification Based gram- 
mar tbrmalisms i  that of re-entrance. In this 
paper, we address the problems that this 
representational device poses when such formal- 
isms are used for translation. We demonstrate 
the inadequacies of existing proposals, and 
describe an approach which exploits the expres- 
sive possibilities of the equational constraint 
language in LFG and involves an inferential 
procedure combining undempecification in the 
statement of bilingual correspondences with the 
use of target language knowledge.
