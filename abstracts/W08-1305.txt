In the area of parser evaluation, formats
like GR and SD which are based on
dependencies, the simplest representation
of syntactic information, are proposed as
framework-independent metrics for parser
evaluation. The assumption behind these
proposals is that the simplicity of depen-
dencies would make conversion from syn-
tactic structures and semantic representa-
tions used in other formalisms to GR/SD a
easy job. But (Miyao et al, 2007) reports
that even conversion between these two
formats is not easy at all. Not to mention
that the 80% success rate of conversion
is not meaningful for parsers that boast
90% accuracy. In this paper, we make
an attempt at evaluation across frame-
works without format conversion. This
is achieved by generating a list of names
of phenomena with each parse. These
names of phenomena are matched against
the phenomena given in the gold stan-
dard. The number of matches found is used
for evaluating the parser that produces the
parses. The evaluation method is more ef-
fective than evaluation methods which in-
volve format conversion because the gen-
eration of names of phenomena from the
output of a parser loaded is done by a rec-
ognizer that has a 100% success rate of
recognizing a phenomenon illustrated by a
sentence. The success rate is made pos-
sible by the reuse of native codes: codes
