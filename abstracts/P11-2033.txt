Transition-based dependency parsers gener-
ally use heuristic decoding algorithms but can
accommodate arbitrarily rich feature represen-
tations. In this paper, we show that we can im-
prove the accuracy of such parsers by consid-
ering even richer feature sets than those em-
ployed in previous systems. In the standard
Penn Treebank setup, our novel features im-
prove attachment score form 91.4% to 92.9%,
giving the best results so far for transition-
based parsing and rivaling the best results
overall. For the Chinese Treebank, they give a
signficant improvement of the state of the art.
An open source release of our parser is freely
available.
