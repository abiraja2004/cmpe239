While large-scale corpora and various 
corpus query tools have long been recog-
nized as essential language resources, the 
value of word association norms as lan-
guage resources has been largely over-
looked. This paper conducts some initial 
comparisons of the lexical relationships 
observed within Japanese collocation da-
ta extracted from a large corpus using the 
Japanese language version of the Sketch 
Engine (SkE) tool (Srdanovi? et al, 
2008) and the relationships found within 
Japanese word association sets taken 
from the large-scale Japanese Word As-
sociation Database (JWAD) under ongo-
ing construction by Joyce (2005, 2007). 
The comparison results indicate that 
while some relationships are common to 
both linguistic resources, many lexical 
relationships are only observed in one re-
source. These findings suggest that both 
resources are necessary in order to more 
adequately cover the diverse range of 
lexical relationships. Finally, the paper 
reflects briefly on the implementation of 
association-based word-search strategies 
into electronic dictionaries proposed by 
Zock and Bilac (2004) and Zock (2006).
