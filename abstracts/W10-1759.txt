The translation model of statistical ma-
chine translation systems is trained on par-
allel data coming from various sources and
domains. These corpora are usually con-
catenated, word alignments are calculated
and phrases are extracted. This means
that the corpora are not weighted accord-
ing to their importance to the domain of
the translation task. This is in contrast
to the training of the language model for
which well known techniques are used to
weight the various sources of texts. On
a smaller granularity, the automatic cal-
culated word alignments differ in quality.
This is usually not considered when ex-
tracting phrases either.
In this paper we propose a method to auto-
matically weight the different corpora and
alignments. This is achieved with a resam-
pling technique. We report experimen-
tal results for a small (IWSLT) and large
(NIST) Arabic/English translation tasks.
In both cases, significant improvements in
the BLEU score were observed.
