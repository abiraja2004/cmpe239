We present the design of a professional mas-
ter?s program in Computational Linguistics.
This program can be completed in one-year of
full-time study, or two-three years of part-time
study. Originally designed for CS profession-
als looking for additional training, the pro-
gram has evolved in flexibility to accommo-
date students from more diverse backgrounds
and with more diverse goals.
