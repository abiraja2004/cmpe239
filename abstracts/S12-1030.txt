Discourse coherence is an important aspect of
natural language that is still understudied in
computational linguistics. Our aim is to learn
factors that constitute coherent discourse from
data, with a focus on how to realize predicate-
argument structures (PAS) in a model that ex-
ceeds the sentence level. In particular, we aim
to study the case of non-realized arguments
as a coherence inducing factor. This task can
be broken down into two subtasks. The first
aligns predicates across comparable texts, ad-
mitting partial argument structure correspon-
dence. The resulting alignments and their con-
texts can then be used for developing a coher-
ence model for argument realization.
This paper introduces a large corpus of com-
parable monolingual texts as a prerequisite for
approaching this task, including an evaluation
set with manual predicate alignments. We il-
lustrate the potential of this new resource for
the empirical investigation of discourse coher-
ence phenomena. Initial experiments on the
task of predicting predicate alignments across
text pairs show promising results. Our findings
establish that manual and automatic predicate
alignments across texts are feasible and that
our data set holds potential for empirical re-
search into a variety of discourse-related tasks.
