In this paper we describe the creation
of a consensus corpus that was obtained
through combining three individual an-
notations of the same clinical corpus in
Swedish. We used a few basic rules that
were executed automatically to create the
consensus. The corpus contains nega-
tion words, speculative words, uncertain
expressions and certain expressions. We
evaluated the consensus using it for nega-
tion and speculation cue detection. We
used Stanford NER, which is based on the
machine learning algorithm Conditional
Random Fields for the training and detec-
tion. For comparison we also used the
clinical part of the BioScope Corpus and
trained it with Stanford NER. For our clin-
ical consensus corpus in Swedish we ob-
tained a precision of 87.9 percent and a re-
call of 91.7 percent for negation cues, and
for English with the Bioscope Corpus we
obtained a precision of 97.6 percent and a
recall of 96.7 percent for negation cues.
