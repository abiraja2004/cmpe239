 
Several computational simulations have been 
proposed for how children solve the word 
segmentation problem, but most have been 
tested only on a limited number of languages, 
often only English.  In order to extend the 
cross-linguistic dimension of word segmenta-
tion research, a finite-state framework for test-
ing various models of word segmentation is 
sketched, and a very simple cue is tested in 
this framework.  Data is taken from Modern 
Greek, a language with phonological patterns 
distinct from English.  A small-scale simula-
tion shows using this cue performs signifi-
cantly better than chance. The utility and 
flexibility of the finite-state approach is con-
firmed; suggestions for improvement are 
noted and directions for future work outlined.
