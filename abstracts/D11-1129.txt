Modelling compositional meaning for sen-
tences using empirical distributional methods
has been a challenge for computational lin-
guists. We implement the abstract categorical
model of Coecke et al (2010) using data from
the BNC and evaluate it. The implementation
is based on unsupervised learning of matrices
for relational words and applying them to the
vectors of their arguments. The evaluation is
based on the word disambiguation task devel-
oped by Mitchell and Lapata (2008) for intran-
sitive sentences, and on a similar new experi-
ment designed for transitive sentences. Our
model matches the results of its competitors
in the first experiment, and betters them in the
second. The general improvement in results
with increase in syntactic complexity show-
cases the compositional power of our model.
