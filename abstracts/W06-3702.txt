 
We present a task-level evaluation of the 
French to English version of MedSLT, a 
medium-vocabulary unidirectional con-
trolled language medical speech transla-
tion system designed for doctor-patient 
diagnosis interviews. Our main goal was 
to establish task performance levels of 
novice users and compare them to expert 
users. Tests were carried out on eight 
medical students with no previous expo-
sure to the system, with each student us-
ing the system for a total of three 
sessions. By the end of the third session, 
all the students were able to use the sys-
tem confidently, with an average task 
completion time of about 4 minutes.
