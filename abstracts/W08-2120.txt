Previous work in referring expression gen-
eration has explored general purpose tech-
niques for attribute selection and surface
realization. However, most of this work
did not take into account: a) stylistic dif-
ferences between speakers; or b) trainable
surface realization approaches that com-
bine semantic and word order information.
In this paper we describe and evaluate sev-
eral end-to-end referring expression gener-
ation algorithms that take into considera-
tion speaker style and use data-driven sur-
face realization techniques.
