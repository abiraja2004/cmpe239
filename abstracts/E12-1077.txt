We present a system for the real-time gen-
eration of car navigation instructions with
landmarks. Our system relies exclusively
on freely available map data from Open-
StreetMap, organizes its output to fit into
the available time until the next driving ma-
neuver, and reacts in real time to driving er-
rors. We show that female users spend sig-
nificantly less time looking away from the
road when using our system compared to a
baseline system.
