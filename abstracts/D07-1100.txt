In this paper, we describe a two-stage multi-
lingual dependency parser used for the mul-
tilingual track of the CoNLL 2007 shared
task. The system consists of two compo-
nents: an unlabeled dependency parser us-
ing Gibbs sampling which can incorporate
sentence-level (global) features as well as
token-level (local) features, and a depen-
dency relation labeling module based on
Support Vector Machines. Experimental re-
sults show that the global features are useful
in all the languages.
