The study presented in this work is a first ef-
fort at real-time speech translation of TED
talks, a compendium of public talks with dif-
ferent speakers addressing a variety of top-
ics. We address the goal of achieving a sys-
tem that balances translation accuracy and la-
tency. In order to improve ASR performance
for our diverse data set, adaptation techniques
such as constrained model adaptation and vo-
cal tract length normalization are found to be
useful. In order to improve machine transla-
tion (MT) performance, techniques that could
be employed in real-time such as monotonic
and partial translation retention are found to
be of use. We also experiment with inserting
text segmenters of various types between ASR
and MT in a series of real-time translation ex-
periments. Among other results, our experi-
ments demonstrate that a good segmentation
is useful, and a novel conjunction-based seg-
mentation strategy improves translation qual-
ity nearly as much as other strategies such
as comma-based segmentation. It was also
found to be important to synchronize various
pipeline components in order to minimize la-
tency.
