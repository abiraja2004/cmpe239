In a large-scale project to list bibliograph-
ical references to all of the ca 7 000 lan-
guages of the world, the need arises to
automatically annotated the bibliographi-
cal entries with ISO-639-3 language iden-
tifiers. The task can be seen as a special
case of a more general Information Extrac-
tion problem: to classify short text snip-
pets in various languages into a large num-
ber of classes. We will explore supervised
and unsupervised approaches motivated by
distributional characterists of the specific
domain and availability of data sets. In
all cases, we make use of a database with
language names and identifiers. The sug-
gested methods are rigorously evaluated on
a fresh representative data set.
