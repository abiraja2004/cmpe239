The paper deals with the application of NLP
technology in e-learning. We report our re-
search on intelligent platforms for computer-
mediated education. Some of the methods de-
scribed in the paper have already taken part in
the end-user applications that are in everyday
use, others still wait for their implementation in
the form of software products. The main mes-
sage of the paper is that the language technol-
ogy, even in the imperfect form of the current
state of the art, can significantly enhance to-
day?s computer-mediated teaching and learning
activities. It is true especially for languages dif-
ferent from English, where the adopted learning
management systems often do not support even
the basic functionality of a language-oriented
search and retrieval of learning objects. As a
case study, this paper demonstrates the appli-
cation of the given ideas for e-learning materials
in Czech.
