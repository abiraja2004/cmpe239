Word co-occurrence networks are one
of the most common linguistic networks
studied in the past and they are known
to exhibit several interesting topological
characteristics. In this article, we inves-
tigate the global topological properties of
word co-occurrence networks and, in par-
ticular, present a detailed study of their
spectrum. Our experiments reveal cer-
tain universal trends found across the net-
works for seven different languages from
three different language families, which
are neither reported nor explained by any
of the previous studies and models of
word-cooccurrence networks. We hy-
pothesize that since word co-occurrences
are governed by syntactic properties of
a language, the network has much con-
strained topology than that predicted by
the previously proposed growth model. A
deeper empirical and theoretical investiga-
tion into the evolution of these networks
further suggests that they have a core-
periphery structure, where the core hardly
evolves with time and new words are only
attached to the periphery of the network.
These properties are fundamental to the
nature of word co-occurrence across lan-
guages.
