This paper presents a comparative study
of 5 different types of Word Space Mod-
els (WSMs) combined with 4 different
compositionality measures applied to the
task of automatically determining seman-
tic compositionality of word expressions.
Many combinations of WSMs and mea-
sures have never been applied to the task
before.
The study follows Biemann and Gies-
brecht (2011) who attempted to find a list
of expressions for which the composition-
ality assumption ? the meaning of an ex-
pression is determined by the meaning of
its constituents and their combination ?
does not hold. Our results are very promis-
ing and can be appreciated by those inter-
ested in WSMs, compositionality, and/or
relevant evaluation methods.
