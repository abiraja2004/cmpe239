This paper presents a tool for extrac-
ting multi-word expressions from cor-
pora in Modern Greek, which is used to-
gether with a parallel concordancer to aug-
ment the lexicon of a rule-based machine-
translation system. The tool is part of a
larger extraction system that relies, in turn,
on a multilingual parser developed over
the past decade in our laboratory. The
paper reviews the various NLP modules
and resources which enable the retrieval
of Greek multi-word expressions and their
translations: the Greek parser, its lexical
database, the extraction and concordanc-
ing system.
