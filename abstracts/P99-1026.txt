 
This paper proposes a method for incrementally un- 
derstanding user utterances whose semantic bound- 
aries are not known and responding in real time 
even before boundaries are determined. It is an 
integrated parsing and discourse processing method 
that updates the partial result of understanding word 
by word, enabling responses based on the partial 
result. This method incrementally finds plausible 
sequences of utterances that play crucial roles in 
the task execution of dialogues, and utilizes beam 
search to deal with the ambiguity of boundaries as 
well as syntactic and semantic ambiguities. The re- 
sults of a preliminary experiment demonstrate hat 
this method understands user utterances better than 
an understanding method that assumes pauses to be 
semantic boundaries.
