 
Arabic inflectional morphology requires 
infixation, prefixation and suffixation, 
giving rise to a large space of morphological 
variation. In this paper we describe an 
approach to reducing the complexity of 
Arabic morphology generation using 
discrimination trees and transformational 
rules. By decoupling the problem of stem 
changes from that of prefixes and suffixes, 
we gain a significant reduction in the 
number of rules required, as much as a 
factor of three for certain verb types. We 
focus on hollow verbs but discuss the wider 
applicability of the approach.
