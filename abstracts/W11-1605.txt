In our work we use an existing classifier to
quantify and analyze the level of specific and
general content in news documents and their
human and automatic summaries. We dis-
cover that while human abstracts contain a
more balanced mix of general and specific
content, automatic summaries are overwhelm-
ingly specific. We also provide an analysis of
summary specificity and the summary qual-
ity scores assigned by people. We find that
too much specificity could adversely affect the
quality of content in the summary. Our find-
ings give strong evidence for the need for a
new task in abstractive summarization: identi-
fication and generation of general sentences.
