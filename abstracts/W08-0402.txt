We describe a scalable decoder for parsing-
based machine translation. The decoder is
written in JAVA and implements all the es-
sential algorithms described in Chiang (2007):
chart-parsing, m-gram language model inte-
gration, beam- and cube-pruning, and unique
k-best extraction. Additionally, parallel
and distributed computing techniques are ex-
ploited to make it scalable. We also propose
an algorithm to maintain equivalent language
model states that exploits the back-off prop-
erty of m-gram language models: instead of
maintaining a separate state for each distin-
guished sequence of ?state? words, we merge
multiple states that can be made equivalent for
language model probability calculations due
to back-off. We demonstrate experimentally
that our decoder is more than 30 times faster
than a baseline decoder written in PYTHON.
We propose to release our decoder as an open-
source toolkit.
