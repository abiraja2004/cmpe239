To tackle the problem of presenting a
large number of options in spoken dia-
logue systems, we identify compelling op-
tions based on a model of user preferences,
and present tradeoffs between alternative
options explicitly. Multiple attractive op-
tions are structured such that the user can
gradually refine her request to find the
optimal tradeoff. We show that our ap-
proach presents complex tradeoffs under-
standably, increases overall user satisfac-
tion, and significantly improves the user?s
overview of the available options. More-
over, our results suggest that presenting
users with a brief summary of the irrele-
vant options increases users? confidence in
having heard about all relevant options.
