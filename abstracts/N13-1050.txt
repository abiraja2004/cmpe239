Social media texts are written in an infor-
mal style, which hinders other natural lan-
guage processing (NLP) applications such as
machine translation. Text normalization is
thus important for processing of social media
text. Previous work mostly focused on nor-
malizing words by replacing an informal word
with its formal form. In this paper, to fur-
ther improve other downstream NLP applica-
tions, we argue that other normalization oper-
ations should also be performed, e.g., missing
word recovery and punctuation correction. A
novel beam-search decoder is proposed to ef-
fectively integrate various normalization oper-
ations. Empirical results show that our system
obtains statistically significant improvements
over two strong baselines in both normaliza-
tion and translation tasks, for both Chinese
and English.
