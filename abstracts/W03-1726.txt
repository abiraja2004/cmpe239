 
In this paper, we roughly described the 
procedures of our segmentation system, 
including the methods for resolving  seg-
mentation ambiguities and identifying un-
known words. The CKIP group of 
Academia Sinica participated in testing on 
open and closed tracks of Beijing Univer-
sity (PK) and Hong Kong Cityu (HK). 
The evaluation results show our system 
performs very well in either HK open 
track or HK closed track and just accept-
able in PK tracks. Some explanations and 
analysis are presented in this paper.
