This paper discusses Korean morpho-
logical analysis and presents three
probabilistic models for morphological
analysis. Each model exploits a distinct
linguistic unit as a processing unit. The
three models can compensate for each
other?s weaknesses. Contrary to the
previous systems that depend on man-
ually constructed linguistic knowledge,
the proposed system can fully automat-
ically acquire the linguistic knowledge
from annotated corpora (e.g. part-of-
speech tagged corpora). Besides, with-
out any modification of the system, it
can be applied to other corpora having
different tagsets and annotation guide-
lines. We describe the models and
present evaluation results on three cor-
pora with a wide range of conditions.
