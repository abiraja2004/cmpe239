Most modern machine translation systems
use phrase pairs as translation units, al-
lowing for accurate modelling of phrase-
internal translation and reordering. How-
ever phrase-based approaches are much
less able to model sentence level effects
between different phrase-pairs. We pro-
pose a new model to address this im-
balance, based on a word-based Markov
model of translation which generates tar-
get translations left-to-right. Our model
encodes word and phrase level phenom-
ena by conditioning translation decisions
on previous decisions and uses a hierar-
chical Pitman-Yor Process prior to pro-
vide dynamic adaptive smoothing. This
mechanism implicitly supports not only
traditional phrase pairs, but also gapping
phrases which are non-consecutive in the
source. Our experiments on Chinese to
English and Arabic to English translation
show consistent improvements over com-
petitive baselines, of up to +3.4 BLEU.
