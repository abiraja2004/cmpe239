Automatic reading comprehension (RC)
systems can analyze a given passage and
generate/extract answers in response to
questions about the passage. The RC
passages are often constrained in their
lengths and the target answer sentence
usually occurs very few times. In order
to generate/extract a specific precise an-
swer, this paper proposes the integration
of two types of ?deep? linguistic features,
namely word dependencies and grammati-
cal relations, in a maximum entropy (ME)
framework to handle the RC task. The
proposed approach achieves 44.7% and
73.2% HumSent accuracy on the Reme-
dia and ChungHwa corpora respectively.
This result is competitive with other re-
sults reported thus far.
