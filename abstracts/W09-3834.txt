This paper discusses the performance
difference of wide-coverage parsers on
small-domain speech transcripts. Two
parsers (C&C CCG and RASP) are tested
on the speech transcripts of two different
domains (parent-child language, and pic-
ture descriptions).
The performance difference between
the domain-independent parsers and
two domain-trained parsers (MSTParser
and MEGRASP) is substantial, with a
difference of at least 30 percent point
in accuracy. Despite this gap, some of
the grammatical relations can still be
recovered reliably.
