 
Chinese parsing has received more and 
more attention, and in this paper, we use 
toolkit to perform parsing on the data of 
Tsinghua Chinese Treebank (TCT) used in 
CIPS, and we use Conditional Random 
Fields (CRFs) to train specific model for the 
head recognition. At last, we compare 
different results on different POS results.
