Adding syntactic labels to synchronous
context-free translation rules can improve
performance, but labeling with phrase struc-
ture constituents, as in GHKM (Galley et al,
2004), excludes potentially useful translation
rules. SAMT (Zollmann and Venugopal,
2006) introduces heuristics to create new
non-constituent labels, but these heuristics
introduce many complex labels and tend to
add rarely-applicable rules to the translation
grammar. We introduce a labeling scheme
based on categorial grammar, which allows
syntactic labeling of many rules with a mini-
mal, well-motivated label set. We show that
our labeling scheme performs comparably to
SAMT on an Urdu?English translation task,
yet the label set is an order of magnitude
smaller, and translation is twice as fast.
