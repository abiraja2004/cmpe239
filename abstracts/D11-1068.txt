We present the first algorithms to automat-
ically identify explicit discourse connectives
and the relations they signal for Arabic text.
First we show that, for Arabic news, most
adjacent sentences are connected via explicit
connectives in contrast to English, making the
treatment of explicit discourse connectives for
Arabic highly important. We also show that
explicit Arabic discourse connectives are far
more ambiguous than English ones, making
their treatment challenging. In the second
part of the paper, we present supervised al-
gorithms to address automatic discourse con-
nective identification and discourse relation
recognition. Our connective identifier based
on gold standard syntactic features achieves
almost human performance. In addition, an
identifier based solely on simple lexical and
automatically derived morphological and POS
features performs with high reliability, essen-
tial for languages that do not have high-quality
parsers yet. Our algorithm for recognizing dis-
course relations performs significantly better
than a baseline based on the connective sur-
face string alone and therefore reduces the am-
biguity in explicit connective interpretation.
