In this paper, we propose a novel self-
training strategy for parsing which is 
based on Treebank conversion (SSPTC). 
In SSPTC, we make full use of the 
strong points of Treebank conversion 
and self-training, and offset their 
weaknesses with each other. To provide 
good parse selection strategies which are 
needed in self-training, we score the 
automatically generated parse trees with 
parse trees in source Treebank as a 
reference. To maintain the constituency 
between source Treebank and conversion 
Treebank which is needed in Treebank 
conversion, we get the conversion trees 
with the help of self-training. In our 
experiments, SSPTC strategy is utilized 
to parse Tsinghua Chinese Treebank 
with the help of Penn Chinese Treebank. 
The results significantly outperform the 
baseline parser.
