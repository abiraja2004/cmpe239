 
This paper addresses recent results on 
Mandarin spoken dialogues and introduces 
the collection of a large Mandarin 
conversational dialogue corpus. In the 
context of data processing, principles of 
transcription are proposed and accordingly a 
transcription tool is specifically developed 
for Mandarin spoken conversations.
