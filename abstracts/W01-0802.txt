In this paper we describe a two-stage
model for content determination in
systems that summarise time series
data. The first stage involves building a
qualitative overview of the data set, and
the second involves using this
overview, together with the actual data,
to produce summaries of the time-
series data.  This model is based on our
observations of how human experts
summarise time-series data.
