This paper proposes a novel method to
refine the grammars in parsing by utiliz-
ing semantic knowledge from HowNet.
Based on the hierarchical state-split ap-
proach, which can refine grammars au-
tomatically in a data-driven manner, this
study introduces semantic knowledge into
the splitting process at two steps. Firstly,
each part-of-speech node will be anno-
tated with a semantic tag of its termi-
nal word. These new tags generated in
this step are semantic-related, which can
provide a good start for splitting. Sec-
ondly, a knowledge-based criterion is used
to supervise the hierarchical splitting of
these semantic-related tags, which can al-
leviate overfitting. The experiments are
carried out on both Chinese and English
Penn Treebank show that the refined gram-
mars with semantic knowledge can im-
prove parsing performance significantly.
Especially with respect to Chinese, our
parser achieves an F
1
score of 87.5%,
which is the best published result we are
aware of.
