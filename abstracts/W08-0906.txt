Information overload is a well-known prob-
lem which can be particularly detrimental to
learners. In this paper, we propose a method
to support learners in the information seek-
ing process which consists in answering their
questions by retrieving question paraphrases
and their corresponding answers from social
Q&A sites. Given the novelty of this kind of
data, it is crucial to get a better understand-
ing of how questions in social Q&A sites can
be automatically analysed and retrieved. We
discuss and evaluate several pre-processing
strategies and question similarity metrics, us-
ing a new question paraphrase corpus col-
lected from the WikiAnswers Q&A site. The
results show that viable performance levels of
more than 80% accuracy can be obtained for
the task of question paraphrase retrieval.
