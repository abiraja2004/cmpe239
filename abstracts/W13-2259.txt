This paper presents a dependency-
constrained hierarchical machine transla-
tion model that uses Moses open-source
toolkit for rule extraction and decoding.
Experiments are carried out for the
German-English language pair in both di-
rections for projective and non-projective
dependencies. We examine effects on
SCFG size and automatic evaluation
results when constraints are applied with
respect to projective or non-projective
dependency structures and on the source
or target language side.
