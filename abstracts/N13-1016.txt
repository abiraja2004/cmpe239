Topics generated automatically, e.g. using
LDA, are now widely used in Computational
Linguistics. Topics are normally represented
as a set of keywords, often the n terms in a
topic with the highest marginal probabilities.
We introduce an alternative approach in which
topics are represented using images. Candi-
date images for each topic are retrieved from
the web by querying a search engine using the
top n terms. The most suitable image is se-
lected from this set using a graph-based al-
gorithm which makes use of textual informa-
tion from the metadata associated with each
image and features extracted from the images
themselves. We show that the proposed ap-
proach significantly outperforms several base-
lines and can provide images that are useful to
represent a topic.
