This short paper describes the use of the
linguistic annotation available in paral-
lel PropBanks (Chinese and English) for
the enhancement of automatically derived
word alignments. Specifically, we sug-
gest ways to refine and expand word
alignments for verb-predicates by using
predicate-argument structures. Evalua-
tions demonstrate improved alignment ac-
curacies that vary by corpus type.
