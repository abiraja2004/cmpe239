Sense inventories for polysemous predicates
are often comprised by a number of related
senses. In this paper, we examine different
types of relations within sense inventories and
give a qualitative analysis of the effects they
have on decisions made by the annotators and
annotator error. We also discuss some common
traps and pitfalls in design of sense inventories.
We use the data set developed specifically for
the task of annotating sense distinctions depen-
dent predominantly on semantics of the argu-
ments and only to a lesser extent on syntactic
frame.
