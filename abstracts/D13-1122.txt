Hypernym discovery aims to extract such
noun pairs that one noun is a hypernym of
the other. Most previous methods are based
on lexical patterns but perform badly on open-
domain data. Other work extracts hypernym
relations from encyclopedias but has limited
coverage. This paper proposes a simple yet ef-
fective distant supervision framework for Chi-
nese open-domain hypernym discovery. Giv-
en an entity name, we try to discover its hy-
pernyms by leveraging knowledge from mul-
tiple sources, i.e., search engine results, ency-
clopedias, and morphology of the entity name.
First, we extract candidate hypernyms from
the above sources. Then, we apply a statistical
ranking model to select correct hypernyms. A
set of novel features is proposed for the rank-
ing model. We also present a heuristic strate-
gy to build a large-scale noisy training data for
the model without human annotation. Exper-
imental results demonstrate that our approach
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on a
manually labeled test dataset.
