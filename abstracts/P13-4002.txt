We implement a city-level geolocation
prediction system for Twitter users. The
system infers a user?s location based on
both tweet text and user-declared metadata
using a stacking approach. We demon-
strate that the stacking method substan-
tially outperforms benchmark methods,
achieving 49% accuracy on a benchmark
dataset. We further evaluate our method
on a recent crawl of Twitter data to in-
vestigate the impact of temporal factors
on model generalisation. Our results sug-
gest that user-declared location metadata
is more sensitive to temporal change than
the text of Twitter messages. We also de-
scribe two ways of accessing/demoing our
system.
