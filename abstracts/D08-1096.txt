This paper presents a graph-theoretic model of
the acquisition of lexical syntactic representa-
tions. The representations the model learns
are non-categorical or graded. We propose a
new evaluation methodology of syntactic ac-
quisition in the framework of exemplar theory.
When applied to the CHILDES corpus, the
evaluation shows that the model?s graded syn-
tactic representations perform better than pre-
viously proposed categorical representations.
