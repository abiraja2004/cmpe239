The compositionality of meaning extends
beyond the single sentence. Just as words
combine to form the meaning of sen-
tences, so do sentences combine to form
the meaning of paragraphs, dialogues and
general discourse. We introduce both a
sentence model and a discourse model cor-
responding to the two levels of composi-
tionality. The sentence model adopts con-
volution as the central operation for com-
posing semantic vectors and is based on
a novel hierarchical convolutional neural
network. The discourse model extends the
sentence model and is based on a recur-
rent neural network that is conditioned in
a novel way both on the current sentence
and on the current speaker. The discourse
model is able to capture both the sequen-
tiality of sentences and the interaction be-
tween different speakers. Without feature
engineering or pretraining and with simple
greedy decoding, the discourse model cou-
pled to the sentence model obtains state of
the art performance on a dialogue act clas-
sification experiment.
