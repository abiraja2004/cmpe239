 
The selection of features is critical in pro-
viding discriminative information for clas-
sifiers in Word Sense Disambiguation 
(WSD). Uninformative features will de-
grade the performance of classifiers. Based 
on the strong evidence that an ambiguous 
word expresses a unique sense in a given 
collocation, this paper reports our experi-
ments on automatic WSD using collocation 
as local features based on the corpus ex-
tracted from People?s Daily News (PDN) 
as well as the standard SENSEVAL-3 data 
set. Using the Na?ve Bayes classifier as our 
core algorithm, we have implemented a 
classifier using a feature set combining 
both local collocation features and topical 
features. The average precision on the 
PDN corpus has 3.2% improvement com-
pared to 81.5% of the baseline system 
where collocation features are not consid-
ered. For the SENSEVAL-3 data, we have 
reached the precision rate of 37.6% by in-
tegrating collocation features into 
contextual features, to achieve 37% im-
provement  over  26.7% of precision in the 
baseline system. Our experiments have 
shown that collocation features can be used 
to reduce the size of human tagged corpus.
