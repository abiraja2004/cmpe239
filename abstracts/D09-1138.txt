The work presented in this paper explores
a supervised method for learning a prob-
abilistic model of a lexicon of VerbNet
classes. We intend for the probabilis-
tic model to provide a probability dis-
tribution of verb-class associations, over
known and unknown verbs, including pol-
ysemous words. In our approach, train-
ing instances are obtained from an ex-
isting lexicon and/or from an annotated
corpus, while the features, which repre-
sent syntactic frames, semantic similarity,
and selectional preferences, are extracted
from unannotated corpora. Our model
is evaluated in type-level verb classifica-
tion tasks: we measure the prediction ac-
curacy of VerbNet classes for unknown
verbs, and also measure the dissimilarity
between the learned and observed proba-
bility distributions. We empirically com-
pare several settings for model learning,
while we vary the use of features, source
corpora for feature extraction, and disam-
biguated corpora. In the task of verb clas-
sification into all VerbNet classes, our best
model achieved a 10.69% error reduction
in the classification accuracy, over the pre-
viously proposed model.
