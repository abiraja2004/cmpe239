We present three ways of inducing proba-
bility distributions on derivation trees pro-
duced by Minimalist Grammars, and give
their maximum likelihood estimators. We
argue that a parameterization based on lo-
cally normalized log-linear models bal-
ances competing requirements for mod-
eling expressiveness and computational
tractability.
