We describe a synthetic method for com-
bining machine translations produced by
different systems given the same input.
One-best outputs are explicitly aligned
to remove duplicate words. Hypotheses
follow system outputs in sentence order,
switching between systems mid-sentence
to produce a combined output. Experi-
ments with the WMT 2009 tuning data
showed improvement of 2 BLEU and 1
METEOR point over the best Hungarian-
English system. Constrained to data pro-
vided by the contest, our system was sub-
mitted to the WMT 2009 shared system
combination task.
