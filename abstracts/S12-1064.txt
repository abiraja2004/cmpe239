We describe the Heidelberg University system
for the Cross-lingual Textual Entailment task
at SemEval-2012. The system relies on fea-
tures extracted with statistical machine trans-
lation methods and tools, combining mono-
lingual and cross-lingual word alignments
as well as standard textual entailment dis-
tance and bag-of-words features in a statisti-
cal learning framework. We learn separate bi-
nary classifiers for each entailment direction
and combine them to obtain four entailment
relations. Our system yielded the best overall
score for three out of four language pairs.
