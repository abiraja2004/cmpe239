Abstract
The ability to accurately model the con-
tent structure of text is important for
many natural language processing appli-
cations. This paper describes experi-
ments with generative models for analyz-
ing the discourse structure of medical ab-
stracts, which generally follow the pattern
of ?introduction?, ?methods?, ?results?,
and ?conclusions?. We demonstrate that
Hidden Markov Models are capable of ac-
curately capturing the structure of such
texts, and can achieve classification ac-
curacy comparable to that of discrimina-
tive techniques. In addition, generative
approaches provide advantages that may
make them preferable to discriminative
techniques such as Support Vector Ma-
chines under certain conditions. Our work
makes two contributions: at the applica-
tion level, we report good performance
on an interesting task in an important do-
main; more generally, our results con-
tribute to an ongoing discussion regarding
the tradeoffs between generative and dis-
criminative techniques.
