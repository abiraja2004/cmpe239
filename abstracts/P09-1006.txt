We address the issue of using heteroge-
neous treebanks for parsing by breaking
it down into two sub-problems, convert-
ing grammar formalisms of the treebanks
to the same one, and parsing on these
homogeneous treebanks. First we pro-
pose to employ an iteratively trained tar-
get grammar parser to perform grammar
formalism conversion, eliminating prede-
fined heuristic rules as required in previ-
ous methods. Then we provide two strate-
gies to refine conversion results, and adopt
a corpus weighting technique for parsing
on homogeneous treebanks. Results on the
Penn Treebank show that our conversion
method achieves 42% error reduction over
the previous best result. Evaluation on
the Penn Chinese Treebank indicates that a
converted dependency treebank helps con-
stituency parsing and the use of unlabeled
data by self-training further increases pars-
ing f-score to 85.2%, resulting in 6% error
reduction over the previous best result.
