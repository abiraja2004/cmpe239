Hindi and Urdu share a common phonol-
ogy, morphology and grammar but are
written in different scripts. In addition,
the vocabularies have also diverged signif-
icantly especially in the written form. In
this paper we show that we can get rea-
sonable quality translations (we estimated
the Translation Error rate at 18%) between
the two languages even in absence of a
parallel corpus. Linguistic resources such
as treebanks, part of speech tagged data
and parallel corpora with English are lim-
ited for both these languages. We use the
translation system to share linguistic re-
sources between the two languages. We
demonstrate improvements on three tasks
and show: statistical machine translation
from Urdu to English is improved (0.8
in BLEU score) by using a Hindi-English
parallel corpus, Hindi part of speech tag-
ging is improved (upto 6% absolute) by
using an Urdu part of speech corpus and
a Hindi-English word aligner is improved
by using a manually word aligned Urdu-
English corpus (upto 9% absolute in F-
Measure).
