In this paper, we offer broad insight
into the underperformance of Arabic con-
stituency parsing by analyzing the inter-
play of linguistic phenomena, annotation
choices, and model design. First, we iden-
tify sources of syntactic ambiguity under-
studied in the existing parsing literature.
Second, we show that although the Penn
Arabic Treebank is similar to other tree-
banks in gross statistical terms, annotation
consistency remains problematic. Third,
we develop a human interpretable gram-
mar that is competitive with a latent vari-
able PCFG. Fourth, we show how to build
better models for three different parsers.
Finally, we show that in application set-
tings, the absence of gold segmentation
lowers parsing performance by 2?5% F1.
