Formal verification techniques provide a way to determine whether regulatory doc-
uments are consistent and whether implementations conform to them. To apply
these techniques a formal description of the regulation needs to be extracted. We
present a framework, under which NLP techniques can be brought to bear, to aid
a requirements engineer in extracting the formal description.
