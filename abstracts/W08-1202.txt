We address the problem of distinguishing
between two sources of disagreement in
annotations: genuine subjectivity and slip
of attention. The latter is especially likely
when the classification task has a default
class, as in tasks where annotators need to
find instances of the phenomenon of inter-
est, such as in a metaphor detection task
discussed here. We apply and extend a data
analysis technique proposed by Beigman
Klebanov and Shamir (2006) to first dis-
till reliably deliberate (non-chance) anno-
tations and then to estimate the amount of
attention slips vs genuine disagreement in
the reliably deliberate annotations.
