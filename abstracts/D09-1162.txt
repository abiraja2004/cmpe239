Automated mining of novel documents
or sentences from chronologically ordered
documents or sentences is an open chal-
lenge in text mining. In this paper, we
describe the preprocessing techniques for
detecting novel Chinese text and discuss
the influence of different Part of Speech
(POS) filtering rules on the detection per-
formance. Experimental results on AP-
WSJ and TREC 2004 Novelty Track data
show that the Chinese novelty mining per-
formance is quite different when choosing
two dissimilar POS filtering rules. Thus,
the selection of words to represent Chinese
text is of vital importance to the success of
the Chinese novelty mining. Moreover, we
compare the Chinese novelty mining per-
formance with that of English and investi-
gate the impact of preprocessing steps on
detecting novel Chinese text, which will
be very helpful for developing a Chinese
novelty mining system.
