This work explores the utility of sentiment and
arguing opinions for classifying stances in ide-
ological debates. In order to capture arguing
opinions in ideological stance taking, we con-
struct an arguing lexicon automatically from
a manually annotated corpus. We build su-
pervised systems employing sentiment and ar-
guing opinions and their targets as features.
Our systems perform substantially better than
a distribution-based baseline. Additionally,
by employing both types of opinion features,
we are able to perform better than a unigram-
based system.
