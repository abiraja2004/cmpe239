Abstract
Referring Expression Generation (REG) is the
task that deals with references to entities ap-
pearing in a spoken or written discourse. If
these referents are organized in terms of a tax-
onomy, there are two problems when estab-
lishing a reference that would distinguish an
intended referent from its possible distractors.
The first one is the choice of the set of possible
distractrors or contrast set in the given situa-
tion. The second is to identify at what level of
the taxonomy to phrase the reference so that
it unambiguously picks out only the intended
referent, leaving all possible distractors in dif-
ferent branches of the taxonomy. We discuss
the use of ontologies to deal with the REG
task, paying special attention to the choice of
the the contrast set and to the use of the in-
formation of the ontology to select the most
appropriate type to be used for the referent.
