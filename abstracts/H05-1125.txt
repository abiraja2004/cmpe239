We present a novel voice-based human-
computer interface designed to enable in-
dividuals with motor impairments to use
vocal parameters for continuous control
tasks. Since discrete spoken commands
are ill-suited to such tasks, our interface
exploits a large set of continuous acoustic-
phonetic parameters like pitch, loudness,
vowel quality, etc. Their selection is opti-
mized with respect to automatic recogniz-
ability, communication bandwidth, learn-
ability, suitability, and ease of use. Pa-
rameters are extracted in real time, trans-
formed via adaptation and acceleration,
and converted into continuous control sig-
nals. This paper describes the basic en-
gine, prototype applications (in particu-
lar, voice-based web browsing and a con-
trolled trajectory-following task), and ini-
tial user studies confirming the feasibility
of this technology.
