Automatically identifying the polarity of
words is a very important task in Natural
Language Processing. It has applications
in text classification, text filtering, analysis
of product review, analysis of responses
to surveys, and mining online discussions.
We propose a method for identifying the
polarity of words. We apply a Markov ran-
dom walk model to a large word related-
ness graph, producing a polarity estimate
for any given word. A key advantage of
the model is its ability to accurately and
quickly assign a polarity sign and mag-
nitude to any word. The method could
be used both in a semi-supervised setting
where a training set of labeled words is
used, and in an unsupervised setting where
a handful of seeds is used to define the
two polarity classes. The method is exper-
imentally tested using a manually labeled
set of positive and negative words. It out-
performs the state of the art methods in the
semi-supervised setting. The results in the
unsupervised setting is comparable to the
best reported values. However, the pro-
posed method is faster and does not need a
large corpus.
