Literature indexing tools provide re-
searchers with a means to navigate
through the network of scholarly scientific
articles in a subject domain. We propose
that more effective indexing tools may be
designed using the links between articles
provided by citations.
With the explosion in the amount of sci-
entific literature and with the advent of ar-
tifacts requiring more sophisticated index-
ing, a means to provide more information
about the citation relation in order to give
more intelligent control to the navigation
process is warranted. In order to navigate
a citation index in this more-sophisticated
manner, the citation index must provide
not only the citation-link information, but
also must indicate the function of the cita-
tion. The design methodology of an in-
dexing tool for scholarly biomedical lit-
erature which uses the rhetorical context
surrounding the citation to provide the ci-
tation function is presented. In particular,
we discuss how the scientific method is re-
flected in scientific writing and how this
knowledge can be used to decide the pur-
pose of a citation.
