This paper describes the application of
so-called topic models to selectional pref-
erence induction. Three models related
to Latent Dirichlet Allocation, a proven
method for modelling document-word co-
occurrences, are presented and evaluated
on datasets of human plausibility judge-
ments. Compared to previously proposed
techniques, these models perform very
competitively, especially for infrequent
predicate-argument combinations where
they exceed the quality of Web-scale pre-
dictions while using relatively little data.
