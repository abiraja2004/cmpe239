A major outcome of the last Shared Tasks
for Referring Expressions Generation was
that each human prefers distinct proper-
ties, syntax and lexical units for building
referring expressions. One of the reasons
for this seems to be that entities might
be identified faster since the conversation
partner has already some knowledge about
how his conversation partner builds refer-
ring expressions. Therefore, artificial re-
ferring expressions should provide such
individual preferences as well so that they
become human like. With this contribu-
tion to the shared task, we follow this idea
again. For the development set, we got a
very good DICE score of 0.88 for the fur-
niture domain and of 0.79 for the people
domain.
