This work studies Named Entity Classi-
fication (NEC) for Catalan without mak-
ing use of large annotated resources of
this language. Two views are explored
and compared, namely exploiting solely
the Catalan resources, and a direct training
of bilingual classification models (Span-
ish and Catalan), given that a large col-
lection of annotated examples is available
for Spanish. The empirical results ob-
tained on real data point out that multi-
lingual models clearly outperform mono-
lingual ones, and that the resulting Cata-
lan NEC models are easier to improve by
bootstrapping on unlabelled data.
