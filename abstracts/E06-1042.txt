In this paper we present TroFi (Trope
Finder), a system for automatically classi-
fying literal and nonliteral usages of verbs
through nearly unsupervised word-sense
disambiguation and clustering techniques.
TroFi uses sentential context instead of
selectional constraint violations or paths
in semantic hierarchies. It also uses lit-
eral and nonliteral seed sets acquired and
cleaned without human supervision in or-
der to bootstrap learning. We adapt a
word-sense disambiguation algorithm to
our task and augment it with multiple seed
set learners, a voting schema, and addi-
tional features like SuperTags and extra-
sentential context. Detailed experiments
on hand-annotated data show that our en-
hanced algorithm outperforms the base-
line by 24.4%. Using the TroFi algo-
rithm, we also build the TroFi Example
Base, an extensible resource of annotated
literal/nonliteral examples which is freely
available to the NLP research community.
