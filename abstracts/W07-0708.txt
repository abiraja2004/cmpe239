In order to simultaneously translate speech
into multiple languages an extension of
stochastic finite-state transducers is pro-
posed. In this approach the speech trans-
lation model consists of a single network
where acoustic models (in the input) and the
multilingual model (in the output) are em-
bedded.
The multi-target model has been evaluated
in a practical situation, and the results have
been compared with those obtained using
several mono-target models. Experimental
results show that the multi-target one re-
quires less amount of memory. In addition, a
single decoding is enough to get the speech
translated into multiple languages.
