In biomedical information extraction (IE), a
central problem is the disambiguation of am-
biguous names for domain specific entities,
such as proteins, genes, etc. One important
dimension of ambiguity is the organism to
which the entities belong: in order to disam-
biguate an ambiguous entity name (e.g. a pro-
tein), it is often necessary to identify the spe-
cific organism to which it refers.
In this paper we present an approach to the
detection and disambiguation of the focus or-
ganism(s), i.e. the organism(s) which are the
subject of the research described in scientific
papers, which can then be used for the disam-
biguation of other entities.
The results are evaluated against a gold stan-
dard derived from IntAct annotations. The
evaluation suggests that the results may al-
ready be useful within a curation environment
and are certainly a baseline for more complex
approaches.
