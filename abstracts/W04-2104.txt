Lexical resources are key components for
applications related to human language technology.
Various models of lexical resources have been
designed and implemented during the last twenty
years and the scientific community has now gained
enough experience to design a common standard at
an international level. This paper thus describes the
ongoing activity within ISO/TC 37/SC 4 on LMF
(Lexical Markup Framework) and shows how it
can be concretely implemented for the design of an
on-line morphological resource for French in the
Morphalou project.
