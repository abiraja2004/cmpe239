Research on paraphrase has mostly fo-
cussed on lexical or syntactic variation
within individual sentences. Our con-
cern is with larger-scale paraphrases,
from multiple sentences or paragraphs
to entire documents. In this paper
we address the problem of generating
paraphrases of large chunks of texts.
We ground our discussion through a
worked example of extending an exist-
ing NLG system to accept as input a
source text, and to generate a range of
fluent semantically-equivalent alterna-
tives, varying not only at the lexical and
syntactic levels, but also in document
structure and layout.
