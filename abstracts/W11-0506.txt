Abstract
Information graphics (bar charts, line graphs,
etc.) in popular media generally have a dis-
course goal that contributes to achieving the
communicative intent of a multimodal docu-
ment. This paper presents our work on ab-
stractive summarization of line graphs. Our
methodology involves hypothesizing the in-
tended message of a line graph and using it
as the core of a summary of the graphic. This
core is then augmented with salient proposi-
tions that elaborate on the intended message.
