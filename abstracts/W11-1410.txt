We further work on detecting errors in post-
positional particle usage by learners of Korean
by improving the training data and develop-
ing a complete pipeline of particle selection.
We improve the data by filtering non-Korean
data and sampling instances to better match
the particle distribution. Our evaluation shows
that, while the data selection is effective, there
is much work to be done with preprocessing
and system optimization.
