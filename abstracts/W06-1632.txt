In this paper we propose a machine-
learning approach to paragraph boundary
identification which utilizes linguistically
motivated features. We investigate the re-
lation between paragraph boundaries and
discourse cues, pronominalization and in-
formation structure. We test our algorithm
on German data and report improvements
over three baselines including a reimple-
mentation of Sporleder & Lapata?s (2006)
work on paragraph segmentation. An
analysis of the features? contribution sug-
gests an interpretation of what paragraph
boundaries indicate and what they depend
on.
