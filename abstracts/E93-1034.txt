 
This paper solves some puzzles in the for- 
malisation of logic for discontinuity in cat- 
egorial grammar. A 'tuple' operation intro- 
duced in \[Solias, 1992\] is defined as a mode 
of prosodic combination which has associ- 
ated projection functions, and consequently 
can support a property of unique prosodic 
decomposability. Discontinuity operators 
are defined model-theoretically b  a resid- 
uation scheme which is particularly arn- 
menable proof-theoretically. This enables 
a formulation which both improves on the 
logic for wrapping and infixing of \[Moort- 
gat, 1988\] which is only partial, and resolves 
some problems of determinacy of insertion 
point in the application of these proposals 
to in-sits binding phenomena. A discontin- 
uons product is also defined by the residu- 
ation scheme, enabling formulation of rules 
of both use and proof or a 'substring' prod- 
uct that would have been similarly doomed 
to partial logic. 
We show how the apparatus enables char- 
acterisation of discontinous functors such 
as particle verbs and phrasal idioms, and 
binding phenomena such as quantifier ais- 
ing and pied piping. We conclude by show- 
ing how the apparatus enables asimple cat- 
egorial analysis of (SVO) gapping using the 
discontinuity product and the wrapping op- 
erator.
