We derive a spectral method for unsupervised
learning of Weighted Context Free Grammars.
We frame WCFG induction as finding a Han-
kel matrix that has low rank and is linearly
constrained to represent a function computed
by inside-outside recursions. The proposed al-
gorithm picks the grammar that agrees with a
sample and is the simplest with respect to the
nuclear norm of the Hankel matrix.
