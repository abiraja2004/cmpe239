We investigate the impact of parse quality
on a syntactically-informed statistical ma-
chine translation system applied to techni-
cal text. We vary parse quality by vary-
ing the amount of data used to train the
parser. As the amount of data increases,
parse quality improves, leading to im-
provements in machine translation output
and results that significantly outperform a
state-of-the-art phrasal baseline.
