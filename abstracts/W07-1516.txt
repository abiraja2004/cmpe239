 
In the construction of a part-of-speech an-
notated corpus, we are constrained by a 
fixed budget. A fully annotated corpus is 
required, but we can afford to label only a 
subset. We train a Maximum Entropy Mar-
kov Model tagger from a labeled subset 
and automatically tag the remainder. This 
paper addresses the question of where to 
focus our manual tagging efforts in order to 
deliver an annotation of highest quality. In 
this context, we find that active learning is 
always helpful. We focus on Query by Un-
certainty (QBU) and Query by Committee 
(QBC) and report on experiments with sev-
eral baselines and new variations of QBC 
and QBU, inspired by weaknesses particu-
lar to their use in this application. Experi-
ments on English prose and poetry test 
these approaches and evaluate their robust-
ness. The results allow us to make recom-
mendations for both types of text and raise 
questions that will lead to further inquiry.
