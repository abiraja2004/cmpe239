tern recognition and human language technol-
ogy (PRHLT) group to the system combina-
tion task of the sixth workshop on statistical
machine translation (WMT 2011). Each sub-
missions is generated by a multi-system mini-
mum Bayes risk (MBR) technique. Our tech-
nique uses the MBR decision rule and a linear
combination of the component systems? prob-
ability distributions to search for the minimum
risk translation among all the sentences in the
target language.
