 
This paper presents a system to summarize 
a Microblog post and its responses with the 
goal to provide readers a more constructive 
and concise set of information for efficient 
digestion. We introduce a novel two-phase 
summarization scheme. In the first phase, 
the post plus its responses are classified in-
to four categories based on the intention, 
interrogation, sharing, discussion and chat. 
For each type of post, in the second phase, 
we exploit different strategies, including 
opinion analysis, response pair identifica-
tion, and response relevancy detection, to 
summarize and highlight critical informa-
tion to display. This system provides an al-
ternative thinking about machine-
summarization: by utilizing AI approaches, 
computers are capable of constructing dee-
per and more user-friendly abstraction.
