We describe the SUPERSENSELEARNER
system that participated in the English all-
words disambiguation task. The system re-
lies on automatically-learned semantic mod-
els using collocational features coupled with
features extracted from the annotations of
coarse-grained semantic categories gener-
ated by an HMM tagger.
