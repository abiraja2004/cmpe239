This paper investigates some computa-
tional problems associated with proba-
bilistic translation models that have re-
cently been adopted in the literature on
machine translation. These models can be
viewed as pairs of probabilistic context-
free grammars working in a ?synchronous?
way. Two hardness results for the class
NP are reported, along with an exponen-
tial time lower-bound for certain classes
of algorithms that are currently used in the
literature.
