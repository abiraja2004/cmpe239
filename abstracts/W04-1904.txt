In this paper we address the issue of user-
adaptivity for annotation guidelines. We show
that different user groups have different needs
towards these documents, a fact neglected by
most of current annotation guidelines. We pro-
pose a formal specification of the structure of
annotation guidelines, thus suggesting a mini-
mum set of requirements that guidelines should
fulfill. Finally, we sketch the use of these speci-
fications by exemplary applications, resulting in
user-specific guideline representations.
