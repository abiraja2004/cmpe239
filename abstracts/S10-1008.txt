We describe the SemEval-2010 shared
task on ?Linking Events and Their Partic-
ipants in Discourse?. This task is an ex-
tension to the classical semantic role label-
ing task. While semantic role labeling is
traditionally viewed as a sentence-internal
task, local semantic argument structures
clearly interact with each other in a larger
context, e.g., by sharing references to spe-
cific discourse entities or events. In the
shared task we looked at one particular as-
pect of cross-sentence links between ar-
gument structures, namely linking locally
uninstantiated roles to their co-referents
in the wider discourse context (if such
co-referents exist). This task is poten-
tially beneficial for a number of NLP ap-
plications, such as information extraction,
question answering or text summarization.
