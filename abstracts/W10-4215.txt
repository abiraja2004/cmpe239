This paper proposes a method for extract-
ing high-level rules for expository dialogue
generation. The rules are extracted from di-
alogues that have been authored by expert
dialogue writers. We examine the rules that
can be extracted by this method, focusing on
whether different dialogues and authors ex-
hibit different dialogue styles.
