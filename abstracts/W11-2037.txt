Error-return plots show the rate of error
(misunderstanding) against the rate of non-
return (non-understanding) for Natural Lan-
guage Processing systems. They are a use-
ful visual tool for judging system performance
when other measures such as recall/precision
and detection-error tradeoff are less informa-
tive, specifically when a system is judged on
the correctness of its responses, but may elect
to not return a response.
