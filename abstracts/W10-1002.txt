Second language acquisition research since
the 90s has emphasized the importance of
supporting awareness of language categories
and forms, and input enhancement techniques
have been proposed to make target language
features more salient for the learner.
We present an NLP architecture and web-
based implementation providing automatic vi-
sual input enhancement for web pages. Learn-
ers freely choose the web pages they want to
read and the system displays an enhanced ver-
sion of the pages. The current system supports
visual input enhancement for several language
patterns known to be problematic for English
language learners, as well as fill-in-the-blank
and clickable versions of such pages support-
ing some learner interaction.
