 
We introduce a method for learning to 
describe the attendant contexts of a given 
query for language learning. In our 
approach, we display phraseological 
information in the form of a summary of 
general patterns as well as lexical bundles 
anchored at the query. The method 
involves syntactical analyses and inverted 
file construction. At run-time, grammatical 
constructions and their lexical 
instantiations characterizing the usage of 
the given query are generated and 
displayed, aimed at improving learners? 
deep vocabulary knowledge. We present a 
prototype system, GRASP, that applies the 
proposed method for enhanced collocation 
learning. Preliminary experiments show 
that language learners benefit more from 
GRASP than conventional dictionary 
lookup. In addition, the information 
produced by GRASP is potentially useful 
information for automatic or manual 
editing process.
