Retrieving similar questions is very
important in community-based ques-
tion answering(CQA). In this paper,
we propose a unified question retrieval
model based on latent semantic index-
ing with tensor analysis, which can cap-
ture word associations among different
parts of CQA triples simultaneously.
Thus, our method can reduce lexical
chasm of question retrieval with the
help of the information of question con-
tent and answer parts. The experimen-
tal result shows that our method out-
performs the traditional methods.
