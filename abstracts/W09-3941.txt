The freely available SPaRKy sentence
planner uses hand-written weighted rules
for sentence plan construction, and a user-
or domain-specific second-stage ranker for
sentence plan selection. However, coming
up with sentence plan construction rules
for a new domain can be difficult. In this
paper, we automatically extract sentence
plan construction rules from the RST-DT
corpus. In our rules, we use only domain-
independent features that are available to a
sentence planner at runtime. We evaluate
these rules, and outline ways in which they
can be used for sentence planning. We
have integrated them into a revised version
of SPaRKy.
