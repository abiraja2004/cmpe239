 
We provide a constraint based compu- 
tational model of linear precedence as 
employed in the HPSG grammar formal- 
ism. An extended feature logic which 
adds a wide range of constraints involv- 
ing precedence is described. A sound, 
complete and terminating deterministic 
constraint solving procedure is given. 
Deterministic omputational model is 
achieved by weakening the logic such 
that it is sufficient for linguistic appli- 
cations involving word-order.
