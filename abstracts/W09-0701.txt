We describe the Lwazi corpus for auto-
matic speech recognition (ASR), a new
telephone speech corpus which includes
data from nine Southern Bantu lan-
guages. Because of practical constraints,
the amount of speech per language is
relatively small compared to major cor-
pora in world languages, and we report
on our investigation of the stability of
the ASR models derived from the corpus.
We also report on phoneme distance mea-
sures across languages, and describe initial
phone recognisers that were developed us-
ing this data.
