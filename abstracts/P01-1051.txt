In this paper we discuss our approach
toward establishing a model of the ac-
quisition of English grammatical struc-
tures by users of our English language
tutoring system, which has been de-
signed for deaf users of American Sign
Language. We explore the correlation
between a corpus of error-tagged texts
and their holistic proficiency scores as-
signed by experts in order to draw ini-
tial conclusions about what language
errors typically occur at different levels
of proficiency in this population. Since
errors made at lower levels (and not
at higher levels) presumably represent
constructions acquired before those on
which errors are found only at higher
levels, this should provide insight into
the order of acquisition of English
grammatical forms.
