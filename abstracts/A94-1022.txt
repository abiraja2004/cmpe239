 
This paper presents Delphi, the natural 
language component of the BBN Spoken 
Language System. Delphi is a domain- 
independent natural language question an- 
swering system that is solidly based on 
linguistic principles, yet which is also ro- 
bust to ungrammatical input. It includes 
a domain-independent, broad-coverage ram- 
mar of English. Analysis components include 
an agenda-based best-first parser and a fall- 
back component for partial understanding that 
works by fragment combination. Delphi has 
been formally evaluated in the ARPA Spoken 
Language program's ATIS (Airline Travel In- 
formation System) domain, and has performed 
well. Delphi has also been ported to a spo- 
ken language demonstration system in an Air 
Force Resource Management domain. We dis- 
cuss results of the evaluation as well as the 
porting process.
