The vast number of published medical doc-
uments is considered a vital source for rela-
tionship discovery. This paper presents a sta-
tistical unsupervised system, called BioNoc-
ulars, for extracting protein-protein interac-
tions from biomedical text. BioNoculars
uses graph-based mutual reinforcement to
make use of redundancy in data to construct
extraction patterns in a domain independent
fashion. The system was tested using MED-
LINE abstract for which the protein-protein
interactions that they contain are listed in the
database of interacting proteins and protein-
protein interactions (DIPPPI). The system
reports an F-Measure of 0.55 on test MED-
LINE abstracts.
