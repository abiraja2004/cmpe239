Opinion mining is often regarded as a clas-
sification or segmentation task, involving
the prediction of i) subjective expressions,
ii) their target and iii) their polarity. In-
tuitively, these three variables are bidirec-
tionally interdependent, but most work has
either attempted to predict them in isolation
or proposing pipeline-based approaches
that cannot model the bidirectional interac-
tion between these variables. Towards bet-
ter understanding the interaction between
these variables, we propose a model that
allows for analyzing the relation of target
and subjective phrases in both directions,
thus providing an upper bound for the im-
pact of a joint model in comparison to a
pipeline model. We report results on two
public datasets (cameras and cars), show-
ing that our model outperforms state-of-
the-art models, as well as on a new dataset
consisting of Twitter posts.
