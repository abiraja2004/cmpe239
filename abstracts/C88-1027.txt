 
The paper presents the embedding of an 
original parsing strategy for Romanian,call- 
ed Segmentation-Cohesion-Dependency (SCD) , 
into Chomsk~'s well-known Government and 
Binding (BG) theory. In order to bring closer 
the SCD concepts and techniques to the GB 
theory, the following questions have had to 
be dealt with: (1) a specification of the 
Principle of Maximal Projection (PMP), (2) 
extending the X'-theory (X - bar) by introd- 
using Augmented X' (AX')-schemes, these ones 
being obtained by (3) specific constraints 
imposed on the new shapes of X'-schemes. (4) 
The AX'-schemes can be represented in terms 
of a tree (paranthetic) language, whose tran 
-slation in a logic progran~ing language fol 
-lows naturally.
