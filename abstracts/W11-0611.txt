Since many real-world concepts are associ-
ated with colour, for example danger with red,
linguistic information is often complimented
with the use of appropriate colours in informa-
tion visualization and product marketing. Yet,
there is no comprehensive resource that cap-
tures concept?colour associations. We present
a method to create a large word?colour as-
sociation lexicon by crowdsourcing. We fo-
cus especially on abstract concepts and emo-
tions to show that even though they cannot be
physically visualized, they too tend to have
strong colour associations. Finally, we show
how word?colour associations manifest them-
selves in language, and quantify usefulness of
co-occurrence and polarity cues in automati-
cally detecting colour associations.1
