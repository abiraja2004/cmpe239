The purpose of this paper is to present an
unusual English dataset for affect explo-
ration in text. It describes a corpus of fairy
tales from three sources that have been
annotated for affect at the sentence level.
Special attention is given to data marked
by high annotator agreement. A quali-
tative analysis of characteristics of high
agreement sentences from H. C. Ander-
sen reveals several interesting trends, illus-
trated by examples.
