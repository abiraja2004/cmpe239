Large-scale parsing is still a complex and time-
consuming process, often so much that it is in-
feasible in real-world applications. The parsing
system described here addresses this problem
by combining finite-state approaches, statisti-
cal parsing techniques and engineering knowl-
edge, thus keeping parsing complexity as low
as possible at the cost of a slight decrease in
performance. The parser is robust and fast
and at the same time based on strong linguis-
tic foundations.
