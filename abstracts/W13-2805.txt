Dependency parsers are almost ubiqui-
tously evaluated on their accuracy scores,
these scores say nothing of the complex-
ity and usefulness of the resulting struc-
tures. The structures may have more com-
plexity due to their coordination structure
or attachment rules. As dependency parses
are basic structures in which other systems
are built upon, it would seem more reason-
able to judge these parsers down the NLP
pipeline.
We show results from 7 individual parsers,
including dependency and constituent
parsers, and 3 ensemble parsing tech-
niques with their overall effect on a Ma-
chine Translation system, Treex, for En-
glish to Czech translation. We show that
parsers? UAS scores are more correlated
to the NIST evaluation metric than to the
BLEU Metric, however we see increases
in both metrics.
