Unknown words are a major issue for
large-scale grammars of natural language.
We propose a machine learning based al-
gorithm for acquiring lexical entries for
all forms in the paradigm of a given un-
known word. The main advantages of our
method are the usage of word paradigms
to obtain valuable morphological knowl-
edge, the consideration of different con-
texts which the unknown word and all
members of its paradigm occur in and
the employment of a full-blown syntactic
parser and the grammar we want to im-
prove to analyse these contexts and pro-
vide elaborate syntactic constraints. We
test our algorithm on a large-scale gram-
mar of Dutch and show that its application
leads to an improved parsing accuracy.
