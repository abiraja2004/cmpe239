 
We describe a system for the CoNLL-
2005 shared task of Semantic Role Label-
ing.  The system implements a two-layer 
architecture to first identify the arguments 
and then to label them for each predicate.  
The components are implemented as 
SVM classifiers using libSVM.   Features 
were adapted and tuned for the system, 
including a reduced set for the identifier 
classifier.  Experiments were conducted to 
find kernel parameters for the Radial Ba-
sis Function (RBF) kernel.  An algorithm 
was defined to combine the results of the 
argument labeling classifier according to 
the constraints of the argument labeling 
problem.
