 We investigate the challenge of extract-
ing information about genetic mutations from ta-
bles, an important source of information in scien-
tific papers. We use various machine learning algo-
rithms and feature sets, and evaluate performance in
extracting fields associated with an existing hand-
created database of mutations. We then show how
classifying tabular information can be leveraged for
the task of named entity detection for mutations.1
Keywords Information extraction; tables;
