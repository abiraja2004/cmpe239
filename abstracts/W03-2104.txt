We describe an information-theoretic
argument-interpretation mechanism em-
bedded in an interactive system. Our
mechanism receives as input an argument
entered through a web interface. It gener-
ates candidate interpretations in terms of
its underlying knowledge representation ?
a Bayesian network, and applies the Mini-
mum Message Length principle to select
the best candidate. The results of our
preliminary evaluations are encouraging,
with the system generally producing plau-
sible interpretations of users? arguments.
Keywords: Minimum message length, discourse in-
terpretation, Bayesian networks.
