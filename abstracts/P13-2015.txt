Most coreference resolvers rely heavily on
string matching, syntactic properties, and
semantic attributes of words, but they lack
the ability to make decisions based on in-
dividual words. In this paper, we ex-
plore the benefits of lexicalized features
in the setting of domain-specific corefer-
ence resolution. We show that adding
lexicalized features to off-the-shelf coref-
erence resolvers yields significant perfor-
mance gains on four domain-specific data
sets and with two types of coreference res-
olution architectures.
