This contribution focuses on multimodal in-
teraction techniques for a mobile communi-
cation and assistance system on a robot plat-
form. The system comprises of acoustic, vi-
sual and haptic input modalities. Feedback is
given to the user by a graphical user interface
and a speech synthesis system. By this, mul-
timodal and natural communication with the
robot system is possible.
