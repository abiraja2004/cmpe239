In a previous work of ours Chinnakotla
et al (2010) we introduced a novel
framework for Pseudo-Relevance Feed-
back (PRF) called MultiPRF. Given a
query in one language called Source, we
used English as the Assisting Language to
improve the performance of PRF for the
source language. MulitiPRF showed re-
markable improvement over plain Model
Based Feedback (MBF) uniformly for 4
languages, viz., French, German, Hungar-
ian and Finnish with English as the as-
sisting language. This fact inspired us
to study the effect of any source-assistant
pair on MultiPRF performance from out
of a set of languages with widely differ-
ent characteristics, viz., Dutch, English,
Finnish, French, German and Spanish.
Carrying this further, we looked into the
effect of using two assisting languages to-
gether on PRF.
The present paper is a report of these in-
vestigations, their results and conclusions
drawn therefrom. While performance im-
provement on MultiPRF is observed what-
ever the assisting language and whatever
the source, observations are mixed when
two assisting languages are used simul-
taneously. Interestingly, the performance
improvement is more pronounced when
the source and assisting languages are
closely related, e.g., French and Spanish.
