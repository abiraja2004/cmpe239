To date, traditional NLP parsers have
not been widely successful in TESOL-
oriented applications, particularly in scor-
ing written compositions. Re-engineering
such applications to provide the neces-
sary robustness for handling ungrammat-
ical English has proven a formidable ob-
stacle. We discuss the use of a non-
traditional parser for rating compositions
that attenuates some of these difficulties.
Its dependency-based shallow parsing ap-
proach provides significant robustness in
the face of language learners? ungrammat-
ical compositions. This paper discusses
how a corpus of L2 essays for English was
rated using the parser, and how the auto-
matic evaulations compared to those ob-
tained by manual methods. The types of
modifications that were made to the sys-
tem are discussed. Limitations to the cur-
rent system are described, future plans for
developing the system are sketched, and
further applications beyond English essay
rating are mentioned.
