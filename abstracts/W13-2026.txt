Published literature in molecular genetics
may collectively provide much informa-
tion on gene regulation networks. Ded-
icated computational approaches are re-
quired to sip through large volumes of text
and infer gene interactions. We propose a
novel sieve-based relation extraction sys-
tem that uses linear-chain conditional ran-
dom fields and rules. Also, we intro-
duce a new skip-mention data represen-
tation to enable distant relation extraction
using first-order models. To account for a
variety of relation types, multiple models
are inferred. The system was applied to the
BioNLP 2013 Gene Regulation Network
Shared Task. Our approach was ranked
first of five, with a slot error rate of 0.73.
