User generated content is characterized
by short, noisy documents, with many
spelling errors and unexpected language
usage. To bridge the vocabulary gap be-
tween the user?s information need and
documents in a specific user generated
content environment, the blogosphere, we
apply a form of query expansion, i.e.,
adding and reweighing query terms. Since
the blogosphere is noisy, query expansion
on the collection itself is rarely effective
but external, edited collections are more
suitable. We propose a generative model
for expanding queries using external col-
lections in which dependencies between
queries, documents, and expansion doc-
uments are explicitly modeled. Differ-
ent instantiations of our model are dis-
cussed and make different (in)dependence
assumptions. Results using two exter-
nal collections (news andWikipedia) show
that external expansion for retrieval of user
generated content is effective; besides,
conditioning the external collection on the
query is very beneficial, and making can-
didate expansion terms dependent on just
the document seems sufficient.
