In this paper, we give a description of the ma-
chine translation system developed at DCU
that was used for our participation in the eval-
uation campaign of the Third Workshop on
Statistical Machine Translation at ACL 2008.
We describe the modular design of our data-
driven MT system with particular focus on
the components used in this participation. We
also describe some of the significant modules
which were unused in this task.
We participated in the EuroParl task for the
following translation directions: Spanish?
English and French?English, in which we em-
ployed our hybrid EBMT-SMT architecture to
translate. We also participated in the Czech?
English News and News Commentary tasks
which represented a previously untested lan-
guage pair for our system. We report results
on the provided development and test sets.
