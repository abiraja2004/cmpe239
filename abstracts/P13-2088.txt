We introduce LABR, the largest sentiment
analysis dataset to-date for the Arabic lan-
guage. It consists of over 63,000 book
reviews, each rated on a scale of 1 to 5
stars. We investigate the properties of the
the dataset, and present its statistics. We
explore using the dataset for two tasks:
sentiment polarity classification and rat-
ing classification. We provide standard
splits of the dataset into training and test-
ing, for both polarity and rating classifica-
tion, in both balanced and unbalanced set-
tings. We run baseline experiments on the
dataset to establish a benchmark.
