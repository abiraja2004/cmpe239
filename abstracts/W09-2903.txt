We address the problem of classifying multi-
word expression tokens in running text. We
focus our study on Verb-Noun Constructions
(VNC) that vary in their idiomaticity depend-
ing on context. VNC tokens are classified as
either idiomatic or literal. We present a super-
vised learning approach to the problem. We ex-
periment with different features. Our approach
yields the best results to date on MWE clas-
sification combining different linguistically mo-
tivated features, the overall performance yields
an F-measure of 84.58% corresponding to an F-
measure of 89.96% for idiomaticity identification
and classification and 62.03% for literal identifi-
cation and classification.
