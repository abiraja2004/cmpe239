Statistical methods for PP attachment fall into
two classes according to the training material
used: first, unsupervised methods trained on
raw text corpora and second, supervised meth-
ods trained on manually disambiguated exam-
ples. Usually supervised methods win over un-
supervised methods with regard to attachment
accuracy. But what if only small sets of manu-
ally disambiguated material are available? We
show that in this case it is advantageous to in-
tertwine unsupervised and supervised methods
into one disambiguation algorithm that outper-
forms both methods used alone.1
