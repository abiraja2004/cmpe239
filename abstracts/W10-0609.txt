We present a series of methods for deriv-
ing conceptual representations from corpora
and investigate the usefulness of the fMRI
data and machine learning methodology of
Mitchell et al (2008) as a basis for evaluat-
ing the different models. Within this frame-
work, the quality of a semantic model is quan-
tified by its ability to predict the fMRI ac-
tivation associated with conceptual stimuli.
Mitchell et al used a manually-acquired set of
verbs as the basis for their semantic model; in
this paper, we also consider automatically ac-
quired feature-norm-like semantic representa-
tions. These models make different assump-
tions about the kinds of information avail-
able in corpora that is relevant to represent-
ing conceptual knowledge. Our results in-
dicate that automatically-acquired representa-
tions can make equally powerful predictions
about the brain activity associated with the
stimuli.
