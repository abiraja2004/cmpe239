 
In this work, we use a large text corpus to 
order nouns by their level of specificity. This 
semantic information can for most nouns be 
determined with over 80% accuracy using 
simple statistics from a text corpus with- 
out using any additional sources of seman- 
tic knowledge. This kind of semantic in- 
formation can be used to help in automat- 
ically constructing or augmenting a lexical 
database such as WordNet.
