 
The use of topical features is abundant in 
Natural Language Processing (NLP), a 
major example being in dictionary-based 
Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD). Yet 
previous research does not attempt to 
measure the level of topic cohesion in 
documents, despite assertions of its ef-
fects. This paper introduces a quantitative 
measure of Topic Homogeneity using a 
range of NLP resources and not requiring 
prior knowledge of correct senses. Eval-
uation is performed firstly by using the 
WordNet::Domains package to create 
word-sets with varying levels of homo-
geneity and comparing our results with 
those expected. Additionally, to evaluate 
each measure?s potential value, the ho-
mogeneity results are correlated against 
those of 3 co-occurrence/dictionary-
based WSD techniques, tested on 1040 
Semcor and SENSEVAL sub-documents. 
Many low-moderate correlations are 
found to exist with several in the mod-
erate range (above .40). These correla-
tions surpass polysemy and sense-
entropy, the 2 most cited factors affecting 
WSD. Finally, a combined homogeneity 
measure achieves correlations of up to 
.52.
