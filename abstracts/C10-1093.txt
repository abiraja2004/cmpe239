This paper describes a search procedure
to discover optimal feature sets for depen-
dency parsers. The search applies to the
shift?reduce algorithm and the feature sets
are extracted from the parser configura-
tion. The initial feature is limited to the
first word in the input queue. Then, the
procedure uses a set of rules founded on
the assumption that topological neighbors
of significant features in the dependency
graph may also have a significant contri-
bution. The search can be fully automated
and the level of greediness adjusted with
the number of features examined at each
iteration of the discovery procedure.
Using our automated feature discovery
on two corpora, the Swedish corpus in
CoNLL-X and the English corpus in
CoNLL 2008, and a single parser system,
we could reach results comparable or bet-
ter than the best scores reported in these
evaluations. The CoNLL 2008 test set
contains, in addition to a Wall Street Jour-
nal (WSJ) section, an out-of-domain sam-
ple from the Brown corpus. With sets of
15 features, we obtained a labeled attach-
ment score of 84.21 for Swedish, 88.11 on
the WSJ test set, and 81.33 on the Brown
test set.
