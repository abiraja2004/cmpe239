This  study investigates  the  use of  Same  ? a 
relation  that  connects  the  parts  of  a 
discontinuous  discourse  segment  ?  in  the 
Discourse Graphbank (Wolf et al, 2004). Our 
analysis  reveals  systematic  deviations  from 
the  definition  of  the  Same relation  and  a 
substantial  number  of  confusions  between 
Same and  Elaboration relations.  We discuss 
some  methodological  and  theoretical 
implications of these findings.
