 
A novel random text generation model is  
introduced. Unlike in previous random 
text models, that mainly aim at producing 
a Zipfian distribution of word frequencies, 
our model also takes the properties of 
neighboring co-occurrence into account 
and introduces the notion of sentences in 
random text. After pointing out the defi-
ciencies of related models, we provide a 
generation process that takes neither the 
Zipfian distribution on word frequencies 
nor the small-world structure of the 
neighboring co-occurrence graph as a 
constraint. Nevertheless, these distribu-
tions emerge in the process. The distribu-
tions obtained with the random generation 
model are compared to a sample of natu-
ral language data, showing high agree-
ment also on word length and sentence 
length. This work proposes a plausible 
model for the emergence of large-scale 
characteristics of language without as-
suming a grammar or semantics.
