We present a framework for cross-lingual
transfer of sequence information from a
resource-rich source language to a resource-
impoverished target language that incorporates
soft constraints via posterior regularization. To
this end, we use automatically word aligned
bitext between the source and target language
pair, and learn a discriminative conditional ran-
dom field model on the target side. Our poste-
rior regularization constraints are derived from
simple intuitions about the task at hand and
from cross-lingual alignment information. We
show improvements over strong baselines for
two tasks: part-of-speech tagging and named-
entity segmentation.
