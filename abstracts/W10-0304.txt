Man achieved flight by studying how birds fly,
and yet the solution that engineers came up
with (jet planes) is very different from the one
birds apply. In this paper I review a number of
efforts in automated story telling and poetry
generation, identifying which human abilities
are being modelled in each case. In an anal-
ogy to the classic example of bird-flight and
jet planes, I explore how the computational
models relate to (the little we know about) hu-
man performance, what the similarities are be-
tween the case for linguistic creativity and the
case for flight, and what the analogy might
have to say about artificial linguistic creativ-
ity if it were valid.
