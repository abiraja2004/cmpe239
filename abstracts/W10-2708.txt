 
The purpose of this research was to advance the understanding of the behavior of small groups in online chat rooms. The research was conducted using Internet chat data collected through planned exercises with recruited par-ticipants. Analysis of the collected data led to construction of preliminary models of social behavior in online discourse. Some of these models, e.g., how to effectively change the topic of conversation, were subsequently im-plemented into an automated Virtual Chat Agent (VCA) prototype. VCA has been dem-onstrated to perform effectively and convinc-ingly in Internet conversation in multiparty chat environments.  1
