This paper proposes a ternary relation
extraction method primarily based on
rich syntactic information. We identify
PROTEIN-ORGANISM-LOCATION re-
lations in the text of biomedical articles.
Different kernel functions are used with
an SVM learner to integrate two sources
of information from syntactic parse trees:
(i) a large number of syntactic features
that have been shown useful for Seman-
tic Role Labeling (SRL) and applied here
to the relation extraction task, and (ii) fea-
tures from the entire parse tree using a
tree kernel. Our experiments show that the
use of rich syntactic features significantly
outperforms shallow word-based features.
The best accuracy is obtained by combin-
ing SRL features with tree kernels.
