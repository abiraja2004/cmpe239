Temporal relation classification task has is-
sues of fourteen target relations, skewed dis-
tribution of the target relations, and relatively
small amount of data. To overcome the is-
sues, methods such as merging target relations
and increasing data size with closure algo-
rithm have been used. However, the method
using merged relations has a problem on how
to recover original relations. In this paper,
a new reduced-relation method is proposed.
The method decomposes a target relation into
four pairs of endpoints with three target rela-
tions. After classifying a relation of each end-
point pair, four classified relations are com-
bined into a relation of original fourteen target
relations. In the combining step, two heuris-
tics are examined.
