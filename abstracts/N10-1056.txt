We report on work in progress on extract-
ing lexical simplifications (e.g., ?collaborate?
? ?work together?), focusing on utilizing
edit histories in Simple English Wikipedia for
this task. We consider two main approaches:
(1) deriving simplification probabilities via an
edit model that accounts for a mixture of dif-
ferent operations, and (2) using metadata to
focus on edits that are more likely to be sim-
plification operations. We find our methods
to outperform a reasonable baseline and yield
many high-quality lexical simplifications not
included in an independently-created manu-
ally prepared list.
