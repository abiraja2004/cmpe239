 
A relatively self-contained subtask of 
natural language generation is sentence 
realization: the process of generating a 
grammatically correct sentence from an 
abstract semantic / logical 
representation.  We propose a method 
where sentence realization is carried 
out using a simplified (context free) 
version of a large analysis grammar, 
combined with a statistical language 
model from the full (context sensitive) 
version of the same grammar.  The 
statistical model provides a measure of 
the probability of syntactic 
substructures, derived from the analysis 
of a corpus with the full grammar, and 
is used to guide both subsequent 
analysis and generation.
