 
Most existing anaphora resolution algo- 
rithms are designed to account only for 
anaphors with NP-antecedents. This paper 
describes an algorithm for the resolution of 
discourse deictic anaphors, which constitute 
a large percentage ofanaphors in spoken di- 
alogues. The success of the resolution is 
dependent on the classification of all pro- 
nouns and demonstratives into individual, 
discourse deictic and vague anaphora. Fi- 
nally, the empirical results of the application 
of the algorithm to a corpus of spoken dia- 
logues are presented.
