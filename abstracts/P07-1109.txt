We propose a bootstrapping approach to
training a memoriless stochastic transducer
for the task of extracting transliterations
from an English-Arabic bitext. The trans-
ducer learns its similarity metric from the
data in the bitext, and thus can func-
tion directly on strings written in different
writing scripts without any additional lan-
guage knowledge. We show that this boot-
strapped transducer performs as well or bet-
ter than a model designed specifically to de-
tect Arabic-English transliterations.
