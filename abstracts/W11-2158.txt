This paper describes the development of
French?English and English?French statisti-
cal machine translation systems for the 2011
WMT shared task evaluation. Our main sys-
tems were standard phrase-based statistical
systems based on the Moses decoder, trained
on the provided data only, but we also per-
formed initial experiments with hierarchical
systems. Additional, new features this year in-
clude improved translation model adaptation
using monolingual data, a continuous space
language model and the treatment of unknown
words.
