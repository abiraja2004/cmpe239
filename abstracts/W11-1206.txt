In this article we present a novel way of look-
ing at the problem of automatic acquisition
of pairs of translationally equivalent words
from comparable corpora. We first present
the standard and extended approaches tradi-
tionally dedicated to this task. We then re-
interpret the extended method, and motivate a
novel model to reformulate this approach in-
spired by the metasearch engines in informa-
tion retrieval. The empirical results show that
performances of our model are always better
than the baseline obtained with the extended
approach and also competitive with the stan-
dard approach.
