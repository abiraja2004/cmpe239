Resolving polysemy and synonymy is re-
quired for high-quality information extraction.
We present ConceptResolver, a component for
the Never-Ending Language Learner (NELL)
(Carlson et al, 2010) that handles both phe-
nomena by identifying the latent concepts that
noun phrases refer to. ConceptResolver per-
forms both word sense induction and synonym
resolution on relations extracted from text us-
ing an ontology and a small amount of la-
beled data. Domain knowledge (the ontology)
guides concept creation by defining a set of
possible semantic types for concepts. Word
sense induction is performed by inferring a set
of semantic types for each noun phrase. Syn-
onym detection exploits redundant informa-
tion to train several domain-specific synonym
classifiers in a semi-supervised fashion. When
ConceptResolver is run on NELL?s knowledge
base, 87% of the word senses it creates cor-
respond to real-world concepts, and 85% of
noun phrases that it suggests refer to the same
concept are indeed synonyms.
