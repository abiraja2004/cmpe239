While natural language as an interaction
modality is increasingly being accepted by
users, remaining technological challenges
still hinder its widespread employment.
Tools that better support the design, devel-
opment and improvement of these types
of applications are required. This demo
presents a prototyping framework for Spo-
ken Dialog System (SDS) design which
combines existing language technology
components for Automatic Speech Recog-
nition (ASR), Dialog Management (DM),
and Text-to-Speech Synthesis (TTS) with
a multi-step component for Natural Lan-
guage Understanding (NLU).
