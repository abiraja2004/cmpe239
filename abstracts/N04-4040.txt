This paper describes a transformation-based learn-
ing approach to disfluency detection in speech tran-
scripts using primarily lexical features. Our method
produces comparable results to two other systems
that make heavy use of prosodic features, thus
demonstrating that reasonable performance can be
achieved without extensive prosodic cues. In addi-
tion, we show that it is possible to facilitate the iden-
tification of less frequently disfluent discourse mark-
ers by taking speaker style into account.
