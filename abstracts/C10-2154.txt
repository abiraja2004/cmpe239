 
Translation rule extraction is an impor-
tant issue in syntax-based Statistical Ma-
chine Translation (SMT). Recent studies 
show that rule coverage is one of the key 
factors affecting the success of syntax-
based systems. In this paper, we first 
present a simple and effective method to 
improve rule coverage by using multiple 
parsers in translation rule extraction, and 
then empirically investigate the effec-
tiveness of our method on Chinese-
English translation tasks. Experimental 
results show that extracting translation 
rules using multiple parsers improves a 
string-to-tree system by over 0.9 BLEU 
points on both NIST 2004 and 2005 test 
corpora.
