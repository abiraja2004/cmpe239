This paper presents an approach to sum-
marize single scientific papers, by extract-
ing its contributions from the set of cita-
tion sentences written in other papers. Our
methodology is based on extracting sig-
nificant keyphrases from the set of cita-
tion sentences and using these keyphrases
to build the summary. Comparisons show
how this methodology excels at the task
of single paper summarization, and how it
out-performs other multi-document sum-
marization methods.
