We consider the task of unsupervised lec-
ture segmentation. We formalize segmen-
tation as a graph-partitioning task that op-
timizes the normalized cut criterion. Our
approach moves beyond localized com-
parisons and takes into account long-
range cohesion dependencies. Our results
demonstrate that global analysis improves
the segmentation accuracy and is robust in
the presence of speech recognition errors.
