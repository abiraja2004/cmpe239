Spoken dialogue systems promise effi-
cient and natural access to information
services from any phone. Recently, spo-
ken dialogue systems for widely used ap-
plications such as email, travel informa-
tion, and customer care have moved from
research labs into commercial use. These
applications can receive millions of calls
a month. This huge amount of spoken
dialogue data has led to a need for fully
automatic methods for selecting a subset
of caller dialogues that are most likely
to be useful for further system improve-
ment, to be stored, transcribed and further
analyzed. This paper reports results on
automatically training a Problematic Di-
alogue Identifier to classify problematic
human-computer dialogues using a corpus
of 1242 DARPA Communicator dialogues
in the travel planning domain. We show
that using fully automatic features we can
identify classes of problematic dialogues
with accuracies from 67% to 89%.
