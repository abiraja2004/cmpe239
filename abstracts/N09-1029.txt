 
In this paper, we propose a method for learn-
ing reordering model for BTG-based statisti-
cal machine translation (SMT). The model 
focuses on linguistic features from bilingual 
phrases. Our method involves extracting reor-
dering examples as well as features such as 
part-of-speech and word class from aligned 
parallel sentences. The features are classified 
with special considerations of phrase lengths. 
We then use these features to train the maxi-
mum entropy (ME) reordering model. With 
the model, we performed Chinese-to-English 
translation tasks. Experimental results show 
that our bilingual linguistic model outper-
forms the state-of-the-art phrase-based and 
BTG-based SMT systems by improvements of 
2.41 and 1.31 BLEU points respectively.
