We present an algorithm, Nomen, for learning
generalized names in text. Examples of these
are names of diseases and infectious agents, such
as bacteria and viruses. These names exhibit
certain properties that make their identica-
tion more complex than that of regular proper
names. Nomen uses a novel form of bootstrap-
ping to grow sets of textual instances and of
their contextual patterns. The algorithm makes
use of competing evidence to boost the learning
of several categories of names simultaneously.
We present results of the algorithm on a large
corpus. We also investigate the relative merits
of several evaluation strategies.
