We investigate the use of language in food
writing, specifically on restaurant menus and
in customer reviews. Our approach is to build
predictive models of concrete external vari-
ables, such as restaurant menu prices. We
make use of a dataset of menus and customer
reviews for thousands of restaurants in several
U.S. cities. By focusing on prediction tasks
and doing our analysis at scale, our method-
ology allows quantitative, objective measure-
ments of the words and phrases used to de-
scribe food in restaurants. We also explore
interactions in language use between menu
prices and sentiment as expressed in user re-
views.
