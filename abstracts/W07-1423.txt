We introduce a system for textual entail-
ment that is based on a probabilistic model
of entailment. The model is defined using
some calculus of transformations on depen-
dency trees, which is characterized by the
fact that derivations in that calculus preserve
the truth only with a certain probability. We
also describe a possible set of transforma-
tions (and with it implicitly a calculus) that
was successfully applied to the RTE3 chal-
lenge data. However, our system can be im-
proved in many ways and we see it as the
starting point for a promising new approach
to textual entailment.
