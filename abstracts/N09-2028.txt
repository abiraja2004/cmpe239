We present a novel two-stage technique for de-
tecting speech disfluencies based on Integer
Linear Programming (ILP). In the first stage
we use state-of-the-art models for speech dis-
fluency detection, in particular, hidden-event
language models, maximum entropy models
and conditional random fields. During testing
each model proposes possible disfluency la-
bels which are then assessed in the presence of
local and global constraints using ILP. Our ex-
perimental results show that by using ILP we
can improve the performance of our models
with negligible cost in processing time. The
less training data is available the larger the im-
provement due to ILP.
