 
A statistical language model may be used to 
segment a data sequence by thresholding its 
instantaneous entropy. In this paper we de- 
scribe how this process works, and we apply it 
to the problem of discovering separator sym- 
bols in a text. Our results how that language 
models which bootstrap themselves with struc- 
ture found in this way undergo a reduction in 
perplexity. We conclude that these techniques 
may be useful in the design of generic gram- 
matical inference systems.
