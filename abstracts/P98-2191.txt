 
This paper proposes a learning method of 
translation rules from parallel corpora. This 
method applies the maximum entropy prin- 
ciple to a probabilistic model of translation 
rules. First, we define feature functions 
which express statistical properties of this 
model. Next, in order to optimize the model, 
the system iterates following steps: (1) se- 
lects a feature function which maximizes log- 
likelihood, and (2) adds this function to the 
model incrementally. As computational cost 
associated with this model is too expensive, 
we propose several methods to suppress the 
overhead in order to realize the system. The 
result shows that it attained 69.54% recall 
rate.
