We investigate a language model that com-
bines morphological and shape features with
a Kneser-Ney model and test it in a large
crosslingual study of European languages.
Even though the model is generic and we use
the same architecture and features for all lan-
guages, the model achieves reductions in per-
plexity for all 21 languages represented in the
Europarl corpus, ranging from 3% to 11%. We
show that almost all of this perplexity reduc-
tion can be achieved by identifying suffixes by
frequency.
