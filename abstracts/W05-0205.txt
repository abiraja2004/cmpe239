 
In Online Inquiry-Based Learning (OIBL) 
learners search for information to answer 
driving questions. While learners conduct 
sequential related searches, the search en-
gines interpret each query in isolation, 
and thus are unable to utilize task context. 
Consequently, learners usually get less 
relevant search results. We are developing 
a NLP-based search agent to bridge the 
gap between learners and search engines. 
Our algorithms utilize contextual features 
to provide user with search term sugges-
tions and results re-ranking. Our pilot 
study indicates that our method can effec-
tively enhance the quality of OIBL.
