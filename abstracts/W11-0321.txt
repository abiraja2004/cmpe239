The problem of authorship attribution ? at-
tributing texts to their original authors ? has
been an active research area since the end of
the 19th century, attracting increased interest
in the last decade. Most of the work on au-
thorship attribution focuses on scenarios with
only a few candidate authors, but recently con-
sidered cases with tens to thousands of can-
didate authors were found to be much more
challenging. In this paper, we propose ways
of employing Latent Dirichlet Allocation in
authorship attribution. We show that our ap-
proach yields state-of-the-art performance for
both a few and many candidate authors, in
cases where these authors wrote enough texts
to be modelled effectively.
