 
Useful automatized translation must be 
considered in a problem-solving setting, 
composed of a linguistic environment and a 
computer environment. We examine the facets of 
the problem which we believe to be essential, 
and try to give some paradigms along each of 
them. Those facets are the linguistic strategy, 
the programming tools, the treatment of seman- 
tics, the computer environment and the types of 
implementation.
