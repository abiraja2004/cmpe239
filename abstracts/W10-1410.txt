This paper shows that training a lexicalized
parser on a lemmatized morphologically-rich
treebank such as the French Treebank slightly
improves parsing results. We also show that
lemmatizing a similar in size subset of the En-
glish Penn Treebank has almost no effect on
parsing performance with gold lemmas and
leads to a small drop of performance when au-
tomatically assigned lemmas and POS tags are
used. This highlights two facts: (i) lemmati-
zation helps to reduce lexicon data-sparseness
issues for French, (ii) it also makes the pars-
ing process sensitive to correct assignment of
POS tags to unknown words.
