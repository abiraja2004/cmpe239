Semantic frames are a rich linguistic re-
source. There has been much work
on semantic frame parsers, but less that
applies them to general NLP problems.
We address a task to predict change in
stock price from financial news. Seman-
tic frames help to generalize from spe-
cific sentences to scenarios, and to de-
tect the (positive or negative) roles of spe-
cific companies. We introduce a novel tree
representation, and use it to train predic-
tive models with tree kernels using sup-
port vector machines. Our experiments
test multiple text representations on two
binary classification tasks, change of price
and polarity. Experiments show that fea-
tures derived from semantic frame pars-
ing have significantly better performance
across years on the polarity task.
