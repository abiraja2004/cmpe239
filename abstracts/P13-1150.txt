In this paper, we present a solution to one
aspect of the decipherment task: the pre-
diction of consonants and vowels for an
unknown language and alphabet. Adopt-
ing a classical Bayesian perspective, we
performs posterior inference over hun-
dreds of languages, leveraging knowledge
of known languages and alphabets to un-
cover general linguistic patterns of typo-
logically coherent language clusters. We
achieve average accuracy in the unsuper-
vised consonant/vowel prediction task of
99% across 503 languages. We further
show that our methodology can be used
to predict more fine-grained phonetic dis-
tinctions. On a three-way classification
task between vowels, nasals, and non-
nasal consonants, our model yields unsu-
pervised accuracy of 89% across the same
set of languages.
