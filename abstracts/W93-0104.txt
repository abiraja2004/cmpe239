 
We describe the proper name recognition and classification facility ("PNV') of the SPARSER 
natural language understanding system. PNF has been used very successfully in the analysis of 
unrestricted texts in several sublanguages taken from online news sources. It makes its categoriza- 
tions on the basis of 'external' evidence from the context of the phrases adjacent to the name as well 
as 'internal' evidence within the sequence ofwords and characters. A semantic model of each name 
and its components is maintained and used for subsequent reference. 
We describe PNF's operations of delimiting, classifying, and semantically recording the 
structure of a name; we situate PNF with respect to the related parsing mechanisms within Sparser; 
and finally we work through an extended example that is typical of the sorts of text we have applied 
PNF to.
