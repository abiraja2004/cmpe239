 
In order to control the quality of internet-based 
language corpora, we developed a method to 
verify automatically that texts are of (near-) 
native quality. For the LOCNESS and ICLE 
corpora, the method is rather successful in 
separating native and non-native learner texts. 
The Equal Error Rate is about 10%. However, 
for other domains, such as internet texts, 
separate classifiers have to be trained on the 
basis of suitable seed corpora.
