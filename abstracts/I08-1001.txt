 
In Modern Mongolian, a content word can 
be inflected when concatenated with suf-
fixes. Identifying the original forms of 
content words is crucial for natural lan-
guage processing and information retrieval. 
We propose a lemmatization method for 
Modern Mongolian and apply our method 
to indexing for information retrieval. We 
use technical abstracts to show the effec-
tiveness of our method experimentally.
