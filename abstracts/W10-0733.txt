Building machine translation (MT) test sets is
a relatively expensive task. As MT becomes
increasingly desired for more and more lan-
guage pairs and more and more domains, it
becomes necessary to build test sets for each
case. In this paper, we investigate using Ama-
zon?s Mechanical Turk (MTurk) to make MT
test sets cheaply. We find that MTurk can
be used to make test sets much cheaper than
professionally-produced test sets. More im-
portantly, in experiments with multiple MT
systems, we find that the MTurk-produced
test sets yield essentially the same conclu-
sions regarding system performance as the
professionally-produced test sets yield.
