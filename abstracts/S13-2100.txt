In this paper, we describe a method for as-
sessing student answers, modeled as a para-
phrase identification problem, based on sub-
stitution by Basic English variants. Basic En-
glish paraphrases are acquired from the Sim-
ple English Wiktionary. Substitutions are ap-
plied both on reference answers and student
answers in order to reduce the diversity of
their vocabulary and map them to a common
vocabulary. The evaluation of our approach
on the SemEval 2013 Joint Student Response
Analysis and 8th Recognizing Textual Entail-
ment Challenge data shows promising results,
and this work is a first step toward an open-
domain system able to exhibit deep text un-
derstanding capabilities.
