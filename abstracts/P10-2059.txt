This paper addresses the issue of how lin-
guistic feedback expressions, prosody and
head gestures, i.e. head movements and
face expressions, relate to one another in
a collection of eight video-recorded Dan-
ish map-task dialogues. The study shows
that in these data, prosodic features and
head gestures significantly improve auto-
matic classification of dialogue act labels
for linguistic expressions of feedback.
