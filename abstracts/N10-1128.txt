We describe a class of translation model in
which a set of input variants encoded as a
context-free forest is translated using a finite-
state translation model. The forest structure of
the input is well-suited to representing word
order alternatives, making it straightforward to
model translation as a two step process: (1)
tree-based source reordering and (2) phrase
transduction. By treating the reordering pro-
cess as a latent variable in a probabilistic trans-
lation model, we can learn a long-range source
reordering model without example reordered
sentences, which are problematic to construct.
The resulting model has state-of-the-art trans-
lation performance, uses linguistically moti-
vated features to effectively model long range
reordering, and is significantly smaller than a
comparable hierarchical phrase-based transla-
tion model.
