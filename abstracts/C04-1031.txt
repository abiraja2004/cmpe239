Word alignment is a challenging task aim-
ing at the identification of translational re-
lations between words and multi-word units
in parallel corpora. Many alignment strate-
gies are based on links between single words.
Different strategies can be used to find the
optimal word alignment using such one-to-
one word links including relations between
multi-word units. In this paper seven algo-
rithms are compared using a word alignment
approach based on association clues and
an English-Swedish bitext together with a
handcrafted reference alignment used for
evaluation.
