While much work has considered the problem
of latent attribute inference for users of social
media such as Twitter, little has been done on
non-English-based content and users. Here,
we conduct the first assessment of latent at-
tribute inference in languages beyond English,
focusing on gender inference. We find that
the gender inference problem in quite diverse
languages can be addressed using existing ma-
chinery. Further, accuracy gains can be made
by taking language-specific features into ac-
count. We identify languages with complex
orthography, such as Japanese, as difficult for
existing methods, suggesting a valuable direc-
tion for future research.
