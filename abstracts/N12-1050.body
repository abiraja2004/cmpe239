Negated statements often carry positive im-
plicit meaning. Regardless of the seman-
tic representation one adopts, pinpointing the
positive concepts within a negated statement
is needed in order to encode the statement?s
meaning. In this paper, novel ideas to reveal
positive implicit meaning using focus of nega-
tion are presented. The concept of granular-
ity of focus is introduced and justified. New
annotation and features to detect fine-grained
focus are discussed and results reported.
