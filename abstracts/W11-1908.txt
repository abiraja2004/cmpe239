Because there is no generally accepted met-
ric for measuring the performance of anaphora
resolution systems, a combination of met-
rics was proposed to evaluate submissions to
the 2011 CONLL Shared Task (Pradhan et
al., 2011). We investigate therefore Multi-
objective function Optimization (MOO) tech-
niques based on Genetic Algorithms to opti-
mize models according to multiple metrics si-
multaneously.
