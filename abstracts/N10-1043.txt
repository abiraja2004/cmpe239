Two of the mechanisms for creating natural
transitions between adjacent sentences in a
text, resulting in local coherence, involve dis-
course relations and switches of focus of at-
tention between discourse entities. These two
aspects of local coherence have been tradi-
tionally discussed and studied separately. But
some empirical studies have given strong evi-
dence for the necessity of understanding how
the two types of coherence-creating devices
interact. Here we present a joint corpus study
of discourse relations and entity coherence ex-
hibited in news texts from the Wall Street Jour-
nal and test several hypotheses expressed in
earlier work about their interaction.
