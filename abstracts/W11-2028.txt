This paper addresses a first step toward a
spoken dialogue system that evokes user?s
spontaneous backchannels. We construct
an HMM-based dialogue-style text-to-speech
(TTS) system that generates human-like cues
that evoke users? backchannels. A spoken
dialogue system for information navigation
was implemented and the TTS was evaluated
in terms of evoked user backchannels. We
conducted user experiments and demonstrated
that the user backchannels evoked by our TTS
are more informative for the system in detect-
ing users? feelings than those by conventional
reading-style TTS.
