 
We present a taxonomy and classification 
system for distinguishing between differ-
ent types of paragraphs in movie reviews: 
formal vs. functional paragraphs and, 
within the latter, between description and 
comment. The classification is used for 
sentiment extraction, achieving im-
provement over a baseline without para-
graph classification.
