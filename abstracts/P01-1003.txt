In this paper, we propose adding
long-term grammatical information in
a Whole Sentence Maximun Entropy
Language Model (WSME) in order
to improve the performance of the
model. The grammatical information
was added to the WSME model as fea-
tures and were obtained from a Stochas-
tic Context-Free grammar. Finally, ex-
periments using a part of the Penn Tree-
bank corpus were carried out and sig-
nificant improvements were acheived.
