 
This paper describes the functional de-
sign of an interface for an online schol-
arly dictionary of contemporary standard 
Dutch, the ANW. One of the main inno-
vations of the ANW is a twofold meaning 
description: definitions are accompanied 
by ?semagrams?. In this paper we focus 
on the strategies that are available for ac-
cessing information in the dictionary and 
the role semagrams play in the dictionary 
practice.
