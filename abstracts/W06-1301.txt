In this paper we deal with learning and for-
getting of speech commands in speech di-
alogue systems. We discuss two mathe-
matical models for learning and four mod-
els for forgetting. Furthermore, we de-
scribe the experiments used to determine
the learning and forgetting curve in our
environment. Our findings are compared
to the theoretical models and based on
this we deduce which models best describe
learning and forgetting in our automotive
environment. The resulting models are
used to develop an adaptive help system
for a speech dialogue system. The system
provides only relevant context specific in-
formation.
