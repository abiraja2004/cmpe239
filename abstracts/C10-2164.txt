 
This paper focuses on the Web-based 
English-Chinese OOV term translation 
pattern, and emphasizes particularly on 
the translation selection strategy based 
on the fusion of multiple features and 
the ranking mechanism based on Rank-
ing Support Vector Machine (Ranking 
SVM). By utilizing the CoNLL2003 
corpus for the English Named Entity 
Recognition (NER) task and selected 
new terms, the experiments based on 
different data sources show the consis-
tent results. Our OOV term translation 
model can ?filter? the most possible 
translation candidates with better abili-
ty. From the experimental results for 
combining our OOV term translation 
model with English-Chinese Cross-
Language Information Retrieval (CLIR) 
on the data sets of Text Retrieval Eval-
uation Conference (TREC), it can be 
found that the obvious performance 
improvement for both query translation 
and retrieval can also be obtained.
