We outline a possible small-vocabulary
shared task for the emerging medical
speech translation community. Data would
consist of about 2000 recorded and tran-
scribed utterances collected during an eval-
uation of an English ? Spanish version
of the Open Source MedSLT system; the
vocabulary covered consisted of about 450
words in English, and 250 in Spanish. The
key problem in defining the task is to agree
on a scoring system which is acceptable
both to medical professionals and to the
speech and language community. We sug-
gest a framework for defining and admin-
istering a scoring system of this kind.
