There are several theories regarding what in-
fluences prominence assignment in English
noun-noun compounds. We have developed
corpus-driven models for automatically pre-
dicting prominence assignment in noun-noun
compounds using feature sets based on two
such theories: the informativeness theory and
the semantic composition theory. The eval-
uation of the prediction models indicate that
though both of these theories are relevant, they
account for different types of variability in
prominence assignment.
