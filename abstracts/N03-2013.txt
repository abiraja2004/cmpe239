In this paper, we propose an automatic quan-
titative expansion method for a sentence set
that contains sentences of the same meaning
(called an equivalent sentence set). This task
is regarded as paraphrasing. The features of
our method are: 1) The paraphrasing rules are
dynamically acquired by Hierarchical Phrase
Alignment from the equivalent sentence set,
and 2) A large equivalent sentence set is gen-
erated by substituting source syntactic struc-
tures. Our experiments show that 561 sen-
tences on average are correctly generated from
8.48 equivalent sentences.
