 
We present an algorithm for simultaneously 
constructing both the syntax and semantics of 
a sentence using a Lexicalized Tree Adjoin- 
ing Grammar (LTAG). This approach captures 
naturally and elegantly the interaction between 
pragmatic and syntactic onstraints on descrip- 
tions in a sentence, and the inferential interac- 
tions between multiple descriptions in a sen- 
tence. At the same time, it exploits linguis- 
tically motivated, eclarative specifications of
the discourse functions of syntactic onstruc- 
tions to make contextually appropriate syntac- 
tic choices.
