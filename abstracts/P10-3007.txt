The growing availability of spoken lan-
guage corpora presents new opportunities
for enriching the methodologies of speech
and language therapy. In this paper, we
present a novel approach for construct-
ing speech motor exercises, based on lin-
guistic knowledge extracted from spoken
language corpora. In our study with the
Dutch Spoken Corpus, syllabic inventories
were obtained by means of automatic syl-
labification of the spoken language data.
Our experimental syllabification method
exhibited a reliable performance, and al-
lowed for the acquisition of syllabic tokens
from the corpus. Consequently, the syl-
labic tokens were integrated in a tool for
clinicians, a result which holds the poten-
tial of contributing to the current state of
speech motor training methodologies.
