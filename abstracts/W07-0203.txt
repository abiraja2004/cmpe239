 
In this article we address the usefulness of 
linguistic-independent methods in extrac-
tive Automatic Summarization, arguing 
that linguistic knowledge is not only useful, 
but may be necessary to improve the in-
formativeness of automatic extracts. An as-
sessment of four diverse AS methods on 
Brazilian Portuguese texts is presented to 
support our claim. One of them is Mihal-
cea?s TextRank; other two are modified 
versions of the former through the inclusion 
of varied linguistic features. Finally, the 
fourth method employs machine learning 
techniques, tackling more profound and 
language-dependent knowledge.
