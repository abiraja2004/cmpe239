Nowadays a large number of opinion reviews
are posted on the Web. Such reviews are a very
important source of information for customers
and companies. The former rely more than
ever on online reviews to make their purchase
decisions and the latter to respond promptly
to their clients? expectations. Due to the eco-
nomic importance of these reviews there is a
growing trend to incorporate spam on such
sites, and, as a consequence, to develop meth-
ods for opinion spam detection. In this paper
we focus on the detection of deceptive opin-
ion spam, which consists of fictitious opinions
that have been deliberately written to sound
authentic, in order to deceive the consumers.
In particular we propose a method based on
the PU-learning approach which learns only
from a few positive examples and a set of un-
labeled data. Evaluation results in a corpus of
hotel reviews demonstrate the appropriateness
of the proposed method for real applications
since it reached a f-measure of 0.84 in the de-
tection of deceptive opinions using only 100
positive examples for training.
