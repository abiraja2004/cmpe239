 
Definitions may be made up of one or more components, 
which correspond to strategic predicates. The selection of which 
components o use in giving a definition in a task-oriented dialogue 
depends heavily on the needs of the user. The selection strategy 
we present involves weighting possible strategic predicates and the 
propositiomL used to fill them at multiple points throughout an 
ongoing dialogue and at the actual time of giving the definition. 
Weighting will he influenced by a model of the user's domain kimwl- 
edge~ task-related plans and goals, and receptivity to the different 
kinds of intormation that could he presented. An utteraalce can 
then be produced that incorporates the most important informa- 
tion while adhering to common rhetorical practices.
