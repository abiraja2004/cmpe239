We propose an event-enriched model to 
alleviate the semantic deficiency 
problem in the IR-style text processing 
and apply it to sentence ordering for 
multi-document news summarization.
The ordering algorithm is built on event 
and entity coherence, both locally and 
globally. To accommodate the event-
enriched model, a novel LSA-integrated 
two-layered clustering approach is 
adopted. The experimental result shows 
clear advantage of our model over 
event-agonistic models.
