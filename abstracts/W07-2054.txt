We participated in the SemEval-2007
coarse-grained English all-words task
and fine-grained English all-words task.
We used a supervised learning approach
with SVM as the learning algorithm. The
knowledge sources used include local col-
locations, parts-of-speech, and surrounding
words. We gathered training examples
from English-Chinese parallel corpora,
SEMCOR, and DSO corpus. While the
fine-grained sense inventory of WordNet
was used to train our system employed for
the fine-grained English all-words task, our
system employed for the coarse-grained
English all-words task was trained with the
coarse-grained sense inventory released by
the task organizers. Our scores (for both
recall and precision) are 0.825 and 0.587
for the coarse-grained English all-words
task and fine-grained English all-words task
respectively. These scores put our systems
in the first place for the coarse-grained
English all-words task1 and the second
place for the fine-grained English all-words
task.
