We present a novel unsupervised approach to
detecting the compositionality of multi-word
expressions. We compute the compositional-
ity of a phrase through substituting the con-
stituent words with their ?neighbours? in a se-
mantic vector space and averaging over the
distance between the original phrase and the
substituted neighbour phrases. Several meth-
ods of obtaining neighbours are presented.
The results are compared to existing super-
vised results and achieve state-of-the-art per-
formance on a verb-object dataset of human
compositionality ratings.
