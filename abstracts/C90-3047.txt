: This paper outlines a framework for 
connectionist representation based on the 
composition of connectionist states under 
vector space operators. The framework is used 
to specify a level of connectionist structure 
defined in terms of addressable superposition 
space hierarchies. Direct and relative address 
systems (:an be defined for such structures 
which use the functional components of 
linguistic structures as labels. Unbounded 
dependency phenomena are shown to be related 
to the different properties of these labelling 
structures.
