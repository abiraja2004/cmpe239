 
We apply the hypothesis of ?One Sense Per 
Discourse? (Yarowsky, 1995) to information 
extraction (IE), and extend the scope of ?dis-
course? from one single document to a cluster 
of topically-related documents. We employ a 
similar approach to propagate consistent event 
arguments across sentences and documents. 
Combining global evidence from related doc-
uments with local decisions, we design a sim-
ple scheme to conduct cross-document 
inference for improving the ACE event ex-
traction task1. Without using any additional 
labeled data this new approach obtained 7.6% 
higher F-Measure in trigger labeling and 6% 
higher F-Measure in argument labeling over a 
state-of-the-art IE system which extracts 
events independently for each sentence.
