We present a method for translating se-
mantic relationships between languages
where relationships are defined as pattern
clusters. Given a pattern set which rep-
resents a semantic relationship, we use
the web to extract sample term pairs of
this relationship. We automatically trans-
late the obtained term pairs using multi-
lingual dictionaries and disambiguate the
translated pairs using web counts. Finally
we discover the set of most relevant tar-
get language patterns for the given rela-
tionship. The obtained pattern set can be
utilized for extraction of new relationship
examples for the target language.
We evaluate our method on 11 diverse tar-
get languages. To assess the quality of
the discovered relationships, we use an au-
tomatically generated cross-lingual SAT
analogy test, WordNet relationships, and
concept-specific relationships, achieving
high precision. The proposed framework
allows fully automated cross-lingual rela-
tionship mining and construction of mul-
tilingual pattern dictionaries without rely-
ing on parallel corpora.
