 
This paper presents preliminary work on a 
corpus-based study of Korean demonstratives. 
Through the development of an annotation 
scheme and the use of spoken and written 
corpora, we aim to determine different func-
tions of demonstratives and to examine their 
distributional properties. Our corpus study 
adopts similar features of annotation used in 
Botley and McEnery (2001) and provides 
some linguistic hypotheses on grammatical 
functions of Korean demonstratives to be fur-
ther explored.
