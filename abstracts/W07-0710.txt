Modern statistical machine translation sys-
tems may be seen as using two components:
feature extraction, that summarizes informa-
tion about the translation, and a log-linear
framework to combine features. In this pa-
per, we propose to relax the linearity con-
straints on the combination, and hence relax-
ing constraints of monotonicity and indepen-
dence of feature functions. We expand fea-
tures into a non-parametric, non-linear, and
high-dimensional space. We extend empir-
ical Bayes reward training of model param-
eters to meta parameters of feature genera-
tion. In effect, this allows us to trade away
some human expert feature design for data.
Preliminary results on a standard task show
an encouraging improvement.
