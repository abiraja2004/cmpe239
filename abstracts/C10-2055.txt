Many existing methods for bilingual
lexicon learning from comparable corpora
are based on similarity of context vectors.
These methods suffer from noisy vectors
that greatly affect their accuracy. We
introduce a method for filtering this noise
allowing highly accurate learning of
bilingual lexicons. Our method is based
on the notion of in-domain terms which
can be thought of as the most important
contextually relevant words. We provide
a method for identifying such terms.
Our evaluation shows that the proposed
method can learn highly accurate bilin-
gual lexicons without using orthographic
features or a large initial seed dictionary.
In addition, we also introduce a method
for measuring the similarity between
two words in different languages without
requiring any initial dictionary.
