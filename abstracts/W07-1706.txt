This paper presents the results of the prelim-
inary experiments in the automatic extrac-
tion of definitions (for semi-automatic glos-
sary construction) from usually unstructured
or only weakly structured e-learning texts
in Bulgarian, Czech and Polish. The ex-
traction is performed by regular grammars
over XML-encoded morphosyntactically-
annotated documents. The results are less
than satisfying and we claim that the rea-
son for that is the intrinsic difficulty of the
task, as measured by the low interannota-
tor agreement, which calls for more sophis-
ticated deeper linguistic processing, as well
as for the use of machine learning classifica-
tion techniques.
