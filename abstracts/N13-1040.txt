We describe a new self-learning framework
for parser lexicalisation that requires only a
plain-text corpus of in-domain text. The
method first creates augmented versions of de-
pendency graphs by applying a series of mod-
ifications designed to directly capture higher-
order lexical path dependencies. Scores are
assigned to each edge in the graph using statis-
tics from an automatically parsed background
corpus. As bilexical dependencies are sparse,
a novel directed distributional word similar-
ity measure is used to smooth edge score es-
timates. Edge scores are then combined into
graph scores and used for reranking the top-
n analyses found by the unlexicalised parser.
The approach achieves significant improve-
ments on WSJ and biomedical text over the
unlexicalised baseline parser, which is origi-
nally trained on a subset of the Brown corpus.
