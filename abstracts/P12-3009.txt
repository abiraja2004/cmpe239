We demonstrate a web-based environment for
development and testing of different pedes-
trian route instruction-giving systems. The
environment contains a City Model, a TTS
interface, a game-world, and a user GUI in-
cluding a simulated street-view. We describe
the environment and components, the metrics
that can be used for the evaluation of pedes-
trian route instruction-giving systems, and the
shared challenge which is being organised us-
ing this environment.
