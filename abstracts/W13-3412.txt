In this paper we discuss our experience of
teaching basic Natural Language Processing
(NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) in an in-
troductory course to Information Science. We
discuss the challenges we faced while incor-
porating NLP and ML to the curriculum fol-
lowed by a presentation of how we met these
challenges. The overall response (of stu-
dents) to the inclusion of this new topic to the
curriculum has been positive. Students this
semester are pursuing NLP/ML projects, for-
mulating their own tasks (some of which are
novel and presented towards the end of the pa-
per), collecting and annotating data and build-
ing models for their task.
