In this paper, structures involving the rais-
ing verb seem, are examined. Specifically,
it is shown that previously-proposed ele-
mentary trees for seem with an experiencer
argument are inadequate, based upon syn-
tactic testing. In Storoshenko (2006), new
articulated structures for the seem pred-
icate are proposed, modelled upon the
treatment of ditransitive verbs. This pa-
per recapitulates and further motivates the
ditransitive-style analysis, while illustrat-
ing its potential value in issues surround-
ing extraction and the raising construction
in TAG.
