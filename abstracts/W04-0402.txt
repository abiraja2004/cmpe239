Some particular classes of lexical paraphrases such
as verb alteration and compound noun decomposi-
tion can be handled by a handful of general rules
and lexical semantic knowledge. In this paper, we
attempt to capture the regularity underlying these
classes of paraphrases, focusing on the paraphras-
ing of Japanese light-verb constructions (LVCs).
We propose a paraphrasing model for LVCs that
is based on transforming the Lexical Conceptual
Structures (LCSs) of verbal elements. We also pro-
pose a refinement of an existing LCS dictionary. Ex-
perimental results show that our LCS-based para-
phrasing model characterizes some of the semantic
features of those verbs required for generating para-
phrases, such as the direction of an action and the
relationship between arguments and surface cases.
