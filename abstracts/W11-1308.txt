This paper reports on the participation of the
NLP GROUP at UNED in the DiSCo?2011
compositionality evaluation task. The aim of
the task is to predict compositionality judge-
ments assigned by human raters to candidate
phrases, in English and German, from three
common grammatical relations: adjective-
noun, subject-verb and subject-object.
Our participation is restricted to adjective-
noun relations in English. We explore the
use of syntactic-based contexts obtained from
large corpora to build classifiers that model
the compositionality of the semantics of such
pairs.
