We propose models for semantic orienta-
tions of phrases as well as classification
methods based on the models. Although
each phrase consists of multiple words, the
semantic orientation of the phrase is not a
mere sum of the orientations of the com-
ponent words. Some words can invert the
orientation. In order to capture the prop-
erty of such phrases, we introduce latent
variables into the models. Through exper-
iments, we show that the proposed latent
variable models work well in the classifi-
cation of semantic orientations of phrases
and achieved nearly 82% classification ac-
curacy.
