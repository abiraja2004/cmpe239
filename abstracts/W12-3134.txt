We present Joshua 4.0, the newest version
of our open-source decoder for parsing-based
statistical machine translation. The main con-
tributions in this release are the introduction
of a compact grammar representation based
on packed tries, and the integration of our
implementation of pairwise ranking optimiza-
tion, J-PRO. We further present the exten-
sion of the Thrax SCFG grammar extractor
to pivot-based extraction of syntactically in-
formed sentential paraphrases.
