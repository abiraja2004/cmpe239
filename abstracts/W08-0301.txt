The treatment of ?spurious? words of source
language is an important problem but often
ignored in the discussion on phrase-based
SMT. This paper explains why it is impor-
tant and why it is not a trivial problem, and
proposes three models to handle spurious
source words. Experiments show that any
source word deletion model can improve a
phrase-based system by at least 1.6 BLEU
points and the most sophisticated model
improves by nearly 2 BLEU points. This
paper also explores the impact of training
data size and training data domain/genre on
source word deletion.
