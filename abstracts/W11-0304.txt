While many computational models have been
created to explore how children might learn
to segment words, the focus has largely been
on achieving higher levels of performance and
exploring cues suggested by artificial learning
experiments. We propose a broader focus that
includes designing models that display prop-
erties of infants? performance as they begin
to segment words. We develop an efficient
bootstrapping online learner with this focus in
mind, and evaluate it on child-directed speech.
In addition to attaining a high level of perfor-
mance, this model predicts the error patterns
seen in infants learning to segment words.
