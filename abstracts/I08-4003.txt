 
We study an adaptive learning framework 
for phonetic similarity modeling (PSM) that 
supports the automatic acquisition of trans-
literations by exploiting minimum prior 
knowledge about machine transliteration to 
mine transliterations incrementally from the 
live Web. We formulate an incremental 
learning strategy for the framework based 
on Bayesian theory for PSM adaptation. 
The idea of incremental learning is to bene-
fit from the continuously developing his-
tory to update a static model towards the in-
tended reality. In this way, the learning 
process refines the PSM incrementally 
while constructing a transliteration lexicon 
at the same time on a development corpus. 
We further demonstrate that the proposed 
learning framework is reliably effective in 
mining live transliterations from Web query 
results.
