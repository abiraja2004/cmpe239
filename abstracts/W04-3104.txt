 
One of the routine tasks for model organ-
ism database curators is to identify and 
associate research articles to database en-
tries. Such task can be considered as text 
categorization which has been studied in 
the general English domain. The task can 
be decomposed into two text categoriza-
tion subtasks: i) finding relevant articles 
associating with specific model organ-
isms, and ii) routing the articles to spe-
cific entries or specific areas. In this 
paper, we investigated the first subtask 
and designed a study using existing refer-
ence information available at four well-
known model organism databases and 
investigated the problem of identifying 
relevant articles for these organisms. We 
used features obtained from abstract text 
and titles. Additionally, we studied the de-
termination power of other MEDLINE ci-
tation fields (e.g., Authors, 
MeshHeadings, Journals). Furthermore, 
we compared three supervised machine 
learning techniques on predicting to 
which organism the article belongs.
