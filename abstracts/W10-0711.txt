This paper describes a semi-automatic para-
phrasing task for English-Arabic machine
translation conducted using Amazon Me-
chanical Turk. The method for automatically
extracting paraphrases is described, as are
several human judgment tasks completed by
Turkers. An ideal task type, revised specif-
ically to address feedback from Turkers, is
shown to be sophisticated enough to identify
and filter problem Turkers while remaining
simple enough for non-experts to complete.
The results of this task are discussed along
with the viability of using this data to combat
data sparsity in MT.
