We propose the use of Lexicalized Tree
Adjoining Grammar (LTAG) as a source
of features that are useful for reranking
the output of a statistical parser. In this
paper, we extend the notion of a tree ker-
nel over arbitrary sub-trees of the parse to
the derivation trees and derived trees pro-
vided by the LTAG formalism, and in ad-
dition, we extend the original definition
of the tree kernel, making it more lexi-
calized and more compact. We use LTAG
based features for the parse reranking task
and obtain labeled recall and precision of
89.7%/90.0% on WSJ section 23 of Penn
Treebank for sentences of length ? 100
words. Our results show that the use
of LTAG based tree kernel gives rise to
a 17% relative difference in f -score im-
provement over the use of a linear kernel
without LTAG based features.
