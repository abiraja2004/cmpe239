This paper introduces a new method to im-
prove tree edit distance approach to tex-
tual entailment recognition, using particle
swarm optimization. Currently, one of the
main constraints of recognizing textual en-
tailment using tree edit distance is to tune
the cost of edit operations, which is a dif-
ficult and challenging task in dealing with
the entailment problem and datasets. We
tried to estimate the cost of edit operations
in tree edit distance algorithm automati-
cally, in order to improve the results for
textual entailment. Automatically estimat-
ing the optimal values of the cost opera-
tions over all RTE development datasets,
we proved a significant enhancement in
accuracy obtained on the test sets.
