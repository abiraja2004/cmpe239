Traditional approaches to the task of ACE
event extraction usually rely on sequential
pipelines with multiple stages, which suf-
fer from error propagation since event trig-
gers and arguments are predicted in isola-
tion by independent local classifiers. By
contrast, we propose a joint framework
based on structured prediction which ex-
tracts triggers and arguments together so
that the local predictions can be mutu-
ally improved. In addition, we propose
to incorporate global features which ex-
plicitly capture the dependencies of multi-
ple triggers and arguments. Experimental
results show that our joint approach with
local features outperforms the pipelined
baseline, and adding global features fur-
ther improves the performance signifi-
cantly. Our approach advances state-of-
the-art sentence-level event extraction, and
even outperforms previous argument la-
beling methods which use external knowl-
edge from other sentences and documents.
