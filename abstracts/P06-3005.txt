It has previously been assumed in the
psycholinguistic literature that finite-state
models of language are crucially limited
in their explanatory power by the local-
ity of the probability distribution and the
narrow scope of information used by the
model. We show that a simple computa-
tional model (a bigram part-of-speech tag-
ger based on the design used by Corley
and Crocker (2000)) makes correct predic-
tions on processing difficulty observed in a
wide range of empirical sentence process-
ing data. We use two modes of evaluation:
one that relies on comparison with a con-
trol sentence, paralleling practice in hu-
man studies; another that measures prob-
ability drop in the disambiguating region
of the sentence. Both are surprisingly
good indicators of the processing difficulty
of garden-path sentences. The sentences
tested are drawn from published sources
and systematically explore five different
types of ambiguity: previous studies have
been narrower in scope and smaller in
scale. We do not deny the limitations of
finite-state models, but argue that our re-
sults show that their usefulness has been
underestimated.
