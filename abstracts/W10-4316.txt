ommendation systems. To provide reliable recom-
mendations to users, we incorporate a review summa-
rization technique which extracts informative opinion 
summaries from grass-roots users? reviews. The dia-
logue system then utilizes these review summaries to 
support both quality-based opinion inquiry and fea-
ture-specific entity search. We propose a probabilistic 
language generation approach to automatically creat-
ing recommendations in spoken natural language 
from the text-based opinion summaries. A user study 
in the restaurant domain shows that the proposed ap-
proaches can effectively generate reliable and helpful 
recommendations in human-computer conversations.
