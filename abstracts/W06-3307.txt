The task of mining relations from collec-
tions of documents is usually approached
in two different ways. One type of sys-
tems do relation extraction from individ-
ual sentences, followed by an aggrega-
tion of the results over the entire collec-
tion. Other systems follow an entirely dif-
ferent approach, in which co-occurrence
counts are used to determine whether the
mentioning together of two entities is due
to more than simple chance. We show
that increased extraction performance can
be obtained by combining the two ap-
proaches into an integrated relation ex-
traction model.
