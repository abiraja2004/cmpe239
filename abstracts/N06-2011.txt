Prior work has shown that generaliza-
tion of data in an Example Based Ma-
chine Translation (EBMT) system, re-
duces the amount of pre-translated text re-
quired to achieve a certain level of accu-
racy (Brown, 2000). Several word clus-
tering algorithms have been suggested to
perform these generalizations, such as k-
Means clustering or Group Average Clus-
tering. The hypothesis is that better con-
textual clustering can lead to better trans-
lation accuracy with limited training data.
In this paper, we use a form of spectral
clustering to cluster words, and this is
shown to result in as much as 29.08% im-
provement over the baseline EBMT sys-
tem.
