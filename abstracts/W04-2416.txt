In this paper, we present a semantic role la-
beler (or chunker) that groups syntactic chunks
(i.e. base phrases) into the arguments of a pred-
icate. This is accomplished by casting the se-
mantic labeling as the classification of syntactic
chunks (e.g. NP-chunk, PP-chunk) into one of
several classes such as the beginning of an ar-
gument (B-ARG), inside an argument (I-ARG)
and outside an argument (O). This amounts to
tagging syntactic chunks with semantic labels
using the IOB representation. The chunker is
realized using support vector machines as one-
versus-all classifiers. We describe the represen-
tation of data and information used to accom-
plish the task. We participate in the ?closed
challenge? of the CoNLL-2004 shared task and
report results on both development and test
sets.
