 
This paper argues that a lexical database should be 
implemented with a special kind of database 
management system (DBMS) and outlines the design of 
such a system. The major difference between this 
proposal and a general purpose DBMS is that its data 
definition language (DDL) allows the specification of 
the entire morphology, which turns the lexical database 
from a mere collection of 'static' data into a real-time 
word-analyser. Moreover, the dedication of the system 
conduces to the feasibility of user interfaces with very 
comfortable monitor- and manipulation functions.
