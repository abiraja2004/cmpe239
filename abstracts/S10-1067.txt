 
This paper describes the PKU_HIT system 
on event detection in the SemEval-2010 
Task. We construct three modules for the 
three sub-tasks of this evaluation. For 
target verb WSD, we build a Na?ve 
Bayesian classifier which uses additional 
training instances expanded from an 
untagged Chinese corpus automatically. 
For sentence SRL and event detection, we 
use a feature-based machine learning 
method which makes combined use of 
both constituent-based and dependency-
based features. Experimental results show 
that the Macro Accuracy of the WSD 
module reaches 83.81% and F-Score of 
the SRL module is 55.71%.
