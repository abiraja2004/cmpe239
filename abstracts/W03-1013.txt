This paper describes log-linear pars-
ing models for Combinatory Categorial
Grammar (CCG). Log-linear models can
easily encode the long-range dependen-
cies inherent in coordination and extrac-
tion phenomena, which CCG was designed
to handle. Log-linear models have pre-
viously been applied to statistical pars-
ing, under the assumption that all possible
parses for a sentence can be enumerated.
Enumerating all parses is infeasible for
large grammars; however, dynamic pro-
gramming over a packed chart can be used
to efficiently estimate the model parame-
ters. We describe a parellelised implemen-
tation which runs on a Beowulf cluster and
allows the complete WSJ Penn Treebank
to be used for estimation.
