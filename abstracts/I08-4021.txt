 
This paper presents a morpheme-based 
part-of-speech tagger for Chinese. It con-
sists of two main components, namely a 
morpheme segmenter to segment each 
word in a sentence into a sequence of mor-
phemes, based on forward maximum 
matching, and a lexical tagger to label each 
morpheme with a proper tag indicating its 
position pattern in forming a word of a 
specific class, based on lexicalized hidden 
Markov models. This system have partici-
pated four closed tracks for POS tagging at 
the Fourth International Chinese Language 
Processing Bakeoff sponsored by the ACL-
SIGHAN.
