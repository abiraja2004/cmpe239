 
Word Sense Induction (WSI) is an 
important topic in natural langage 
processing area. For the bakeoff task 
Chinese Word Sense Induction (CWSI), 
this paper proposes two systems using 
basic clustering algorithms, k-means and 
agglomerative clustering. Experimental 
results show that k-means achieves a 
better performance. Based only on the 
data provided by the task organizers, the 
two systems get FScores of 0.7812 and 
0.7651 respectively.
