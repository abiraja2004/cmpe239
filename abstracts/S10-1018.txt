This paper presents SUCRE, a new soft-
ware tool for coreference resolution and
its feature engineering. It is able to sep-
arately do noun, pronoun and full coref-
erence resolution. SUCRE introduces a
new approach to the feature engineering
of coreference resolution based on a rela-
tional database model and a regular feature
definition language. SUCRE successfully
participated in SemEval-2010 Task 1 on
Coreference Resolution in Multiple Lan-
guages (Recasens et al, 2010) for gold
and regular closed annotation tracks of six
languages. It obtained the best results in
several categories, including the regular
closed annotation tracks of English and
German.
