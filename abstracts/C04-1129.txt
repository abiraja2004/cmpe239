In this paper, we explore the use of automatic
syntactic simplification for improving content
selection in multi-document summarization. In
particular, we show how simplifying parenthet-
icals by removing relative clauses and apposi-
tives results in improved sentence clustering, by
forcing clustering based on central rather than
background information. We argue that the in-
clusion of parenthetical information in a sum-
mary is a reference-generation task rather than a
content-selection one, and implement a baseline
reference rewriting module. We perform our
evaluations on the test sets from the 2003 and
2004 Document Understanding Conference and
report that simplifying parentheticals results in
significant improvement on the automated eval-
uation metric Rouge.
