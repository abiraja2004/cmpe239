In automated speech assessment, adaptation of
language models (LMs) to test questions is im-
portant to achieve high recognition accuracy
However, for large-scale language tests, the
ordinary supervised training, which uses an
expensive and time-consuming manual tran-
scription process, is hard to utilize for LM
adaptation. In this paper, several LM adap-
tation methods that require either no manual
transcription process or just a small amount of
transcriptions have been evaluated. Our ex-
periments suggest that these LM adaptation
methods can allow us to obtain considerable
recognition accuracy gain with no or low hu-
man transcription cost.
