 
This paper describes a coreference resolution 
system for CONLL 2012 shared task 
developed by HLT_HITSZ group, which 
incorporates rule-based and statistic-based 
techniques. The system performs coreference 
resolution through the mention pair 
classification and linking. For each detected 
mention pairs in the text, a Decision Tree (DT) 
based binary classifier is applied to determine 
whether they form a coreference. This 
classifier incorporates 51 and 61 selected 
features for English and Chinese, respectively. 
Meanwhile, a rule-based classifier is applied to 
recognize some specific types of coreference, 
especially the ones with long distances. The 
outputs of these two classifiers are merged. 
Next, the recognized coreferences are linked to 
generate the final coreference chain. This 
system is evaluated on English and Chinese 
sides (Closed Track), respectively. It achieves 
0.5861 and 0.6003 F1 score on the 
development data of English and Chinese, 
respectively. As for the test dataset, the 
achieved F1 scores are 0.5749 and 0.6508, 
respectively. This encouraging performance 
shows the effectiveness of our proposed 
coreference resolution system.
