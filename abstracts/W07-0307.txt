The recent advances in speech recognition
technologies, and the experience acquired
in the development of WEB or Interac-
tive Voice Response interfaces, have facil-
itated the integration of speech modules
in robust Spoken Dialog Systems (SDS),
leading to the deployment on a large scale
of speech-enabled services. With these
services it is possible to obtain very large
corpora of human-machine interactions by
collecting system logs. This new kinds of
systems and dialogue corpora offer new
opportunities for academic research while
raising two issues: How can academic re-
search take profit of the system logs of
deployed SDS in order to build the next
generation of SDS, although the dialogues
collected have a dialogue flow constrained
by the previous SDS generation? On the
other side, what immediate benefits can
academic research offer for the improve-
ment of deployed system? This paper ad-
dresses these aspects in the framework of
the deployed France Telecom 3000 Voice
Agency service.
