We present a corpus study of local dis-
course relations based on the Penn Dis-
course Tree Bank, a large manually anno-
tated corpus of explicitly or implicitly re-
alized relations. We show that while there
is a large degree of ambiguity in temporal
explicit discourse connectives, overall con-
nectives are mostly unambiguous and al-
low high-accuracy prediction of discourse
relation type. We achieve 93.09% accu-
racy in classifying the explicit relations
and 74.74% accuracy overall. In addition,
we show that some pairs of relations oc-
cur together in text more often than ex-
pected by chance. This finding suggests
that global sequence classification of the
relations in text can lead to better results,
especially for implicit relations.
