In an ordinary syntactic parser, the input is a string,
and the grammar ranges over strings. This paper
explores generalizations of ordinary parsing algo-
rithms that allow the input to consist of string tu-
ples and/or the grammar to range over string tu-
ples. Such algorithms can infer the synchronous
structures hidden in parallel texts. It turns out that
these generalized parsers can do most of the work
required to train and apply a syntax-aware statisti-
cal machine translation system.
