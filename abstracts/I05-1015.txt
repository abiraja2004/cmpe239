. We present a method of chunking in Korean texts using conditional 
random fields (CRFs), a recently introduced probabilistic model for labeling 
and segmenting sequence of data. In agglutinative languages such as Korean 
and Japanese, a rule-based chunking method is predominantly used for its sim-
plicity and efficiency. A hybrid of a rule-based and machine learning method 
was also proposed to handle exceptional cases of the rules. In this paper, we 
present how CRFs can be applied to the task of chunking in Korean texts. Ex-
periments using the STEP 2000 dataset show that the proposed method signifi-
cantly improves the performance as well as outperforms previous systems.
