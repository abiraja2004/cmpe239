Bilingual lexicons are fundamental re-
sources. Modern automated lexicon gen-
eration methods usually require parallel
corpora, which are not available for most
language pairs. Lexicons can be gener-
ated using non-parallel corpora or a pivot
language, but such lexicons are noisy.
We present an algorithm for generating
a high quality lexicon from a noisy one,
which only requires an independent cor-
pus for each language. Our algorithm in-
troduces non-aligned signatures (NAS), a
cross-lingual word context similarity score
that avoids the over-constrained and inef-
ficient nature of alignment-based methods.
We use NAS to eliminate incorrect transla-
tions from the generated lexicon. We eval-
uate our method by improving the quality
of noisy Spanish-Hebrew lexicons gener-
ated from two pivot English lexicons. Our
algorithm substantially outperforms other
lexicon generation methods.
