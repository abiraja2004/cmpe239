We tested a linguistically motivated rule-
based system in the Cancer Genetics task 
of the BioNLP13 shared task challenge. 
The performance of the system was very 
moderate, ranging from 52% against the 
development set to 45% against the test 
set. Interestingly, the performance of the 
system did not change appreciably when 
using only  entities tagged by the inbuilt 
tagger as compared to performance using 
the gold-tagged entities. The lack of an 
event anaphoric module, as well as prob-
lems in reducing events generated by a 
large trigger class to the task-specific 
event subset, were likely major contribut-
ory factors to the rather moderate per-
formance.
