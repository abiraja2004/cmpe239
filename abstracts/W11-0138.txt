The paper presents an ongoing research that aims at OWL ontology authoring and verbalizationusing a deterministic controlled natural language (CNL) that would be as natural and intuitive aspossible. Moreover, we focus on a multilingual CNL interface to OWL by considering both highlyanalytical and highly synthetic languages (namely, English and Latvian). We propose a flexible two-level translation approach that is enabled by the Grammatical Framework and that has allowed us todevelop a more natural, but still predictable multilingual CNL on top of the widely used AttemptoControlled English (its subset for OWL, ACE-OWL). This has also allowed us to exploit the readilyavailable ACE parser and verbalizer not only for the modified and extended version of ACE-OWL,but also for the corresponding controlled Latvian.
