This paper presents an easy-to-adapt,
discourse-aware framework that can be
utilized as the content selection compo-
nent of a generation system whose goal is
to deliver descriptive texts in several turns.
Our framework involves a novel use of a
graph-based ranking algorithm, to itera-
tively determine what content to convey to
a given request while taking into account
various considerations such as capturing a
priori importance of information, convey-
ing related information, avoiding redun-
dancy, and incorporating the effects of dis-
course history. We illustrate and evaluate
this framework in an accessibility system
for sight-impaired individuals.
