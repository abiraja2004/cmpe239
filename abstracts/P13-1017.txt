In this paper, we explore a novel bilin-
gual word alignment approach based on
DNN (Deep Neural Network), which has
been proven to be very effective in var-
ious machine learning tasks (Collobert
et al, 2011). We describe in detail
how we adapt and extend the CD-DNN-
HMM (Dahl et al, 2012) method intro-
duced in speech recognition to the HMM-
based word alignment model, in which
bilingual word embedding is discrimina-
tively learnt to capture lexical translation
information, and surrounding words are
leveraged to model context information
in bilingual sentences. While being ca-
pable to model the rich bilingual corre-
spondence, our method generates a very
compact model with much fewer parame-
ters. Experiments on a large scale English-
Chinese word alignment task show that the
proposed method outperforms the HMM
and IBM model 4 baselines by 2 points in
F-score.
