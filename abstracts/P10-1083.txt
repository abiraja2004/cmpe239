We present a system that learns to fol-
low navigational natural language direc-
tions. Where traditional models learn
from linguistic annotation or word distri-
butions, our approach is grounded in the
world, learning by apprenticeship from
routes through a map paired with English
descriptions. Lacking an explicit align-
ment between the text and the reference
path makes it difficult to determine what
portions of the language describe which
aspects of the route. We learn this corre-
spondence with a reinforcement learning
algorithm, using the deviation of the route
we follow from the intended path as a re-
ward signal. We demonstrate that our sys-
tem successfully grounds the meaning of
spatial terms like above and south into ge-
ometric properties of paths.
