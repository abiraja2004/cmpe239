Building on work detecting errors in de-
pendency annotation, we set out to correct
local dependency errors. To do this, we
outline the properties of annotation errors
that make the task challenging and their
existence problematic for learning. For
the task, we define a feature-based model
that explicitly accounts for non-relations
between words, and then use ambiguities
from one model to constrain a second,
more relaxed model. In this way, we are
successfully able to correct many errors,
in a way which is potentially applicable to
dependency parsing more generally.
