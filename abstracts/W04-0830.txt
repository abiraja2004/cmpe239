 
This paper describes the architecture and re-
sults of the University of Ja?n system pre-
sented at the SENSEVAL-3 for the English-
lexical-sample and English-All-Words tasks. 
The system is based on a neural network ap-
proach. We have used the Learning Vector 
Quantization, which is a supervised learning 
algorithm based on the Kohonen neural model.
