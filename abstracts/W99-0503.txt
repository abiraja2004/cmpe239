 
Vve zeport a number of computatmnal ex- 
periments m supervised learning whose 
goal Is to automatmally classify a set of 
verbs into lexmal semanUc classes, based 
on frequency dlstnbutmn approxlmatmns 
of grammatical features extracted from a 
very large annotated corpus DlstnbuUons 
of five syntactic features that approximate 
tranmUvlty alternatmns and thematic role 
assignments are sufficient to reduce error 
rate by 56% over chance We conclude 
that corpus data is a usable repository of 
verb class mformatmn, and that corpus- 
driven extraction of grammaUcal features 
Is a promising methodology for automatm 
lexmal acqum,Uon
