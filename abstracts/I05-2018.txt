 
In this paper, we proposed an approach 
for detecting the countability of English 
compound nouns treating the web as 
a large corpus of words. We classified 
compound nouns into three classes: 
countable, uncountable, plural only. 
Our detecting algorithm is based on 
simple, viable n-gram models, whose 
parameters can be obtained using the 
WWW search engine Google. The de-
tecting thresholds are optimized on the 
small training set. Finally we 
experimentally showed that our 
algorithm based on these simple 
models could perform the promising 
results with a precision of 89.2% on the 
total test set.
