We propose a detection method for or-
thographic variants caused by translit-
eration in a large corpus. The method
employs two similarities. One is string
similarity based on edit distance. The
other is contextual similarity by a vec-
tor space model. Experimental results
show that the method performed a 0.889
F-measure in an open test.
