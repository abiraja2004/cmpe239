This paper proposes a framework for representing cross-lingual/interlingual lexical semantic cor-
respondences that are expected to be recovered through a series of on-demand/on-the-fly invocations
of a lexical semantic matching process. One of the central notions of the proposed framework is a
pseudo synset, which is introduced to represent a cross-lingual/multilingual lexical concept, jointly
denoted by word senses in more than one language. Another important ingredient of the proposed
framework is a framework for semantifying bilingual lexical resource entries. This is a necessary
substep when associating and representing corresponding lexical concepts in different languages
by using bilingual lexical resources. Based on these devices, this paper further discusses possible
extensions to the ISO standard lexical markup framework (LMF). These extensions would enable re-
covered correspondences to be organized as a dynamic secondary language resource, while keeping
the existing primary language resources intact.
