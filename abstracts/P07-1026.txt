 
Convolution tree kernel has shown promis-
ing results in semantic role classification. 
However, it only carries out hard matching, 
which may lead to over-fitting and less ac-
curate similarity measure. To remove the 
constraint, this paper proposes a grammar-
driven convolution tree kernel for semantic 
role classification by introducing more lin-
guistic knowledge into the standard tree 
kernel. The proposed grammar-driven tree 
kernel displays two advantages over the pre-
vious one: 1) grammar-driven approximate 
substructure matching and 2) grammar-
driven approximate tree node matching. The 
two improvements enable the grammar-
driven tree kernel explore more linguistically 
motivated structure features than the previ-
ous one. Experiments on the CoNLL-2005 
SRL shared task show that the grammar-
driven tree kernel significantly outperforms 
the previous non-grammar-driven one in 
SRL. Moreover, we present a composite 
kernel to integrate feature-based and tree 
kernel-based methods. Experimental results 
show that the composite kernel outperforms 
the previously best-reported methods.
