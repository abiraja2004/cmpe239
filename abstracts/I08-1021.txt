We describe a graph-based approach to Sce-
nario Template Creation, which is the task
of creating a representation of multiple re-
lated events, such as reports of different hur-
ricane incidents. We argue that context is
valuable to identify important, semantically
similar text spans from which template slots
could be generalized. To leverage context,
we represent the input as a set of graphs
where predicate-argument tuples are ver-
tices and their contextual relations are edges.
A context-sensitive clustering framework is
then applied to obtain meaningful tuple clus-
ters by examining their intrinsic and extrin-
sic similarities. The clustering framework
uses Expectation Maximization to guide the
clustering process. Experiments show that:
1) our approach generates high quality clus-
ters, and 2) information extracted from the
clusters is adequate to build high coverage
templates.
