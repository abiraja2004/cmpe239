We propose in this paper a method for
quantifying sentence grammaticality. The
approach based on Property Grammars,
a constraint-based syntactic formalism,
makes it possible to evaluate a grammat-
icality index for any kind of sentence, in-
cluding ill-formed ones. We compare on
a sample of sentences the grammaticality
indices obtained from PG formalism and
the acceptability judgements measured by
means of a psycholinguistic analysis. The
results show that the derived grammatical-
ity index is a fairly good tracer of accept-
ability scores.
