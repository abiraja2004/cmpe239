Countability of English nouns is impor-
tant in various natural language process-
ing tasks. It especially plays an important
role in machine translation since it deter-
mines the range of possible determiners.
This paper proposes a method for reinforc-
ing countability prediction by introducing
a novel concept called one countability per
discourse. It claims that when a noun
appears more than once in a discourse,
they will all share the same countability in
the discourse. The basic idea of the pro-
posed method is that mispredictions can
be correctly overridden using efficiently
the one countability per discourse prop-
erty. Experiments show that the proposed
method successfully reinforces countabil-
ity prediction and outperforms other meth-
ods used for comparison.
