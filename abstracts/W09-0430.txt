 
This paper presents our first attempt at con-
structing a Vietnamese-French statistical 
machine translation system. Since Vietnam-
ese is an under-resourced language, we con-
centrate on building a large Vietnamese-
French parallel corpus. A document align-
ment method based on publication date, spe-
cial words and sentence alignment result is 
proposed. The paper also presents an appli-
cation of the obtained parallel corpus to the 
construction of a Vietnamese-French statis-
tical machine translation system, where the 
use of different units for Vietnamese (sylla-
bles, words, or their combinations) is dis-
cussed.
