We consider the problem of how the mean-
ings of words can be grounded in sensor data.
A probabilistic representation for the mean-
ings of words is defined, a method for recov-
ering meanings from observational information
about word use in the face of referential uncer-
tainty is described, and empirical results with
real utterances and robot sensor data are pre-
sented.
