State-of-the-art Question Answering (QA)
systems are very sensitive to variations
in the phrasing of an information need.
Finding the preferred language for such
a need is a valuable task. We investi-
gate that claim by adopting a simple MT-
based paraphrasing technique and evalu-
ating QA system performance on para-
phrased questions. We found a potential
increase of 35% in MRR with respect to
the original question.
