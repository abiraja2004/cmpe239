This paper presents a system which adopts
a standard sequence labeling technique for
hedge detection and scope finding. For
the first task, hedge detection, we formu-
late it as a hedge labeling problem, while
for the second task, we use a two-step la-
beling strategy, one for hedge cue label-
ing and the other for scope finding. In par-
ticular, various kinds of syntactic features
are systemically exploited and effectively
integrated using a large-scale normalized
feature selection method. Evaluation on
the CoNLL-2010 shared task shows that
our system achieves stable and competi-
tive results for all the closed tasks. Fur-
thermore, post-deadline experiments show
that the performance can be much further
improved using a sufficient feature selec-
tion.
