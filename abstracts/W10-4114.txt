 
Existing methods for extracting features 
from Chinese reviews only use 
simplistic syntactic knowledge, while 
those for identifying sentiments rely 
heavily on a semantic dictionary. In this 
paper, we present a systematic technique 
for identifying features and sentiments, 
using both syntactic and statistical anal-
ysis. We firstly identify candidate fea-
tures using a proposed set of common 
syntactic rules. We then prune irrelevant 
candidates with topical relevance scores 
below a cut-off point. We also propose 
an association analysis method based on 
likelihood ratio test to infer the polarity 
of opinion word. The sentiment of a fea-
ture is finally adjusted by analyzing the 
negative modifiers in the local context 
of the opinion word. Experimental re-
sults show that our system performs sig-
nificantly better than a well-known opi-
nion mining system.
