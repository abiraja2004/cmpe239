The present paper is concerned with sta-
tistical parsing of constituent structures
in German. The paper presents four ex-
periments that aim at improving parsing
performance of coordinate structure: 1)
reranking the n-best parses of a PCFG
parser, 2) enriching the input to a PCFG
parser by gold scopes for any conjunct, 3)
reranking the parser output for all possi-
ble scopes for conjuncts that are permissi-
ble with regard to clause structure. Exper-
iment 4 reranks a combination of parses
from experiments 1 and 3.
The experiments presented show that n-
best parsing combined with reranking im-
proves results by a large margin. Provid-
ing the parser with different scope possi-
bilities and reranking the resulting parses
results in an increase in F-score from
69.76 for the baseline to 74.69. While the
F-score is similar to the one of the first ex-
periment (n-best parsing and reranking),
the first experiment results in higher re-
call (75.48% vs. 73.69%) and the third one
in higher precision (75.43% vs. 73.26%).
Combining the two methods results in the
best result with an F-score of 76.69.
