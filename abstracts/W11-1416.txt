To overcome their substantial barriers to flu-
ent reading, students with dyslexia need to be
enticed to read more, and to read texts with
carefully controlled lexical content. We de-
scribe and show examples from a prototype of
the new R2aft story assembly engine, which
generates an interactive text that has A) vari-
able plot and B) lexical content which is indi-
vidualized by decoding pattern.
