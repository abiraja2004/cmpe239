Abstract
We introduce a new categorial formal-
ism based on intuitionistic linear logic.
This formalism, which derives from
current type-logical grammars, is ab-
stract in the sense that both syntax and
semantics are handled by the same set
of primitives. As a consequence, the
formalism is reversible and provides
different computational paradigms that
may be freely composed together.
