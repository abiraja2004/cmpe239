One major bottleneck in conversational sys-
tems is their incapability in interpreting un-
expected user language inputs such as out-of-
vocabulary words. To overcome this problem,
conversational systems must be able to learn
new words automatically during human ma-
chine conversation. Motivated by psycholin-
guistic findings on eye gaze and human lan-
guage processing, we are developing tech-
niques to incorporate human eye gaze for au-
tomatic word acquisition in multimodal con-
versational systems. This paper investigates
the use of temporal alignment between speech
and eye gaze and the use of domain knowl-
edge in word acquisition. Our experiment re-
sults indicate that eye gaze provides a poten-
tial channel for automatically acquiring new
words. The use of extra temporal and domain
knowledge can significantly improve acquisi-
tion performance.
