 
We explore the role negation and speculation 
identification plays in the multi-label docu-
ment-level classification of medical reports for 
diseases. We identify the polarity of assertions 
made on noun phrases which reference dis-
eases in the medical reports. We experiment 
with two machine learning classifiers: one 
based upon Lucene and the other based upon 
BoosTexter. We find the performance of these 
systems on document-level classification of 
medical reports for diseases fails to show im-
provement when their input is enhanced by the 
polarity of assertions made on noun phrases. 
We conclude that due to the nature of our ma-
chine learning classifiers, information on the 
polarity of phrase-level assertions does not 
improve performance on our data in a multi-
label document-level classification task.
