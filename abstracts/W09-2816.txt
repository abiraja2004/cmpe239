The GREC-MSR Task at Generation Chal-
lenges 2009 required participating systems
to select coreference chains to the main
subject of short encyclopaedic texts col-
lected from Wikipedia. Three teams sub-
mitted one system each, and we addition-
ally created four baseline systems. Sys-
tems were tested automatically using ex-
isting intrinsic metrics. We also evaluated
systems extrinsically by applying corefer-
ence resolution tools to the outputs and
measuring the success of the tools. In ad-
dition, systems were tested in an intrinsic
evaluation involving human judges. This
report describes the GREC-MSR Task and
the evaluation methods applied, gives brief
descriptions of the participating systems,
and presents the evaluation results.
