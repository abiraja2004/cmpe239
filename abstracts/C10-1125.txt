The precise identification of light verb
constructions is crucial for the successful
functioning of several NLP applications.
In order to facilitate the development of
an algorithm that is capable of recogniz-
ing them, a manually annotated corpus of
light verb constructions has been built for
Hungarian. Basic annotation guidelines
and statistical data on the corpus are also
presented in the paper. It is also shown
how applications in the fields of machine
translation and information extraction can
make use of such a corpus and an algo-
rithm.
