This paper describes the NICT statis-
tical machine translation (SMT) system
used for the WMT 2009 Shared Task
(WMT09) evaluation. We participated in
the Spanish-English translation task. The
focus of this year?s participation was to in-
vestigate model adaptation and transliter-
ation techniques in order to improve the
translation quality of the baseline phrase-
based SMT system.
