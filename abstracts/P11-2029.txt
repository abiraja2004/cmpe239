 
Word alignment is a central problem in sta-
tistical machine translation (SMT). In re-
cent years, supervised alignment algo-
rithms, which improve alignment accuracy 
by mimicking human alignment, have at-
tracted a great deal of attention. The objec-
tive of this work is to explore the perform-
ance limit of supervised alignment under 
the current SMT paradigm. Our experi-
ments used a manually aligned Chinese-
English corpus with 280K words recently 
released by the Linguistic Data Consortium 
(LDC). We treated the human alignment as 
the oracle of supervised alignment. The re-
sult is surprising:  the gain of human 
alignment over a state of the art unsuper-
vised method (GIZA++) is less than 1 point 
in BLEU. Furthermore, we showed the 
benefit of improved alignment becomes 
smaller with more training data, implying 
the above limit also holds for large training 
conditions.
