 
Statistical systems with high accuracy are very 
useful in real-world applications. If these sys-
tems can capture basic linguistic information, 
then the usefulness of these statistical systems 
improve a lot. This paper is an attempt at in-
corporating linguistic constraints in statistical 
dependency parsing. We consider a simple 
linguistic constraint that a verb should not 
have multiple subjects/objects as its children 
in the dependency tree. We first describe the 
importance of this constraint considering Ma-
chine Translation systems which use depen-
dency parser output, as an example applica-
tion. We then show how the current state-of-
the-art dependency parsers violate this con-
straint. We present two new methods to handle 
this constraint. We evaluate our methods on 
the state-of-the-art dependency parsers for 
Hindi and Czech.
