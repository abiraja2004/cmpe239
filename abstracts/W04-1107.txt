 
Spec is a critical issue for automatic chunking. 
This paper proposes a solution of Chinese 
chunking with another type of spec, which is 
not derived from a complete syntactic tree but 
only based on the un-bracketed, POS tagged 
corpus. With this spec, a chunked data is built 
and HMM is used to build the chunker. TBL-
based error correction is used to further 
improve chunking performance. The average 
chunk length is about 1.38 tokens, F measure 
of chunking achieves 91.13%, labeling 
accuracy alone achieves 99.80% and the ratio 
of crossing brackets is 2.87%. We also find 
that the hardest point of Chinese chunking is 
to identify the chunking boundary inside 
noun-noun sequences1.
