This paper assesses the role of multi-label
classification in modelling polysemy for lan-
guage acquisition tasks. We focus on the ac-
quisition of semantic classes for Catalan ad-
jectives, and show that polysemy acquisition
naturally suits architectures used for multi-
label classification. Furthermore, we ex-
plore the performance of information drawn
from different levels of linguistic descrip-
tion, using feature sets based on morphol-
ogy, syntax, semantics, and n-gram distribu-
tion. Finally, we demonstrate that ensemble
classifiers are a powerful and adequate way
to combine different types of linguistic ev-
idence: a simple, majority voting ensemble
classifier improves the accuracy from 62.5%
(best single classifier) to 84%.
