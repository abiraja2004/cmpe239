Distributions of the senses of words are
often highly skewed. This fact is exploited
by word sense disambiguation (WSD) sys-
tems which back off to the predominant
sense of a word when contextual clues are
not strong enough. The domain of a doc-
ument has a strong influence on the sense
distribution of words, but it is not feasi-
ble to produce large manually annotated
corpora for every domain of interest. In
this paper we describe the construction of
three sense annotated corpora in different
domains for a sample of English words.
We apply an existing method for acquir-
ing predominant sense information auto-
matically from raw text, and for our sam-
ple demonstrate that (1) acquiring such
information automatically from a mixed-
domain corpus is more accurate than de-
riving it from SemCor, and (2) acquiring
it automatically from text in the same do-
main as the target domain performs best
by a large margin. We also show that
for an all words WSD task this automatic
method is best focussed on words that are
salient to the domain, and on words with
a different acquired predominant sense in
that domain compared to that acquired
from a balanced corpus.
