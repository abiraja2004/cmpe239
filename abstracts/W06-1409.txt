It is often desirable that referring expres-
sions be chosen in such a way that their
referents are easy to identify. In this paper,
we investigate to what extent identification
becomes easier by the addition of logically
redundant properties.We focus on hierar-
chically structured domains, whose con-
tent is not fully known to the reader when
the referring expression is uttered.
