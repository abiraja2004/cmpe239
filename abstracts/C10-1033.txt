Syntactic reordering on the source-side
is an effective way of handling word or-
der differences. The { (DE) construc-
tion is a flexible and ubiquitous syntac-
tic structure in Chinese which is a ma-
jor source of error in translation quality.
In this paper, we propose a new classi-
fier model ? discriminative latent vari-
able model (DPLVM) ? to classify the
DE construction to improve the accuracy
of the classification and hence the transla-
tion quality. We also propose a new fea-
ture which can automatically learn the re-
ordering rules to a certain extent. The ex-
perimental results show that the MT sys-
tems using the data reordered by our pro-
posed model outperform the baseline sys-
tems by 6.42% and 3.08% relative points
in terms of the BLEU score on PB-SMT
and hierarchical phrase-based MT respec-
tively. In addition, we analyse the impact
of DE annotation on word alignment and
on the SMT phrase table.
