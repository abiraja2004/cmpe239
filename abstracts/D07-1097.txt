We describe a two-stage optimization of the
MaltParser system for the ten languages in
the multilingual track of the CoNLL 2007
shared task on dependency parsing. The
first stage consists in tuning a single-parser
system for each language by optimizing pa-
rameters of the parsing algorithm, the fea-
ture model, and the learning algorithm. The
second stage consists in building an ensem-
ble system that combines six different pars-
ing strategies, extrapolating from the opti-
mal parameters settings for each language.
When evaluated on the official test sets, the
ensemble system significantly outperforms
the single-parser system and achieves the
highest average labeled attachment score.
