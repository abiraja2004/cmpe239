Teaching Computational Linguistics is in-
herently multi-disciplinary and frequently
poses challenges and provides opportunities in
teaching to a student body with diverse ed-
ucational backgrounds and goals. This pa-
per describes the use of a computational en-
vironment (SIDGrid) that facilitates interdis-
ciplinary instruction by providing support for
students with little computational background
as well as extending the scale of projects ac-
cessible to students with more advanced com-
putational skills. The environment facilitates
the use of hands-on exercises and is being ap-
plied to interdisciplinary instruction in Dis-
course and Dialogue.
