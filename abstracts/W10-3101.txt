In view of the increasing need to facilitate
processing the content of scientific papers,
we present an annotation scheme for anno-
tating full papers with zones of conceptu-
alisation, reflecting the information struc-
ture and knowledge types which constitute
a scientific investigation. The latter are the
Core Scientific Concepts (CoreSCs) and
include Hypothesis, Motivation, Goal, Ob-
ject, Background, Method, Experiment,
Model, Observation, Result and Conclu-
sion. The CoreSC scheme has been used
to annotate a corpus of 265 full papers in
physical chemistry and biochemistry and
we are currently automating the recogni-
tion of CoreSCs in papers. We discuss
how the CoreSC scheme relates to other
views of scientific papers and indeed how
the former could be used to help identify
negation and speculation in scientific texts.
