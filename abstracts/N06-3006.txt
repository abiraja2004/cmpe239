The goal of my proposed dissertation work
is to help answer two fundamental questions:
(1) How is emotion communicated in speech?
and (2) Does emotion modeling improve spo-
ken dialogue applications? In this paper I de-
scribe feature extraction and emotion classifi-
cation experiments I have conducted and plan
to conduct on three different domains: EPSaT,
HMIHY, and ITSpoke. In addition, I plan to
implement emotion modeling capabilities into
ITSpoke and evaluate the effectiveness of do-
ing so.
