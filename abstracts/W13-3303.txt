Explicit discourse connectives in a source
language text are not always translated to
comparable words or phrases in the tar-
get language. The paper provides a corpus
analysis and a method for semi-automatic
detection of such cases. Results show
that discourse connectives are not trans-
lated into comparable forms (or even any
form at all), in up to 18% of human refer-
ence translations from English to French
or German. In machine translation, this
happens much less frequently (up to 8%
only). Work in progress aims to cap-
ture this natural implicitation of discourse
connectives in current statistical machine
translation models.
