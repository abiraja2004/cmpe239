A challenging topic in Portuguese language
processing is the multifunctional and ambigu-
ous use of the clitic pronoun se, which impacts
NLP tasks such as syntactic parsing, semantic
role labeling and machine translation. Aiming
to give a step forward towards the automatic
disambiguation of se, our study focuses on the
identification of pronominal verbs, which cor-
respond to one of the six uses of se as a clitic
pronoun, when se is considered a CONSTITU-
TIVE PARTICLE of the verb lemma to which
it is bound, as a multiword unit. Our strategy
to identify such verbs is to analyze the results
of a corpus search and to rule out all the other
possible uses of se. This process evidenced
the features needed in a computational lexicon
to automatically perform the disambiguation
task. The availability of the resulting lexicon
of pronominal verbs on the web enables their
inclusion in broader lexical resources, such as
the Portuguese versions of Wordnet, Propbank
and VerbNet. Moreover, it will allow the revi-
sion of parsers and dictionaries already in use.
