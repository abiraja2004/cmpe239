This paper proposes a novel approach to the
induction of Combinatory Categorial Gram-
mars (CCGs) by their potential affinity with
the Genetic Algorithms (GAs). Specifically,
CCGs utilize a rich yet compact notation for
lexical categories, which combine with rela-
tively few grammatical rules, presumed uni-
versal. Thus, the search for a CCG consists
in large part in a search for the appropri-
ate categories for the data-set?s lexical items.
We present and evaluates a system utilizing
a simple GA to successively search and im-
prove on such assignments. The fitness of
categorial-assignments is approximated by
the coverage of the resulting grammar on the
data-set itself, and candidate solutions are
updated via the standard GA techniques of
reproduction, crossover and mutation.
