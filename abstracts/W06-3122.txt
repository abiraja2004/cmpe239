Complex Language Models cannot be eas-
ily integrated in the first pass decoding of
a Statistical Machine Translation system ?
the decoder queries the LM a very large
number of times; the search process in the
decoding builds the hypotheses incremen-
tally and cannot make use of LMs that
analyze the whole sentence. We present
in this paper the Language Computer?s
system for WMT06 that employs LM-
powered reranking on hypotheses gener-
ated by phrase-based SMT systems
