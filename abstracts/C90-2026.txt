: Ttfs paper describes a tractable method for 
parsing GPSG grmnmars without ,altering the modu- 
larity and expressiveness of this tbnnalism. The pro- 
posed method is based on a constraint propagation 
mech,'ufism which reduces the number of unnecessary 
structures built at parse thne through the early detec- 
tion of inadmissible local trees. The propagation of 
constraints is rendered efficient by indexing con- 
straints and categories in a connection graph m~d by 
using a bidirectional chat1 pm~er together with a bot- 
lore-up strategy centered around head constituents.
