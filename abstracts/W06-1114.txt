In this paper we propose two metrics to be
used in various fields of computational lin-
guistics area. Our construction is based on
the supposition that in most of the natural
languages the most important information
is carried by the first part of the unit. We
introduce total rank distance and scaled to-
tal rank distance, we prove that they are
metrics and investigate their max and ex-
pected values. Finally, a short application
is presented: we investigate the similarity
of Romance languages by computing the
scaled total rank distance between the di-
gram rankings of each language.
