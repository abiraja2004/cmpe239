This paper describes a computational ap-
proach to resolving the true referent of a
named mention of a person in the body of an
email. A generative model of mention gener-
ation is used to guide mention resolution. Re-
sults on three relatively small collections indi-
cate that the accuracy of this approach com-
pares favorably to the best known techniques,
and results on the full CMU Enron collection
indicate that it scales well to larger collections.
