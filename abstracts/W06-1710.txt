In this paper we present an approach to
structure learning in the area of web doc-
uments. This is done in order to approach
the goal of webgenre tagging in the area of
web corpus linguistics. A central outcome
of the paper is that purely structure ori-
ented approaches to web document classi-
fication provide an information gain which
may be utilized in combined approaches of
web content and structure analysis.
