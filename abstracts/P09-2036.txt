Binarization of n-ary rules is critical for the effi-
ciency of syntactic machine translation decoding.
Because the target side of a rule will generally
reorder the source side, it is complex (and some-
times impossible) to find synchronous rule bina-
rizations. However, we show that synchronous
binarizations are not necessary in a two-stage de-
coder. Instead, the grammar can be binarized one
way for the parsing stage, then rebinarized in a
different way for the reranking stage. Each indi-
vidual binarization considers only one monolin-
gual projection of the grammar, entirely avoid-
ing the constraints of synchronous binarization
and allowing binarizations that are separately op-
timized for each stage. Compared to n-ary for-
est reranking, even simple target-side binariza-
tion schemes improve overall decoding accuracy.
