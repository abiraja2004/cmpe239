Previous attempts at identifying translational equiv-
alents in comparable corpora have dealt with very
large ?general language? corpora and words. We ad-
dress this task in a specialized domain, medicine,
starting from smaller non-parallel, comparable cor-
pora and an initial bilingual medical lexicon. We
compare the distributional contexts of source and
target words, testing several weighting factors and
similarity measures. On a test set of frequently oc-
curring words, for the best combination (the Jaccard
similarity measure with or without tf:idf weight-
ing), the correct translation is ranked first for 20% of
our test words, and is found in the top 10 candidates
for 50% of them. An additional reverse-translation
filtering step improves the precision of the top can-
didate translation up to 74%, with a 33% recall.
