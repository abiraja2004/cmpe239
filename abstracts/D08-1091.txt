We present a discriminative, latent variable
approach to syntactic parsing in which rules
exist at multiple scales of refinement. The
model is formally a latent variable CRF gram-
mar over trees, learned by iteratively splitting
grammar productions (not categories). Dif-
ferent regions of the grammar are refined to
different degrees, yielding grammars which
are three orders of magnitude smaller than
the single-scale baseline and 20 times smaller
than the split-and-merge grammars of Petrov
et al (2006). In addition, our discriminative
approach integrally admits features beyond lo-
cal tree configurations. We present a multi-
scale training method along with an efficient
CKY-style dynamic program. On a variety of
domains and languages, this method produces
the best published parsing accuracies with the
smallest reported grammars.
