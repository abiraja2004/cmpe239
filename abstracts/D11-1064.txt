Decision trees have been applied to a vari-
ety of NLP tasks, including language mod-
eling, for their ability to handle a variety of
attributes and sparse context space. More-
over, forests (collections of decision trees)
have been shown to substantially outperform
individual decision trees. In this work, we in-
vestigate methods for combining trees in a for-
est, as well as methods for diversifying trees
for the task of syntactic language modeling.
We show that our tree interpolation technique
outperforms the standard method used in the
literature, and that, on this particular task, re-
stricting tree contexts in a principled way pro-
duces smaller and better forests, with the best
achieving an 8% relative reduction in Word
Error Rate over an n-gram baseline.
