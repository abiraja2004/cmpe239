We present a framework, based on Sejane and
Eger (2012), for inducing lexical semantic ty-
pologies for groups of languages. Our frame-
work rests on lexical semantic association net-
works derived from encoding, via bilingual
corpora, each language in a common reference
language, the tertium comparationis, so that
distances between languages can easily be de-
termined.
