Probabilistic synchronous context-free
grammar (PSCFG) translation models
define weighted transduction rules that
represent translation and reordering oper-
ations via nonterminal symbols. In this
work, we investigate the source of the im-
provements in translation quality reported
when using two PSCFG translation mod-
els (hierarchical and syntax-augmented),
when extending a state-of-the-art phrase-
based baseline that serves as the lexical
support for both PSCFG models. We
isolate the impact on translation quality
for several important design decisions in
each model. We perform this comparison
on three NIST language translation tasks;
Chinese-to-English, Arabic-to-English
and Urdu-to-English, each representing
unique challenges.
