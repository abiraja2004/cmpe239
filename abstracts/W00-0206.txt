 
In this ~paper, we present he Interlingua 
system ISS to generate the pronominal 
anaphora into the Spanish and English 
languages. We also describe the main 
problems in the pronoun generation into 
both languages such as zero-subject 
constructions and number, gender and 
syntactic differences. Our system improves 
other proposals presented so far due to the 
fact that we are able to solve and generate 
intersentential anaphora, to detect 
coreference chains and to generate Spanish 
zero-pronouns into English, issues that are 
hardly considered by other systems. Finally, 
we provide outstanding results of our system 
on unrestricted corpora.
