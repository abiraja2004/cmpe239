 
This paper describes the design and application of 
time-enhanced, finite state models of discourse 
cues to the automated segmentation of broadcast 
news. We describe our analysis of a broadcast 
news corpus, the design of a discourse cue based 
story segmentor that builds upon information 
extraction techniques, and finally its computational 
implementation a d evaluation in the Broadcast 
News Navigator (BNN) to support video news 
browsing, retrieval, and summarization.
