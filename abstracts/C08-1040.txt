We introduce a technique for analyzing the
temporal evolution of the salience of par-
ticipants in a discussion. Our method can
dynamically track how the relative impor-
tance of speakers evolve over time using
graph based techniques. Speaker salience
is computed based on the eigenvector cen-
trality in a graph representation of partici-
pants in a discussion. Two participants in a
discussion are linked with an edge if they
use similar rhetoric. The method is dy-
namic in the sense that the graph evolves
over time to capture the evolution inher-
ent to the participants salience. We used
our method to track the salience of mem-
bers of the US Senate using data from the
US Congressional Record. Our analysis
investigated how the salience of speakers
changes over time. Our results show that
the scores can capture speaker centrality
in topics as well as events that result in
change of salience or influence among dif-
ferent participants.
