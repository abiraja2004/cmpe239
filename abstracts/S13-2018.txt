This paper describes the IIRG 1 system en-
tered in SemEval-2013, the 7th International
Workshop on Semantic Evaluation. We partic-
ipated in Task 5 Evaluating Phrasal Semantics.
We have adopted a token-based approach to
solve this task using 1) Na??ve Bayes methods
and 2) Word Overlap methods, both of which
rely on the extraction of syntactic features. We
found that the word overlap method signifi-
cantly out-performs the Na??ve Bayes methods,
achieving our highest overall score with an ac-
curacy of approximately 78%.
