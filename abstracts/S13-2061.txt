 
This paper presents our system, TJP, which 
participated in SemEval 2013 Task 2 part A: 
Contextual Polarity Disambiguation. The goal 
of this task is to predict whether marked con-
texts are positive, neutral or negative. Howev-
er, only the scores of positive and negative 
class will be used to calculate the evaluation 
result using F-score. We chose to work as 
?constrained?, which used only the provided 
training and development data without addi-
tional sentiment annotated resources. Our ap-
proach considered unigram, bigram and 
trigram using Na?ve Bayes training model 
with the objective of establishing a simple-
approach baseline. Our system achieved F-
score 81.23% and F-score 78.16% in the re-
sults for SMS messages and Tweets respec-
tively.
