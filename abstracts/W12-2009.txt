 
Paraphrasing is an important aspect of language 
competence; however, EFL learners have long 
had difficulty paraphrasing in their writing 
owing to their limited language proficiency. 
Therefore, automatic paraphrase suggestion 
systems can be useful for writers. In this paper, 
we present PREFER1, a paraphrase reference 
tool for helping language learners improve their 
writing skills. In this paper, we attempt to 
transform the paraphrase generation problem 
into a graphical problem in which the phrases 
are treated as nodes and translation similarities 
as edges. We adopt the PageRank algorithm to 
rank and filter the paraphrases generated by the 
pivot-based paraphrase generation method. We 
manually evaluate the performance of our 
method and assess the effectiveness of 
PREFER in language learning. The results 
show that our method successfully preserves 
both the semantic meaning and syntactic 
structure of the query phrase. Moreover, the 
students? writing performance improve most 
with the assistance of PREFER.
