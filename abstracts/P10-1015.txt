We present a method for extracting so-
cial networks from literature, namely,
nineteenth-century British novels and se-
rials. We derive the networks from di-
alogue interactions, and thus our method
depends on the ability to determine when
two characters are in conversation. Our
approach involves character name chunk-
ing, quoted speech attribution and conver-
sation detection given the set of quotes.
We extract features from the social net-
works and examine their correlation with
one another, as well as with metadata such
as the novel?s setting. Our results provide
evidence that the majority of novels in this
time period do not fit two characterizations
provided by literacy scholars. Instead, our
results suggest an alternative explanation
for differences in social networks.
