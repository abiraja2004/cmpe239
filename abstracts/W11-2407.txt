Intervals and the events that occur in them
are encoded as strings, elaborating on a con-
ception of events as ?intervals cum descrip-
tion.? Notions of satisfaction in interval
temporal logics are formulated in terms of
strings, and the possibility of computing these
via finite-state machines/transducers is inves-
tigated. This opens up temporal semantics to
finite-state methods, with entailments that are
decidable insofar as these can be reduced to
inclusions between regular languages.
