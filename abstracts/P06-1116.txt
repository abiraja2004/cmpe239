We investigate the unsupervised detection
of semi-fixed cue phrases such as ?This
paper proposes a novel approach. . . 1?
from unseen text, on the basis of only a
handful of seed cue phrases with the de-
sired semantics. The problem, in contrast
to bootstrapping approaches for Question
Answering and Information Extraction, is
that it is hard to find a constraining context
for occurrences of semi-fixed cue phrases.
Our method uses components of the cue
phrase itself, rather than external con-
text, to bootstrap. It successfully excludes
phrases which are different from the tar-
get semantics, but which look superficially
similar. The method achieves 88% ac-
curacy, outperforming standard bootstrap-
ping approaches.
