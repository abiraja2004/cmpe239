  
It is difficult to develop an effective 
computer-based aid to enable children 
whose speech is hard to understand to par- 
ticipate in social conversations. Such chil- 
dren require a relatively simple device that 
will enable them to select and produce suit- 
able content for a conversation i real time. 
We are investigating how an analysis of 
children's language can be used in the de- 
sign of such a device. In particular, we be- 
lieve that an analysis of the pragmatics of 
children's conversations will provide a ba- 
sis for predicting from a corpus of plausi- 
ble utterances those utterances that will be 
most useful for a particular child. Such 
an analysis may also be useful for subse- 
quently predicting and locating which of 
these pre-loaded utterances i likely to be 
required next during a particular conver- 
sation. In addition, we are interested in 
using computer-based training for the aid. 
Given that all of the child's speech will be 
produced through the computer-based aid, 
it may be possible to provide intelligent in- 
teractive training.
