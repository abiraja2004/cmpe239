We present a classifier that discriminates be-
tween types of corrections made by teachers
of English in student essays. We define a set
of linguistically motivated feature templates
for a log-linear classification model, train this
classifier on sentence pairs extracted from
the Cambridge Learner Corpus, and achieve
89% accuracy improving upon a 33% base-
line. Furthermore, we incorporate our classi-
fier into a novel application that takes as input
a set of corrected essays that have been sen-
tence aligned with their originals and outputs
the individual corrections classified by error
type. We report the F-Score of our implemen-
tation on this task.
