 
For our system we use the SMO implemen-
tation of a support vector machine provided 
with the WEKA machine learning toolkit. 
As with all machine learning approaches, 
the most important step is to choose a set of 
features which reliably help to predict the 
label of the example. We used 76 features 
drawn from two very different knowledge 
sources. The first 48 features are boolean 
values indicating whether or not each of the 
nominals in the sentence are linked to cer-
tain other words in the WordNet hypernym 
and meronym networks. The remaining 28 
features are web frequency counts for the 
two nominals joined by certain common 
prepositions and verbs. Our system per-
formed well on all but two of the relations; 
theme-tool and origin entity.
