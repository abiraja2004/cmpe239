Parser Evaluation using Textual Entail-
ments (PETE) is a shared task in the
SemEval-2010 Evaluation Exercises on
Semantic Evaluation. The task involves
recognizing textual entailments based on
syntactic information alone. PETE intro-
duces a new parser evaluation scheme that
is formalism independent, less prone to
annotation error, and focused on semanti-
cally relevant distinctions.
