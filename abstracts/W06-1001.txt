 
Optimizing the production, maintenance 
and extension of lexical resources is one 
the crucial aspects impacting Natural 
Language Processing (NLP). A second 
aspect involves optimizing the process 
leading to their integration in applica-
tions. With this respect, we believe that 
the production of a consensual specifica-
tion on multilingual lexicons can be a 
useful aid for the various NLP actors. 
Within ISO, one purpose of LMF (ISO-
24613) is to define a standard for lexi-
cons that covers multilingual data.
