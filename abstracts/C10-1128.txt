 
Single-document summarization and multi-
document summarization are very closely re-
lated tasks and they have been widely investi-
gated independently.  This paper examines 
the mutual influences between the two tasks 
and proposes a novel unified approach to si-
multaneous single-document and multi-
document summarizations. The mutual influ-
ences between the two tasks are incorporated 
into a graph model and the ranking scores of a 
sentence for the two tasks can be obtained in 
a unified ranking process. Experimental re-
sults on the benchmark DUC datasets demon-
strate the effectiveness of the proposed ap-
proach for both single-document and multi-
document summarizations.
