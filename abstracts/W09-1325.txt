In this paper we introduce a web application
(SAPIENT) for sentence based annotation of
full papers with semantic information. SAPI-
ENT enables experts to annotate scientific pa-
pers sentence by sentence and also to link re-
lated sentences together, thus forming spans
of interesting regions, which can facilitate text
mining applications. As part of the system,
we developed an XML-aware sentence split-
ter (SSSplit) which preserves XML markup
and identifies sentences through the addition
of in-line markup. SAPIENT has been used
in a systematic study for the annotation of
scientific papers with concepts representing
the Core Information about Scientific Papers
(CISP) to create a corpus of 225 annotated pa-
pers.
