Human text is characterised by the indi-
vidual lexical choices of a specific au-
thor. Significant variations exist be-
tween authors. In contrast, natural lan-
guage generation systems normally pro-
duce uniform texts. In this paper we
apply distributional similarity measures
to help verb choice in a natural lan-
guage generation system which tries to
generate text similar to individual au-
thor. By using a distributional sim-
ilarity (DS) measure on corpora col-
lected from a recipe domain, we get
the most likely verbs for individual au-
thors. The accuracy of matching verb
pairs produced by distributional similar-
ity is higher than using the synonym out-
puts of verbs from WordNet. Further-
more, the combination of the two meth-
ods provides the best accuracy.
