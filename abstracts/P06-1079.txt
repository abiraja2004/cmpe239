We approach the zero-anaphora resolu-
tion problem by decomposing it into
intra-sentential and inter-sentential zero-
anaphora resolution. For the former prob-
lem, syntactic patterns of the appearance
of zero-pronouns and their antecedents are
useful clues. Taking Japanese as a target
language, we empirically demonstrate that
incorporating rich syntactic pattern fea-
tures in a state-of-the-art learning-based
anaphora resolution model dramatically
improves the accuracy of intra-sentential
zero-anaphora, which consequently im-
proves the overall performance of zero-
anaphora resolution.
