In this paper, we present a method that
improves Japanese dependency parsing by
using large-scale statistical information. It
takes into account two kinds of informa-
tion not considered in previous statistical
(machine learning based) parsing meth-
ods: information about dependency rela-
tions among the case elements of a verb,
and information about co-occurrence re-
lations between a verb and its case ele-
ment. This information can be collected
from the results of automatic dependency
parsing of large-scale corpora. The results
of an experiment in which our method was
used to rerank the results obtained using an
existing machine learning based parsing
method showed that our method can im-
prove the accuracy of the results obtained
using the existing method.
