This paper proposes a hierarchical text catego-
rization (TC) approach to encoding free-text
clinical notes with ICD-9-CM codes. Prelim-
inary experimental result on the 2007 Com-
putational Medicine Challenge data shows a
hierarchical TC system has achieved a micro-
averaged F1 value of 86.6, which is compara-
ble to the performance of state-of-the-art flat
classification systems.
