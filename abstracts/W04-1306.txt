Language learners must acquire the grammar(rules, constraints, principles) of their lan-guage as well as representations at variouslevels. I will argue that representations arepart of the grammar and must be acquiredtogether with other aspects of grammar; thus,grammar acquisition may not presupposeknowledge of representations. Further, I willargue that the goal of a learning modelshould not be to try to match or approximatetarget forms directly, because strategies to doso are defeated by the disconnect betweenprinciples of grammar and the effects theyproduce. Rather, learners should use targetforms as evidence bearing on the selection ofthe correct grammar. I will draw on twoareas of phonology to illustrate these argu-ments. The first is the grammar of stress, ormetrical phonology, which has receivedmuch attention in the learning model litera-ture. The second concerns the acquisition ofphonological features and contrasts. Thisaspect of acquisition turns out, contrary tofirst appearances, to pose challenging prob-lems for learning models.
