In this paper, we address the issue of automat-
ically identifying null instantiated arguments
in text. We refer to Fillmore?s theory of prag-
matically controlled zero anaphora (Fillmore,
1986), which accounts for the phenomenon of
omissible arguments using a lexically-based
approach, and we propose a strategy for iden-
tifying implicit arguments in a text and finding
their antecedents, given the overtly expressed
semantic roles in the form of frame elements.
To this purpose, we primarily rely on linguis-
tic knowledge enriched with role frequency
information collected from a training corpus.
We evaluate our approach using the test set
developed for the SemEval task 10 and we
highlight some issues of our approach. Be-
sides, we also point out some open problems
related to the task definition and to the general
phenomenon of null instantiated arguments,
which needs to be better investigated and de-
scribed in order to be captured from a compu-
tational point of view.
