There has been relatively little work fo-
cused on determining the formality level
of individual lexical items. This study
applies information from large mixed-
genre corpora, demonstrating that signif-
icant improvement is possible over simple
word-length metrics, particularly when
multiple sources of information, i.e. word
length, word counts, and word associ-
ation, are integrated. Our best hybrid
system reaches 86% accuracy on an En-
glish near-synonym formality identifica-
tion task, and near perfect accuracy when
comparing words with extreme formality
differences. We also test our word as-
sociation method in Chinese, a language
where word length is not an appropriate
metric for formality.
