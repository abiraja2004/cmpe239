Language Conversational Interfaces plays a 
very important role in improving the usage of 
computers for the common man. It is the 
need of time to bring human computer 
interaction as close to human-human 
interaction as possible. There are two main 
challenges that are to be faced in 
implementing such an interface that enables 
interaction in a way similar to human-human 
interaction. These are Speech to Text 
conversion i.e. Speech Recognition & Text 
To Speech (TTS) conversion. In this paper 
the implementation of one issue Speech 
Recognition for Indian Languages is 
presented.
