 
Chinese NE (Named Entity) recognition is 
a difficult problem because of the 
uncertainty in word segmentation and 
flexibility in language structure. This paper 
proposes the use of a rationality model in a 
multi-agent framework to tackle this 
problem. We employ a greedy strategy and 
use the NE rationality model to evaluate 
and detect all possible NEs in the text. We 
then treat the process of selecting the best 
possible NEs as a multi-agent negotiation 
problem. The resulting system is robust 
and is able to handle different types of NE 
effectively. Our test on the MET-2 test 
corpus indicates that our system is able to 
achieve high F1 values of above 92% on all 
NE types.
