To improve the Mandarin large vocabulary
continuous speech recognition (LVCSR), a
unified framework based approach is intro-
duced to exploit multi-level linguistic knowl-
edge. In this framework, each knowledge
source is represented by a Weighted Finite
State Transducer (WFST), and then they are
combined to obtain a so-called analyzer for in-
tegrating multi-level knowledge sources. Due
to the uniform transducer representation, any
knowledge source can be easily integrated into
the analyzer, as long as it can be encoded
into WFSTs. Moreover, as the knowledge in
each level is modeled independently and the
combination is processed in the model level,
the information inherently in each knowledge
source has a chance to be thoroughly ex-
ploited. By simulations, the effectiveness
of the analyzer is investigated, and then a
LVCSR system embedding the presented ana-
lyzer is evaluated. Experimental results reveal
that this unified framework is an effective ap-
proach which significantly improves the per-
formance of speech recognition with a 9.9%
relative reduction of character error rate on
the HUB-4 test set, a widely used Mandarin
speech recognition task.
