For NLP applications that require some
sort of semantic interpretation it would be
helpful to know what expressions exhibit
an idiomatic meaning and what expres-
sions exhibit a literal meaning. We invest-
igate whether automatic word-alignment
in existing parallel corpora facilitates
the classification of candidate expressions
along a continuum ranging from literal and
transparent expressions to idiomatic and
opaque expressions. Our method relies on
two criteria: (i) meaning predictability that
is measured as semantic entropy and (ii),
the overlap between the meaning of an ex-
pression and the meaning of its compon-
ent words. We approximate the mentioned
overlap as the proportion of default align-
ments. We obtain a significant improve-
ment over the baseline with both meas-
ures.
