A Bilingual Knowledge Bank is a syntactically and 
referentially structured pair of corpora, one being a 
translation of the other, in which translation units are 
cross-codexl between the corpora. A pilot implemen- 
tation is described for a corpus of some 20,000 words 
each in English, French and Esperanto which has been 
cross-coded between English and Esperanto and 
between Esperanto and French. The aim is to develop 
a corpus-based general-purpose knowledge source for 
applications in machine translation and computer- 
aided translation.
