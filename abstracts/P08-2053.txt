Earlier work in parsing Arabic has specu-
lated that attachment to construct state con-
structions decreases parsing performance. We
make this speculation precise and define the
problem of attachment to construct state con-
structions in the Arabic Treebank. We present
the first statistics that quantify the problem.
We provide a baseline and the results from a
first attempt at a discriminative learning pro-
cedure for this task, achieving 80% accuracy.
