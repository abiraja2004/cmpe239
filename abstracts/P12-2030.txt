This work presents a first step to a general im-
plementation of the Semantic-Script Theory
of Humor (SSTH). Of the scarce amount of
research in computational humor, no research
had focused on humor generation beyond sim-
ple puns and punning riddles. We propose
an algorithm for mining simple humorous
scripts from a semantic network (Concept-
Net) by specifically searching for dual scripts
that jointly maximize overlap and incongruity
metrics in line with Raskin?s Semantic-Script
Theory of Humor. Initial results show that a
more relaxed constraint of this form is capable
of generating humor of deeper semantic con-
tent than wordplay riddles. We evaluate the
said metrics through a user-assessed quality of
the generated two-liners.
