This paper describes the augmented three-
pass system combination framework of
the Dublin City University (DCU) MT
group for the WMT 2010 system combi-
nation task. The basic three-pass frame-
work includes building individual confu-
sion networks (CNs), a super network, and
a modified Minimum Bayes-risk (mCon-
MBR) decoder. The augmented parts for
WMT2010 tasks include 1) a rescoring
component which is used to re-rank the
N -best lists generated from the individual
CNs and the super network, 2) a new hy-
pothesis alignment metric ? TERp ? that
is used to carry out English-targeted hy-
pothesis alignment, and 3) more differ-
ent backbone-based CNs which are em-
ployed to increase the diversity of the
mConMBR decoding phase. We took
part in the combination tasks of English-
to-Czech and French-to-English. Exper-
imental results show that our proposed
combination framework achieved 2.17 ab-
solute points (13.36 relative points) and
1.52 absolute points (5.37 relative points)
in terms of BLEU score on English-to-
Czech and French-to-English tasks re-
spectively than the best single system. We
also achieved better performance on hu-
man evaluation.
