. This paper proposes a method for detecting errors concern-
ing article usage and singular/plural usage based on the mass count
distinction. Although the mass count distinction is particularly impor-
tant in detecting these errors, it has been pointed out that it is hard
to make heuristic rules for distinguishing mass and count nouns. To
solve the problem, first, instances of mass and count nouns are auto-
matically collected from a corpus exploiting surface information in the
proposed method. Then, words surrounding the mass (count) instances
are weighted based on their frequencies. Finally, the weighted words are
used for distinguishing mass and count nouns. After distinguishing mass
and count nouns, the above errors can be detected by some heuristic
rules. Experiments show that the proposed method distinguishes mass
and count nouns in the writing of Japanese learners of English with
an accuracy of 93% and that 65% of article errors are detected with a
precision of 70%.
