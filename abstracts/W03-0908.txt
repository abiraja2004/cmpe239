The paper1 presents a lightweight knowledge-
based reasoning framework for the JAVELIN
open-domain Question Answering (QA) sys-

of text meaning, along with a flexible unifica-
tion strategy that matches questions with re-
trieved passages based on semantic similarities
and weighted relations between words.
