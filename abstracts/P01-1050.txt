We present a set of algorithms that en-
able us to translate natural language
sentences by exploiting both a trans-
lation memory and a statistical-based
translation model. Our results show
that an automatically derived transla-
tion memory can be used within a sta-
tistical framework to often find trans-
lations of higher probability than those
found using solely a statistical model.
The translations produced using both
the translation memory and the sta-
tistical model are significantly better
than translations produced by two com-
mercial systems: our hybrid system
translated perfectly 58% of the 505
sentences in a test collection, while
the commercial systems translated per-
fectly only 40-42% of them.
