This paper proposes a method to correct En-
glish verb form errors made by non-native
speakers. A basic approach is template match-
ing on parse trees. The proposed method im-
proves on this approach in two ways. To
improve recall, irregularities in parse trees
caused by verb form errors are taken into ac-
count; to improve precision, n-gram counts
are utilized to filter proposed corrections.
Evaluation on non-native corpora, represent-
ing two genres and mother tongues, shows
promising results.
