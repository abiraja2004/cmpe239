 
This paper presents a constraint-based multi-
agent strategy to coreference resolution of 
general noun phrases in unrestricted English 
text. For a given anaphor and all the preceding 
referring expressions as the antecedent 
candidates, a common constraint agent is first 
presented to filter out invalid antecedent 
candidates using various kinds of general 
knowledge.  Then, according to the type of the 
anaphor, a special constraint agent is proposed to 
filter out more invalid antecedent candidates 
using constraints which are derived from various 
kinds of special knowledge. Finally, a simple 
preference agent is used to choose an antecedent 
for the anaphor form the remaining antecedent 
candidates, based on the proximity principle. 
One interesting observation is that the most 
recent antecedent of an anaphor in the 
coreferential chain is sometimes indirectly 
linked to the anaphor via some other antecedents 
in the chain.  In this case, we find that the most 
recent antecedent always contains little 
information to directly determine the coreference 
relationship with the anaphor. Therefore, for a 
given anaphor, the corresponding special 
constraint agent can always safely filter out these 
less informative antecedent candidates. In this 
way, rather than finding the most recent 
antecedent for an anaphor, our system tries to 
find the most direct and informative antecedent. 
Evaluation shows that our system achieves 
Precision / Recall / F-measures of 84.7% / 
65.8% / 73.9 and 82.8% / 55.7% / 66.5 on MUC-
6 and MUC-7 English coreference tasks 
respectively. This means that our system 
achieves significantly better precision rates by 
about 8 percent over the best-reported systems 
while keeping recall rates.
