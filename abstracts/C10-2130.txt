Retrieval evaluation without relevance 
judgments is a hard but also very mean-
ingful work. In this paper, we use clus-
tering technique to improve the per-
formance of judgment free retrieval 
evaluation. By using one system to rep-
resent all the systems that are similar to 
it, we can largely reduce the negative ef-
fect of similar retrieval results in Re-
trieval evaluation. Experimental results 
demonstrated that our method outper-
formed all the previous judgment free 
evaluation methods significantly. Its 
overall average performance outper-
formed the best previous result by 
20.5%. Besides, our work is a general 
framework that can be applied to any 
other judgment free evaluation method 
for performance improvement.
