We extend a lexical knowledge-base of
near-synonym differences with knowl-
edge about their collocational behaviour.
This type of knowledge is useful in the
process of lexical choice between near-
synonyms. We acquire collocations for
the near-synonyms of interest from a cor-
pus (only collocations with the appropri-
ate sense and part-of-speech). For each
word that collocates with a near-synonym
we use a differential test to learn whether
the word forms a less-preferred collo-
cation or an anti-collocation with other
near-synonyms in the same cluster. For
this task we use a much larger corpus
(the Web). We also look at associations
(longer-distance co-occurrences) as a pos-
sible source of learning more about nu-
ances that the near-synonyms may carry.
