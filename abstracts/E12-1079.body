In this paper, we propose an annota-
tion schema for the discourse analysis of
Wikipedia Talk pages aimed at the coor-
dination efforts for article improvement.
We apply the annotation schema to a cor-
pus of 100 Talk pages from the Simple
English Wikipedia and make the resulting
dataset freely available for download1. Fur-
thermore, we perform automatic dialog act
classification on Wikipedia discussions and
achieve an average F1-score of 0.82 with
our classification pipeline.
