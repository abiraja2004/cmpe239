Electronic health records (EHRs) contain
important clinical information about pa-
tients. Some of these data are in the form
of free text and require preprocessing to be
able to used in automated systems. Effi-
cient and effective use of this data could
be vital to the speed and quality of health
care. As a case study, we analyzed clas-
sification of CT imaging reports into bi-
nary categories. In addition to regular
text classification, we utilized topic mod-
eling of the entire dataset in various ways.
Topic modeling of the corpora provides in-
terpretable themes that exist in these re-
ports. Representing reports according to
their topic distributions is more compact
than bag-of-words representation and can
be processed faster than raw text in sub-
sequent automated processes. A binary
topic model was also built as an unsuper-
vised classification approach with the as-
sumption that each topic corresponds to a
class. And, finally an aggregate topic clas-
sifier was built where reports are classified
based on a single discriminative topic that
is determined from the training dataset.
Our proposed topic based classifier system
is shown to be competitive with existing
text classification techniques and provides
a more efficient and interpretable repre-
sentation.
