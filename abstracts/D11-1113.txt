This paper develops a framework for syntac-
tic dependency parse correction. Dependen-
cies in an input parse tree are revised by se-
lecting, for a given dependent, the best gov-
ernor from within a small set of candidates.
We use a discriminative linear ranking model
to select the best governor from a group of
candidates for a dependent, and our model in-
cludes a rich feature set that encodes syntac-
tic structure in the input parse tree. The parse
correction framework is parser-agnostic, and
can correct attachments using either a generic
model or specialized models tailored to dif-
ficult attachment types like coordination and
pp-attachment. Our experiments show that
parse correction, combining a generic model
with specialized models for difficult attach-
ment types, can successfully improve the qual-
ity of predicted parse trees output by sev-
eral representative state-of-the-art dependency
parsers for French.
