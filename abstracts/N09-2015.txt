Semi-supervised speaker clustering refers to
the use of our prior knowledge of speakers
in general to assist the unsupervised speaker
clustering process. In the form of an in-
dependent training set, the prior knowledge
helps us learn a speaker-discriminative fea-
ture transformation, a universal speaker prior
model, and a discriminative speaker subspace,
or equivalently a speaker-discriminative dis-
tance metric. The directional scattering pat-
terns of Gaussian mixture model mean su-
pervectors motivate us to perform discrimi-
nant analysis on the unit hypersphere rather
than in the Euclidean space, which leads to
a novel dimensionality reduction technique
called spherical discriminant analysis (SDA).
Our experiment results show that in the
SDA subspace, speaker clustering yields su-
perior performance than that in other reduced-
dimensional subspaces (e.g., PCA and LDA).
