This paper presents an unsupervised topic
identification method integrating linguis-
tic and visual information based on Hid-
den Markov Models (HMMs). We employ
HMMs for topic identification, wherein a
state corresponds to a topic and various
features including linguistic, visual and
audio information are observed. Our ex-
periments on two kinds of cooking TV
programs show the effectiveness of our
proposed method.
