E-Dictor is a tool for encoding, applying
levels of editions, and assigning part-of-
speech tags to ancient texts. In short, it
works as a WYSIWYG interface to en-
code text in XML format. It comes from
the experience during the building of the
Tycho Brahe Parsed Corpus of Historical
Portuguese and from consortium activities
with other research groups. Preliminary
results show a decrease of at least 50% on
the overall time taken on the editing pro-
cess.
