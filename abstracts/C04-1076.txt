 
Spelling recognition is an approach to enhance a 
speech recognizer?s ability to cope with incorrectly 
recognized words and out-of-vocabulary words. 
This paper presents a general framework for Thai 
speech recognition enhanced with spelling 
recognition. In order to implement Thai spelling 
recognition, Thai alphabets and their spelling 
methods are analyzed. Based on hidden Markov 
models, we propose a method to construct a Thai 
spelling recognition system by using an existing 
continuous speech corpus. To compensate the 
difference between spelling utterances and 
continuous speech utterances, the adjustment of 
utterance speed is taken into account. Assigning 
different numbers of states for syllables with 
different durations is helpful to improve the 
recognition accuracy. Our system achieves up to 
79.38% accuracy.
