 
We present an algorithm which assigns interpretations to 
several major types of ellipsis structures through a 
generalized procedure of syntactic reconstrtiction. 
Ellipsis structures are taken to be sequences of lexically 
realized arguments and/or adjuncts of an empty verbal 
head. Reconstruction s characterized as the specification 
of a (partial) correspondence relation between the 
unrealized head verb of an elided clause and its 
argument and adjuncts on one hand, and the head of a 
non-elided antecedent sentence and its arguments and 
adjuncts on the other. The algorithm generates 
appropriate interpretations for cases of VP ellipsis, 
pseudo-gapping, bare llipsis (stripping), and gapping. It 
provides a uniform computational approach to a wide 
range of ellipsis phenomena, nd it has significant 
advantages over several other approaches to ellipsis 
which have recently been suggested in the computational 
and linguistic literature.
