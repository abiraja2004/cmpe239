Pure statistical parsing systems achieves
high in-domain accuracy but performs
poorly out-domain. In this paper, we
propose two different approaches to pro-
duce syntactic dependency structures us-
ing a large-scale hand-crafted HPSG gram-
mar. The dependency backbone of an
HPSG analysis is used to provide general
linguistic insights which, when combined
with state-of-the-art statistical dependency
parsing models, achieves performance im-
provements on out-domain tests.?
