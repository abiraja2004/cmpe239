 
This paper proposes a new automatic ma-
chine translation evaluation metric: 
AMBER, which is based on the metric 
BLEU but incorporates recall, extra penal-
ties, and some text processing variants. 
There is very little linguistic information in 
AMBER. We evaluate its system-level cor-
relation and sentence-level consistency 
scores with human rankings from the 
WMT shared evaluation task; AMBER 
achieves state-of-the-art performance.
