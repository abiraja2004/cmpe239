The textual entailment recognition system
that we discuss in this paper represents
a perspective-based approach composed of
two modules that analyze text-hypothesis
pairs from a strictly lexical and syntactic
perspectives, respectively. We attempt to
prove that the textual entailment recognition
task can be overcome by performing indi-
vidual analysis that acknowledges us of the
maximum amount of information that each
single perspective can provide. We compare
this approach with the system we presented
in the previous edition of PASCAL Recognis-
ing Textual Entailment Challenge, obtaining
an accuracy rate 17.98% higher.
