While the automatic translation of tweets has
already been investigated in different scenar-
ios, we are not aware of any attempt to trans-
late tweets created by government agencies.
In this study, we report the experimental re-
sults we obtained when translating 12 Twitter
feeds published by agencies and organizations
of the government of Canada, using a state-of-
the art Statistical Machine Translation (SMT)
engine as a black box translation device. We
mine parallel web pages linked from the URLs
contained in English-French pairs of tweets in
order to create tuning and training material.
For a Twitter feed that would have been other-
wise difficult to translate, we report significant
gains in translation quality using this strategy.
Furthermore, we give a detailed account of the
problems we still face, such as hashtag trans-
lation as well as the generation of tweets of
legal length.
