Many linguistic and textual processes involve transduc-
tion of strings. We show how to learn a stochastic trans-
ducer from an unorganized collection of strings (rather
than string pairs). The role of the transducer is to orga-
nize the collection. Our generative model explains simi-
larities among the strings by supposing that some strings
in the collection were not generated ab initio, but were in-
stead derived by transduction from other, ?similar? strings
in the collection. Our variational EM learning algorithm
alternately reestimates this phylogeny and the transducer
parameters. The final learned transducer can quickly link
any test name into the final phylogeny, thereby locating
variants of the test name. We find that our method can
effectively find name variants in a corpus of web strings
used to refer to persons inWikipedia, improving over stan-
dard untrained distances such as Jaro-Winkler and Leven-
shtein distance.
