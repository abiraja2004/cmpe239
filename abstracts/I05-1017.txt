. We present a PP-attachment disambiguation method based
on a gigantic volume of unambiguous examples extracted from raw cor-
pus. The unambiguous examples are utilized to acquire precise lexical
preferences for PP-attachment disambiguation. Attachment decisions are
made by a machine learning method that optimizes the use of the lexical
preferences. Our experiments indicate that the precise lexical preferences
work effectively.
