In this paper, we discuss our efforts to anno-
tate nominals in the Hindi Treebank with the
semantic property of animacy. Although the
treebank already encodes lexical information
at a number of levels such as morph and part
of speech, the addition of animacy informa-
tion seems promising given its relevance to
varied linguistic phenomena. The suggestion
is based on the theoretical and computational
analysis of the property of animacy in the con-
text of anaphora resolution, syntactic parsing,
verb classification and argument differentia-
tion.
