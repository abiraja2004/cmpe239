Conventional n-best reranking techniques of-
ten suffer from the limited scope of the n-
best list, which rules out many potentially
good alternatives. We instead propose forest
reranking, a method that reranks a packed for-
est of exponentially many parses. Since ex-
act inference is intractable with non-local fea-
tures, we present an approximate algorithm in-
spired by forest rescoring that makes discrim-
inative training practical over the whole Tree-
bank. Our final result, an F-score of 91.7, out-
performs both 50-best and 100-best reranking
baselines, and is better than any previously re-
ported systems trained on the Treebank.
