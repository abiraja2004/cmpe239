This paper investigates a new task, subjec-
tivity word sense disambiguation (SWSD),
which is to automatically determine which
word instances in a corpus are being used
with subjective senses, and which are be-
ing used with objective senses. We pro-
vide empirical evidence that SWSD is
more feasible than full word sense dis-
ambiguation, and that it can be exploited
to improve the performance of contextual
subjectivity and sentiment analysis sys-
tems.
