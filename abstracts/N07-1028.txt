Information retrieval systems are fre-
quently required to handle long queries.
Simply using all terms in the query or re-
lying on the underlying retrieval model
to appropriately weight terms often leads
to ineffective retrieval. We show that re-
writing the query to a version that com-
prises a small subset of appropriate terms
from the original query greatly improves
effectiveness. Targeting a demonstrated
potential improvement of almost 50% on
some difficult TREC queries and their as-
sociated collections, we develop a suite of
automatic techniques to re-write queries
and study their characteristics. We show
that the shortcomings of automatic meth-
ods can be ameliorated by some simple
user interaction, and report results that are
on average 25% better than the baseline.
