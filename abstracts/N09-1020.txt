We propose a principled probabilisitc frame-
work which uses trees over the vocabulary to
capture similarities among terms in an infor-
mation retrieval setting. This allows the re-
trieval of documents based not just on occur-
rences of specific query terms, but also on sim-
ilarities between terms (an effect similar to
query expansion). Additionally our principled
generative model exhibits an effect similar to
inverse document frequency. We give encour-
aging experimental evidence of the superiority
of the hierarchical Dirichlet tree compared to
standard baselines.
