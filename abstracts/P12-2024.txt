We address a core aspect of the multilingual
content synchronization task: the identifica-
tion of novel, more informative or semanti-
cally equivalent pieces of information in two
documents about the same topic. This can be
seen as an application-oriented variant of tex-
tual entailment recognition where: i) T and
H are in different languages, and ii) entail-
ment relations between T and H have to be
checked in both directions. Using a combi-
nation of lexical, syntactic, and semantic fea-
tures to train a cross-lingual textual entailment
system, we report promising results on differ-
ent datasets.
