This paper presents the Tweetsted system im-
plemented for the SemEval 2013 task on Sen-
timent Analysis in Twitter. In particular, we
participated in Task B on Message Polar-
ity Classification in the Constrained setting.
The approach is based on the exploitation of
various resources such as SentiWordNet and
LIWC. Official results show that our approach
yields a F-score of 0.5976 for Twitter mes-
sages (11th out of 35) and a F-score of 0.5487
for SMS messages (8th out of 28 participants).
