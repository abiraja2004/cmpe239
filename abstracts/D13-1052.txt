Machine translation benefits from system
combination. We propose flexible interaction
of hypergraphs as a novel technique combin-
ing different translation models within one de-
coder. We introduce features controlling the
interactions between the two systems and ex-
plore three interaction schemes of hiero and
forest-to-string models?specification, gener-
alization, and interchange. The experiments
are carried out on large training data with
strong baselines utilizing rich sets of dense
and sparse features. All three schemes signif-
icantly improve results of any single system
on four testsets. We find that specification?a
more constrained scheme that almost entirely
uses forest-to-string rules, but optionally uses
hiero rules for shorter spans?comes out as
the strongest, yielding improvement up to 0.9
(Ter-Bleu)/2 points. We also provide a de-
tailed experimental and qualitative analysis of
the results.
