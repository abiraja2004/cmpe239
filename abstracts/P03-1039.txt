This paper describes an alternative trans-
lation model based on a text chunk un-
der the framework of statistical machine
translation. The translation model sug-
gested here first performs chunking. Then,
each word in a chunk is translated. Fi-
nally, translated chunks are reordered.
Under this scenario of translation model-
ing, we have experimented on a broad-
coverage Japanese-English traveling cor-
pus and achieved improved performance.
