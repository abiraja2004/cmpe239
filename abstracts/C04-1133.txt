In this paper, we introduce a model for sense as-
signment which relies on assigning senses to the
contexts within which words appear, rather than to
the words themselves. We argue that word senses
as such are not directly encoded in the lexicon
of the language. Rather, each word is associated
with one or more stereotypical syntagmatic pat-
terns, which we call selection contexts. Each selec-
tion context is associated with a meaning, which
can be expressed in any of various formal or com-
putational manifestations. We present a formalism
for encoding contexts that help to determine the
semantic contribution of a word in an utterance.
Further, we develop a methodology through which
such stereotypical contexts for words and phrases
can be identified from very large corpora, and sub-
sequently structured in a selection context dictio-
nary, encoding both stereotypical syntactic and se-
mantic information. We present some preliminary
results.
