In this paper we present a reference gen-
eration model based on Reference Domain
Theory which gives a dynamic account of
reference. This reference model assumes
that each referring act both relies and up-
dates the reference context. We present a
formal definition of a reference domain, a
generation algorithm and its instantiation
in the GIVE challenge.
