Meaning cannot be based on dictionary defini-
tions all the way down: at some point the cir-
cularity of definitions must be broken in some
way, by grounding the meanings of certain
words in sensorimotor categories learned from
experience or shaped by evolution. This is the
?symbol grounding problem?. We introduce
the concept of a reachable set ? a larger vo-
cabulary whose meanings can be learned from
a smaller vocabulary through definition alone,
as long as the meanings of the smaller vocabu-
lary are themselves already grounded. We pro-
vide simple algorithms to compute reachable
sets for any given dictionary.
