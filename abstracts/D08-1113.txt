String-to-string transduction is a central prob-
lem in computational linguistics and natural
language processing. It occurs in tasks as di-
verse as name transliteration, spelling correc-
tion, pronunciation modeling and inflectional
morphology. We present a conditional log-
linear model for string-to-string transduction,
which employs overlapping features over la-
tent alignment sequences, and which learns la-
tent classes and latent string pair regions from
incomplete training data. We evaluate our ap-
proach on morphological tasks and demon-
strate that latent variables can dramatically
improve results, even when trained on small
data sets. On the task of generating mor-
phological forms, we outperform a baseline
method reducing the error rate by up to 48%.
On a lemmatization task, we reduce the error
rates in Wicentowski (2002) by 38?92%.
