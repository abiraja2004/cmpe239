In statistical machine translation, estimat-
ing word-to-word alignment probabilities
for the translation model can be difficult
due to the problem of sparse data: most
words in a given corpus occur at most a
handful of times. With a highly inflected
language such as Czech, this problem can
be particularly severe. In addition, much
of the morphological variation seen in Czech
words is not reflected in either the morphol-
ogy or syntax of a language like English. In
this work, we show that using morphologi-
cal analysis to modify the Czech input can
improve a Czech-English machine transla-
tion system. We investigate several differ-
ent methods of incorporating morphological
information, and show that a system that
combines these methods yields the best re-
sults. Our final system achieves a BLEU
score of .333, as compared to .270 for the
baseline word-to-word system.
