We present a probabilistic model exten-
sion to the Tesni`ere Dependency Structure
(TDS) framework formulated in (Sangati
and Mazza, 2009). This representation in-
corporates aspects from both constituency
and dependency theory. In addition, it
makes use of junction structures to handle
coordination constructions. We test our
model on parsing the English Penn WSJ
treebank using a re-ranking framework.
This technique allows us to efficiently test
our model without needing a specialized
parser, and to use the standard evalua-
tion metric on the original Phrase Struc-
ture version of the treebank. We obtain
encouraging results: we achieve a small
improvement over state-of-the-art results
when re-ranking a small number of candi-
date structures, on all the evaluation met-
rics except for chunking.
