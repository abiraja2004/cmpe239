In this paper we report on our recent efforts to
collect a corpus of spoken lecture material that
will enable research directed towards fast, ac-
curate, and easy access to lecture content. Thus
far, we have collected a corpus of 270 hours of
speech from a variety of undergraduate courses
and seminars. We report on an initial analysis
of the spontaneous speech phenomena present
in these data and the vocabulary usage patterns
across three courses. Finally, we examine lan-
guage model perplexities trained from written
and spoken materials, and describe an initial
recognition experiment on one course.
