 
Japanese texts frequently suffer from the 
homophone errors caused by the KANA-KANJI 
conversion eeded to input the text. It is critical, 
therefore, for Japanese revision support systems 
to detect and to correct homophone errors. This 
paper proposes a method for detecting and 
correcting Japanese homophone errors in 
compound nouns. This method can not only detect 
Japanese homophone errors in compound nouns, 
but also can find the correct candidates for the 
detected errors automatically. Finding the correct 
candidates i one superiority of this method over 
existing methods. The basic idea of this method 
is that a compound noun component places ome 
restrictions on the semantic ategories of the 
adjoining words. The method accurately 
determines that a homophone is misused in a 
compound noun if one or both of its neighbors i  
not a member of the semantic set defined by the 
homophone. Also, the method successfully 
indicates the correct candidates for the detected 
homophone errors.
