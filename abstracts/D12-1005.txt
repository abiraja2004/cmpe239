Inferring attributes of discourse participants
has been treated as a batch-processing task:
data such as all tweets from a given author
are gathered in bulk, processed, analyzed for
a particular feature, then reported as a result
of academic interest. Given the sources and
scale of material used in these efforts, along
with potential use cases of such analytic tools,
discourse analysis should be reconsidered as
a streaming challenge. We show that un-
der certain common formulations, the batch-
processing analytic framework can be decom-
posed into a sequential series of updates, us-
ing as an example the task of gender classifi-
cation. Once in a streaming framework, and
motivated by large data sets generated by so-
cial media services, we present novel results in
approximate counting, showing its applicabil-
ity to space efficient streaming classification.
