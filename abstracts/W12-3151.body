We describe our experiments with phrase-
based machine translation for the WMT
2012 Shared Task. We trained one sys-
tem for 14 translation directions between
English or Czech on one side and English,
Czech, German, Spanish or French on the
other side. We describe a set of results
with different training data sizes and sub-
sets.
