 
Much work in current research in the field of semantic - 
pragmatic analysis has been concerned with the interpre- 
tation of natural anguage utterances in the context of 
dialogs. In this paper, however, we will present methods 
for a primary pragmatic analysis of single utterances. Our 
investigations involve problems which are not currently 
well understood, for example how to infer the speaker's 
intentions by using interpretation of connectives and 
modal verbs.
