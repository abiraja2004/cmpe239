We describe the extension and objective eval-
uation of a network1 of semantically related
noun senses (or concepts) that has been au-
tomatically acquired by analyzing lexical co-
occurrence in Wikipedia. The acquisition pro-
cess makes no use of the metadata or links
that have been manually built into the ency-
clopedia, and nouns in the network are auto-
matically disambiguated to their correspond-
ing noun senses without supervision. For
this task, we use the noun sense inventory of
WordNet 3.0. Thus, this work can be con-
ceived of as augmenting the WordNet noun
ontologywith unweighted, undirected related-
to edges between synsets. Our network con-
tains 208,832 such edges.
We evaluate our network?s performance on a
word sense disambiguation (WSD) task and
show: a) the network is competitive with
WordNet when used as a stand-alone knowl-
edge source for two WSD algorithms; b) com-
bining our network with WordNet achieves
disambiguation results that exceed the perfor-
mance of either resource individually; and c)
our network outperforms a similar resource
that has been automatically derived from se-
mantic annotations in the Wikipedia corpus.
