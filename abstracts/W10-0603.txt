Different studies have been conducted for 
predicting human brain activity associated 
with the semantics of nouns. Corpus based 
approaches have been used for deriving fea-
ture vectors of concrete nouns, to model the 
brain activity associated with that noun. In 
this paper a computational model is proposed 
in which, the feature vectors for each concrete 
noun is computed by the WordNet similarity 
of that noun with the 25 sensory-motor verbs 
suggested by psychologists. The feature vec-
tors are used for training a linear model to 
predict functional MRI images of the brain as-
sociated with nouns. The WordNet extracted 
features are also combined with corpus based 
semantic features of the nouns. The combined 
features give better results in predicting hu-
man brain activity related to concrete nouns.
