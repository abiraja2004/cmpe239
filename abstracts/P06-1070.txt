Cross-language Text Categorization is the
task of assigning semantic classes to docu-
ments written in a target language (e.g. En-
glish) while the system is trained using la-
beled documents in a source language (e.g.
Italian).
In this work we present many solutions ac-
cording to the availability of bilingual re-
sources, and we show that it is possible
to deal with the problem even when no
such resources are accessible. The core
technique relies on the automatic acquisi-
tion of Multilingual Domain Models from
comparable corpora.
Experiments show the effectiveness of our
approach, providing a low cost solution for
the Cross Language Text Categorization
task. In particular, when bilingual dictio-
naries are available the performance of the
categorization gets close to that of mono-
lingual text categorization.
