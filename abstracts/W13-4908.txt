This paper presents a dependency parsing
system, presented as BASQUE TEAM at
the SPMRL?2013 Shared Task, based on
the analysis of each morphological feature
of the languages. Once the specific rel-
evance of each morphological feature is
calculated, this system uses the most sig-
nificant of them to create a series of ana-
lyzers using two freely available and state
of the art dependency parsers, MaltParser
and Mate. Finally, the system will com-
bine previously achieved parses using a
voting approach.
