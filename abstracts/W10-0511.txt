 
This paper describes a technique for automati-
cally tagging political blog posts using SVM?s 
and named entity recognition. We compare 
the quality of the tags detected by this ap-
proach to earlier approaches in other domains, 
observing effects from the political domain 
and benefits from NLP techniques comple-
mentary to the core SVM method.
