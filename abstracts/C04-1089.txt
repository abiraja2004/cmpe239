 
New words such as names, technical terms, 
etc appear frequently. As such, the bilingual 
lexicon of a machine translation system has 
to be constantly updated with these new word 
translations. Comparable corpora such as 
news documents of the same period from dif-
ferent news agencies are readily available. In 
this paper, we present a new approach to min-
ing new word translations from comparable 
corpora, by using context information to 
complement transliteration information. We 
evaluated our approach on six months of Chi-
nese and English Gigaword corpora, with en-
couraging results.
