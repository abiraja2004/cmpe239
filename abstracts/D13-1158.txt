Recent studies on extractive text summariza-
tion formulate it as a combinatorial optimiza-
tion problem such as a Knapsack Problem, a
Maximum Coverage Problem or a Budgeted
Median Problem. These methods successfully
improved summarization quality, but they did
not consider the rhetorical relations between
the textual units of a source document. Thus,
summaries generated by these methods may
lack logical coherence. This paper proposes a
single document summarization method based
on the trimming of a discourse tree. This is
a two-fold process. First, we propose rules
for transforming a rhetorical structure theory-
based discourse tree into a dependency-based
discourse tree, which allows us to take a tree-
trimming approach to summarization. Sec-
ond, we formulate the problem of trimming
a dependency-based discourse tree as a Tree
Knapsack Problem, then solve it with integer
linear programming (ILP). Evaluation results
showed that our method improved ROUGE
scores.
