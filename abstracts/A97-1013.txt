 
We describe the use of energy function op- 
timisation in very shallow syntactic pars- 
ing. The approach can use linguistic 
rules and corpus-based statistics, so the 
strengths of both linguistic and statisti- 
cal approaches to NLP can be combined 
in a single framework. The rules are con- 
textual constraints for resolving syntactic 
ambiguities expressed as alternative tags, 
and the statistical language model consists 
of corpus-based n-grams of syntactic tags. 
The success of the hybrid syntactic dis- 
ambiguator is evaluated against a held-out 
benchmark corpus. Also the contributions 
of the linguistic and statistical language 
models to the hybrid model are estimated.
