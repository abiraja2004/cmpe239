We present Tightly Packed Tries (TPTs), a
compact implementation of read-only, com-
pressed trie structures with fast on-demand
paging and short load times.
We demonstrate the benefits of TPTs for stor-
ing n-gram back-off language models and
phrase tables for statistical machine transla-
tion. Encoded as TPTs, these databases re-
quire less space than flat text file representa-
tions of the same data compressed with the
gzip utility. At the same time, they can be
mapped into memory quickly and be searched
directly in time linear in the length of the key,
without the need to decompress the entire file.
The overhead for local decompression during
search is marginal.
