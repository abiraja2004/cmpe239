In this paper we present a detailed
scheme for annotating expressions of
opinions, beliefs, emotions, sentiment
and speculation (private states) in the
news and other discourse. We explore
inter-annotator agreement for individ-
ual private state expressions, and show
that these low-level annotations are use-
ful for producing higher-level subjec-
tive sentence annotations.
