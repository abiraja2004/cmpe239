 
The authors present a study of prosodic 
turn-taking indicators. The aim was to 
investigate whether some of the prosodic 
cues increase in quality or quantity if the 
optical feedback channel in the verbal 
conversation is missing. For the study we 
built up an experimental setup in which 
conversational partners held a conversa-
tion once with and once without an opti-
cal feedback channel. A detailed tran-
scription of the recorded speech material 
was segmented into turns. In each turn 
the topic units were identified and the 
syllables were labelled. We measured 
and compared prosodic feature character-
istics between turn-final and turn-medial 
topic units.
