LXGram is a hand-built Portuguese computational grammar based on
HPSG (syntax) and MRS (semantics). The LXGram system participated
in the STEP 2008 shared task which aims at comparing semantic repre-
sentations produced by NLP systems such as LXGram. Every partici-
pating team had to contribute a small text. The text that we submitted
for the shared task was originally in Portuguese (an excerpt from a news-
paper) and translated into English, to make a meaningful comparison at
the shared task possible. Likewise, the English texts contributed by the
other participating teams were translated into Portuguese. Because the
LXGram generates many different analyses (mainly due to PP attach-
ment ambiguities), the preferred analysis was selected manually. It was
required to extend LXGram?s lexicon and inventory of syntax rules to be
able to get a reasonable performance on the shared task data. Eventually,
our system was able to produce an analysis for 20 out of the 30 sentences
of the shared task data.
