Although diathesis alternations have been
used as features for manual verb clas-
sification, and there is recent work on
incorporating such features in computa-
tional models of human language acquisi-
tion, work on large scale verb classifica-
tion has yet to examine the potential for
using diathesis alternations as input fea-
tures to the clustering process. This pa-
per proposes a method for approximating
diathesis alternation behaviour in corpus
data and shows, using a state-of-the-art
verb clustering system, that features based
on alternation approximation outperform
those based on independent subcategoriza-
tion frames. Our alternation-based ap-
proach is particularly adept at leveraging
information from less frequent data.
