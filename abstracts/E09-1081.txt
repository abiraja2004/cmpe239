Abstract
We present a general model and concep-
tual framework for specifying architec-
tures for incremental processing in dia-
logue systems, in particular with respect
to the topology of the network of modules
that make up the system, the way informa-
tion flows through this network, how in-
formation increments are ?packaged?, and
how these increments are processed by the
modules. This model enables the precise
specification of incremental systems and
hence facilitates detailed comparisons be-
tween systems, as well as giving guidance
on designing new systems.
