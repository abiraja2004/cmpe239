N-gram-based models co-exist with their
phrase-based counterparts as an alternative
SMT framework. Both techniques have pros
and cons. While the N-gram-based frame-
work provides a better model that captures
both source and target contexts and avoids
spurious phrasal segmentation, the ability to
memorize and produce larger translation units
gives an edge to the phrase-based systems dur-
ing decoding, in terms of better search per-
formance and superior selection of transla-
tion units. In this paper we combine N-gram-
based modeling with phrase-based decoding,
and obtain the benefits of both approaches.
Our experiments show that using this combi-
nation not only improves the search accuracy
of the N-gram model but that it also improves
the BLEU scores. Our system outperforms
state-of-the-art phrase-based systems (Moses
and Phrasal) and N-gram-based systems by
a significant margin on German, French and
Spanish to English translation tasks.
