Actively sampled data can have very different
characteristics than passively sampled data.
Therefore, it?s promising to investigate using
different inference procedures during AL than
are used during passive learning (PL). This
general idea is explored in detail for the fo-
cused case of AL with cost-weighted SVMs
for imbalanced data, a situation that arises for
many HLT tasks. The key idea behind the
proposed InitPA method for addressing im-
balance is to base cost models during AL on
an estimate of overall corpus imbalance com-
puted via a small unbiased sample rather than
the imbalance in the labeled training data,
which is the leading method used during PL.
