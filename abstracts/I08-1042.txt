Combining different metrics into a single
measure of quality seems the most direct
and natural way to improve over the quality
of individual metrics. Recently, several ap-
proaches have been suggested (Kulesza and
Shieber, 2004; Liu and Gildea, 2007; Al-
brecht and Hwa, 2007a). Although based
on different assumptions, these approaches
share the common characteristic of being
parametric. Their models involve a num-
ber of parameters whose weight must be
adjusted. As an alternative, in this work,
we study the behaviour of non-parametric
schemes, in which metrics are combined
without having to adjust their relative im-
portance. Besides, rather than limiting to
the lexical dimension, we work on a wide
set of metrics operating at different linguis-
tic levels (e.g., lexical, syntactic and se-
mantic). Experimental results show that
non-parametric methods are a valid means
of putting different quality dimensions to-
gether, thus tracing a possible path towards
heterogeneous automatic MT evaluation.
