In many types of technical texts, meaning is
embedded in noun compounds. A language un-
derstanding program needs to be able to inter-
pret these in order to ascertain sentence mean-
ing. We explore the possibility of using an ex-
isting lexical hierarchy for the purpose of plac-
ing words from a noun compound into cate-
gories, and then using this category member-
ship to determine the relation that holds be-
tween the nouns. In this paper we present the
results of an analysis of this method on two-
word noun compounds from the biomedical do-
main, obtaining classification accuracy of ap-
proximately 90%. Since lexical hierarchies are
not necessarily ideally suited for this task, we
also pose the question: how far down the hi-
erarchy must the algorithm descend before all
the terms within the subhierarchy behave uni-
formly with respect to the semantic relation in
question? We find that the topmost levels of the
hierarchy yield an accurate classification, thus
providing an economic way of assigning rela-
tions to noun compounds.
