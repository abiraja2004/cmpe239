Current domain-specific information extrac-
tion systems represent an important resource
for biomedical researchers, who need to pro-
cess vaster amounts of knowledge in short
times. Automatic discourse causality recog-
nition can further improve their workload by
suggesting possible causal connections and
aiding in the curation of pathway models. We
here describe an approach to the automatic
identification of discourse causality triggers in
the biomedical domain using machine learn-
ing. We create several baselines and experi-
ment with various parameter settings for three
algorithms, i.e., Conditional Random Fields
(CRF), Support Vector Machines (SVM) and
Random Forests (RF). Also, we evaluate the
impact of lexical, syntactic and semantic fea-
tures on each of the algorithms and look at er-
rors. The best performance of 79.35% F-score
is achieved by CRFs when using all three fea-
ture types.
