We propose a formal characterization of variation
in the syntactic realization of semantic arguments,
using hierarchies of syntactic relations and thematic
roles, and a mechanism of lexical inheritance to ob-
tain valency frames from individual linking types.
We embed the formalization in the new lexicalized,
dependency-based grammar formalism of Topologi-
cal Dependency Grammar (TDG) (Duchier and De-
busmann, 2001). We account for arguments that can
be alternatively realized as a NP or a PP, and model
thematic role alternations. We also treat auxiliary
constructions, where the correspondance between
syntactic and semantic argumenthood is indirect.1
