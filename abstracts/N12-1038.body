We introduce a new segmentation evaluation
measure, WinPR, which resolves some of the
limitations of WindowDiff. WinPR distin-
guishes between false positive and false nega-
tive errors; produces more intuitive measures,
such as precision, recall, and F-measure; is in-
sensitive to window size, which allows us to
customize near miss sensitivity; and is based
on counting errors not windows, but still pro-
vides partial reward for near misses.
