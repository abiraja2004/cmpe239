This paper regards Question Answering
(QA) as Question-Biased Term Extraction
(QBTE). This new QBTE approach lib-
erates QA systems from the heavy bur-
den imposed by question types (or answer
types). In conventional approaches, a QA
system analyzes a given question and de-
termines the question type, and then it se-
lects answers from among answer candi-
dates that match the question type. Con-
sequently, the output of a QA system is
restricted by the design of the question
types. The QBTE directly extracts an-
swers as terms biased by the question. To
confirm the feasibility of our QBTE ap-
proach, we conducted experiments on the
CRL QA Data based on 10-fold cross val-
idation, using Maximum Entropy Models
(MEMs) as an ML technique. Experimen-
tal results showed that the trained system
achieved 0.36 in MRR and 0.47 in Top5
accuracy.
