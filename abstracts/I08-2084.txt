 
Term Extraction (TE) is an important com-
ponent of many NLP applications. In gen-
eral, terms are extracted for a given text 
collection based on global context and fre-
quency analysis on words/phrases associa-
tion. These extracted terms represent effec-
tively the text content of the collection for 
knowledge elicitation tasks. However, they 
fail to dictate the local contextual informa-
tion for each document effectively. In this 
paper, we refine the state-of-the-art C/NC-
Value term weighting method by consider-
ing both termhood and unithood measures, 
and use the former extracted terms to direct 
the local term extraction for each document. 
We performed the experiments on Straits 
Times year 2006 corpus and evaluated our 
performance using Wikipedia termbank.  
The experiments showed that our model 
outperforms C/NC-Value method for global 
term extraction by 24.4% based on term 
ranking. The precision for local term ex-
traction improves by 12% when compared 
to pure linguistic based extraction method.
