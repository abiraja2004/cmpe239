In this paper, we propose a crowdsourcing
methodology for a single-step construction of
both an empirically-derived sense inventory
and the corresponding sense-annotated cor-
pus. The methodology taps the intuitions of
non-expert native speakers to create an expert-
quality resource, and natively lends itself to
supplementing such a resource with additional
information about the structure and reliabil-
ity of the produced sense inventories. The re-
sulting resource will provide several ways to
empirically measure distances between related
word senses, and will explicitly address the
question of fuzzy boundaries between them.
