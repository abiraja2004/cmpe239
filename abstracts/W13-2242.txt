We introduce referential translation ma-
chines (RTM) for quality estimation of
translation outputs. RTMs are a computa-
tional model for identifying the translation
acts between any two data sets with re-
spect to a reference corpus selected in the
same domain, which can be used for esti-
mating the quality of translation outputs,
judging the semantic similarity between
text, and evaluating the quality of student
answers. RTMs achieve top performance
in automatic, accurate, and language inde-
pendent prediction of sentence-level and
word-level statistical machine translation
(SMT) quality. RTMs remove the need to
access any SMT system specific informa-
tion or prior knowledge of the training data
or models used when generating the trans-
lations. We develop novel techniques for
solving all subtasks in the WMT13 qual-
ity estimation (QE) task (QET 2013) based
on individual RTM models. Our results
achieve improvements over last year?s QE
task results (QET 2012), as well as our
previous results, provide new features and
techniques for QE, and rank 1st or 2nd in
all of the subtasks.
