This paper introduces the concepts of ask-
ing point and expected answer type as vari-
ations of the question focus. They are of
particular importance for QA over semi-
structured data, as represented by Topic
Maps, OWL or custom XML formats.
We describe an approach to the identifica-
tion of the question focus from questions
asked to a Question Answering system
over Topic Maps by extracting the asking
point and falling back to the expected an-
swer type when necessary. We use known
machine learning techniques for expected
answer type extraction and we implement
a novel approach to the asking point ex-
traction. We also provide a mathematical
model to predict the performance of the
system.
