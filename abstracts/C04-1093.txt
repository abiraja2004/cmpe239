We are developing an automatic method to
compile an encyclopedic corpus from the
Web. In our previous work, paragraph-style
descriptions for a term are extracted from
Web pages and organized based on domains.
However, these descriptions are independent
and do not comprise a condensed text as
in hand-crafted encyclopedias. To resolve
this problem, we propose a summarization
method, which produces a single text from
multiple descriptions. The resultant sum-
mary concisely describes a term from dif-
ferent viewpoints. We also show the effec-
tiveness of our method by means of experi-
ments.
