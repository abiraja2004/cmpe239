 
In this work, we attempt to detect sentence-
level subjectivity by means of two supervised 
machine learning approaches: a Fuzzy Control 
System and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference 
System. Even though these methods are popu-
lar in pattern recognition, they have not been 
thoroughly investigated for subjectivity analy-
sis. We present a novel ?Pruned ICF 
Weighting Coefficient,? which improves the 
accuracy for subjectivity detection. Our fea-
ture extraction algorithm calculates a feature 
vector based on the statistical occurrences of 
words in a corpus without any lexical 
knowledge. For this reason, these machine 
learning models can be applied to any lan-
guage; i.e., there is no lexical, grammatical, 
syntactical analysis used in the classification 
process.
