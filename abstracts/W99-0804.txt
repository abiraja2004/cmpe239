 
This paper describes experience with the 
developed of tools for CL education using Java. 
Some are standalone Java applets and others are 
clients which connect to a parsing server using a 
LISP-based backend. The principal benefits are 
platform independence and reusability rather 
than world-wide web access, although intranet 
technology reduces the need for special purpose 
labs.
