 
The lexical choice process hould be regarded as a con- 
straint satisfaction problem: the generation system must 
choose a lexical unit that is accurate (t~mthful), va//d 
(conveys the necessary information), and preferred (max- 
irnal under a preference function). This corts~aint-based 
architecture allows a clema separation to be made 
between what the system knows of the object or event, 
and what the system wishes to communicate about he 
object or event. It also allows lexical choices to be 
biased towards basic-level (Rosch 1978) and other pre- 
ferred lexical units.
