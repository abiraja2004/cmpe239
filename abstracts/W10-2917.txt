Supervised learning has been recently
used to improve the performance of word
alignment. However, due to the limited
amount of labeled data, the performance
of ?pure? supervised learning, which only
used labeled data, is limited. As a re-
sult, many existing methods employ fea-
tures learnt from a large amount of unla-
beled data to assist the task. In this pa-
per, we propose a semi-supervised ensem-
ble method to better incorporate both la-
beled and unlabeled data during learning.
Firstly, we employ an ensemble learning
framework, which effectively uses align-
ment results from different unsupervised
alignment models. We then propose to
use a semi-supervised learning method,
namely Tri-training, to train classifiers us-
ing both labeled and unlabeled data col-
laboratively and further improve the result.
Experimental results show that our meth-
ods can substantially improve the quality
of word alignment. The final translation
quality of a phrase-based translation sys-
tem is slightly improved, as well.
