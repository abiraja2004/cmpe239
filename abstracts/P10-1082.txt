In-vehicle dialogue systems often contain
more than one application, e.g. a navi-
gation and a telephone application. This
means that the user might, for example, in-
terrupt the interaction with the telephone
application to ask for directions from the
navigation application, and then resume
the dialogue with the telephone applica-
tion. In this paper we present an anal-
ysis of interruption and resumption be-
haviour in human-human in-vehicle dia-
logues and also propose some implications
for resumption strategies in an in-vehicle
dialogue system.
