The construction of pathways is a major fo-
cus of present-day biology. Typical pathways
involve large numbers of entities of various
types whose associations are represented as
reactions involving arbitrary numbers of reac-
tants, outputs and modifiers. Until recently,
few information extraction approaches were
capable of resolving the level of detail in text
required to support the annotation of such
pathway representations. We argue that event
representations of the type popularized by the
BioNLP Shared Task are potentially applica-
ble for pathway annotation support. As a step
toward realizing this possibility, we study the
mapping from a formal pathway representa-
tion to the event representation in order to
identify remaining challenges in event extrac-
tion for pathway annotation support. Follow-
ing initial analysis, we present a detailed study
of protein association and dissociation reac-
tions, proposing a new event class and repre-
sentation for the latter and, as a step toward
its automatic extraction, introduce a manu-
ally annotated resource incorporating the type
among a total of nearly 1300 annotated event
instances. As a further practical contribu-
tion, we introduce the first pathway-to-event
conversion software for SBML/CellDesigner
pathways and discuss the opportunities arising
from the ability to convert the substantial ex-
isting pathway resources to events.
