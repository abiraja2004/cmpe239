 
This paper describes the Chinese Word 
Segmenter for the fourth International 
Chinese Language Processing Bakeoff. 
Base on Conditional Random Field (CRF) 
model, a basic segmenter is designed as a 
problem of character-based tagging.  To 
further improve the performance of our 
segmenter, we employ a word-based ap-
proach to increase the in-vocabulary (IV) 
word recall and a post-processing to in-
crease the out-of-vocabulary (OOV) word 
recall. We participate in the word segmen-
tation closed test on all five corpora and 
our system achieved four second best and 
one the fifth in all the five corpora.
