 
In this paper we argue for the direct application of 
metarules ill the parsing prlx;ess and intrurluce a slight 
restriction on metarules. This restriction relies ml 
theoretical results alxmt he ternfiluation of term-rewrite 
systems and does not retinue tile expressive power of 
metarules as much as previous restrictions. We prove 
the termination for a ~t  of metarnles used in our 
German gramnlar and show \[low nletarules can be 
integrated into the parer.
