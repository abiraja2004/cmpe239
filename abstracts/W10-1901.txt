This paper presents two strong baselines
for the BioNLP 2009 shared task on event
extraction. First we re-implement a rule-
based approach which allows us to ex-
plore the task and the effect of domain-
adapted parsing on it. We then replace the
rule-based component with support vec-
tor machine classifiers and achieve perfor-
mance near the state-of-the-art without us-
ing any external resources. The good per-
formances achieved and the relative sim-
plicity of both approaches make them re-
producible baselines. We conclude with
suggestions for future work with respect to
the task representation.
