 
This paper describes our syllable-based phrase 
transliteration system for the NEWS 2012 
shared task on English-Chinese track and its 
back. Grapheme-based Transliteration maps the 
character(s) in the source side to the target 
character(s) directly. However, character-based 
segmentation on English side will cause 
ambiguity in alignment step. In this paper we 
utilize Phrase-based model to solve machine 
transliteration with the mapping between 
Chinese characters and English syllables rather 
than English characters. Two heuristic rule-
based syllable segmentation algorithms are 
applied. This transliteration model also 
incorporates three phonetic features to enhance 
discriminative ability for phrase. The primary 
system achieved 0.330 on Chinese-English and 
0.177 on English-Chinese in terms of top-1 
accuracy.
