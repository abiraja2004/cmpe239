We show that unsupervised part of speech
tagging performance can be significantly
improved using likely substitutes for tar-
get words given by a statistical language
model. We choose unambiguous substi-
tutes for each occurrence of an ambiguous
target word based on its context. The part
of speech tags for the unambiguous sub-
stitutes are then used to filter the entry for
the target word in the word?tag dictionary.
A standard HMM model trained using the
filtered dictionary achieves 92.25% accu-
racy on a standard 24,000 word corpus.
