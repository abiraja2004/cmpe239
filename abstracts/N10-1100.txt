 
In this paper, we focus on a recent Web trend 
called microblogging, and in particular a site 
called Twitter.  The content of such a site is an 
extraordinarily large number of small textual 
messages, posted by millions of users, at ran-
dom or in response to perceived events or sit-
uations.  We have developed an algorithm that 
takes a trending phrase or any phrase specified 
by a user, collects a large number of posts 
containing the phrase, and provides an auto-
matically created summary of the posts related 
to the term.  We present examples of summa-
ries we produce along with initial evaluation.
