 
Reduplication, a central instance of prosodic mor- 
phology, is particularly challenging for state-of- 
the-art computational morphology, since it involves 
copying of some part of a phonological string. In 
this paper I advocate a finite-state method that com- 
bines enriched lexical representations via intersec- 
tion to implement the copying. The proposal in- 
cludes a resource-conscious variant of automata and 
can benefit from the existence of lazy algorithms. 
Finally, the implementation f a complex case from 
Koasati s presented.
