This report documents the details of the
Machine Transliteration Shared Task con-
ducted as a part of the Named Enti-
ties Workshop (NEWS), an ACL-IJCNLP
2009 workshop. The shared task features
machine transliteration of proper names
from English to a set of languages. This
shared task has witnessed enthusiastic par-
ticipation of 31 teams from all over the
world, with diversity of participation for
a given system and wide coverage for a
given language pair (more than a dozen
participants per language pair). Diverse
transliteration methodologies are repre-
sented adequately in the shared task for a
given language pair, thus underscoring the
fact that the workshop may truly indicate
the state of the art in machine transliter-
ation in these language pairs. We mea-
sure and report 6 performance metrics on
the submitted results. We believe that the
shared task has successfully achieved the
following objectives: (i) bringing together
the community of researchers in the area
of Machine Transliteration to focus on var-
ious research avenues, (ii) Calibrating sys-
tems on common corpora, using common
metrics, thus creating a reasonable base-
line for the state-of-the-art of translitera-
tion systems, and (iii) providing a quan-
titative basis for meaningful comparison
and analysis between various algorithmic
approaches used in machine translitera-
tion. We believe that the results of this
shared task would uncover a host of inter-
esting research problems, giving impetus
to research in this significant research area.
