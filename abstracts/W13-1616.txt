of users from review documents. Sentiment 
classification using Machine Learning (ML) 
methods faces the problem of high dimen-
sionality of feature vector. Therefore, a fea-
ture selection method is required to eliminate 
the irrelevant and noisy features from the 
feature vector for efficient working of ML 
algorithms. Rough Set Theory based feature 
selection method finds the optimal feature 
subset by eliminating the redundant features. 
In this paper, Rough Set Theory (RST) based 
feature selection method is applied for sen-
timent classification. A Hybrid feature selec-
tion method based on RST and Information 
Gain (IG) is proposed for sentiment classifi-
cation. Proposed methods are evaluated on 
four standard datasets viz. Movie review, 
product (book, DVD and electronics) review 
dataset. Experimental results show that Hy-
brid feature selection method outperforms 
than other feature selection methods for sen-
timent classification.
