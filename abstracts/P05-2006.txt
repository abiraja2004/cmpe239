Semantic relations between text concepts
denote the core elements of lexical se-
mantics. This paper presents a model for
the automatic detection of INTENTION se-
mantic relation. Our approach first identi-
fies the syntactic patterns that encode in-
tentions, then we select syntactic and se-
mantic features for a SVM learning classi-
fier. In conclusion, we discuss the appli-
cation of INTENTION relations to Q&A.
