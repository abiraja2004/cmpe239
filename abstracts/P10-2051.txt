This paper presents a joint optimization
method of a two-step conditional random
field (CRF) model for machine transliter-
ation and a fast decoding algorithm for
the proposed method. Our method lies in
the category of direct orthographical map-
ping (DOM) between two languages with-
out using any intermediate phonemic map-
ping. In the two-step CRF model, the first
CRF segments an input word into chunks
and the second one converts each chunk
into one unit in the target language. In this
paper, we propose a method to jointly op-
timize the two-step CRFs and also a fast
algorithm to realize it. Our experiments
show that the proposed method outper-
forms the well-known joint source channel
model (JSCM) and our proposed fast al-
gorithm decreases the decoding time sig-
nificantly. Furthermore, combination of
the proposed method and the JSCM gives
further improvement, which outperforms
state-of-the-art results in terms of top-1 ac-
curacy.
