This paper describes the exemplar based ap-
proach presented by UNED at Senseval-3. In-
stead of representing contexts as bags of terms
and defining a similarity measure between con-
texts, we propose to represent terms as bags
of contexts and define a similarity measure be-
tween terms. Thus, words, lemmas and senses
are represented in the same space (the context
space), and similarity measures can be defined
between them. New contexts are transformed
into this representation in order to calculate
their similarity to the candidate senses. We
show how standard similarity measures obtain
better results in this framework. A new similar-
ity measure in the context space is proposed for
selecting the senses and performing disambigua-
tion. Results of this approach at Senseval-3 are
here reported.
