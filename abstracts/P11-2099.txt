 
We investigate the expression of opinions 
about human entities in user-generated con-
tent (UGC). A set of 2,800 online news 
comments (8,000 sentences) was manually 
annotated, following a rich annotation 
scheme designed for this purpose. We con-
clude that the challenge in performing opi-
nion mining in such type of content is 
correctly identifying the positive opinions, 
because (i) they are much less frequent 
than negative opinions and (ii) they are par-
ticularly exposed to verbal irony. We also 
show that the recognition of human targets 
poses additional challenges on mining opi-
nions from UGC, since they are frequently 
mentioned by pronouns, definite descrip-
tions and nicknames.
