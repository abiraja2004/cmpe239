Publishers  of  biomedical  journals  in-
creasingly  use  XML  as  the  underlying 
document format.  We present a modular 
text-processing pipeline that inserts XML 
markup  into  such  documents  in  every 
processing step, leading to multi-dimen-
sional markup.  The markup introduced 
is  used  to  identify  and  disambiguate 
named entities of several semantic types 
(protein/gene,  Gene  Ontology  terms, 
drugs  and species)  and to  communicate 
data from one module to the next.  Each 
module  independently  adds,  changes  or 
removes markup, which allows for mod-
ularization  and  a  flexible  setup  of  the 
processing  pipeline.  We  also  describe 
how the cascaded approach is embedded 
in  a  large-scale  XML-based  application 
(EBIMed) used for on-line access to bio-
medical  literature.   We discuss  the  les-
sons  learnt  so  far,  as  well  as  the  open 
problems  that  need  to  be  resolved.   In 
particular,  we  argue  that  the  pragmatic 
and tailored solutions allow for reduction 
in  the need for overlapping annotations 
? although not completely without cost.
