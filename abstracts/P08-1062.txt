 
In this paper, we present a novel backward transliteration approach which can further as-sist the existing statistical model by mining monolingual web resources. Firstly, we em-ploy the syllable-based search to revise the transliteration candidates from the statistical model. By mapping all of them into existing words, we can filter or correct some pseudo candidates and improve the overall recall. Secondly, an AdaBoost model is used to re-rank the revised candidates based on the in-formation extracted from monolingual web pages. To get a better precision during the re-ranking process, a variety of web-based in-formation is exploited to adjust the ranking score, so that some candidates which are less possible to be transliteration names will be as-signed with lower ranks. The experimental re-sults show that the proposed framework can significantly outperform the baseline translit-eration system in both precision and recall. 1
