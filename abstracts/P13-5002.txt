Semantic parsers map natural language sentences
to formal representations of their underlying
meaning. Building accurate semantic parsers
without prohibitive engineering costs is a long-
standing, open research problem.
The tutorial will describe general principles for
building semantic parsers. The presentation will
be divided into two main parts: modeling and
learning. The modeling section will include best
practices for grammar design and choice of se-
mantic representation. The discussion will be
guided by examples from several domains. To il-
lustrate the choices to be made and show how they
can be approached within a real-life representation
language, we will use ?-calculus meaning repre-
sentations. In the learning part, we will describe
a unified approach for learning Combinatory Cat-
egorial Grammar (CCG) semantic parsers, that in-
duces both a CCG lexicon and the parameters of
a parsing model. The approach learns from data
with labeled meaning representations, as well as
from more easily gathered weak supervision. It
also enables grounded learning where the seman-
tic parser is used in an interactive environment, for
example to read and execute instructions.
The ideas we will discuss are widely appli-
cable. The semantic modeling approach, while
implemented in ?-calculus, could be applied to
many other formal languages. Similarly, the al-
gorithms for inducing CCGs focus on tasks that
are formalism independent, learning the meaning
of words and estimating parsing parameters. No
prior knowledge of CCGs is required. The tuto-
rial will be backed by implementation and exper-
iments in the University of Washington Semantic
Parsing Framework (UW SPF).1
