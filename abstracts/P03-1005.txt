This paper proposes the ?Hierarchical Di-
rected Acyclic Graph (HDAG) Kernel? for
structured natural language data. The
HDAG Kernel directly accepts several lev-
els of both chunks and their relations,
and then efficiently computes the weighed
sum of the number of common attribute
sequences of the HDAGs. We applied the
proposed method to question classifica-
tion and sentence alignment tasks to eval-
uate its performance as a similarity mea-
sure and a kernel function. The results
of the experiments demonstrate that the
HDAG Kernel is superior to other kernel
functions and baseline methods.
