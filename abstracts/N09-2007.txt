This paper explores corpus-based bilingual re-
trieval where the translation corpora used vary
by source and size. We find that the quality of
translation alignments and the domain of the
bitext are important. In some settings these
factors are more critical than corpus size. We
also show that judicious choice of tokeniza-
tion can reduce the amount of bitext required
to obtain good bilingual retrieval performance.
