We propose a novel method to predict the inter-
paragraph discourse structure of text, i.e. to infer
which paragraphs are related to each other and form
larger segments on a higher level. Our method com-
bines a clustering algorithm with a model of seg-
ment ?relatedness? acquired in a machine learning
step. The model integrates information from a va-
riety of sources, such as word co-occurrence, lexi-
cal chains, cue phrases, punctuation, and tense. Our
method outperforms an approach that relies on word
co-occurrence alone.
