 
We studied contrast and variability in 
a corpus of gene names to identify 
potential heuristics for use in 
performing entity identification in the 
molecular biology domain.  Based on 
our findings, we developed heuristics 
for mapping weakly matching gene 
names to their official gene names.  
We then tested these heuristics against 
a large body of Medline abstracts, and 
found that using these heuristics can 
increase recall, with varying levels of 
precision.  Our findings also 
underscored the importance of good 
information retrieval and of the ability 
to disambiguate between genes, 
proteins, RNA, and a variety of other 
referents for performing entity 
identification with high precision.
