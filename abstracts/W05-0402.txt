We present the results of feature engineer-
ing and post-processing experiments con-
ducted on a temporal expression recogni-
tion task. The former explores the use of
different kinds of tagging schemes and of
exploiting a list of core temporal expres-
sions during training. The latter is con-
cerned with the use of this list for post-
processing the output of a system based on
conditional random fields.
We find that the incorporation of knowl-
edge sources both for training and post-
processing improves recall, while the use
of extended tagging schemes may help
to offset the (mildly) negative impact on
precision. Each of these approaches ad-
dresses a different aspect of the over-
all recognition performance. Taken sep-
arately, the impact on the overall perfor-
mance is low, but by combining the ap-
proaches we achieve both high precision
and high recall scores.
