 
We have developed an algorithm for the automatic 
conversion of dictated English sentences to written text, 
with essentially no restriction on the nature of the mate- 
rial dictated. We require that speakers undergo a short 
training session so that the system can adapt to their 
individual speaking characteristics and that they leave 
brief pauses between words. We have tested our algo- 
rithm extensively on an 86,000 word vocabulary (the 
largest of any such system in the world) using nine 
speakers and obtained word recognition rates on the or- 
der of 93Uo.
