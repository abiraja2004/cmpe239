We present a method which, given a few
words defining a concept in some lan-
guage, retrieves, disambiguates and ex-
tends corresponding terms that define a
similar concept in another specified lan-
guage. This can be very useful for
cross-lingual information retrieval and the
preparation of multi-lingual lexical re-
sources. We automatically obtain term
translations from multilingual dictionaries
and disambiguate them using web counts.
We then retrieve web snippets with co-
occurring translations, and discover ad-
ditional concept terms from these snip-
pets. Our term discovery is based on co-
appearance of similar words in symmetric
patterns. We evaluate our method on a set
of language pairs involving 45 languages,
including combinations of very dissimilar
ones such as Russian, Chinese, and He-
brew for various concepts. We assess the
quality of the retrieved sets using both hu-
man judgments and automatically compar-
ing the obtained categories to correspond-
ing English WordNet synsets.
