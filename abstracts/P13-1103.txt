This paper describes a method of in-
ducing wide-coverage CCG resources for
Japanese. While deep parsers with corpus-
induced grammars have been emerging
for some languages, those for Japanese
have not been widely studied, mainly be-
cause most Japanese syntactic resources
are dependency-based. Our method first
integrates multiple dependency-based cor-
pora into phrase structure trees and then
converts the trees into CCG derivations.
The method is empirically evaluated in
terms of the coverage of the obtained lexi-
con and the accuracy of parsing.
