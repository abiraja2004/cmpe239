This paper describes our contribution to the
CoNLL 2012 Shared Task.1 We present a
novel decoding algorithm for coreference res-
olution which is combined with a standard
pair-wise coreference resolver in a stacking
approach. The stacked decoders are evaluated
on the three languages of the Shared Task. We
obtain an official overall score of 58.25 which
is the second highest in the Shared Task.
