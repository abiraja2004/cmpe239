 
It is challenging to translate names and technical terms from English into Arabic. Translation is 
usually done phonetically: different alphabets and sound inventories force various compromises. 
For example, Peter Streams may come out as hr..~ ~ bytr szrymz. This process is called 
transliteration. We address here the reverse problem: given a foreign name or loanword in Arabic 
text, we want to recover the original in Roman script. For example, an input like .~..A~ 
bytr strymz should yield an output like Peter Streams. Arabic presents special challenges due 
to unwritten vowels and phonetic-context effects. We present results and examples of use in an 
Arabic-to-English machine translator.
