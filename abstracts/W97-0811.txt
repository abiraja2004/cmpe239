 
The same word can have many different mean- 
ings depending on the context in which it is 
used. Discovering the meaning of a word, given 
the text around it, has been an interesting prob- 
lem for both the psychology and the artificial 
intelligence research communities. In this arti- 
cle, we present a series of experiments, using 
methods which have proven to be useful for 
eliminating part-of-speech ambiguity, to see if 
such simple methods can be used to resolve se- 
mantic ambiguities. Using a publicly available 
semantic lexicon, we find the Hidden Markov 
Models work surprising well at choosing the 
right semantic ategories, once the sentence has 
been stripped of purely functional words.
