Children learn various levels of linguistic
structure concurrently, yet most existing mod-
els of language acquisition deal with only
a single level of structure, implicitly assum-
ing a sequential learning process. Developing
models that learn multiple levels simultane-
ously can provide important insights into how
these levels might interact synergistically dur-
ing learning. Here, we present a model that
jointly induces syntactic categories and mor-
phological segmentations by combining two
well-known models for the individual tasks.
We test on child-directed utterances in English
and Spanish and compare to single-task base-
lines. In the morphologically poorer language
(English), the model improves morphological
segmentation, while in the morphologically
richer language (Spanish), it leads to better
syntactic categorization. These results provide
further evidence that joint learning is useful,
but also suggest that the benefits may be dif-
ferent for typologically different languages.
