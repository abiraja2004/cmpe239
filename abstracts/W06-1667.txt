We present an unsupervised learning ap-
proach to disambiguate various relations
between name entities by use of various
lexical and syntactic features from the
contexts. It works by calculating eigen-
vectors of an adjacency graph?s Lapla-
cian to recover a submanifold of data
from a high dimensionality space and
then performing cluster number estima-
tion on the eigenvectors. This method
can address two difficulties encoutered
in Hasegawa et al (2004)?s hierarchical
clustering: no consideration of manifold
structure in data, and requirement to pro-
vide cluster number by users. Experiment
results on ACE corpora show that this
spectral clustering based approach outper-
forms Hasegawa et al (2004)?s hierarchi-
cal clustering method and a plain k-means
clustering method.
