We have designed, implemented and eval-
uated an end-to-end system spellcheck-
ing and autocorrection system that does
not require any manually annotated train-
ing data. The World Wide Web is used
as a large noisy corpus from which we
infer knowledge about misspellings and
word usage. This is used to build an er-
ror model and an n-gram language model.
A small secondary set of news texts with
artificially inserted misspellings are used
to tune confidence classifiers. Because
no manual annotation is required, our sys-
tem can easily be instantiated for new lan-
guages. When evaluated on human typed
data with real misspellings in English and
German, our web-based systems outper-
form baselines which use candidate cor-
rections based on hand-curated dictionar-
ies. Our system achieves 3.8% total error
rate in English. We show similar improve-
ments in preliminary results on artificial
data for Russian and Arabic.
