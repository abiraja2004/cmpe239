A common focus of systems in Intelli-
gent Computer-Assisted Language Learning
(ICALL) is to provide immediate feedback to
language learners working on exercises. Most
of this research has focused on providing feed-
back on the form of the learner input. Foreign
language practice and second language acqui-
sition research, on the other hand, emphasizes
the importance of exercises that require the
learner to manipulate meaning.
The ability of an ICALL system to diag-
nose and provide feedback on the mean-
ing conveyed by a learner response depends
on how well it can deal with the response
variation allowed by an activity. We focus
on short-answer reading comprehension ques-
tions which have a clearly defined target re-
sponse but the learner may convey the mean-
ing of the target in multiple ways. As empiri-
cal basis of our work, we collected an English
as a Second Language (ESL) learner corpus
of short-answer reading comprehension ques-
tions, for which two graders provided target
answers and correctness judgments. On this
basis, we developed a Content-Assessment
Module (CAM), which performs shallow se-
mantic analysis to diagnose meaning errors. It
reaches an accuracy of 88% for semantic error
detection and 87% on semantic error diagno-
sis on a held-out test data set.
