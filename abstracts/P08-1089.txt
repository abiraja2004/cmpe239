Paraphrase patterns are useful in paraphrase
recognition and generation. In this paper, we
present a pivot approach for extracting para-
phrase patterns from bilingual parallel cor-
pora, whereby the English paraphrase patterns
are extracted using the sentences in a for-
eign language as pivots. We propose a log-
linear model to compute the paraphrase likeli-
hood of two patterns and exploit feature func-
tions based on maximum likelihood estima-
tion (MLE) and lexical weighting (LW). Us-
ing the presented method, we extract over
1,000,000 pairs of paraphrase patterns from
2M bilingual sentence pairs, the precision
of which exceeds 67%. The evaluation re-
sults show that: (1) The pivot approach is
effective in extracting paraphrase patterns,
which significantly outperforms the conven-
tional method DIRT. Especially, the log-linear
model with the proposed feature functions
achieves high performance. (2) The coverage
of the extracted paraphrase patterns is high,
which is above 84%. (3) The extracted para-
phrase patterns can be classified into 5 types,
which are useful in various applications.
