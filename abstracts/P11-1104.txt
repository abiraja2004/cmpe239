 
This paper proposes a novel reordering model 
for statistical machine translation (SMT) by 
means of modeling the translation orders of 
the source language collocations. The model 
is learned from a word-aligned bilingual cor-
pus where the collocated words in source sen-
tences are automatically detected. During 
decoding, the model is employed to softly 
constrain the translation orders of the source 
language collocations, so as to constrain the 
translation orders of those source phrases con-
taining these collocated words. The experi-
mental results show that the proposed method 
significantly improves the translation quality, 
achieving the absolute improvements of 
1.1~1.4 BLEU score over the baseline me-
thods.
