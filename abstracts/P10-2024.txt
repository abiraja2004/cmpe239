We describe the strategy currently pur-
sued for verbalising OWL ontologies by
sentences in Controlled Natural Language
(i.e., combining generic rules for realising
logical patterns with ontology-specific lex-
icons for realising atomic terms for indi-
viduals, classes, and properties) and argue
that its success depends on assumptions
about the complexity of terms and axioms
in the ontology. We then show, through
analysis of a corpus of ontologies, that al-
though these assumptions could in princi-
ple be violated, they are overwhelmingly
respected in practice by ontology develop-
ers.
