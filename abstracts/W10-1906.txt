 
Based on linguistic generalizations, we 
enhanced an existing semantic processor, 
SemRep, for effective interpretation of a 
wide range of patterns used to express 
arguments of nominalization in clinically 
oriented biomedical text. Nominaliza-
tions are pervasive in the scientific litera-
ture, yet few text mining systems ade-
quately address them, thus missing a 
wealth of information. We evaluated the 
system by assessing the algorithm inde-
pendently and by determining its contri-
bution to SemRep generally. The first 
evaluation demonstrated the strength of 
the method through an F-score of 0.646 
(P=0.743, R=0.569), which is more than 
20 points higher than the baseline. The 
second evaluation showed that overall 
SemRep results were increased to F-score 
0.689 (P=0.745, R=0.640), approximate-
ly 25 points better than processing with-
out nominalizations.
