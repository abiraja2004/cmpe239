We describe a multi-step process for automati-
cally learning reliable sub-sentential syntactic
phrases that are translation equivalents of each
other and syntactic translation rules between
two languages. The input to the process is a
corpus of parallel sentences, word-aligned and
annotated with phrase-structure parse trees.
We first apply a newly developed algorithm
for aligning parse-tree nodes between the two
parallel trees. Next, we extract all aligned
sub-sentential syntactic constituents from the
parallel sentences, and create a syntax-based
phrase-table. Finally, we treat the node align-
ments as tree decomposition points and extract
from the corpus all possible synchronous par-
allel tree fragments. These are then converted
into synchronous context-free rules. We de-
scribe the approach and analyze its application
to Chinese-English parallel data.
