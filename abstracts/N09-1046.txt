Recent work has shown that translating seg-
mentation lattices (lattices that encode alterna-
tive ways of breaking the input to an MT sys-
tem into words), rather than text in any partic-
ular segmentation, improves translation qual-
ity of languages whose orthography does not
mark morpheme boundaries. However, much
of this work has relied on multiple segmenters
that perform differently on the same input to
generate sufficiently diverse source segmen-
tation lattices. In this work, we describe a
maximum entropy model of compound word
splitting that relies on a few general features
that can be used to generate segmentation lat-
tices for most languages with productive com-
pounding. Using a model optimized for Ger-
man translation, we present results showing
significant improvements in translation qual-
ity in German-English, Hungarian-English,
and Turkish-English translation over state-of-
the-art baselines.
