We describe an unsupervised approach to
the problem of automatically detecting sub-
groups of people holding similar opinions in
a discussion thread. An intuitive way of iden-
tifying this is to detect the attitudes of discus-
sants towards each other or named entities or
topics mentioned in the discussion. Sentiment
tags play an important role in this detection,
but we also note another dimension to the de-
tection of people?s attitudes in a discussion: if
two persons share the same opinion, they tend
to use similar language content. We consider
the latter to be an implicit attitude. In this pa-
per, we investigate the impact of implicit and
explicit attitude in two genres of social media
discussion data, more formal wikipedia dis-
cussions and a debate discussion forum that
is much more informal. Experimental results
strongly suggest that implicit attitude is an im-
portant complement for explicit attitudes (ex-
pressed via sentiment) and it can improve the
sub-group detection performance independent
of genre.
