Reordering poses one of the greatest chal-
lenges in Statistical Machine Translation re-
search as the key contextual information may
well be beyond the confine of translation units.
We present the ?Anchor Graph? (AG) model
where we use a graph structure to model
global contextual information that is crucial
for reordering. The key ingredient of our AG
model is the edges that capture the relation-
ship between the reordering around a set of
selected translation units, which we refer to as
anchors. As the edges link anchors that may
span multiple translation units at decoding
time, our AG model effectively encodes global
contextual information that is previously ab-
sent. We integrate our proposed model into a
state-of-the-art translation system and demon-
strate the efficacy of our proposal in a large-
scale Chinese-to-English translation task.
