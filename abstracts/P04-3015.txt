 
In this paper, we propose a method of auto-
matically extracting word hierarchies based on 
the inclusion relation of appearance patterns 
from corpora. We apply a complementary 
similarity measure to find a hierarchical word 
structure. This similarity measure was devel-
oped for the recognition of degraded machine-
printed text in the field and can be applied to 
estimate one-to-many relations. Our purpose is 
to extract word hierarchies from corpora 
automatically. As the initial task, we attempt 
to extract hierarchies of abstract nouns co-
occurring with adjectives in Japanese and 
compare with hierarchies in the EDR elec-
tronic dictionary.
