 
Analogy is heavily used in written explana-
tions, particularly in instructional texts.  We 
introduce the concept of analogical dialogue 
acts (ADAs) which represent the roles utter-
ances play in instructional analogies.  We de-
scribe a catalog of such acts, based on ideas 
from structure-mapping theory.  We focus on 
the operations that these acts lead to while un-
derstanding instructional texts, using the 
Structure-Mapping Engine (SME) and dynam-
ic case construction in a computational model.  
We test this model on a small corpus of in-
structional analogies, expressed in simplified 
English, which were understood via a semi-
automatic natural language system using ana-
logical dialogue acts.  The model enabled a 
system to answer questions after understand-
ing the analogies that it was not able to answer 
without them.
