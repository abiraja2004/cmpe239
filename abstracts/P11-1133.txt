We present a first known result of high pre-
cision rare word bilingual extraction from
comparable corpora, using aligned compara-
ble documents and supervised classification.
We incorporate two features, a context-vector
similarity and a co-occurrence model between
words in aligned documents in a machine
learning approach. We test our hypothesis
on different pairs of languages and corpora.
We obtain very high F-Measure between 80%
and 98% for recognizing and extracting cor-
rect translations for rare terms (from 1 to 5 oc-
currences). Moreover, we show that our sys-
tem can be trained on a pair of languages and
test on a different pair of languages, obtain-
ing a F-Measure of 77% for the classification
of Chinese-English translations using a train-
ing corpus of Spanish-French. Our method is
therefore even potentially applicable to low re-
sources languages without training data.
