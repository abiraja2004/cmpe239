This demonstration presents the LinGO
Grammar Matrix grammar customization
system: a repository of distilled linguis-
tic knowledge and a web-based service
which elicits a typological description of
a language from the user and yields a cus-
tomized grammar fragment ready for sus-
tained development into a broad-coverage
grammar. We describe the implementation
of this repository with an emphasis on how
the information is made available to users,
including in-browser testing capabilities.
