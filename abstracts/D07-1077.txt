Syntactic reordering approaches are an ef-
fective method for handling word-order dif-
ferences between source and target lan-
guages in statistical machine translation
(SMT) systems. This paper introduces a re-
ordering approach for translation from Chi-
nese to English. We describe a set of syntac-
tic reordering rules that exploit systematic
differences between Chinese and English
word order. The resulting system is used
as a preprocessor for both training and test
sentences, transforming Chinese sentences
to be much closer to English in terms of their
word order. We evaluated the reordering
approach within the MOSES phrase-based
SMT system (Koehn et al, 2007). The
reordering approach improved the BLEU
score for the MOSES system from 28.52 to
30.86 on the NIST 2006 evaluation data. We
also conducted a series of experiments to an-
alyze the accuracy and impact of different
types of reordering rules.
