We present a framework where auxiliary
MT systems are used to provide lexical
predictions to a main SMT system. In
this work, predictions are obtained by
means of pivoting via auxiliary languages,
and introduced into the main SMT sys-
tem in the form of a low order language
model, which is estimated on a sentence-
by-sentence basis. The linear combination
of models implemented by the decoder
is thus extended with this additional lan-
guage model. Experiments are carried out
over three different translation tasks using
the European Parliament corpus. For each
task, nine additional languages are used
as auxiliary languages to obtain the trian-
gulated predictions. Translation accuracy
results show that improvements in trans-
lation quality are obtained, even for large
data conditions.
