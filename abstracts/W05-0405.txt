In this paper we examine topic segmen-
tation of narrative documents, which are
characterized by long passages of text
with few headings. We first present results
suggesting that previous topic segmenta-
tion approaches are not appropriate for
narrative text. We then present a feature-
based method that combines features from
diverse sources as well as learned features.
Applied to narrative books and encyclope-
dia articles, our method shows results that
are significantly better than previous seg-
mentation approaches. An analysis of in-
dividual features is also provided and the
benefit of generalization using outside re-
sources is shown.
