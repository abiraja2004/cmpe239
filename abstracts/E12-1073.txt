The task of paraphrase acquisition from re-
lated sentences can be tackled by a variety
of techniques making use of various types
of knowledge. In this work, we make the
hypothesis that their performance can be
increased if candidate paraphrases can be
validated using information that character-
izes paraphrases independently of the set of
techniques that proposed them. We imple-
ment this as a bi-class classification prob-
lem (i.e. paraphrase vs. not paraphrase),
allowing any paraphrase acquisition tech-
nique to be easily integrated into the com-
bination system. We report experiments on
two languages, English and French, with
5 individual techniques on parallel mono-
lingual parallel corpora obtained via multi-
ple translation, and a large set of classifi-
cation features including surface to contex-
tual similarity measures. Relative improve-
ments in F-measure close to 18% are ob-
tained on both languages over the best per-
forming techniques.
