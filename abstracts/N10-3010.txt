In this paper, we describe a syntax based
source side reordering method for phrase-
based statistical machine translation (SMT)
systems. The source side training corpus is
first parsed, then reordering rules are auto-
matically learnt from source-side phrases and
word alignments. Later the source side train-
ing and test corpus are reordered and given
to the SMT system. Reordering is a common
problem observed in language pairs of distant
language origins. This paper describes an au-
tomated approach for learning reorder rules
from a word-aligned parallel corpus using as-
sociation rule mining. Reordered and gener-
alized rules are the most significant in our ap-
proach. Our experiments were conducted on
an English-Hindi EILMT corpus.
