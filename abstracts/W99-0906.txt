 
We propose and evaluate computational techniques 
for deciphering unknown scripts. We focus on the 
case in which an unfamiliar script encodes a known 
language. The decipherment of a brief document 
or inscription is driven by data about the spoken 
language. We consider which scripts are easy or hard 
to decipher, how much data is required, and whether 
the techniques are robust against language change 
over time.
