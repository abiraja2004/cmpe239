In this paper we define two intermediate
models of textual entailment, which corre-
spond to lexical and lexical-syntactic lev-
els of representation. We manually anno-
tated a sample from the RTE dataset ac-
cording to each model, compared the out-
come for the two models, and explored
how well they approximate the notion of
entailment. We show that the lexical-
syntactic model outperforms the lexical
model, mainly due to a much lower rate
of false-positives, but both models fail to
achieve high recall. Our analysis also
shows that paraphrases stand out as a
dominant contributor to the entailment
task. We suggest that our models and an-
notation methods can serve as an evalua-
tion scheme for entailment at these levels.
