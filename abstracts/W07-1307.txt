Pair Hidden Markov Models (PairHMMs)
are trained to align the pronunciation tran-
scriptions of a large contemporary collec-
tion of Dutch dialect material, the Goeman-
Taeldeman-Van Reenen-Project (GTRP, col-
lected 1980?1995). We focus on the ques-
tion of how to incorporate information about
sound segment distances to improve se-
quence distance measures for use in di-
alect comparison. PairHMMs induce seg-
ment distances via expectation maximisa-
tion (EM). Our analysis uses a phonologi-
cally comparable subset of 562 items for all
424 localities in the Netherlands. We evalu-
ate the work first via comparison to analyses
obtained using the Levenshtein distance on
the same dataset and second, by comparing
the quality of the induced vowel distances to
acoustic differences.
