This paper presents a simple and effi-
cient algorithm for approximate dictio-
nary matching designed for similarity
measures such as cosine, Dice, Jaccard,
and overlap coefficients. We propose this
algorithm, called CPMerge, for the ? -
overlap join of inverted lists. First we
show that this task is solvable exactly by
a ? -overlap join. Given inverted lists re-
trieved for a query, the algorithm collects
fewer candidate strings and prunes un-
likely candidates to efficiently find strings
that satisfy the constraint of the ? -overlap
join. We conducted experiments of ap-
proximate dictionary matching on three
large-scale datasets that include person
names, biomedical names, and general
English words. The algorithm exhib-
ited scalable performance on the datasets.
For example, it retrieved strings in 1.1
ms from the string collection of Google
Web1T unigrams (with cosine similarity
and threshold 0.7).
