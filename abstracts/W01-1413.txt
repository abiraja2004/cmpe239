We present a system for extracting an
English translation of a given Japanese
technical term by collecting and scor-
ing translation candidates from the web.
We first show that there are a lot of par-
tially bilingual documents in the web
that could be useful for term translation,
discovered by using a commercial tech-
nical term dictionary and an Internet
search engine. We then present an al-
gorithm for obtaining translation candi-
dates based on the distance of Japanese
and English terms in web documents,
and report the results of a preliminary
experiment.
