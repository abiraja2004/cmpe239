Dependency analysis relies on morphosyntac-
tic evidence, as well as semantic evidence.
In some cases, however, morphosyntactic ev-
idence seems to be in conflict with seman-
tic evidence. For this reason dependency
grammar theories, annotation guidelines and
tree-to-dependency conversion schemes often
differ in how they analyze various syntactic
constructions. Most experiments for which
constituent-based treebanks such as the Penn
Treebank are converted into dependency tree-
banks rely blindly on one of four-five widely
used tree-to-dependency conversion schemes.
This paper evaluates the down-stream effect of
choice of conversion scheme, showing that it
has dramatic impact on end results.
