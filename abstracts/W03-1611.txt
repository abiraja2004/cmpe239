This paper proposes a novel method to extract
paraphrases of Japanese noun phrases from a
set of documents. The proposed method con-
sists of three steps: (1) retrieving passages us-
ing character-based index terms given a noun
phrase as an input query, (2) filtering the re-
trieved passages with syntactic and seman-
tic constraints, and (3) ranking the passages
and reformatting them into grammatical forms.
Experiments were conducted to evaluate the
method by using 53 noun phrases and three
years worth of newspaper articles. The ac-
curacy of the method needs to be further im-
proved for fully automatic paraphrasing but the
proposed method can extract novel paraphrases
which past approaches could not.
