Current research in text mining favours the
quantity of texts over their quality. But for
bilingual terminology mining, and for many
language pairs, large comparable corpora
are not available. More importantly, as terms
are defined vis-?-vis a specific domain with
a restricted register, it is expected that the
quality rather than the quantity of the corpus
matters more in terminology mining. Our
hypothesis, therefore, is that the quality of
the corpus is more important than the quan-
tity and ensures the quality of the acquired
terminological resources. We show how im-
portant the type of discourse is as a charac-
teristic of the comparable corpus.
