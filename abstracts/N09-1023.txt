Computational processing of text exchanged
in interactive venues in which participants en-
gage in simultaneous conversations can bene-
fit from techniques for automatically grouping
overlapping sequences of messages into sepa-
rate conversations, a problem known as ?dis-
entanglement.? While previous methods ex-
ploit both lexical and non-lexical information
that exists in conversations for this task, the
inter-dependency between the meaning of a
message and its temporal and social contexts
is largely ignored. Our approach exploits con-
textual properties (both explicit and hidden)
to probabilistically expand each message to
provide a more accurate message representa-
tion. Extensive experimental evaluations show
our approach outperforms the best previously
known technique.
