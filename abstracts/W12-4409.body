We developed a machine transliteration sys-
tem combining mpaligner (an improvement of
m2m-aligner), DirecTL+, and some Japanese-
specific heuristics for the purpose of NEWS
2012. Our results show that mpaligner
is greatly better than m2m-aligner, and the
Japanese-specific heuristics are effective for
JnJk and EnJa tasks. While m2m-aligner is
not good at long alignment, mpaligner per-
forms well at longer alignment without any
length limit. In JnJk and EnJa tasks, it is cru-
cial to handle long alignment. An experimen-
tal result revealed that de-romanization, which
is reverse operation of romanization, is crucial
for JnJk task. In EnJa task, it is shown that
mora is the best alignment unit for Japanese
language.
