 
A general-purpose text annotation tool 
called Knowtator is introduced.  Knowtator 
facilitates the manual creation of annotated 
corpora that can be used for evaluating or 
training a variety of natural language proc-
essing systems.  Building on the strengths 
of the widely used Prot?g? knowledge rep-
resentation system, Knowtator has been 
developed as a Prot?g? plug-in that lever-
ages Prot?g??s knowledge representation 
capabilities to specify annotation schemas.  
Knowtator?s unique advantage over other 
annotation tools is the ease with which 
complex annotation schemas (e.g. schemas 
which have constrained relationships be-
tween annotation types) can be defined and 
incorporated into use.  Knowtator is avail-
able under the Mozilla Public License 1.1 
at http://bionlp.sourceforge.net/Knowtator.
