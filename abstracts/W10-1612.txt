IRASubcat is a language-independent tool to
acquire information about the subcategoriza-
tion of verbs from corpus. The tool can extract
information from corpora annotated at vari-
ous levels, including almost raw text, where
only verbs are identified. It can also ag-
gregate information from a pre-existing lex-
icon with verbal subcategorization informa-
tion. The system is highly customizable, and
works with XML as input and output format.
IRASubcat identifies patterns of constituents
in the corpus, and associates patterns with
verbs if their association strength is over a fre-
quency threshold and passes the likelihood ra-
tio hypothesis test. It also implements a proce-
dure to identify verbal constituents that could
be playing the role of an adjunct in a pattern.
Thresholds controlling frequency and identi-
fication of adjuncts can be customized by the
user, or else they are given a default value.
