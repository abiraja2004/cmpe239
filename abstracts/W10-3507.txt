 
The blogosphere is a huge collaboratively 
constructed resource containing diverse 
and rich information. This diversity and 
richness presents a significant research 
challenge to the Information Retrieval 
community. This paper addresses this 
challenge by proposing a method for 
identification of ?topic clusters? within 
the blogosphere where topic clusters 
represent the concept of grouping togeth-
er blogs sharing a common interest i.e. 
topic, the algorithm takes into account 
both the hyperlinked social network of 
blogs along with the content in the blog 
posts. Additionally we use various forms 
and parts-of-speech of the topic to pro-
vide a broader coverage of the blogos-
phere. The next step of the method is to 
assign topic-specific ranks to each blog 
in the cluster using a metric called ?Topic 
Discussion Rank,? that helps in identify-
ing the most influential blog for a specif-
ic topic. We also perform an experimen-
tal evaluation of our method on real blog 
data and show that the proposed method 
reaches a high level of accuracy.
