Discriminative reranking is one method
for constructing high-performance statis-
tical parsers (Collins, 2000). A discrim-
inative reranker requires a source of can-
didate parses for each sentence. This pa-
per describes a simple yet novel method
for constructing sets of 50-best parses
based on a coarse-to-fine generative parser
(Charniak, 2000). This method gener-
ates 50-best lists that are of substantially
higher quality than previously obtainable.
We used these parses as the input to a
MaxEnt reranker (Johnson et al, 1999;
Riezler et al, 2002) that selects the best
parse from the set of parses for each sen-
tence, obtaining an f-score of 91.0% on
sentences of length 100 or less.
