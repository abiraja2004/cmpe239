In this paper, we propose a linguistically anno-
tated reordering model for BTG-based statis-
tical machine translation. The model incorpo-
rates linguistic knowledge to predict orders for
both syntactic and non-syntactic phrases. The
linguistic knowledge is automatically learned
from source-side parse trees through an an-
notation algorithm. We empirically demon-
strate that the proposed model leads to a sig-
nificant improvement of 1.55% in the BLEU
score over the baseline reordering model on
the NIST MT-05 Chinese-to-English transla-
tion task.
