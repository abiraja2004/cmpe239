This paper describes the JHU system combi-
nation scheme used in WMT-11. The JHU
system combination is based on confusion
network alignment, and inherited the frame-
work developed by (Karakos et al, 2008).
We improved our core system combination al-
gorithm by making use of TER-plus, which
was originally designed for string alignment,
for alignment of confusion networks. Exper-
imental results on French-English, German-
English, Czech-English and Spanish-English
combination tasks show significant improve-
ments on BLEU and TER by up to 2 points on
average, compared to the best individual sys-
tem output, and improvements compared with
the results produced by ITG which we used in
WMT-10.
