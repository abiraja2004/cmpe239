We present a novel text exploration model,
which extends the scope of state-of-the-art
technologies by moving from standard con-
cept-based exploration to statement-based ex-
ploration. The proposed scheme utilizes the
textual entailment relation between statements
as the basis of the exploration process. A user
of our system can explore the result space of
a query by drilling down/up from one state-
ment to another, according to entailment re-
lations specified by an entailment graph and
an optional concept taxonomy. As a promi-
nent use case, we apply our exploration sys-
tem and illustrate its benefit on the health-care
domain. To the best of our knowledge this is
the first implementation of an exploration sys-
tem at the statement level that is based on the
textual entailment relation.
