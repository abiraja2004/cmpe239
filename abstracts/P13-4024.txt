 
In this paper, we introduce a Web-scale lin-guistics search engine, Linggle, that retrieves lexical bundles in response to a given query. The query might contain keywords, wildcards, wild parts of speech (PoS), synonyms, and ad-ditional regular expression (RE) operators. In our approach, we incorporate inverted file in-dexing, PoS information from BNC, and se-mantic indexing based on Latent Dirichlet Al-location with Google Web 1T. The method in-volves parsing the query to transforming it in-to several keyword retrieval commands. Word chunks are retrieved with counts, further filter-ing the chunks with the query as a RE, and fi-nally displaying the results according to the counts, similarities, and topics. Clusters of synonyms or conceptually related words are also provided.  In addition, Linggle provides example sentences from The New York Times on demand. The current implementation of Linggle is the most functionally comprehen-sive, and is in principle language and dataset independent. We plan to extend Linggle to provide fast and convenient access to a wealth of linguistic information embodied in Web scale datasets including Google Web 1T and Google Books Ngram for many major lan-guages in the world. 1
