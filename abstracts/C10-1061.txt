This paper presents a first efficient imple-
mentation of a weighted deductive CYK
parser for Probabilistic Linear Context-
Free Rewriting Systems (PLCFRS), to-
gether with context-summary estimates
for parse items used to speed up pars-
ing. LCFRS, an extension of CFG, can de-
scribe discontinuities both in constituency
and dependency structures in a straight-
forward way and is therefore a natural
candidate to be used for data-driven pars-
ing. We evaluate our parser with a gram-
mar extracted from the German NeGra
treebank. Our experiments show that data-
driven LCFRS parsing is feasible with
a reasonable speed and yields output of
competitive quality.
