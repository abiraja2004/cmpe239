Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) is one
of the toughest problems in NLP, and in
WSD, verb disambiguation has proved to
be extremely difficult, because of high de-
gree of polysemy, too fine grained senses,
absence of deep verb hierarchy and low in-
ter annotator agreement in verb sense an-
notation. Unsupervised WSD has received
widespread attention, but has performed
poorly, specially on verbs. Recently an
unsupervised bilingual EM based algo-
rithm has been proposed, which makes
use only of the raw counts of the transla-
tions in comparable corpora (Marathi and
Hindi). But the performance of this ap-
proach is poor on verbs with accuracy
level at 25-38%. We suggest a modifica-
tion to this mentioned formulation, using
context and semantic relatedness of neigh-
boring words. An improvement of 17% -
35% in the accuracy of verb WSD is ob-
tained compared to the existing EM based
approach. On a general note, the work
can be looked upon as contributing to the
framework of unsupervised WSD through
context aware expectation maximization.
