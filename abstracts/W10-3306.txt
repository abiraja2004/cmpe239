We propose a novel algorithm to ex-
tract taxonomic (or isa/instanceOf ) rela-
tions from category structure by classi-
fying each category link. Previous algo-
rithms mainly focus on lexical patterns of
category names to classify whether or not
a given category link is an isa/instanceOf.
In contrast, our algorithm extracts intrin-
sic properties that represent the definition
of given category name, and uses those
properties to classify each category link.
Experimental result shows about 5 to 18 %
increase in F-Measure, compared to other
existing systems.
