This paper addresses the pragmatic challenges
that state-of-the-art question/answering sys-
tems face in trying to decompose complex
information-seeking scenarios. We propose
that question decomposition can be approached
in one of two ways: either by approximating
the domain-specific knowledge for a particular
set of domains, or by identifying the decompo-
sition strategies employed by human users. We
also present preliminary results from experi-
ments that confirm the viability of each of these
approaches within an interactive Q/A context.
