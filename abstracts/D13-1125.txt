Assigning a positive or negative score to a
word out of context (i.e. a word?s prior polar-
ity) is a challenging task for sentiment analy-
sis. In the literature, various approaches based
on SentiWordNet have been proposed. In this
paper, we compare the most often used tech-
niques together with newly proposed ones and
incorporate all of them in a learning frame-
work to see whether blending them can fur-
ther improve the estimation of prior polarity
scores. Using two different versions of Sen-
tiWordNet and testing regression and classifi-
cation models across tasks and datasets, our
learning approach consistently outperforms
the single metrics, providing a new state-of-
the-art approach in computing words? prior
polarity for sentiment analysis. We conclude
our investigation showing interesting biases
in calculated prior polarity scores when word
Part of Speech and annotator gender are con-
sidered.
