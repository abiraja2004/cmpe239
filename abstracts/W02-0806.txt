This paper presents a comparative evalua-
tion among the systems that participated
in the Spanish and English lexical sam-
ple tasks of SENSEVAL-2. The focus is
on pairwise comparisons among systems
to assess the degree to which they agree,
and on measuring the difficulty of the test
instances included in these tasks.
