Abstract
We propose a framework for generating an ab-
stractive summary from a semantic model of a
multimodal document. We discuss the type of
model required, the means by which it can be
constructed, how the content of the model is
rated and selected, and the method of realizing
novel sentences for the summary. To this end,
we introduce a metric called information den-
sity used for gauging the importance of con-
tent obtained from text and graphical sources.
