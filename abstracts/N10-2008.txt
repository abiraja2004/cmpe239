 
In this demonstration we will present technol-
ogies that enable learners to engage in spoken 
conversations in foreign languages, integrat-
ing intelligent tutoring and serious game ca-
pabilities into a package that helps learners 
quickly acquire communication skills.  Con-
versational AI technologies based on the 
SAIBA framework for dialog modeling are 
realized in this 3-D game environment.  Par-
ticipants will be introduced to tools for author-
ing dialogs in this framework, and will have 
an opportunity to experience learning with 
Alelo products, including the Operational 
Language and Culture Training System 
(OLCTS).
