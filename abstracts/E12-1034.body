In this paper, we extend current state-of-the-
art research on unsupervised acquisition of
scripts, that is, stereotypical and frequently
observed sequences of events. We design,
evaluate and compare different methods for
constructing models for script event predic-
tion: given a partial chain of events in a
script, predict other events that are likely
to belong to the script. Our work aims
to answer key questions about how best
to (1) identify representative event chains
from a source text, (2) gather statistics from
the event chains, and (3) choose ranking
functions for predicting new script events.
We make several contributions, introducing
skip-grams for collecting event statistics, de-
signing improved methods for ranking event
predictions, defining a more reliable evalu-
ation metric for measuring predictiveness,
and providing a systematic analysis of the
various event prediction models.
