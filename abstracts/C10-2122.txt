We study correlation of rankings of text
summarization systems using evaluation
methods with and without human mod-
els. We apply our comparison frame-
work to various well-established content-
based evaluation measures in text sum-
marization such as coverage, Responsive-
ness, Pyramids and ROUGE studying their
associations in various text summarization
tasks including generic and focus-based
multi-document summarization in English
and generic single-document summariza-
tion in French and Spanish. The research
is carried out using a new content-based
evaluation framework called FRESA to
compute a variety of divergences among
probability distributions.
