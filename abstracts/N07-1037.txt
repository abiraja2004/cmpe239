We propose a method for extracting se-
mantic orientations of phrases (pairs of an
adjective and a noun): positive, negative,
or neutral. Given an adjective, the seman-
tic orientation classification of phrases can
be reduced to the classification of words.
We construct a lexical network by con-
necting similar/related words. In the net-
work, each node has one of the three ori-
entation values and the neighboring nodes
tend to have the same value. We adopt
the Potts model for the probability model
of the lexical network. For each adjec-
tive, we estimate the states of the nodes,
which indicate the semantic orientations
of the adjective-noun pairs. Unlike ex-
isting methods for phrase classification,
the proposed method can classify phrases
consisting of unseen words. We also pro-
pose to use unlabeled data for a seed set of
probability computation. Empirical evalu-
ation shows the effectiveness of the pro-
posed method.
