Natural language processing (NLP) programs are
confronted with various diculties in processing
HTML and XML documents, and have the po-
tential to produce better results if linguistic infor-
mation is annotated in the source texts. We have
therefore developed the Linguistic Annotation Lan-
guage (or LAL), which is an XML-compliant tag set
for assisting natural language processing programs,
and NLP tools such as parsers and machine trans-
lation programs which can accept LAL-annotated
input. In addition, we have developed a LAL-
annotation editor which allows users to annotate
documents graphically without seeing tags. Fur-
ther, we have conducted an experiment to check
the translation quality improvement by using LAL
annotation.
