We present a kernel-based approach for fine-
grained classification of named entities. The
only training data for our algorithm is a few
manually annotated entities for each class. We
defined kernel functions that implicitly map
entities, represented by aggregating all con-
texts in which they occur, into a latent seman-
tic space derived from Wikipedia. Our method
achieves a significant improvement over the
state of the art for the task of populating an
ontology of people, although requiring con-
siderably less training instances than previous
approaches.
