Argumentation schemes are structures or tem-
plates for various kinds of arguments. Given
the text of an argument with premises and con-
clusion identified, we classify it as an instance
of one of five common schemes, using features
specific to each scheme. We achieve accura-
cies of 63?91% in one-against-others classifi-
cation and 80?94% in pairwise classification
(baseline = 50% in both cases).
