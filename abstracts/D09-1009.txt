Methods that learn from prior informa-
tion about input features such as general-
ized expectation (GE) have been used to
train accurate models with very little ef-
fort. In this paper, we propose an ac-
tive learning approach in which the ma-
chine solicits ?labels? on features rather
than instances. In both simulated and real
user experiments on two sequence label-
ing tasks we show that our active learning
method outperforms passive learning with
features as well as traditional active learn-
ing with instances. Preliminary experi-
ments suggest that novel interfaces which
intelligently solicit labels on multiple fea-
tures facilitate more efficient annotation.
