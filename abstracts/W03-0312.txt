We propose a method of constructing an
example-based machine translation (EBMT)
system that exploits a content-aligned bilingual
corpus. First, the sentences and phrases in the
corpus are aligned across the two languages,
and the pairs with high translation confidence
are selected and stored in the translation mem-
ory. Then, for a given input sentences, the
system searches for fitting examples based on
both the monolingual similarity and the transla-
tion confidence of the pair, and the obtained re-
sults are then combined to generate the transla-
tion. Our experiments on translation selection
showed the accuracy of 85% demonstrating the
basic feasibility of our approach.
