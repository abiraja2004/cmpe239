Patent translation is a complex problem due
to the highly specialized technical vocab-
ulary and the peculiar textual structure of
patent documents. In this paper we analyze
patents along the orthogonal dimensions of
topic and textual structure. We view differ-
ent patent classes and different patent text
sections such as title, abstract, and claims,
as separate translation tasks, and investi-
gate the influence of such tasks on machine
translation performance. We study multi-
task learning techniques that exploit com-
monalities between tasks by mixtures of
translation models or by multi-task meta-
parameter tuning. We find small but sig-
nificant gains over task-specific training
by techniques that model commonalities
through shared parameters. A by-product
of our work is a parallel patent corpus of 23
million German-English sentence pairs.
