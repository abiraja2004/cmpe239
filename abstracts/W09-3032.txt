This paper presents an on-going effort
which aims to annotate the Wall Street
Journal sections of the Penn Treebank with
the help of a hand-written large-scale and
wide-coverage grammar of English. In do-
ing so, we are not only focusing on the
various stages of the semi-automated an-
notation process we have adopted, but we
are also showing that rich linguistic anno-
tations, which can apart from syntax also
incorporate semantics, ensure that the tree-
bank is guaranteed to be a truly sharable,
re-usable and multi-functional linguistic
resource?.
