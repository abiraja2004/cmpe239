This paper describes a Natural Lan-
guage Learning method that extracts
knowledge in the form of semantic pat-
terns with ontology elements associated
to syntactic components in the text. The
method combines the use of EuroWord-
Net?s ontological concepts and the cor-
rect sense of each word assigned by
a Word Sense Disambiguation(WSD)
module to extract three sets of pat-
terns: subject-verb, verb-direct object
and verb-indirect object. These sets de-
fine the semantic behaviour of the main
textual elements based on their syntac-
tic role. On the one hand, it is shown
that Maximum Entropy models applied
to WSD tasks provide good results. The
evaluation of the WSD module has re-
vealed a accuracy rate of 64% in a pre-
liminary test. On the other hand, we ex-
plain how an adequate set of semantic
or ontological patterns can improve the
success rate of NLP tasks such us pro-
noun resolution. We have implemented
both modules in C++ and although the
evaluation has been performed for En-
glish, their general features allow the
treatment of other languages like Span-
ish.
