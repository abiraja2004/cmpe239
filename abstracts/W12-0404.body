In this study, we explore several popular
techniques for obtaining corpora for decep-
tion research. Through a survey of tra-
ditional as well as non-gold standard cre-
ation approaches, we identify advantages
and limitations of these techniques for web-
based deception detection and offer crowd-
sourcing as a novel avenue toward achiev-
ing a gold standard corpus. Through an in-
depth case study of online hotel reviews,
we demonstrate the implementation of this
crowdsourcing technique and illustrate its
applicability to a broad array of online re-
views.
