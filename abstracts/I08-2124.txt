 
In this paper, we present an empirical 
study on adapting Conditional Random 
Fields (CRF) models to conduct semantic 
analysis on biomedical articles using ac-
tive learning. We explore uncertainty-
based active learning with the CRF model 
to dynamically select the most informa-
tive training examples. This abridges the 
power of the supervised methods and ex-
pensive human annotation cost.
