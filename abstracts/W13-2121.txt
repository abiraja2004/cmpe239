In this paper we present the preliminary work of
a Basque poetry generation system. Basically,
we have extracted the POS-tag sequences from
some verse corpora and calculated the probabil-
ity of each sequence. For the generation process
we have defined 3 different experiments: Based
on a strophe from the corpora, we (a) replace
each word with other according to its POS-tag
and suffixes, (b) replace each noun and adjective
with another equally inflected word and (c) re-
place only nouns with semantically related ones
(inflected). Finally we evaluate those strategies
using a Turing Test-like evaluation.
