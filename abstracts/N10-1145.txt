We describe tree edit models for representing
sequences of tree transformations involving
complex reordering phenomena and demon-
strate that they offer a simple, intuitive, and
effective method for modeling pairs of seman-
tically related sentences. To efficiently extract
sequences of edits, we employ a tree kernel
as a heuristic in a greedy search routine. We
describe a logistic regression model that uses
33 syntactic features of edit sequences to clas-
sify the sentence pairs. The approach leads to
competitive performance in recognizing tex-
tual entailment, paraphrase identification, and
answer selection for question answering.
