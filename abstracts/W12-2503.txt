What is the role of textual features above the 
sentence  level  in  advancing  the  machine 
translation of literature? This paper examines 
how  referential  cohesion  is  expressed  in 
literary  and  non-literary  texts  and  how  this 
cohesion affects translation. We first show in a 
corpus study on English that literary texts use 
more dense reference chains to express greater 
referential  cohesion  than  news.  We  then 
compare the referential  cohesion of machine 
versus  human  translations  of  Chinese 
literature and news. While human translators 
capture  the  greater  referential  cohesion  of 
literature,  Google  translations  perform  less 
well at capturing literary cohesion. Our results 
suggest  that  incorporating discourse  features 
above  the  sentence  level  is  an  important 
direction for MT research if it is to be applied 
to literature.
