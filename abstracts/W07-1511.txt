 
This paper presents the design and construc-
tion of an annotated Chinese collocation bank 
as the resource to support systematic research 
on Chinese collocations. With the help of 
computational tools, the bi-gram and n-gram 
collocations corresponding to 3,643 head-
words are manually identified. Furthermore, 
annotations for bi-gram collocations include 
dependency relation, chunking relation and 
classification of collocation types. Currently, 
the collocation bank annotated 23,581 bi-
gram collocations and 2,752 n-gram colloca-
tions extracted from  a 5-million-word corpus. 
Through statistical analysis on the collocation 
bank, some characteristics of Chinese bi-
gram collocations are examined which is es-
sential to collocation research, especially for 
Chinese.
