The goal of this task is to allow for com-
parison across sense-induction and discrim-
ination systems, and also to compare these
systems to other supervised and knowledge-
based systems. In total there were 6 partic-
ipating systems. We reused the SemEval-
2007 English lexical sample subtask of task
17, and set up both clustering-style unsuper-
vised evaluation (using OntoNotes senses as
gold-standard) and a supervised evaluation
(using the part of the dataset for mapping).
We provide a comparison to the results of
the systems participating in the lexical sam-
ple subtask of task 17.
