In this paper we first describe the technol-
ogy of automatic annotation transformation,
which is based on the annotation adaptation
algorithm (Jiang et al2009). It can auto-
matically transform a human-annotated cor-
pus from one annotation guideline to another.
We then propose two optimization strategies,
iterative training and predict-self reestimation,
to further improve the accuracy of annota-
tion guideline transformation. Experiments on
Chinese word segmentation show that, the it-
erative training strategy together with predict-
self reestimation brings significant improve-
ment over the simple annotation transforma-
tion baseline, and leads to classifiers with sig-
nificantly higher accuracy and several times
faster processing than annotation adaptation
does. On the Penn Chinese Treebank 5.0,
it achieves an F-measure of 98.43%, signif-
icantly outperforms previous works although
using a single classifier with only local fea-
tures.
