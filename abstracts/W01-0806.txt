We present an algorithm which im-
proves the efficiency of a search for the
optimally aggregated paragraph which
summarises a flat structured input spec-
ification. We model the space of possi-
ble paraphrases of possible paragraphs
as the space of sequences of composi-
tions of a set of tree-adjoining grammar
(TAG) elementary trees. Our algorithm
transforms this to a set with equivalent
paraphrasing power but better compu-
tational properties. Also, it identifies an
explicit mapping between input propo-
sitions and their possible surface reali-
sations.
