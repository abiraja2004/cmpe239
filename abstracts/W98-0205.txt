 
Organizations that make use of large 
amounts of multimedia material 
(especially images and video) require 
easy access to such information. Recent 
developments in computer hardware and 
algorithm design have made possible 
content indexing of digital video 
information and efficient display of 3D 
data representations. This paper 
describes collaborative work between 
Boeing Applied Research & Technology 
(AR&T), Carnegie Mellon University 
(CMU), and the Battelle Pacific 
Northwest National Laboratories 
(PNNL). to integrate media indexing 
with computer visualization to achieve 
effective content-based access to video 
information. Text metadata, representing 
video content, was extracted from the 
CMU Informedia system, processed by 
AR&T's text analysis software, and 
presented to users via PNNL's Starlight 
3D visualization system. This approach 
shows how to make multimedia 
information accessible to a text-based 
visualization system, facilitating aglobal 
view of large collections of such data. 
We evaluated our approach by making 
several experimental queries against a 
library of eight hours of video 
segmented into several hundred "video 
paragraphs." We conclude that search 
performance of Inforrnedia was 
enhanced in terms of ease of exploration 
by the integration with Starlight.
