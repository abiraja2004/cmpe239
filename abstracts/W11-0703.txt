Political blogs as a form of social media al-
low for an uniquely interactive form of politi-
cal discourse. This is especially evident in fo-
cused blogs with a strong ideological identity.
We investigate techniques to identify topics
within the context of the community, which
when discussed in a blog post evoke a dis-
cernible positive or negative collective opin-
ion from readers who respond to posts in com-
ments. This is done by using computational
methods to assign sentiment polarity to blog
comments and learning community specific
models that summarize issues tackled by blogs
and predict the polarity based on the topics
discussed in a blog post.
