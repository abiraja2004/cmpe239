 
Chinese and Korean belong to different lan-
guage families in terms of word-order and 
morphological typology. Chinese is an SVO 
and morphologically poor language while Ko-
rean is an SOV and morphologically rich one. 
In Chinese-to-Korean SMT systems, systemat-
ic differences between the verbal systems of 
the two languages make the generation of Ko-
rean verbal phrases difficult. To resolve the 
difficulties, we address two issues in this paper. 
The first issue is that the verb position is dif-
ferent from the viewpoint of word-order ty-
pology. The second is the difficulty of com-
plex morphology generation of Korean verbs 
from the viewpoint of morphological typology. 
We propose a Chinese syntactic reordering 
that is better at generating Korean verbal 
phrases in Chinese-to-Korean SMT. Specifi-
cally, we consider reordering rules targeting 
Chinese verb phrases (VPs), preposition 
phrases (PPs), and modality-bearing words 
that are closely related to Korean verbal phras-
es. We verify our system with two corpora of 
different domains. Our proposed approach 
significantly improves the performance of our 
system over a baseline phrased-based SMT 
system. The relative improvements in the two 
corpora are +9.32% and +5.43%, respectively.
