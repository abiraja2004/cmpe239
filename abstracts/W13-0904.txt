Metaphor is a pervasive feature of human lan-
guage that enables us to conceptualize and
communicate abstract concepts using more
concrete terminology. Unfortunately, it is
also a feature that serves to confound a com-
puter?s ability to comprehend natural human
language. We present a method to detect
linguistic metaphors by inducing a domain-
aware semantic signature for a given text and
compare this signature against a large index
of known metaphors. By training a suite of
binary classifiers using the results of several
semantic signature-based rankings of the in-
dex, we are able to detect linguistic metaphors
in unstructured text at a significantly higher
precision as compared to several baseline ap-
proaches.
