This paper describes a new method for cross-
lingual textual entailment (CLTE) detection
based on machine translation (MT). We use
sub-segment translations from different MT
systems available online as a source of cross-
lingual knowledge. In this work we describe
and evaluate different features derived from
these sub-segment translations, which are used
by a support vector machine classifier to detect
CLTEs. We presented this system to the Se-
mEval 2012 task 8 obtaining an accuracy up to
59.8% on the English?Spanish test set, the sec-
ond best performing approach in the contest.
