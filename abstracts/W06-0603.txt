This work reports on three human tense
annotation experiments for Chinese verbs
in Chinese-to-English translation scenar-
ios. The results show that inter-annotator
agreement increases as the context of the
verb under the annotation becomes in-
creasingly specified, i.e. as the context
moves from the situation in which the tar-
get English sentence is unknown to the
situation in which the target lexicon and
target syntactic structure are fully speci-
fied. The annotation scheme with a fully
specified syntax and lexicon in the tar-
get English sentence yields a satisfactorily
high agreement rate. The annotation re-
sults were then analyzed via an ANOVA
analysis, a logistic regression model and a
log-linear model. The analyses reveal that
while both the overt and the latent linguis-
tic factors seem to significantly affect an-
notation agreement under different scenar-
ios, the latent features are the real driving
factors of tense annotation disagreement
among multiple annotators. The analy-
ses also find the verb telicity feature, as-
pect marker presence and syntactic em-
bedding structure to be strongly associated
with tense, suggesting their utility in the
automatic tense classification task.
