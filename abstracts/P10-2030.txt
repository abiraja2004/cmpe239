Maintaining high annotation consistency
in large corpora is crucial for statistical
learning; however, such work is hard,
especially for tasks containing semantic
elements. This paper describes predi-
cate argument structure analysis using?
transformation-based learning. An advan-
tage of transformation-based learning is
the readability of learned rules. A dis-
advantage is that the rule extraction pro-
cedure is time-consuming. We present
incremental-based, transformation-based
learning for semantic processing tasks. As
an example, we deal with Japanese pred-
icate argument analysis and show some
tendencies of annotators for constructing
a corpus with our method.
