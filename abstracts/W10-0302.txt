 
The exponential growth of the Persian blo-
gosphere and the increased number of neolog-
isms create a major challenge in NLP 
applications of Persian blogs. This paper de-
scribes a method for extracting and classifying 
newly constructed words and borrowings from 
Persian blog posts. The analysis of the occur-
rence of neologisms across five distinct topic 
categories points to a correspondence between 
the topic domain and the type of neologism 
that is most commonly encountered. The re-
sults suggest that different approaches should 
be implemented for the automatic detection 
and processing of neologisms depending on 
the domain of application.
