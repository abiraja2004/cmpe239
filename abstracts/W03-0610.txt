How can we build robots that engage in fluid
spoken conversations with people, moving be-
yond canned responses to words and towards
actually understanding? As a step towards ad-
dressing this question, we introduce a robotic
architecture that provides a basis for grounding
word meanings. The architecture provides per-
ceptual, procedural, and affordance represen-
tations for grounding words. A perceptually-
coupled on-line simulator enables sensory-
motor representations that can shift points of
view. Held together, we show that this archi-
tecture provides a rich set of data structures
and procedures that provide the foundations for
grounding the meaning of certain classes of
words.
