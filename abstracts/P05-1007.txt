To improve the interaction between students
and an intelligent tutoring system, we devel-
oped two Natural Language generators, that we
systematically evaluated in a three way com-
parison that included the original system as
well. We found that the generator which intu-
itively produces the best language does engen-
der the most learning. Specifically, it appears
that functional aggregation is responsible for
the improvement.
