 
Personal profile information on social media 
like LinkedIn.com and Facebook.com is at the 
core of many interesting applications, such as 
talent recommendation and contextual advertis-
ing. However, personal profiles usually lack or-
ganization confronted with the large amount of 
available information. Therefore, it is always a 
challenge for people to find desired information 
from them. In this paper, we address the task of 
personal profile summarization by leveraging 
both personal profile textual information and so-
cial networks. Here, using social networks is 
motivated by the intuition that, people with 
similar academic, business or social connections 
(e.g. co-major, co-university, and co-
corporation) tend to have similar experience and 
summaries. To achieve the learning process, we 
propose a collective factor graph (CoFG) model 
to incorporate all these resources of knowledge 
to summarize personal profiles with local textual 
attribute functions and social connection factors. 
Extensive evaluation on a large-scale dataset 
from LinkedIn.com demonstrates the effective-
ness of the proposed approach.*
