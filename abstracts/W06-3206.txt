In performing morpho-phonological se-
quence processing tasks, such as letter-
phoneme conversion or morphological
analysis, it is typically not enough to base
the output sequence on local decisions that
map local-context input windows to sin-
gle output tokens. We present a global
sequence-processing method that repairs
inconsistent local decisions. The approach
is based on local predictions of overlap-
ping trigrams of output tokens, which
open up a space of possible sequences;
a data-driven constraint satisfaction infer-
ence step then searches for the optimal
output sequence. We demonstrate signifi-
cant improvements in terms of word accu-
racy on English and Dutch letter-phoneme
conversion and morphological segmenta-
tion, and we provide qualitative analyses
of error types prevented by the constraint
satisfaction inference method.
