This paper presents a novel application of
Alternating Structure Optimization (ASO)
to the task of Semantic Role Labeling (SRL)
of noun predicates in NomBank. ASO is
a recently proposed linear multi-task learn-
ing algorithm, which extracts the common
structures of multiple tasks to improve accu-
racy, via the use of auxiliary problems. In
this paper, we explore a number of different
auxiliary problems, and we are able to sig-
nificantly improve the accuracy of the Nom-
Bank SRL task using this approach. To our
knowledge, our proposed approach achieves
the highest accuracy published to date on the
English NomBank SRL task.
