 
Schwa deletion is an important issue in 
grapheme-to-phoneme conversion for Indo-
Aryan languages (IAL). In this paper, we 
describe a syllable minimization based 
algorithm for dealing with this that 
outperforms the existing methods in terms of 
efficiency and accuracy. The algorithm is 
motivated by the fact that deletion of schwa is 
a diachronic and sociolinguistic phenomenon 
that facilitates faster communication through 
syllable economy. The contribution of the 
paper is not just a better algorithm for schwa 
deletion; rather we describe here a constrained 
optimization based framework that can partly 
model the evolution of languages, and hence, 
can be used for solving many problems in 
computational linguistics that call for 
diachronic explanations.
