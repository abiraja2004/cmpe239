Better representations of plot structure
could greatly improve computational meth-
ods for summarizing and generating sto-
ries. Current representations lack abstrac-
tion, focusing too closely on events. We
present a kernel for comparing novelistic
plots at a higher level, in terms of the
cast of characters they depict and the so-
cial relationships between them. Our kernel
compares the characters of different nov-
els to one another by measuring their fre-
quency of occurrence over time and the
descriptive and emotional language associ-
ated with them. Given a corpus of 19th-
century novels as training data, our method
can accurately distinguish held-out novels
in their original form from artificially dis-
ordered or reversed surrogates, demonstrat-
ing its ability to robustly represent impor-
tant aspects of plot structure.
