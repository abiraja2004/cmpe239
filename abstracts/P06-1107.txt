In this paper we investigate a novel
method to detect asymmetric entailment
relations between verbs. Our starting point
is the idea that some point-wise verb selec-
tional preferences carry relevant seman-
tic information. Experiments using Word-
Net as a gold standard show promising re-
sults. Where applicable, our method, used
in combination with other approaches, sig-
nificantly increases the performance of en-
tailment detection. A combined approach
including our model improves the AROC
of 5% absolute points with respect to stan-
dard models.
