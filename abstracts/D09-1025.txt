Combining information extraction sys-
tems yields significantly higher quality re-
sources than each system in isolation. In
this paper, we generalize such a mixing of
sources and features in a framework called
Ensemble Semantics. We show very large
gains in entity extraction by combining
state-of-the-art distributional and pattern-
based systems with a large set of fea-
tures from a webcrawl, query logs, and
Wikipedia. Experimental results on a web-
scale extraction of actors, athletes and mu-
sicians show significantly higher mean av-
erage precision scores (29% gain) com-
pared with the current state of the art.
