 
This paper presents a computer-tool tea- 
ching system supplied by a language proce- 
ssor. Its aim is to correct mistakes in 
texts written by foreign students learning 
Russian as a second language. Since a text 
may include grammar mistakes, the system 
cannot use morphological analysis to fool 
extent. So one must compile a programm 
capable of finding and correcting mistakes 
without traditional means of analysis. 
To solve this problem we prepone a system 
that includes a vocabalary and rules of 
finding and re-writing words. So the pro- 
cess consists of finding word stems and 
than correcting word endings . Semantic 
and syntactic information("a model of ru- 
ling"/Mel'~uk 1974/~ necessary for that 
is written in the vocabulary of verbs 
as a frame. The slots of this frame con- 
tain semantic and morphological infor- 
mation about words that depend on this 
vord~. 
The vocabulary containing now approxi- 
mately 200 lexemes is enough for beginners
