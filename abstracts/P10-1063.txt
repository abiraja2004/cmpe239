The adoption of Machine Translation tech-
nology for commercial applications is
hampered by the lack of trust associated
with machine-translated output. In this pa-
per, we describe TrustRank, an MT sys-
tem enhanced with a capability to rank the
quality of translation outputs from good to
bad. This enables the user to set a quality
threshold, granting the user control over
the quality of the translations.
We quantify the gains we obtain in trans-
lation quality, and show that our solution
works on a wide variety of domains and
language pairs.
