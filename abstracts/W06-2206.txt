We present two methods for semi-
automatic detection and correction of er-
rors in textual databases. The first method
(horizontal correction) aims at correct-
ing inconsistent values within a database
record, while the second (vertical correc-
tion) focuses on values which were en-
tered in the wrong column. Both methods
are data-driven and language-independent.
We utilise supervised machine learning,
but the training data is obtained automat-
ically from the database; no manual anno-
tation is required. Our experiments show
that a significant proportion of errors can
be detected by the two methods. Further-
more, both methods were found to lead to
a precision that is high enough to make
semi-automatic error correction feasible.
