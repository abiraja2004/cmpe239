Many applications in the context of natural
language processing or information retrieval
may be largely improved if they were able to
fully exploit the rich semantic information an-
notated in high-quality, publicly available re-
sources such as the FrameNet and the Word-
Net databases. Nevertheless, the practical use
of similar resources is often biased by the
limited coverage of semantic phenomena that
they provide.
A natural solution to this problem would be to
automatically establish anchors between these
resources that would allow us 1) to jointly use
the encoded information, thus possibly over-
coming limitations of the individual corpora,
and 2) to extend each resource coverage by ex-
ploiting the information encoded in the others.
In this paper, we present a supervised learn-
ing framework for the mapping of FrameNet
lexical units onto WordNet synsets based on
a reduced set of novel and semantically rich
features. The automatically learnt mapping,
which we call MapNet, can be used 1) to ex-
tend frame sets in the English FrameNet, 2)
to populate frame sets in the Italian FrameNet
via MultiWordNet and 3) to add frame labels
to the MultiSemCor corpus. Our evaluation on
these tasks shows that the proposed approach
is viable and can result in accurate automatic
annotations.
