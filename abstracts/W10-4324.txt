We present new results from a real-user
evaluation of a data-driven approach to
learning user-adaptive referring expres-
sion generation (REG) policies for spoken
dialogue systems. Referring expressions
can be difficult to understand in techni-
cal domains where users may not know
the technical ?jargon? names of the do-
main entities. In such cases, dialogue sys-
tems must be able to model the user?s (lex-
ical) domain knowledge and use appro-
priate referring expressions. We present
a reinforcement learning (RL) framework
in which the system learns REG policies
which can adapt to unknown users on-
line. For real users of such a system, we
show that in comparison to an adaptive
hand-coded baseline policy, the learned
policy performs significantly better, with
a 20.8% average increase in adaptation ac-
curacy, 12.6% decrease in time taken, and
a 15.1% increase in task completion rate.
The learned policy also has a significantly
better subjective rating from users. This is
because the learned policies adapt online
to changing evidence about the user?s do-
main expertise. We also discuss the issue
of evaluation in simulation versus evalua-
tion with real users.
