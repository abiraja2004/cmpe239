Automatic evaluation has greatly facilitated
system development in summarization. At the
same time, the use of automatic evaluation
has been viewed with mistrust by many, as its
accuracy and correct application are not well
understood. In this paper we provide an as-
sessment of the automatic evaluations used for
multi-document summarization of news. We
outline our recommendations about how any
evaluation, manual or automatic, should be
used to find statistically significant differences
between summarization systems. We identify
the reference automatic evaluation metrics?
ROUGE 1 and 2?that appear to best emu-
late human pyramid and responsiveness scores
on four years of NIST evaluations. We then
demonstrate the accuracy of these metrics in
reproducing human judgements about the rel-
ative content quality of pairs of systems and
present an empirical assessment of the rela-
tionship between statistically significant dif-
ferences between systems according to man-
ual evaluations, and the difference according
to automatic evaluations. Finally, we present a
case study of how new metrics should be com-
pared to the reference evaluation, as we search
for even more accurate automatic measures.
