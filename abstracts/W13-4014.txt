Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) are
now recognised as an interesting alter-
native for providing learning opportuni-
ties in various domains. The Reinforce-
ment Learning (RL) approach has been
shown reliable for finding efficient teach-
ing strategies. However, similarly to other
human-machine interaction systems such
as spoken dialogue systems, ITSs suffer
from a partial knowledge of the interlocu-
tor?s intentions. In the dialogue case, en-
gineering work can infer a precise state of
the user by taking into account the uncer-
tainty provided by the spoken understand-
ing language module. A model-free ap-
proach based on RL and Echo State New-
torks (ESNs), which retrieves similar in-
formation, is proposed here for tutoring.
