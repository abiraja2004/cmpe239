The ability to detect deceptive statements in
predatory communications can help in the iden-
tification of sexual predators, a type of deception
that is recently attracting the attention of the re-
search community. Due to the intention of a pe-
dophile of hiding his/her true identity (name, age,
gender and location) its detection is a challenge.
According to previous research, fixated discourse
is one of the main characteristics inherent to the
language of online sexual predation. In this pa-
per we approach this problem by computing sex-
related lexical chains spanning over the conversa-
tion. Our study shows a considerable variation in
the length of sex-related lexical chains according
to the nature of the corpus, which supports our
belief that this could be a valuable feature in an
automated pedophile detection system.
