This paper considers the linguistic indicators of bias
in political text. We used Amazon Mechanical Turk
judgments about sentences from American political
blogs, asking annotators to indicate whether a sen-
tence showed bias, and if so, in which political di-
rection and through which word tokens. We also
asked annotators questions about their own political
views. We conducted a preliminary analysis of the
data, exploring how different groups perceive bias in
different blogs, and showing some lexical indicators
strongly associated with perceived bias.
