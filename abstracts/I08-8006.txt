 
In this paper, we present a report on the re-
search and development of speech to 
speech translation system for Asian lan-
guages, primarily on the design and im-
plementation of speech recognition and 
machine translation systems for Indonesia 
language. As part of the A-STAR project, 
each participating country will need to de-
velop each component of the full system 
for the corresponding language. We will 
specifically discuss our method on building 
speech recognition and stochastic language 
model for statistically translating Indone-
sian into other Asian languages. The sys-
tem is equipped with a capability to handle 
variation of speech input, a more natural 
mode of communication between the sys-
tem and the users.
