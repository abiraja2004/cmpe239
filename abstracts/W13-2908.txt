The task of identifying complex words
(CWs) is important for lexical simpli-
fication, however it is often carried out
with no evaluation of success. There is
no basis for comparison of current tech-
niques and, prior to this work, there
has been no standard corpus or eval-
uation technique for the CW identi-
fication task. This paper addresses
these shortcomings with a new cor-
pus for evaluating a system?s perfor-
mance in identifying CWs. Simple
Wikipedia edit histories were mined for
instances of single word lexical simpli-
fications. The corpus contains 731 sen-
tences, each with one annotated CW.
This paper describes the method used
to produce the CW corpus and presents
the results of evaluation, showing its
validity.
