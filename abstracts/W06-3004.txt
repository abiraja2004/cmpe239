This paper describes a new methodology
for enhancing the quality and relevance of
suggestions provided to users of interac-
tive Q/A systems. We show that by using
Conditional Random Fields to combine
relevance feedback gathered from users
along with information derived from dis-
course structure and coherence, we can
accurately identify irrelevant suggestions
with nearly 90% F-measure.
