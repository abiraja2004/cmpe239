 
Based on German production data from 
the ?Kiel Corpus of Spontaneous 
Speech?, we conducted two perception 
experiments, using an innovative interac-
tive task in which participants gave real 
oral responses to resynthesized question 
stimuli. Differences in the time interval 
between stimulus question and response 
show that segmental reduction, intensity 
level, and the shape of the phrase-final 
rise all function as cues to turn-taking in 
conversation. Thus, the phonetics of turn-
taking goes beyond the traditional triad 
of duration, voice quality, and F0 level.
