A key question facing the parsing commu-
nity is how to compare parsers which use
different grammar formalisms and produce
different output. Evaluating a parser on the
same resource used to create it can lead
to non-comparable accuracy scores and an
over-optimistic view of parser performance.
In this paper we evaluate a CCG parser on
DepBank, and demonstrate the difficulties
in converting the parser output into Dep-
Bank grammatical relations. In addition we
present a method for measuring the effec-
tiveness of the conversion, which provides
an upper bound on parsing accuracy. The
CCG parser obtains an F-score of 81.9%
on labelled dependencies, against an upper
bound of 84.8%. We compare the CCG
parser against the RASP parser, outperform-
ing RASP by over 5% overall and on the ma-
jority of dependency types.
