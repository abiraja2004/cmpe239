Referring expression generation has recently
been the subject of the first Shared Task Chal-
lenge in NLG. In this paper, we analyse the
systems that participated in the Challenge in
terms of their algorithmic properties, compar-
ing new techniques to classic ones, based on
results from a new human task-performance
experiment and from the intrinsic measures
that were used in the Challenge. We also con-
sider the relationship between different eval-
uation methods, showing that extrinsic task-
performance experiments and intrinsic evalu-
ation methods yield results that are not signif-
icantly correlated. We argue that this high-
lights the importance of including extrinsic
evaluation methods in comparative NLG eval-
uations.
