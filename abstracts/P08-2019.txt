In spoken dialogue systems, Partially Observ-
able Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs)
provide a formal framework for making di-
alogue management decisions under uncer-
tainty, but efficiency and interpretability con-
siderations mean that most current statistical
dialogue managers are only MDPs. These
MDP systems encode uncertainty explicitly in
a single state representation. We formalise
such MDP states in terms of distributions
over POMDP states, and propose a new di-
alogue system architecture (Mixture Model
POMDPs) which uses mixtures of these dis-
tributions to efficiently represent uncertainty.
We also provide initial evaluation results (with
real users) for this architecture.
