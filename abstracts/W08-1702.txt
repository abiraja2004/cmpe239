We present an overview of the de-
velopment environment for Regulus, an
Open Source platform for construction of
grammar-based speech-enabled systems,
focussing on recent work whose goal has
been to introduce uniformity between text
and speech views of Regulus-based appli-
cations. We argue the advantages of be-
ing able to switch quickly between text and
speech modalities in interactive and offline
testing, and describe how the new func-
tionalities enable rapid prototyping of spo-
ken dialogue systems and speech transla-
tors.
