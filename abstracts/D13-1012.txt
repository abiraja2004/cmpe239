When reviewing scientific literature, it would
be useful to have automatic tools that iden-
tify the most influential scientific articles as
well as how ideas propagate between articles.
In this context, this paper introduces topical
influence, a quantitative measure of the ex-
tent to which an article tends to spread its
topics to the articles that cite it. Given the
text of the articles and their citation graph, we
show how to learn a probabilistic model to re-
cover both the degree of topical influence of
each article and the influence relationships be-
tween articles. Experimental results on cor-
pora from two well-known computer science
conferences are used to illustrate and validate
the proposed approach.
