This paper demonstrates a novel distributed
architecture to facilitate the acquisition of
Language Resources. We build a factory
that automates the stages involved in the ac-
quisition, production, updating and mainte-
nance of these resources. The factory is de-
signed as a platform where functionalities
are deployed as web services, which can
be combined in complex acquisition chains
using workflows. We show a case study,
which acquires a Translation Memory for a
given pair of languages and a domain using
web services for crawling, sentence align-
ment and conversion to TMX.
