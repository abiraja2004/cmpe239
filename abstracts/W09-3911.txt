A distinguishing feature of dialogue is that
more that one person can contribute to the
production of an utterance. However, un-
til recently these ?split? utterances have re-
ceived relatively little attention in mod-
els of dialogue processing or of dialogue
structure. Here we report an experiment
that tests the effects of artificially intro-
duced speaker switches on groups of peo-
ple engaged in a task-oriented dialogue.
The results show that splits have reliable
effects on response time and on the num-
ber of edits involved in formulating sub-
sequent turns. In particular we show that
if the second half of an utterance is ?mis-
attributed? people take longer to respond
to it. We also show that responses to ut-
terances that are split across speakers in-
volve fewer deletes. We argue that these
effects provide evidence that: a) speaker
switches affect processing where they in-
terfere with expectations about who will
speak next and b) that the pragmatic effect
of a split is to suggest to other participants
the formation of a coalition or sub-?party?.
