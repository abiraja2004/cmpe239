Interpreting news requires identifying its con-
stituent events. Events are complex linguis-
tically and ontologically, so disambiguating
their reference is challenging. We introduce
event linking, which canonically labels an
event reference with the article where it was
first reported. This implicitly relaxes corefer-
ence to co-reporting, and will practically en-
able augmenting news archives with semantic
hyperlinks. We annotate and analyse a corpus
of 150 documents, extracting 501 links to a
news archive with reasonable inter-annotator
agreement.
