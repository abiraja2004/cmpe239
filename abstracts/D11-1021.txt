Real document collections do not fit the inde-
pendence assumptions asserted by most statis-
tical topic models, but how badly do they vi-
olate them? We present a Bayesian method
for measuring how well a topic model fits a
corpus. Our approach is based on posterior
predictive checking, a method for diagnosing
Bayesian models in user-defined ways. Our
method can identify where a topic model fits
the data, where it falls short, and in which di-
rections it might be improved.
