 
In this paper we describe automatic in-
formation nuggetization and its applica-
tion to text comparison. More 
specifically, we take a close look at how 
machine-generated nuggets can be used to 
create evaluation material. A semi-
automatic annotation scheme is designed 
to produce gold-standard data with excep-
tionally high inter-human agreement.
