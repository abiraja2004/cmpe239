The aim of this paper is to present a com-
putational model of the dynamic composition
and update of verb argument expectations us-
ing Distributional Memory, a state-of-the-art
framework for distributional semantics. The
experimental results conducted on psycholin-
guistic data sets show that the model is able
to successfully predict the changes on the pa-
tient argument thematic fit produced by differ-
ent types of verb agents.
