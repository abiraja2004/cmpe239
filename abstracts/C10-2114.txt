the Person Cross Document Coreference task. 
We show that accurate results require a way to 
adapt the parameters of the similarity function 
? metrics and threshold ? to the ontological 
constraints obeyed by individuals. The tech-
nique we propose dynamically changes the ini-
tial weights computed when the context is ana-
lyzed. The weight recomputation is necessary 
in order to resolve clusters borders, which are 
inevitably blurred by a static approach. The re-
sults show a significant gain in accuracy.
