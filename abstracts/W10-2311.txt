MuLLinG is a model for knowledge extrac-
tion  (especially  lexical  extraction  from cor-
pora), based on multilevel graphs. Its aim is 
to allow large-scale data acquisition, by mak-
ing  it  easy  to  realize  automatically,  and 
simple to configure by linguists with limited 
knowledge  in  computer  programming.  In 
MuLLinG, each new level represents the in-
formation  in  a  different  manner  (more  and 
more abstract). We also introduce several as-
sociated operators, written to be as generic as 
possible. They are independent of what nodes 
and  edges  represent,  and  of  the  task  to 
achieve.  Consequently,  they  allow  the  de-
scription of a complex extraction process as a 
succession of simple graph manipulations. Fi-
nally,  we present  an experiment of colloca-
tion extraction using MuLLinG model.
