This paper explores to what extent lemmati-
sation, lexical resources, distributional seman-
tics and paraphrases can increase the accuracy
of supervised models for dialogue manage-
ment. The results suggest that each of these
factors can help improve performance but that
the impact will vary depending on their com-
bination and on the evaluation mode.
