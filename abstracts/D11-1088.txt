In active dual supervision, not only informa-
tive examples but also features are selected for
labeling to build a high quality classifier with
low cost. However, how to measure the infor-
mativeness for both examples and feature on
the same scale has not been well solved. In
this paper, we propose a non-negative matrix
factorization based approach to address this is-
sue. We first extend the matrix factorization
framework to explicitly model the correspond-
ing relationships between feature classes and
examples classes. Then by making use of
the reconstruction error, we propose a unified
scheme to determine which feature or exam-
ple a classifier is most likely to benefit from
having labeled. Empirical results demonstrate
the effectiveness of our proposed methods.
