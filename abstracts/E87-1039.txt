 
Acquiring information systems specifications from natural 
language description is presented as a problem class that 
requires a different treatment of semantics when compared 
with other applied NL systems such as database and 
operating system interfaces. Within this problem class, the 
specific task of obtaining explicit conceptual data models 
from natural language text or dialogue is being 
investigated. The knowledge brought o bear on this task is 
classified into syntactic, semantic and systems analysis 
knowledge. Investigations with a simple syntactic parse 
and with a semantic analysis using McCorcl's Slot Grammar 
are reported, and the structure of the systems analysis 
knowledge is considered.
