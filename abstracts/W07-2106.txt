 
One of the main challenges in the applica-
tions (i.e.: text summarization, question an-
swering, information retrieval, etc.) of 
Natural Language Processing is to deter-
mine which of the several senses of a word 
is used in a given context. The problem is 
phrased as ?Word Sense Disambiguation 
(WSD)? in the NLP community. This paper 
presents the dictionary based disambigua-
tion technique that adopts the assumption 
of one sense per discourse in the context of 
SemEval-2007 Task 7: ?Coarse-grained 
English all-words?.
