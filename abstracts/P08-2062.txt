Underspecification-based algorithms for pro-
cessing partially disambiguated discourse
structure must cope with extremely high num-
bers of readings. Based on previous work on
dominance graphs and weighted tree gram-
mars, we provide the first possibility for com-
puting an underspecified discourse description
and a best discourse representation efficiently
enough to process even the longest discourses
in the RST Discourse Treebank.
