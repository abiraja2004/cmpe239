We pose the development of cognitively
plausible models of human language pro-
cessing as a challenge for computational
linguistics. Existing models can only deal
with isolated phenomena (e.g., garden
paths) on small, specifically selected data
sets. The challenge is to build models that
integrate multiple aspects of human lan-
guage processing at the syntactic, seman-
tic, and discourse level. Like human lan-
guage processing, these models should be
incremental, predictive, broad coverage,
and robust to noise. This challenge can
only be met if standardized data sets and
evaluation measures are developed.
