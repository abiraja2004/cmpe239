We analyze humorous spoken conversa-
tions from a classic comedy television
show, FRIENDS, by examining acoustic-
prosodic and linguistic features and their
utility in automatic humor recognition.
Using a simple annotation scheme, we au-
tomatically label speaker turns in our cor-
pus that are followed by laughs as hu-
morous and the rest as non-humorous.
Our humor-prosody analysis reveals sig-
nificant differences in prosodic character-
istics (such as pitch, tempo, energy etc.)
of humorous and non-humorous speech,
even when accounted for the gender and
speaker differences. Humor recognition
was carried out using standard supervised
learning classifiers, and shows promising
results significantly above the baseline.
