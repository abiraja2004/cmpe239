In this paper we present a hybrid statisti-
cal machine translation (SMT)-example-based
MT (EBMT) system that shows significant
improvement over both SMT and EBMT base-
line systems. First we present a runtime
EBMT system using a subsentential transla-
tion memory (TM). The EBMT system is fur-
ther combined with an SMT system for effec-
tive hybridization of the pair of systems. The
hybrid system shows significant improvement
in translation quality (0.82 and 2.75 abso-
lute BLEU points) for two different language
pairs (English?Turkish (En?Tr) and English?
French (En?Fr)) over the baseline SMT sys-
tem. However, the EBMT approach suffers
from significant time complexity issues for a
runtime approach. We explore two methods to
make the system scalable at runtime. First, we
use an heuristic-based approach. Secondly, we
use an IR-based indexing technique to speed
up the time-consuming matching procedure of
the EBMT system. The index-based match-
ing procedure substantially improves run-time
speed without affecting translation quality.
