We develop a pipeline consisting of var-
ious text processing tools which is de-
signed to assist political scientists in find-
ing specific, complex concepts within
large amounts of text. Our main focus is
the interaction between the political scien-
tists and the natural language processing
groups to ensure a beneficial assistance for
the political scientists and new application
challenges for NLP. It is of particular im-
portance to find a ?common language? be-
tween the different disciplines. Therefore,
we use an interactive web-interface which
is easily usable by non-experts. It inter-
faces an active learning algorithm which
is complemented by the NLP pipeline to
provide a rich feature selection. Political
scientists are thus enabled to use their own
intuitions to find custom concepts.
