Many approaches to unsupervised mor-
phology acquisition incorporate the fre-
quency of character sequences with re-
spect to each other to identify word stems
and affixes. This typically involves heuris-
tic search procedures and calibrating mul-
tiple arbitrary thresholds. We present a
simple approach that uses no thresholds
other than those involved in standard ap-
plication of ?2 significance testing. A
key part of our approach is using docu-
ment boundaries to constrain generation of
candidate stems and affixes and clustering
morphological variants of a given word
stem. We evaluate our model on English
and the Mayan language Uspanteko; it
compares favorably to two benchmark sys-
tems which use considerably more com-
plex strategies and rely more on experi-
mentally chosen threshold values.
