We propose a new model for unsupervised
POS tagging based on linguistic distinc-
tions between open and closed-class items.
Exploiting notions from current linguis-
tic theory, the system uses far less infor-
mation than previous systems, far simpler
computational methods, and far sparser
descriptions in learning contexts. By ap-
plying simple language acquisition tech-
niques based on counting, the system is
given the closed-class lexicon, acquires a
large open-class lexicon and then acquires
disambiguation rules for both. This sys-
tem achieves a 20% error reduction for
POS tagging over state-of-the-art unsuper-
vised systems tested under the same con-
ditions, and achieves comparable accuracy
when trained with much less prior infor-
mation.
