 
In this paper, we have addressed the task 
of PropBank annotation of light verb 
constructions, which like multi-word 
expressions pose special problems. To 
arrive at a solution, we have evaluated 3 
different possible methods of annotation. 
The final method involves three passes: 
(1) manual identification of a light verb 
construction, (2) annotation based on the 
light verb construction?s Frame File, and 
(3) a deterministic merging of the first 
two passes. We also discuss how in 
various languages the light verb 
constructions are identified and can be 
distinguished from the non-light verb 
word groupings.
