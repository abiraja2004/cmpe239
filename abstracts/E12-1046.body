In this paper, we extend the work on using
latent cross-language topic models for iden-
tifying word translations across compara-
ble corpora. We present a novel precision-
oriented algorithm that relies on per-topic
word distributions obtained by the bilin-
gual LDA (BiLDA) latent topic model.
The algorithm aims at harvesting only the
most probable word translations across lan-
guages in a greedy fashion, without any
prior knowledge about the language pair,
relying on a symmetrization process and
the one-to-one constraint. We report our re-
sults for Italian-English and Dutch-English
language pairs that outperform the current
state-of-the-art results by a significant mar-
gin. In addition, we show how to use the al-
gorithm for the construction of high-quality
initial seed lexicons of translations.
