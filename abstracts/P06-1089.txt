In this paper, we present a method for
guessing POS tags of unknown words us-
ing local and global information. Al-
though many existing methods use only
local information (i.e. limited window
size or intra-sentential features), global in-
formation (extra-sentential features) pro-
vides valuable clues for predicting POS
tags of unknown words. We propose a
probabilistic model for POS guessing of
unknown words using global information
as well as local information, and estimate
its parameters using Gibbs sampling. We
also attempt to apply the model to semi-
supervised learning, and conduct experi-
ments on multiple corpora.
