Analogical learning is based on a two-
step inference process: (i) computation
of a structural mapping between a new
and a memorized situation; (ii) transfer
of knowledge from the known to the un-
known situation. This approach requires
the ability to search for and exploit such
mappings, hence the need to properly de-
fine analogical relationships, and to effi-
ciently implement their computation.
In this paper, we propose a unified defini-
tion for the notion of (formal) analogical
proportion, which applies to a wide range
of algebraic structures. We show that this
definition is suitable for learning in do-
mains involving large databases of struc-
tured data, as is especially the case in Nat-
ural Language Processing (NLP). We then
present experimental results obtained on
two morphological analysis tasks which
demonstrate the flexibility and accuracy of
this approach.
