Modern statistical parsers are robust and quite
fast, but their output is relatively shallow when
compared to formal grammar parsers. We sug-
gest to extend statistical approaches to a more
deep-linguistic analysis while at the same time
keeping the speed and low complexity of a sta-
tistical parser. The resulting parsing architec-
ture suggested, implemented and evaluated here
is highly robust and hybrid on a number of
levels, combining statistical and rule-based ap-
proaches, constituency and dependency gram-
mar, shallow and deep processing, full and near-
full parsing. With its parsing speed of about
300,000 words per hour and state-of-the-art per-
formance the parser is reliable for a number of
large-scale applications discussed in the article.
