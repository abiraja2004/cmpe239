Context-based projection methods for
identifying the translation of terms in
comparable corpora has attracted a lot of
attention in the community, e.g. (Fung,
1998; Rapp, 1999). Surprisingly, none of
those works have systematically investi-
gated the impact of the many parameters
controlling their approach. The present
study aims at doing just this. As a test-
case, we address the task of translating
terms of the medical domain by exploit-
ing pages mined from Wikipedia. One in-
teresting outcome of this study is that sig-
nificant gains can be obtained by using an
association measure that is rarely used in
practice.
