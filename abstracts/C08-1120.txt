In this paper, we extend an existing para-
graph retrieval approach to why-question
answering. The starting-point is a system
that retrieves a relevant answer for 73%
of the test questions. However, in 41%
of these cases, the highest ranked relevant
answer is not ranked in the top-10. We
aim to improve the ranking by adding a re-
ranking module. For re-ranking we con-
sider 31 features pertaining to the syntactic
structure of the question and the candidate
answer. We find a significant improvement
over the baseline for both success@10 and
MRR@150. The most important features
for re-ranking are the baseline score, the
presence of cue words, the question?s main
verb, and the relation between question fo-
cus and document title.
