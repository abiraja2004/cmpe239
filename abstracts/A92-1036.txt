This paper reports on the SPOKESMAN natural anguage 
generation system, which is a domain independent text gen- 
erator designed to incrementally produce text for an underly- 
ing application program. This work is a direct outgrowth of 
the work we reported on at the last ACL Applied Conference 
in 1988, where we connected an application program directly 
to the linguistic omponent, Mumble-86. The major addi- 
tion has been a new component to the system, a text planner 
that provides the capability to compose the utterance incre- 
mentally. The central feature of the text planning com- 
ponent is a new level of representation that both captures 
more linguistic generalizations and makes the system more 
portable, so that we can easily interface to different domains 
and different kinds of application programs. This larger sys- 
tem is called "Spokesman", as it acts as the mouthpiece for 
a number of application programs.
