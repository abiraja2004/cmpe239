Key to named entity recognition, the manual
gazetteering of entity lists is a costly, error-
prone process that often yields results that
are incomplete and suffer from sampling bias.
Exploiting current sources of structured in-
formation, we propose a novel method for
extending minimal seed lists into complete
gazetteers. Like previous approaches, we
value WIKIPEDIA as a huge, well-curated, and
relatively unbiased source of entities. How-
ever, in contrast to previous work, we exploit
not only its content, but also its structure, as
exposed in DBPEDIA. We extend gazetteers
through Wikipedia categories, carefully limit-
ing the impact of noisy categorizations. The
resulting gazetteers easily outperform previ-
ous approaches on named entity recognition.
