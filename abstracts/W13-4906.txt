The SPMRL 2013 shared task was the op-
portunity to develop and test, with promising
results, a simple beam-based shift-reduce de-
pendency parser on top of the tabular logic
programming system DYALOG. The parser
was also extended to handle ambiguous word
lattices, with almost no loss w.r.t. disam-
biguated input, thanks to specific training, use
of oracle segmentation, and large beams. We
believe that this result is an interesting new
one for shift-reduce parsing.
