 
The title of this paper playfully contrasts 
two rather different approaches tolanguage 
analysis. The "Noisy Channel" 's are the 
promoters of statistically based approaches 
to language l arning. Many of these studies 
are based on the Shannons's Noisy 
Channel model. The "Braying Donkey" 's 
are those oriented towards theoretically 
motivated language models. They are 
interested in any type of language 
expressions ( uch as the famous "Donkey 
Sentences"), regardless of their frequency in
real language, because the focus is the 
study of human communication. 
In the past few years, we supported amore 
balanced approach. While our major concern 
is applicability to real NLP systems, we 
think that, after aLl, quantitative methods in 
Computational Linguistic should provide not 
only practical tools for language 
processing, but also some linguistic insight. 
Since, for sake of space, in this paper we 
cannot give any complete account of our 
research, we will present examples of 
"linguistically appealing", automatically 
acquired, lexical data (selectional restrictions 
of words) obtained trough an integrated use 
of knowledge-based and statistical 
techniques. We discuss the pros and cons of 
adding symbolic knowledge to the corpus 
linguistic recipe. 
1. The "Noisy Channel" 's 
All the researchers in the field of 
Computational Linguistics, no matter what 
their specific interest may be, must have 
noticed the impetuous advance of the 
promoter of statistically based methods in 
linguistics. This is evident not only because 
of the growing number of papers in many 
Computational Linguistic conferences and 
journals, but also because of the many 
specific initiatives, such as workshops, 
special issues, and interest groups. 
An historical account of this "empirical 
renaissance" is provide in \[Church and 
Mercer, 1993\]. The general motivations are: 
availability of large on-line texts, on one 
side, emphasis on scalability and concrete 
deliverables, on the other side. 
We agree on the claim, supported by the 
authors, that statistical methods potentially 
outperform knowledge based methods in 
terms of coverage and human cost. The 
human cost., however, is not zero. Most 
statistically based methods either ely on a 
more or less shallow level of linguistic pre- 
processing, or they need non trivial human 
intervention for an initial estimate of the 
parameters (training). This applies in 
particular to statistical methods based on 
Shannon's Noisy Channel Model (n-gram 
models). As far as coverage is concerned~ 
so far no method described in literature 
could demonstrate an adequate coverage of 
the linguistic phenomena being studied. For 
example, in collocational analysis, 
statistically refiable associations are obtained 
only for a small fragment of the corpus. The 
problem of" "low counts" (i.e. linguistic 
patterns that were never, or rarely found) 
has not been analyzed appropriately inmost 
papers, as convincingly demonstrated in
\[Dunning, 1993\]. 
In addition, there are other performance 
figures, such as adequacy, accuracy and 
"linguistic appeal" of the acquired 
knowledge for a given application, for 
which the supremacy of statistics is not 
entirely demonstrated. Our major objection 
to purely statistically based approaches i in 
fact that hey treat language xpressions like 
stings of signals. At its extreme, this 
perspective may lead to results that by no 
means have practical interest, but give no 
contribution to the study of language. 
21 
2...and the "Braying Donkey"'s 
On the other side of the barricade, there are 
the supporters of more philosophical, and 
theoretically sound, models of language. We 
hope these scholars will excuse us for 
categorising their very serious work under 
such a funny label. Our point was to 
playfully emphasise that the principal 
interest in human models of language 
communication motivated the study of rather 
odd language xpressions, like the famous 
"Donkey Sentences "1. The importance of 
these sentences i not their frequency in 
spoken, or written language (which is 
probably close to zero), but the specific 
linguistic phenomena they represent. 
The supporters of theoretically based 
approaches cannot be said to ignore the 
problem of applicability and scalability but 
this is not a priority in their research. Some 
of these studies rely on statistical analyses to 
gain evidence of some phenomenon, or to 
support empirically a theoretical framework, 
but the depth of the lexical model posited 
eventually makes a truly automatic learning 
impossible or at least difficult on a vast 
scale. 
The ensign of this approach is Pustejovsky, 
who defined a theory of lexical semantics 
making use of a rich knowledge 
representation framework, called the qualia 
structure. Words in the lexicon are proposed 
to encode all the important aspects of 
meaning, ranging from their argument 
structure, primitive decomposition, and 
conceptual organisation. The theory of 
qualia has been presented inseveral papers, 
but the reader may refer to \[Pustejovsky and 
Boguraev, 1993\], for a rather complete and 
recent account of this research. Pustejovsky 
confronted with the problem of automatic 
acquisition more extensively in \[Pustejovsky 
et al 1993\]. The experiment described, 
besides producing limited results (as 
remarked by the author itself), is hardly 
reproducible on a large scale, since it 
presupposes the identification of an 
appropriate conceptual schema that 
generalises the semantics of the word being 
studied. 
The difficulty to define sealable methods for 
lexical acquisition is an obvious drawback 
of using a rich lexical model. Admittedly, 
corpus research is seen by many authors in 
this area, as a tool to fine-tune lexical 
structures and support theoretical 
hypothesis. 
3. Adding semantics to the 
corpus statistics recipe... 
Indeed, the growing literature in lexical 
statistics demonstrates that much can be 
done using purely statistical methods. This 
is appealing, since the need for heavy 
human intervention precluded to NLP 
techniques a ubstantial impact on real world 
applications. However, we should not 
forget hat one of the ultimate objectives o f  
Computational Linguistic is to acquire some 
deeper insight of human communication. 
Knowledge-based, or syraboHc, techniques 
should not be banished as impractical, since 
no computational system can ever learn 
anything interesting if it does not embed 
some, though primitive, semantic model 2. 
In the last few years, we promoted a more 
integrated use of statistically and knowledge 
based models in language l arning. Though 
our major concern is applicability and 
scalability in NLP systems, we do not 
believe that the human can be entirely kept 
out of the loop. However, his/her 
contribution i defining the semantic bias of 
a lexical earning system should ideally be 
reduced to a limited amount of time 
constrained, well understood, actions, to be 
performed by easily founded professionals. 
Similar constraints are commonly accepted 
when customising Information Retrieval and 
Database systems. 
Since we are very much concerned with 
sealability asia\[ with what we call linguistic 
appeal, our effort has been to demonstrate 
that "some" semantic knowledge can be 
modelled at the price of limited human 
intervention, resulting in a higher 
informative power of the linguistic data 
extracted from corpora. With purely 
statistical pproaches, the aequked lexical 
information has no finguisfic ontent per se 
until a human analyst assigns the correct 
interpretation to the data. Semantic 
modelling can be more or less coarse, but in 
any case it provides a means to categorise 
lwhere the poor donkey brays since it is beated all 
the time.. 
2this is often referred to as the semantic bias in 
Machine Learning 
22 
language phenomena r ther that sinking the 
linguist in milfions of data (collocations, n- 
grams, or the like), and it supports a more 
finguistically oriented large scale language 
analysis. Finally, symbolic computation, 
unlike for statistical computation, adds 
predictive value to the data, and ensures 
statistically reliable data even for relatively 
small corpora. 
Since in the past 3-4 years all our research 
was centred on finding a better balance 
between shallow (statistically based) and 
deep (knowledge based) methods for lexical 
learning, we cannot give for sake of brevity 
any complete account of the methods and 
algorithms that we propose. The interest 
reader is referred to \[Basili et al 1993 b and 
c\], for a summary of ARIOSTO, an 
integrated tool for extensive acquisition of 
lexieal knowledge from corpora that we 
used to demonstrate and validate our 
approach. 
The learning algorithms that we def'med, 
acquire some useful type of lexical 
knowledge (disambiguation cues, selectional 
restrictions, word categories) through the 
statistical processing of syntactically and 
semantically tagged collocations. The 
statistical methods are based on 
distributional analysis (we defined a 
measure called mutual conditioned 
plausibility, a derivation of the well known 
mutual information), and cluster analysis (a 
COBWEB-l ike algorithm for word 
classification is presented in \[Basili et al 
1993,a\]). The knowledge based methods 
are morphosyntactic processing \[Basili et al 
1992b\] and some shallow level of semantic 
categorisation. 
Since the use of syntactic processing in 
combination with probability calculus is 
rather well established in corpus linguistics, 
we will not discuss here the particular 
methods, and measures, that we defined. 
Rather, we will concentrate on semantic 
categorisation, since this aspect more closely 
relates to the focus of this workshop: What 
knowledge can be represented symbolically 
and how can it be obtained on a large scale ? 
The title of the workshop, Combing 
symbolic and statistical approaches.., 
presupposes that, indeed, one such 
combination is desirable, and this was not 
so evident in the literature so far. 
However, the what-and-how issue raised 
by the workshop organisers i a crucial one. 
It seems there is no way around: the more 
semantics, the less coverage. Is that so true? 
We think that in part, it is, but not 
completely. For example, categorizing 
collocations via semantic tagging, as we 
propose, add predictive power to the 
collected collocadons, ince it is possible to 
forecast the probability of collocations that 
have not been detected in the training 
corpus. Hence the coverage is, generally 
speaking, higher. 
In the next section we will discuss the 
problem of finding the best source for 
semantic ategorization. There are many 
open issues here, that we believe an 
intersting matter of discussion for the 
workshop. 
In the last section we (briefly) present an 
example of very useful type of lexical 
knowledge that can be extracted by the use 
of semantic ategorization i combination 
with statistical methods. 
4. Sources of semant ic  
categorization 
We first presented the idea of adding 
semantic tags in corpus analysis in \[B'asili et 
al. 1991 and 1992a\], but other 
contemporaneous and subsequent papers 
introduced some notion of semantic 
categorisation in corpus analysis. \[Boggess 
et al 1991\] used rather fine-tuned 
seleetional restrictions to classify word pairs 
and triples detected by an n-gram model 
based part of speech tagger. \[Grishman 
1992\] generalises automatically acquired 
word triples using a manually prepared full 
word taxonomy. More recently, the idea of 
using some kind of semantics seems to gain 
a wider popularity. \[Resnik and Hearst, 
1993\] use Wordnet categories to tag 
syntactic associations detected by a shallow 
parser. \[Utsuro et al, 1993\] categorise 
words using the "Bunrui Goi Hyou" 
(Japanese) thesaurus. 
In ARIOSTO, we initially used hand 
assigned semantic ategories for two italian 
corpora, since on-line thesaura are 
notcurrently available in Italian. For an 
English corpus, we later used Wordnet. 
We mark with semantic tags all the words 
that are included at least in one collocation 
extracted from each application corpus. 
In defining semantic tags, we pursued two 
contrasting requirements: portability and 
reduced manual cost, on one side, and the 
value-added to the data by the semantic 
23 
markers, on the other side. The compromise 
we conformed to is to select about 10-15 
"naive" tags, that mediate at best between 
generality and domain-appropriateness. 
Hand tagging was performed on a 
commercial and a legal domain (hereafter 
CD and LD), both in Italian. Examples of 
tags in the CD are: MACHINE (grindstone, 
tractor, engine), BY_PRODUCT (wine, 
milk, juice). In the LD, examples are: 
DOCUMENT (law, comma, invoice)and 
REALESTATE (field, building, house). 
There are categories incommon between the 
two domains, such as HUMAI~ENTITY, 
PLACE, etc. The appropriate level of 
generality for categories, is roughly selected 
according to the criterion that words in a 
domain should be evenly distributed among 
categories. For example, BY_PRODUCT 
is not at the same level as HUMAN EN1TY 
in a domain general classification, but in the 
CD there is a very large number of words in 
this class. 
For what concerns ambiguous words, 
many subtle ambiguities are eliminated 
because of the generality of the tags. Since 
all verbs are either ACTs or STATEs, one 
has no choices in classifying an ambiguous 
verb like make. This is obviously a 
simplification, and we will see later its 
consequences. On the other side, many 
ambiguous senses of make are not found in 
a given domain. For example, in the 
commercial domain, make essentially is 
used in the sense of manufacturing. 
Despite the generality of the tags used, we 
experiment that, while the categorisation f
animates and concrete ntities is relatively 
simple, words that do not relate with bodily 
experience, such as abstract entities and the 
majority of verbs, pose hard problems. 
An alternative to manual classification is 
using on-line thesaura, such as Roget's and 
Wordnet categories in English 3. We 
experimented Wordnet on our English 
domain (remote sensing abstracts, RSD). 
The use of domain-general categories, uch 
as those found in thesaura, has its evident 
drawbacks, namely that the categorisation 
principles used by the linguists are inspired 
by philosophical concerns and personal 
intuitions, while the purpose of a type 
hierarchy in a NLP system is more practical, 
for example xpressing at the highest level 
3There is an on-going European initiative to 
translate Wordnet in other languages, among whiela 
Iuflian 
of generality the selectional constrains of 
words in a given domain. For one such 
practical objective, asuitable categorization 
pnnciple is similarity in words usage. 
Though Wordnet categories rely also on a 
study of collocations in corpora (the Brown 
corpus), word similarity in contexts is only 
one of the classification pdncipia adopted, 
surely not prevailing. For example, the 
words resource, archive and file are used in 
the RSD almost interchangeably (e.g. 
access, use, read .from resource, archive, 
file). However, resource and archive have 
no common supertyp? in Wordnet. 
Another pro.blem is over-ambiguity. Given 
a specific application, Wordnet tags create 
many unnecessary ambiguity. For example, 
we were rather surprised to find the word 
high classified as a PERSON (--soprano) 
and as an ORGANIZATION (=high 
school). "this wide-speetnma classification is
very useful on a purely linguistic ground, 
but renders the classification unusable as it 
is, for most practical applications. In the 
RSD, we had 5311 different words of 
which 2796 are not classified in Wordnet 
because they are technical terms, proper 
nouns and labels. For the "known" words, 
the avergae ambiguity in Wordnet is 4.76 
senses per word. In order to reduce part of 
the ambiguity, we (manually) selected 14 
high-level Wordnet nodes, like for example: 
COGNIT ION,  ART IFACT,  
ABSTRACTION, PROPERTY, PERSON, 
that seemed appropriate for the domain. This 
reduced the average ambiguity to 1.67, 
which is still a bit too high (soprano ?), i.e. 
it does not reflect the ambiguity actually 
present in the domain. There is clearly the 
need of using some context-driven 
disambiguafion method to automatically 
reduce the ambiguity of Wordnet ags. For 
example, we are currently experimenting an 
algorithm to automatically select from 
Wordnet the "best level" categories for a 
given corpus, and eliminate part of the 
unwanted ambiguity. The algorithm is based 
on the Machine Learning method for word 
categorisation, i spired by the well known 
study on basic-level categories \[Rosch, 
1978\], presented in \[Basili et al 1993a\]. 
Other methods that seem applicable to the 
problem at hand have been presented in the 
literature \[Yarowsky 1992\].

5. Producing wine, statements, 
and data: on the acquisition of 
selectionai restrictions in sub 
languages 
Since our objective is to show that adding 
semantics to the standard corpus linguistics 
recipe (collocations +statistics) renders the 
acquired ata more linguistically appealing, 
this section is devoted to the linguistic 
analysis of a case-based lexicon. The 
algorithm to acquire the lexicon, 
implemented in the ARIOSTQLEX system, 
has been extensively described in \[Basili et 
al, 1993c\]. In short, the algorithms works 
as follows: 
First, collocations extracted from the 
application corpus are clustered according to 
the semantic and syntactic tag 4 of one or 
both the co-occurring content words. The 
result are what we call clustered association 
d a t a . For  example ,  
V_prep_N(sell ,  to,shareholder) and 
V_prep_N(assign, totax-payer), occurring 
with frequency f /and.t2 respectively, are 
merged into a unique association 
V_prep_N(ACT, to, HUMAN ENTITY) 
with frequency fl+f2. The statistically 
relevant conceptual associations are 
presented to a linguist, that can replace 
syntactic patterns with the underlying 
conceptual relation (e.g. \[ACT\]- 
>(beneficiary)->\[HUMAl~ENTITY\]). 
These coarse grained selectional restrictions 
are later used in AIOSTO LEX for a more 
refined lexical acquisition phase. We have 
shown in \[Basili et al 1992a\] that in sub 
languages there are many unintuitive ways 
of relating concepts to each other, that 
would have been very hard to find without 
the help of an automatic procedure. 
Then, for each content word w, we acquire 
all the collocations in which it participates. 
We select among ambiguous patterns using 
a preference method escribed in \[Basili et 
al, 1993 b, d\]. The detected collocations for 
a word w are then generalised using the 
coarse grained selectional restrictions 
4We did not discuss of syntactic tags for brevity. 
Our (not-so) shallow parser detects productive pairs 
and triples like verb subject and direct object (N_V 
and V N, respectively), prepositional triples 
between non adjacent words (N_prep_N, V_lxeP_~, 
etc. 
acquired during the previous phase. For 
example, the following collocations 
including the word measurement in the 
RSD: 
V prep_N(deriveJrom, easurement), 
V prep_N(determineJrom, measurement) 
and V_prep_N( infer, from, measurement) 
let the ARIOSTO_LEX system learn the 
following selectional restriction: 
\[COGNrNONI 
<-(/igurative_source)<-\[measurement\], 
where COGNITION is a Wordnet category 
for the verbs determine, infer and derive, 
and f igurative_source is one of the 
conceptual relations used. Notice that the 
use of conceptual relations is not strictly 
necessary, though it adds semantic value to 
the data. One could simply store the 
syntactic subeategorization f each word 
along with lhe semantic restriction on the 
accompanying word in a collocation, e.g. 
something like: measurement. (V_prep_N 
.from, COGNITION(V)). It is also possible 
to cluster, for each verb or verbal noun, all 
the syntactic subcategorization frames for 
which there is an evidence in the corpus. In 
this case, lexieal acquisition is entirely 
automatic. 
The selectional restrictions extensively 
acquired by ARIOSTQLEX are a useful 
type of lexical knowledge that could be used 
virtually in any NLP system. Importantly, 
the linguistic material acquired is 
linguistically appealing since it provides 
evidence for a systematic study of sub 
languages. From a cross analysis of words 
usage in three different domains we gained 
evidence that many linguistic patterns do not 
generalise across ub languages. Hence, the 
application corpus is an ideal source for 
lexical acqu~ition. 
25 
In fig. 1 we show one of the screen out of 
ARIOSTO_LEX. The word shown is 
measurement, very frequent in the RSD, as 
presented to the linguist. Three windows 
show, respectively, the lexical entry that 
ARIOSTQLEX proposes to acquire, a list 
of accepted patterns for which only one 
example was found (lexical patterns are 
generalized only when at least two similar 
patterns are found), and a list of rejected 
patterns. The linguist can modify or accept 
any of these choices. Each acquire d 
selectional restriction is represented as 
follows: 
pre semJex(word, conceptual relation, 
semantic tag 5, direction, SE, CF) 
the first four arguments identify the 
selectional restriction and the direction of the 
conceptual relation, Le.: 
\[measurement\]<-(OBJ)<-\[COGNITION\] 
(e.g. calculate, setup, compare...a 
measurement) 
\[measurement\] ->(INSTRUMENT)-> 
\[ NSTRUM NTAL1TY\] 
(e.g. measurement from satellite, aircraft, 
radar) 
SE and CF are two statistical measures of 
the semantic expectation and confidence of 
the acquired selectional restriction (see the 
aforementioned papers for details). 
ARIOSTO_LEX provides the linguist with 
several facilities to inspect and validate the 
acquired lexicon, such as examples of 
phrases from which a selectional restriction 
was derived, and other nice gadgets. For 
example, the central window in Figure 1 
(opened only on demand) shows the 
Conceptual Graph of the acquired entry. 
The Conceptual Graph includes the extended 
Wordnet labels for each category. 
One very interesting matter for linguistic 
analysis is provided by a cross-comparison 
of words, as used in the three domains. 
Many words, particularly verbs, exhibit 
completely different patterns of usage. Here 
are some examples: 
The verb produrre (to produce) is relatively 
frequent in all the three domains, but exhibit 
very different selectional restrictions. In the 
RSD (Remote Sensing) we found the 
pattem: 
produce 
->(agent)->\[ORGANIZATION, 
PERSON\] 
->(source)->\[INSTRUMENTALITY\] 
or : 
5 Labels of Wordnet classes are sometimes denoted 
by abbreviations, e.g. CGN = 'cognition, 
knowledge'. 
26 
produce 
->(theme)-> COGNITIVE_CONTENT 
->(source)->INSTRUMENTALITY 
e.g. the satellite produced an image with 
high accuracy, the NASA produced the 
data.. 
in the CD (commercial) we found: 
produce 
->(obj)-> ARTIFACT 
->(agent)-> HUMAN_ENTITY 
->(instruraent)->MACHINE 6 
e.g.: la d/tta produce vino con macchinari 
propri (*the company produces wine with 
owned machinery) 
and in the LD (legal): 
produce 
->agent)->HUMAI~ENTITY 
->(theme)-> DOCUMENT 
e.g.: il contn'buente d ve produrre la 
dichiarazione (the tax payer must produce a
statement) 
It is interesting to see which company the 
word "ground" keeps in the three domains. 
The RSD is mostly concerned with its 
physical properties, ince we find patterns 
like: 
measure 
->(obj)-> PROPERTY/A'ITR/BUTE 
<-(characteristic)<- ground 
(e.g. to measure the feature, emissivity, 
image ,surface of ground) 
In the CD, terreno (=ground) is the direct 
object of physical ACTs such as cultivate, 
reclaim, plough, etc. But is also found in 
patterns like: 
BYPRODUCT ->(source)-> terreno 
(e.g. patate, carote ed altn'prodotti del 
terreno = potatoes, carrots and other ground 
products) 
in the LD, terreno is a real estate, object of 
transactions, and taxable as such. The 
generaJised pattern is: 
6MACHINE is the same as the Wordnet class 
INSTRUMENTALITY. Notice that we used 
Wordnet categories for our English corpus only later 
in our research. Perhaps we could fmd a Wordnet 
tag name for each of our previous manually assigned 
tags in the two Italian domains, but this would be 
only useful for presentation purposes. In fact, since 
there is not as yet an Italian version of Wordnet 
(though it will be available soon), we cannot 
classify automaO~lly. 
TRANSACTION->(obj)-> terreno 
(vendere, acquistare, permutare terreno = 
sell, buy, exchange aground) 
AMOUNT <-(source)<- terreno 
(e.g. costo, rendita, di terreno= price, 
revenue of ( =deriving from the ownership 
o~ ground) 
And what is managed in the three domains? 
In the RSD,  one manages 
COGNIT IVECONTENT,  such as image, 
information, data etc. The manager is a 
human ORGANIZATION, but also an 
ARTIFACT (a system, an archive). 
In the CD, the pattern is: 
manage ->(agent)->HUMAb~ENTITY 
or 
->(theme)->ACT 
->(location)-> BUILDING 
manage ->(agent)->HUMAI',~ENTITy 
->(obj)->BUILDING 
(e.g. gestire la vendita di alimentari nel 
negozio.. = to manage the sale of food in 
shops ) 
Finally, in the LD, the pattern is: 
manage 
->(agent)->HUMAN_ENTITY 
->(obj)->\[AMOUNT,ABSTRACTION\] 
(e.g. gestione di tributi, fondi, credito, 
debito etc. = management oftaxes, funding, 
credit, debit)

It is interesting to see how little in common 
these patterns have. Clearly, this 
information could not he derived from 
dictionaries or thesaura. Though the 
categories used to cluster patterns of use are 
very high level (especially for verbs), still 
they capture very well the specific 
phenomena of each sublanguage. 
6. Conc lud ing  remarks  
In this paper we supported the idea that 
"some amount" of symbofic knowledge 
(high-level semantic markers) can be added 
to the standard lexical statistics recipe with 
several advantages, among which 
categorization, predictive power, and 
linguitic appeal of the acquired knowledge. 
For sake of space, we could not provide all 
the evidence (algorithms, data and 
performance evaluation) to support our 
arguments. We briefly discussed, and gave 
examples, of our system for the semi- 
automatic acquisition, on a large scale, of 
selectionl restrictions. ARIOSTO_LEX has 
its merits and limitations. The merit is that it 
acquires extensively, with limited manual 
cost, a very useful type of semantic 
knowledge, usable virtually in any NLP 
system. We demonstrated with several 
examples that selectional restrictions do not 
generalize across sublanguages, and 
acquiring them by hand is often inintuitive 
and very time-consuming. 
The limitation is that the choice of the 
appropriate conceptual types is non trivial, 
even when selecting very high-level tags. 
On the other hand, selecting categories from 
on-line thesaura poses many problems, 
particularly because the categorization 
principia adopted, may not be adequate for 
the practical purposes of a NLP system.
