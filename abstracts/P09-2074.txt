Most approaches to topic modeling as-
sume an independence between docu-
ments that is frequently violated. We
present an topic model that makes use
of one or more user-specified graphs de-
scribing relationships between documents.
These graph are encoded in the form of a
Markov random field over topics and serve
to encourage related documents to have
similar topic structures. Experiments on
show upwards of a 10% improvement in
modeling performance.
