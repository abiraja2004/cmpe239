In this paper I shall present a treatment of
lexical and grammatical tone and vowel
length in Hausa, as implemented in an
emerging bidirectional HPSG of the lan-
guage based on the Lingo Grammar Ma-
trix (Bender et al, 2002). I shall argue
in particular that a systematic treatment
of suprasegmental phonology is indispen-
sible in an implemented grammar of the
language, both for theoretical and practical
reasons. I shall propose an LKB represen-
tation that is strongly inspired by linguistic
and computational work on Autosegmental
Phonology. Finally, I shall show that the
specific implementation presented here is
flexible enough to accommodate different
levels of suprasegmental information in the
input.
