We show that the standard beam-search al-
gorithm can be used as an efficient decoder
for the global linear model of Zhang and
Clark (2008) for joint word segmentation and
POS-tagging, achieving a significant speed im-
provement. Such decoding is enabled by:
(1) separating full word features from par-
tial word features so that feature templates
can be instantiated incrementally, according to
whether the current character is separated or
appended; (2) deciding the POS-tag of a poten-
tial word when its first character is processed.
Early-update is used with perceptron training
so that the linear model gives a high score to a
correct partial candidate as well as a full out-
put. Effective scoring of partial structures al-
lows the decoder to give high accuracy with a
small beam-size of 16. In our 10-fold cross-
validation experiments with the Chinese Tree-
bank, our system performed over 10 times as
fast as Zhang and Clark (2008) with little ac-
curacy loss. The accuracy of our system on
the standard CTB 5 test was competitive with
the best in the literature.
