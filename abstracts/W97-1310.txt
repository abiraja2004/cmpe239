 
A variety of approaches to annotating 
reference in corpora have been 
adopted. This paper reviews four 
approaches to the annotation of 
reference in corpora. Following this 
we present a variety of results from 
one annotated corpus, the UCREL 
anaphoric treebank, relevant to 
automated reference resolution.
