Automatically constructed Knowledge Bases
(KBs) are often incomplete and there is a gen-
uine need to improve their coverage. Path
Ranking Algorithm (PRA) is a recently pro-
posed method which aims to improve KB cov-
erage by performing inference directly over
the KB graph. For the first time, we demon-
strate that addition of edges labeled with la-
tent features mined from a large dependency
parsed corpus of 500 million Web documents
can significantly outperform previous PRA-
based approaches on the KB inference task.
We present extensive experimental results val-
idating this finding. The resources presented
in this paper are publicly available.
