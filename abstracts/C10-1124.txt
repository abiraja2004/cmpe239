A distributed system is described that re-
liably mines parallel text from large cor-
pora. The approach can be regarded
as cross-language near-duplicate detec-
tion, enabled by an initial, low-quality
batch translation. In contrast to other ap-
proaches which require specialized meta-
data, the system uses only the textual con-
tent of the documents. Results are pre-
sented for a corpus of over two billion web
pages and for a large collection of digi-
tized public-domain books.
