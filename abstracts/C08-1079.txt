Much effort in the research community has
been spent on solving the anaphora resolu-
tion or pronoun resolution problem, and in
particular for news texts. In order to selec-
tively inherit the previous works and solve
the same problem for a new domain, we
carried out a comparative study with three
different corpora: MUC, ACE for the news
texts, and GENIA for bio-medical papers.
Our corpus analysis and experimental re-
sults show the significant differences in the
use of pronouns in the two domains, thus
by properly considering the characteristics
of a domain, we can improve the perfor-
mance of pronoun resolution for that do-
main.
