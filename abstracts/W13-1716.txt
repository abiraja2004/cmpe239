Our submission for this NLI shared task used
for the most part standard features found in re-
cent work. Our focus was instead on two other
aspects of our system: at a high level, on pos-
sible ways of constructing ensembles of multi-
ple classifiers; and at a low level, on the gran-
ularity of part-of-speech tags used as features.
We found that the choice of ensemble com-
bination method did not lead to much differ-
ence in results, although exploiting the vary-
ing behaviours of linear versus logistic regres-
sion SVM classifiers could be promising in fu-
ture work; but part-of-speech tagsets showed
noticeable differences.
We also note that the overall architecture, with
its feature set and ensemble approach, had an
accuracy of 83.1% on the test set when trained
on both the training data and development data
supplied, close to the best result of the task.
This suggests that basically throwing together
all the features of previous work will achieve
roughly the state of the art.
