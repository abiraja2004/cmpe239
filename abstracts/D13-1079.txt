The rise of ?Big Data? analytics over unstruc-
tured text has led to renewed interest in infor-
mation extraction (IE). We surveyed the land-
scape of IE technologies and identified a major
disconnect between industry and academia:
while rule-based IE dominates the commercial
world, it is widely regarded as dead-end tech-
nology by the academia. We believe the dis-
connect stems from the way in which the two
communities measure the benefits and costs of
IE, as well as academia?s perception that rule-
based IE is devoid of research challenges. We
make a case for the importance of rule-based
IE to industry practitioners. We then lay out a
research agenda in advancing the state-of-the-
art in rule-based IE systems which we believe
has the potential to bridge the gap between
academic research and industry practice.
