Automatic summaries of text generated through
sentence or word extraction has been evaluated by
comparing them with manual summaries generated
by humans by using numerical evaluation measures
based on precision or accuracy. Although sentence
extraction has previously been evaluated based only
on precision of a single sentence, sentence concate-
nations in the summaries should be evaluated as
well. We have evaluated the appropriateness of sen-
tence concatenations in summaries by using eval-
uation measures used for evaluating word concate-
nations in summaries through word extraction. We
determined that measures considering sentence con-
catenation much better reflect the human judgment
rather than those based only on the precision of a
single sentence.
