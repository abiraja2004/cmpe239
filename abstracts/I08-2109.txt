Grammar-driven convolution tree kernel
(GTK) has shown promising results for se-
mantic role labeling (SRL). However, the
time complexity of computing the GTK is
exponential in theory. In order to speed
up the computing process, we design two
fast grammar-driven convolution tree kernel
(FGTK) algorithms, which can compute the
GTK in polynomial time. Experimental re-
sults on the CoNLL-2005 SRL data show
that our two FGTK algorithms are much
faster than the GTK.
