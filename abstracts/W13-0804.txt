In this paper, we empirically investigate the
impact of critical configuration parameters in
the popular cube pruning algorithm for decod-
ing in hierarchical statistical machine transla-
tion. Specifically, we study how the choice
of the k-best generation size affects trans-
lation quality and resource requirements in
hierarchical search. We furthermore exam-
ine the influence of two different granular-
ities of hypothesis recombination. Our ex-
periments are conducted on the large-scale
Chinese?English and Arabic?English NIST
translation tasks. Besides standard hierarchi-
cal grammars, we also explore search with re-
stricted recursion depth of hierarchical rules
based on shallow-1 grammars.
