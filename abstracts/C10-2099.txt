 
The goal of this work is to produce a 
classifier that can distinguish subjective 
sentences from objective sentences for 
the Urdu language. The amount of la-
beled data required for training automatic 
classifiers can be highly imbalanced es-
pecially in the multilingual paradigm as 
generating annotations is an expensive 
task. In this work, we propose a co-
training approach for subjectivity analy-
sis in the Urdu language that augments 
the positive set (subjective set) and gene-
rates a negative set (objective set) devoid 
of all samples close to the positive ones. 
Using the data set thus generated for 
training, we conduct experiments based 
on SVM and VSM algorithms, and show 
that our modified VSM based approach 
works remarkably well as a sentence lev-
el subjectivity classifier.
