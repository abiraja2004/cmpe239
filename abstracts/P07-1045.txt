Non-verbal modalities such as gesture can
improve processing of spontaneous spoken
language. For example, similar hand ges-
tures tend to predict semantic similarity, so
features that quantify gestural similarity can
improve semantic tasks such as coreference
resolution. However, not all hand move-
ments are informative gestures; psycholog-
ical research has shown that speakers are
more likely to gesture meaningfully when
their speech is ambiguous. Ideally, one
would attend to gesture only in such cir-
cumstances, and ignore other hand move-
ments. We present conditional modality
fusion, which formalizes this intuition by
treating the informativeness of gesture as a
hidden variable to be learned jointly with
the class label. Applied to coreference
resolution, conditional modality fusion sig-
nificantly outperforms both early and late
modality fusion, which are current tech-
niques for modality combination.
