This paper describes experiments in using
machine learning for relation disambiguation.
There have been succesfuld experiments in
combining machine learning and ontologies,
or light-weight ontologies such as WordNet,
for word sense disambiguation. However,
what we are trying to do, is to disambiguate
complex concepts consisting of two simpler
concepts and the relation that holds between
them. The motivation behind the approach is
to expand existing methods for content based
information retrieval. The experiments have
been performed using an annotated extract of
a corpus, consisting of prepositions surroun-
ded by noun phrases, where the prepositions
denote the relation we are trying disambigu-
ate. The results show an unexploited opportu-
nity of including prepositions and the relations
they denote, e.g. in content based information
retrieval.
