Although recent named entity (NE) annotation ef-
forts involve the markup of nested entities, there has
been limited focus on recognising such nested struc-
tures. This paper introduces and compares three
techniques for modelling and recognising nested
entities by means of a conventional sequence tag-
ger. The methods are tested and evaluated on two
biomedical data sets that contain entity nesting. All
methods yield an improvement over the baseline tag-
ger that is only trained on flat annotation.
