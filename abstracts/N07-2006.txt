 
We describe a new pruning approach to 
remove phrase pairs from translation mod-
els of statistical machine translation sys-
tems. The approach applies the original 
translation system to a large amount of text 
and calculates usage statistics for the 
phrase pairs. Using these statistics the rele-
vance of each phrase pair can be estimated. 
The approach is tested against a strong 
baseline based on previous work and shows 
significant improvements.
