We propose an efficient dialogue manage-
ment for an information navigation sys-
tem based on a document knowledge base
with a spoken dialogue interface. In order
to perform robustly for fragmental speech
input and erroneous output of an auto-
matic speech recognition (ASR), the sys-
tem should selectively use N-best hypothe-
ses of ASR and contextual information.
The system also has several choices in gen-
erating responses or confirmations. In this
work, we formulate the optimization of
the choices based on a unified criterion:
Bayes risk, which is defined based on re-
ward for correct information presentation
and penalty for redundant turns. We have
evaluated this strategy with a spoken di-
alogue system which also has question-
answering capability. Effectiveness of the
proposed framework was confirmed in the
success rate of retrieval and the average
number of turns.
