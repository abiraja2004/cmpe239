 
This paper describes a statistics-based Chinese parser, which parses the Chinese sentences with 
correct segmentation a d POS tagging information through the following processing stages: 1) to predict 
constituent boundaries, 2) to match open and close brackets and produce syntactic trees, 3) to 
disambiguate and choose the best parse tree. Evaluating the parser against a smaller Chinese treebank 
with 5573 sentences, it shows the following encouraging results: 86% precision, 86% recall, 1.1 crossing 
brackets per sentence and 95% labeled precision.
