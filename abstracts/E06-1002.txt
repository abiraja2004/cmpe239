We present a new method for detecting and
disambiguating named entities in open do-
main text. A disambiguation SVM kernel
is trained to exploit the high coverage and
rich structure of the knowledge encoded
in an online encyclopedia. The resulting
model significantly outperforms a less in-
formed baseline.
