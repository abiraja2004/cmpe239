We describe a classifier which determines the
rhetorical status of sentences in texts from a corpus
of judgments of the UK House of Lords. Our sum-
marisation system is based on the work of Teufel
and Moens where sentences are classified for rhetor-
ical status to aid sentence selection. We experi-
ment with a variety of linguistic features with results
comparable to Teufel and Moens, thereby demon-
strating the feasibility of porting this kind of system
to a new domain.
