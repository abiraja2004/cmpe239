 
The paper investigates the problem of 
representing coordination constructs in a 
formal system for the dependency approach to
syntax. The distinctive aspect of the formalism 
is the presence of non-lexical (trace - ~) nodes 
in the representation. We illustrate the basic 
mechanisms, and how they can account for 
syntactic phenomena i volving long-distance 
dependencies. Then, we see how the same 
mechanism can account for the gaps and 
ellipses of coordination constructs.
