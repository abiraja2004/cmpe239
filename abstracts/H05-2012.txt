Abstract
This work demonstrates the ProMED-
PLUS Epidemiological Fact Base. The
facts are automatically extracted from
plain-text reports about outbreaks of in-
fectious epidemics around the world. The
system collects new reports, extracts new
facts, and updates the database, in real
time. The extracted database is available
on-line through a Web server.
