 
We have proposed a method of ma- 
chine translation, which acquires trans- 
lation rules from translation examples 
using inductive learning, and have eval- 
uated the method. And we have con- 
firmed that the method requires many 
translation examples. To resolve this 
problem, we applied genetic algorithms 
to the method. In this paper, we de- 
scribe our method with genetic algo- 
rithms and evaluated it by some experi- 
ments. We confirmed that the accuracy 
rate of translation increased from 52.8% 
to 61.9% by applying genetic algorithms.
