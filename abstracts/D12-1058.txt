This paper presents a paraphrase acquisition
method that uncovers and exploits generali-
ties underlying paraphrases: paraphrase pat-
terns are first induced and then used to col-
lect novel instances. Unlike existing methods,
ours uses both bilingual parallel and monolin-
gual corpora. While the former are regarded as
a source of high-quality seed paraphrases, the
latter are searched for paraphrases that match
patterns learned from the seed paraphrases.
We show how one can use monolingual cor-
pora, which are far more numerous and larger
than bilingual corpora, to obtain paraphrases
that rival in quality those derived directly from
bilingual corpora. In our experiments, the
number of paraphrase pairs obtained in this
way from monolingual corpora was a large
multiple of the number of seed paraphrases.
Human evaluation through a paraphrase sub-
stitution test demonstrated that the newly ac-
quired paraphrase pairs are of reasonable qual-
ity. Remaining noise can be further reduced
by filtering seed paraphrases.
