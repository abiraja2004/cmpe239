Recent years have witnessed a growing in-
terest in analogical learning for NLP ap-
plications. If the principle of analogical
learning is quite simple, it does involve
complex steps that seriously limit its ap-
plicability, the most computationally de-
manding one being the identification of
analogies in the input space. In this study,
we investigate different strategies for ef-
ficiently solving this problem and study
their scalability.
