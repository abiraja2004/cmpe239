I present a method of identifying cognates in the vo-
cabularies of related languages. I show that a mea-
sure of phonetic similarity based on multivalued fea-
tures performs better than ?orthographic? measures,
such as the Longest Common Subsequence Ratio
(LCSR) or Dice?s coefficient. I introduce a proce-
dure for estimating semantic similarity of glosses
that employs keyword selection and WordNet. Tests
performed on vocabularies of four Algonquian lan-
guages indicate that the method is capable of discov-
ering on average nearly 75% percent of cognates at
50% precision.
