 
In this paper we present a new approach to 
controlling the behaviour of a natural lan-
guage generation system by correlating in-
ternal decisions taken during free generation 
of a wide range of texts with the surface sty-
listic characteristics of the resulting outputs, 
and using the correlation to control the gen-
erator. This contrasts with the generate-and-
test architecture adopted by most previous 
empirically-based generation approaches, 
offering a more efficient, generic and holis-
tic method of generator control. We illus-
trate the approach by describing a system in 
which stylistic variation (in the sense of 
Biber (1988)) can be effectively controlled 
during the generation of short medical in-
formation texts.
