In this paper we sketch the design, motivation
and use of the GeM annotation scheme: an
XML-based annotation framework for prepar-
ing corpora involving documents with complex
layout of text, graphics, diagrams, layout and
other navigational elements. We set out the
basic organizational layers, contrast the techni-
cal approach with some other schemes for com-
plex markup in the XML tradition, and indicate
some of the applications we are pursuing.
