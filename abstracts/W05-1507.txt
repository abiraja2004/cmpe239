We adapt the ?hook? trick for speeding up
bilexical parsing to the decoding problem
for machine translation models that are
based on combining a synchronous con-
text free grammar as the translation model
with an n-gram language model. This
dynamic programming technique yields
lower complexity algorithms than have
previously been described for an impor-
tant class of translation models.
