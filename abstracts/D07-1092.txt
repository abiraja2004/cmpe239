Unknown words are a well-known hindrance
to natural language applications. In particu-
lar, they drastically impact machine transla-
tion quality. An easy way out commercial
translation systems usually offer their users
is the possibility to add unknown words
and their translations into a dedicated lex-
icon. Recently, Stroppa and Yvon (2005)
have shown how analogical learning alone
deals nicely with morphology in different
languages. In this study we show that ana-
logical learning offers as well an elegant and
effective solution to the problem of identify-
ing potential translations of unknown words.
