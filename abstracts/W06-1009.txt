An area of recent interest in cross-
language information retrieval (CLIR)
is the question of which parallel corpora
might be best suited to tasks in CLIR, or
even to what extent parallel corpora can
be obtained or are necessary. One pro-
posal, which in our opinion has been
somewhat overlooked, is that the Bible
holds a unique value as a multilingual
corpus, being (among other things)
widely available in a broad range of
languages and having a high coverage
of modern-day vocabulary. In this pa-
per, we test empirically whether this
claim is justified through a series of
validation tests on various information
retrieval tasks. Our results appear to in-
dicate that our methodology may sig-
nificantly outperform others recently
proposed.
