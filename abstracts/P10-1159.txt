We present a natural language genera-
tion approach which models, exploits, and
manipulates the non-linguistic context in
situated communication, using techniques
from AI planning. We show how to gen-
erate instructions which deliberately guide
the hearer to a location that is convenient
for the generation of simple referring ex-
pressions, and how to generate referring
expressions with context-dependent adjec-
tives. We implement and evaluate our
approach in the framework of the Chal-
lenge on Generating Instructions in Vir-
tual Environments, finding that it performs
well even under the constraints of real-
time generation.
