Post-retrieval clustering is the task of clus-
tering Web search results. Within this
context, we propose a new methodology
that adapts the classical K-means algo-
rithm to a third-order similarity measure
initially developed for NLP tasks. Results
obtained with the definition of a new stop-
ping criterion over the ODP-239 and the
MORESQUE gold standard datasets evi-
dence that our proposal outperforms all re-
ported text-based approaches.
