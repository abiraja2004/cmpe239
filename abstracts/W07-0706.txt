This paper describes a novel model using
dependency structures on the source side
for syntax-based statistical machine transla-
tion: Dependency Treelet String Correspon-
dence Model (DTSC). The DTSC model
maps source dependency structures to tar-
get strings. In this model translation pairs of
source treelets and target strings with their
word alignments are learned automatically
from the parsed and aligned corpus. The
DTSC model allows source treelets and tar-
get strings with variables so that the model
can generalize to handle dependency struc-
tures with the same head word but with dif-
ferent modifiers and arguments. Addition-
ally, target strings can be also discontinuous
by using gaps which are corresponding to
the uncovered nodes which are not included
in the source treelets. A chart-style decod-
ing algorithm with two basic operations?
substituting and attaching?is designed for
the DTSC model. We argue that the DTSC
model proposed here is capable of lexical-
ization, generalization, and handling discon-
tinuous phrases which are very desirable for
machine translation. We finally evaluate our
current implementation of a simplified ver-
sion of DTSC for statistical machine trans-
lation.
