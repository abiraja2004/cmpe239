In this paper, we introduce a method that au-
tomatically builds text classifiers in a new lan-
guage by training on already labeled data in
another language. Our method transfers the
classification knowledge across languages by
translating the model features and by using
an Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm
that naturally takes into account the ambigu-
ity associated with the translation of a word.
We further exploit the readily available un-
labeled data in the target language via semi-
supervised learning, and adapt the translated
model to better fit the data distribution of the
target language.
