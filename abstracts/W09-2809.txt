 
In this paper, we propose an event-based ap-
proach for Chinese sentence compression 
without using any training corpus. We en-
hance the linguistically-motivated heuristics 
by exploiting event word significance and 
event information density. This is shown to 
improve the preservation of important infor-
mation and the tolerance of POS and parsing 
errors, which are more common in Chinese 
than English. The heuristics are only required 
to determine possibly removable constituents 
instead of selecting specific constituents for 
removal, and thus are easier to develop and 
port to other languages and domains. The ex-
perimental results show that around 72% of 
our automatic compressions are grammatically 
and semantically correct, preserving around 
69% of the most important information on av-
erage.
