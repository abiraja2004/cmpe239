Abstract
Many practical tasks require accessing
specific types of information in scientific
literature; e.g. information about the ob-
jective, methods, results or conclusions of
the study in question. Several schemes
have been developed to characterize such
information in full journal papers. Yet
many tasks focus on abstracts instead. We
take three schemes of different type and
granularity (those based on section names,
argumentative zones and conceptual struc-
ture of documents) and investigate their
applicability to biomedical abstracts. We
show that even for the finest-grained of
these schemes, the majority of categories
appear in abstracts and can be identified
relatively reliably using machine learning.
We discuss the impact of our results and
the need for subsequent task-based evalu-
ation of the schemes.
