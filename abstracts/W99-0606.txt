 
Boosting is a machine learning algorithm that is not 
well known in computational linguistics. We ap- 
ply it to part-of-speech tagging and prepositional 
phrase attachment. Performance is very encourag- 
ing. We also show how to improve data quality by 
using boosting to identify annotation errors.
