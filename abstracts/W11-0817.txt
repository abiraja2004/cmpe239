In this paper, we describe our methods to
detect noun compounds and light verb con-
structions in running texts. For noun com-
pounds, dictionary-based methods and POS-
tagging seem to contribute most to the per-
formance of the system whereas for light
verb constructions, the combination of POS-
tagging, syntactic information and restrictions
on the nominal and verbal component yield
the best result. However, focusing on deverbal
nouns proves to be beneficial for both types
of MWEs. The effect of syntax is negligible
on noun compound detection whereas it is un-
ambiguously helpful for identifying light verb
constructions.
