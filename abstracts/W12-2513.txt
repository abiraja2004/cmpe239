We present a network analysis of a literary
text, Alice in Wonderland. We build novel
types of networks in which links between
characters are different types of social events.
We show that analyzing networks based on
these social events gives us insight into the
roles of characters in the story. Also, static
network analysis has limitations which be-
come apparent from our analysis. We propose
the use of dynamic network analysis to over-
come these limitations.
