Our work addresses the problem of predict-
ing whether an essay is off-topic to a given
prompt or question without any previously-
seen essays as training data. Prior work has
used similarity between essay vocabulary and
prompt words to estimate the degree of on-
topic content. In our corpus of opinion es-
says, prompts are very short, and using sim-
ilarity with such prompts to detect off-topic
essays yields error rates of about 10%. We
propose two methods to enable better compar-
ison of prompt and essay text. We automat-
ically expand short prompts before compari-
son, with words likely to appear in an essay
to that prompt. We also apply spelling correc-
tion to the essay texts. Both methods reduce
the error rates during off-topic essay detection
and turn out to be complementary, leading to
even better performance when used in unison.
