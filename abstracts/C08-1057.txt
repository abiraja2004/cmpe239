We conduct large-scale experiments to in-
vestigate optimal features for classification
of verbs in biomedical texts. We intro-
duce a range of feature sets and associated
extraction techniques, and evaluate them
thoroughly using a robust method new to
the task: cost-based framework for pair-
wise clustering. Our best results compare
favourably with earlier ones. Interestingly,
they are obtained with sophisticated fea-
ture sets which include lexical and seman-
tic information about selectional prefer-
ences of verbs. The latter are acquired au-
tomatically from corpus data using a fully
unsupervised method.
