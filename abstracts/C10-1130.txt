Question detection serves great purposes
in the cQA question retrieval task. While
detecting questions in standard language
data corpus is relatively easy, it becomes
a great challenge for online content. On-
line questions are usually long and infor-
mal, and standard features such as ques-
tion mark or 5W1H words are likely to be
absent. In this paper, we explore ques-
tion characteristics in cQA services, and
propose an automated approach to detect
question sentences based on lexical and
syntactic features. Our model is capable
of handling informal online languages.
The empirical evaluation results further
demonstrate that our model significantly
outperforms traditional methods in de-
tecting online question sentences, and it
considerably boosts the question retrieval
performance in cQA.
