 
This paper proposes methods to 
pre-process questions in the postings 
before a QA system can find answers in a 
discussion group in the Internet.  
Pre-processing includes garbage text 
removal and question segmentation.  
Garbage keywords are collected and 
different length thresholds are assigned to 
them for garbage text identification.  
Interrogative forms and question types 
are used to segment questions.  The best 
performance on the test set achieves 
92.57% accuracy in garbage text removal 
and 85.87% accuracy in question 
segmentation, respectively.
