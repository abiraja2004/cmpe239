Online reviews are often accompanied with
numerical ratings provided by users for a set
of service or product aspects. We propose
a statistical model which is able to discover
corresponding topics in text and extract tex-
tual evidence from reviews supporting each of
these aspect ratings ? a fundamental problem
in aspect-based sentiment summarization (Hu
and Liu, 2004a). Our model achieves high ac-
curacy, without any explicitly labeled data ex-
cept the user provided opinion ratings. The
proposed approach is general and can be used
for segmentation in other applications where
sequential data is accompanied with corre-
lated signals.
