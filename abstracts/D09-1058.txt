This paper describes an empirical study
of high-performance dependency parsers
based on a semi-supervised learning ap-
proach. We describe an extension of semi-
supervised structured conditional models
(SS-SCMs) to the dependency parsing
problem, whose framework is originally
proposed in (Suzuki and Isozaki, 2008).
Moreover, we introduce two extensions re-
lated to dependency parsing: The first ex-
tension is to combine SS-SCMs with an-
other semi-supervised approach, described
in (Koo et al, 2008). The second exten-
sion is to apply the approach to second-
order parsing models, such as those de-
scribed in (Carreras, 2007), using a two-
stage semi-supervised learning approach.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
proposed methods on dependency parsing
experiments using two widely used test
collections: the Penn Treebank for En-
glish, and the Prague Dependency Tree-
bank for Czech. Our best results on
test data in the above datasets achieve
93.79% parent-prediction accuracy for En-
glish, and 88.05% for Czech.
