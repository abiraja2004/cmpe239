We investigate the utility of linguistic features
for automatically differentiating between chil-
dren with varying combinations of two po-
tentially comorbid neurodevelopmental disor-
ders: autism spectrum disorder and specific
language impairment. We find that certain
manual codes for linguistic errors are useful
for distinguishing between diagnostic groups.
We investigate the relationship between cod-
ing detail and diagnostic classification perfor-
mance, and find that a simple coding scheme
is of high diagnostic utility. We propose a sim-
ple method to automate the pared down coding
scheme, and find that these automatic codes
are of diagnostic utility.
