Text input aids such as automatic correction
systems play an increasingly important role in
facilitating fast text entry and efficient com-
munication between text message users. Al-
though these tools are beneficial when they
work correctly, they can cause significant
communication problems when they fail. To
improve its autocorrection performance, it is
important for the system to have the capabil-
ity to assess its own performance and learn
from its mistakes. To address this, this pa-
per presents a novel task of self-assessment of
autocorrection performance based on interac-
tions between text message users. As part of
this investigation, we collected a dataset of au-
tocorrection mistakes from true text message
users and experimented with a rich set of fea-
tures in our self-assessment task. Our exper-
imental results indicate that there are salient
cues from the text message discourse that al-
low systems to assess their own behaviors with
high precision.
