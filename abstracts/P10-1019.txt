Current turn-taking approaches for spoken
dialogue systems rely on the speaker re-
leasing the turn before the other can take it.
This reliance results in restricted interac-
tions that can lead to inefficient dialogues.
In this paper we present a model we re-
fer to as Importance-Driven Turn-Bidding
that treats turn-taking as a negotiative pro-
cess. Each conversant bids for the turn
based on the importance of the intended
utterance, and Reinforcement Learning is
used to indirectly learn this parameter. We
find that Importance-Driven Turn-Bidding
performs better than two current turn-
taking approaches in an artificial collabo-
rative slot-filling domain. The negotiative
nature of this model creates efficient dia-
logues, and supports the improvement of
mixed-initiative interaction.
