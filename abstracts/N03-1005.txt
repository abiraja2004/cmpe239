This paper describes a novel multi-stage recog-
nition procedure for deducing the spelling and
pronunciation of an open set of names. The
overall goal is the automatic acquisition of un-
known words in a human computer conver-
sational system. The names are spoken and
spelled in a single utterance, achieving a con-
cise and natural dialogue flow. The first recog-
nition pass extracts letter hypotheses from the
spelled part of the waveform and maps them
to phonemic hypotheses via a hierarchical sub-
lexical model capable of generating grapheme-
phoneme mappings. A second recognition pass
determines the name by combining information
from the spoken and spelled part of the wave-
form, augmented with language model con-
straints. The procedure is integrated into a spo-
ken dialogue system where users are asked to
enroll their names for the first time. The acqui-
sition process is implemented in multiple paral-
lel threads for real-time operation. Subsequent
to inducing the spelling and pronunciation of a
new name, a series of operations automatically
updates the recognition and natural language
systems to immediately accommodate the new
word. Experiments show promising results for
letter and phoneme accuracies on a preliminary
dataset.
