The automatic acquisition of feature-based
conceptual representations from text corpora
can be challenging, given the unconstrained
nature of human-generated features. We
examine large-scale extraction of concept-
relation-feature triples and the utility of syn-
tactic, semantic, and encyclopedic informa-
tion in guiding this complex task. Meth-
ods traditionally employed do not investi-
gate the full range of triples occurring in
human-generated norms (e.g. flute produce
sound), rather targeting concept-feature pairs
(e.g. flute ? sound) or triples involving specific
relations (e.g. is-a, part-of ). We introduce
a novel method that extracts candidate triples
(e.g. deer have antlers, flute produce sound)
from parsed data and re-ranks them using se-
mantic information. We apply this technique
to Wikipedia and the British National Corpus
and assess its accuracy in a variety of ways.
Our work demonstrates the utility of external
knowledge in guiding feature extraction, and
suggests a number of avenues for future work.
