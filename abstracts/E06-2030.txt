We report work1 in progress on adding
affect-detection to an existing program
for virtual dramatic improvisation, moni-
tored by a human director. To partially
automate the directors? functions, we
have partially implemented the detection
of emotions, etc. in users? text input, by
means of pattern-matching, robust pars-
ing and some semantic analysis. The
work also involves basic research into
how affect is conveyed by metaphor.
