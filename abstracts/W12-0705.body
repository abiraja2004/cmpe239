Relation extraction is frequently and suc-
cessfully addressed by machine learning
methods. The downside of this approach
is the need for annotated training data, typi-
cally generated in tedious manual, cost inten-
sive work. Distantly supervised approaches
make use of weakly annotated data, like au-
tomatically annotated corpora.
Recent work in the biomedical domain
has applied distant supervision for protein-
protein interaction (PPI) with reasonable
results making use of the IntAct database.
Such data is typically noisy and heuristics
to filter the data are commonly applied. We
propose a constraint to increase the qual-
ity of data used for training based on the
assumption that no self-interaction of real-
world objects are described in sentences.
In addition, we make use of the Univer-
sity of Kansas Proteomics Service (KUPS)
database. These two steps show an increase
of 7 percentage points (pp) for the PPI cor-
pus AIMed. We demonstrate the broad appli-
cability of our approach by using the same
workflow for the analysis of drug-drug in-
teractions, utilizing relationships available
from the drug database DrugBank. We
achieve 37.31 % in F1 measure without man-
ually annotated training data on an indepen-
dent test set.
