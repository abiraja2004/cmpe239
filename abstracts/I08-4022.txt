 
Chinese word segmentation and named 
entity recognition (NER) are both important 
tasks in Chinese information processing. 
This paper presents a character-based 
Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) model 
for such two tasks. In The SIGHAN 
Bakeoff 2007, this model participated in all 
closed tracks for both Chinese NER and 
word segmentation tasks, and turns out to 
perform well. Our system ranks 2nd in the 
closed track on NER of MSRA, and 4th in 
the closed track on word segmentation of 
SXU.
