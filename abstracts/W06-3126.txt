We describe the LDV-COMBO system pre-
sented at the Shared Task. Our approach
explores the possibility of working with
alignments at different levels of abstrac-
tion using different degrees of linguis-
tic analysis from the lexical to the shal-
low syntactic level. Translation mod-
els are built on top of combinations of
these alignments. We present results
for the Spanish-to-English and English-to-
Spanish tasks. We show that liniguistic in-
formation may be helpful, specially when
the target language has a rich morphology.
