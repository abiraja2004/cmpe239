We analyze the concept of focus in speech
and the relationship between focus and
speech acts for prosodic generation. We
determine how the speaker?s utterances are
influenced by speaker?s intention. The re-
lationship between speech acts and focus
information is used to define which parts
of the sentence serve as the focus parts.
We propose the Focus to Emphasize Tones
(FET) structure to analyze the focus com-
ponents. We also design the FET grammar
to analyze the intonation patterns and pro-
duce tone marks as a result of our anal-
ysis. We present a proof-of-the-concept
working example to validate our proposal.
More comprehensive evaluations are part
of our current work.
