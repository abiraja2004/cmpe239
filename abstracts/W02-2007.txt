This paper investigates the use of a language inde-
pendent model for named entity recognition based
on iterative learning in a co-training fashion, using
word-internal and contextual information as inde-
pendent evidence sources. Its bootstrapping pro-
cess begins with only seed entities and seed con-
texts extracted from the provided annotated corpus.
F-measure exceeds 77 in Spanish and 72 in Dutch.
