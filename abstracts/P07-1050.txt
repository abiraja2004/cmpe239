This paper introduces a Maximum Entropy
dependency parser based on an efficient k-
best Maximum Spanning Tree (MST) algo-
rithm. Although recent work suggests that
the edge-factored constraints of the MST al-
gorithm significantly inhibit parsing accu-
racy, we show that generating the 50-best
parses according to an edge-factored model
has an oracle performance well above the
1-best performance of the best dependency
parsers. This motivates our parsing ap-
proach, which is based on reranking the k-
best parses generated by an edge-factored
model. Oracle parse accuracy results are
presented for the edge-factored model and
1-best results for the reranker on eight lan-
guages (seven from CoNLL-X and English).
