For multi-document summarization where docu-
ments are collected over an extended period of time,
the subject in a document changes over time. This
paper focuses on subject shift and presents a method
for extracting key paragraphs from documents that
discuss the same event. Our extraction method uses
the results of event tracking which starts from a few
sample documents and finds all subsequent docu-
ments that discuss the same event. The method was
tested on the TDT1 corpus, and the result shows the
effectiveness of the method.
