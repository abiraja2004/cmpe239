This paper introduces IQPs (Integer Quadratic
Programs) as a way to model joint inference
for the task of concept recognition in clinical
domain. IQPs make it possible to easily in-
corporate soft constraints in the optimization
framework and still support exact global infer-
ence. We show that soft constraints give statis-
tically significant performance improvements
when compared to hard constraints.
