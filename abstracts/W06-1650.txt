 
User-supplied reviews are widely and 
increasingly used to enhance e-
commerce and other websites. Because 
reviews can be numerous and varying in 
quality, it is important to assess how 
helpful each review is. While review 
helpfulness is currently assessed manu-
ally, in this paper we consider the task 
of automatically assessing it. Experi-
ments using SVM regression on a vari-
ety of features over Amazon.com 
product reviews show promising results, 
with rank correlations of up to 0.66. We 
found that the most useful features in-
clude the length of the review, its uni-
grams, and its product rating.
