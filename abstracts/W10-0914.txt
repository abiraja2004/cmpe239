The pervasive ambiguity of language al-
lows sentences that differ in just one lexi-
cal item to have rather different inference
patterns. This would be no problem if the
different lexical items fell into clearly de-
finable and easy to represent classes. But
this is not the case. To draw the correct
inferences we need to look how the refer-
ents of the lexical items in the sentence (or
broader context) interact in the described
situation. Given that the knowledge our
systems have of the represented situation
will typically be incomplete, the classifica-
tions we come up with can only be prob-
abilistic. We illustrate this problem with
an investigation of various inference pat-
terns associated with predications of the
form ?Verb from X to Y?, especially ?go
from X to Y?. We characterize the vari-
ous readings and make an initial proposal
about how to create the lexical classes that
will allow us to draw the correct inferences
in the different cases.
