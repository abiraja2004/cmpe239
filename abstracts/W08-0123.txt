Argumentation is an emerging topic in the
field of human computer dialogue. In this
paper we describe a novel approach to dia-
logue management that has been developed to
achieve persuasion using a textual argumen-
tation dialogue system. The paper introduces
a layered management architecture that mixes
task-oriented dialogue techniques with chat-
bot techniques to achieve better persuasive-
ness in the dialogue.
