 
This paper presents a decision-tree 
approach to the problems of part-of- 
speech disambiguation and unknown 
word guessing as they appear in Modem 
Greek, a highly inflectional language. The 
learning procedure is tag-set independent 
and reflects the linguistic reasoning on the 
specific problems. The decision trees 
induced are combined with a high- 
coverage lexicon to form a tagger that 
achieves 93,5% overall disambiguation 
accuracy.
