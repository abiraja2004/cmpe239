 
A bilingual concept MRD is of significance for 
IE, MT, WSD and the like. However, it is 
reasonably difficult to build such a lexicon for 
there exist two ontologies, also, the evolution of 
such a lexicon is quite challenging. In this 
paper, we would like to put forth the new 
approach to building a bilingual WordNet-like 
lexicon and to dwell on some of the pivotal 
algorithms. 
A characteristic of this new approach is to 
emphasize the inheritance and transformation 
of the existent monolingual lexicon.  On the one 
hand, we have extracted all the common 
knowledge in WordNet as the semantic basis 
for further use. On the other hand, we have 
developed a visualized developing tool for the 
lexicographers to interactively operate on to 
express the bilingual semantics. The bilingual 
lexicon has thus gradually come into being in 
this natural process. 
ICL now has benefited a lot by employing 
this new approach to build CCD (Chinese 
Concept Dictionary), a bilingual WordNet-like 
lexicon, in Peking University.
