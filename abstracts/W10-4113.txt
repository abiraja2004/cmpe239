 
Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) are the 
state-of-the-art models for sequential labe-
ling problems. A critical step is to select 
optimal feature template subset before em-
ploying CRFs, which is a tedious task. To 
improve the efficiency of this step, we pro-
pose a new method that adopts the maxi-
mum entropy (ME) model and maximum 
entropy Markov models (MEMMs) instead 
of CRFs considering the homology be-
tween ME, MEMMs, and CRFs. Moreover, 
empirical studies on the efficiency and ef-
fectiveness of the method are conducted in 
the field of Chinese text chunking, whose 
performance is ranked the first place in 
task two of CIPS-ParsEval-2009.
