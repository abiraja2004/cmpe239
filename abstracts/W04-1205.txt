 
Information extraction (IE) in the biomedical 
domain is now regarded as an essential 
technique for the dynamic management of 
factual information contained in archived journal 
articles and abstract collections. We aim to 
provide a technique serving as a basis for pin-
pointing and organizing factual information 
related to experimental results. In this paper, we 
enhance the idea proposed in (Mizuta and 
Collier, 2004); annotating articles in terms of 
rhetorical zones with shallow nesting. We give a 
qualitative analysis of the zone identification 
(ZI) process in biology articles. Specifically, we 
illustrate the linguistic and other features of each 
zone based on our investigation of articles 
selected from four major online journals. We 
also discuss controversial cases and nested zones, 
and ZI using multiple features. In doing so, we 
provide a stronger theoretical and practical 
support for our framework toward automatic ZI.
