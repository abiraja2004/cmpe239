We present a series of simulations of behavioral data
by casting a simple parsing model in the cognitive
architecture ACT-R. We show that constraints de-
fined in ACT-R, specifically those relating to acti-
vation, can account for a range of facts about hu-
man sentence processing. In doing so, we argue
that resource limitation in working memory is bet-
ter defined as an artefact of very general and in-
dependently motivated principles of cognitive pro-
cessing.
