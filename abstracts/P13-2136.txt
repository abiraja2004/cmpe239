We present an information theoretic objec-
tive for bilingual word clustering that in-
corporates both monolingual distributional
evidence as well as cross-lingual evidence
from parallel corpora to learn high qual-
ity word clusters jointly in any number of
languages. The monolingual component
of our objective is the average mutual in-
formation of clusters of adjacent words in
each language, while the bilingual com-
ponent is the average mutual information
of the aligned clusters. To evaluate our
method, we use the word clusters in an
NER system and demonstrate a statisti-
cally significant improvement in F1 score
when using bilingual word clusters instead
of monolingual clusters.
