In this paper we will briefly survey
the key results achieved so far in
Hungarian POS tagging and show
how classifier combination tech-
niques can aid the POS taggers.
Methods are evaluated on a manu-
ally annotated corpus containing 1.2
million words. POS tagger tests
were performed on single-domain,
multiple domain and cross-domain
test settings, and, to improve the ac-
curacy of the taggers, various com-
bination rules were implemented.
The results indicate that combina-
tion schemas (like the Boosting al-
gorithm) are promising tools which
can significantly degrade the classi-
fication errors, and produce a more
effective tagger application.
