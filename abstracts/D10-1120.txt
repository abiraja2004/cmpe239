We present an approach to grammar induc-
tion that utilizes syntactic universals to im-
prove dependency parsing across a range of
languages. Our method uses a single set
of manually-specified language-independent
rules that identify syntactic dependencies be-
tween pairs of syntactic categories that com-
monly occur across languages. During infer-
ence of the probabilistic model, we use pos-
terior expectation constraints to require that a
minimum proportion of the dependencies we
infer be instances of these rules. We also auto-
matically refine the syntactic categories given
in our coarsely tagged input. Across six lan-
guages our approach outperforms state-of-the-
art unsupervised methods by a significant mar-
