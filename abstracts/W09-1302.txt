 
Determining whether a condition is historical 
or recent is important for accurate results in 
biomedicine. In this paper, we investigate four 
types of information found in clinical text that 
might be used to make this distinction. We 
conducted a descriptive, exploratory study us-
ing annotation on clinical reports to determine 
whether this temporal information is useful 
for classifying conditions as historical or re-
cent. Our initial results suggest that few of 
these feature values can be used to predict 
temporal classification.
