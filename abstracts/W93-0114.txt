  
In this paper, we describe the most recent 
implementation and evaluation of the proper noun 
categorization and standardization module of the DR- 
LINK document detection system being developed at 
Syracuse University, under the auspices of ARPA's 
TIPSTER program. We also discuss the expansion of 
group common nouns and group proper nouns to 
enhance retrieval recall. Successful proper noun 
boundary identification within the part of speech tagger 
is essential for successful categorization. The proper 
noun classification module is designed to assign a 
category code to each proper noun entity, using 30 
categories generated from corpus analysis. 
Standardization f variant proper nouns occurs at three 
levels of processing. Expansion of group proper nouns 
and group common nouns is performed on queries. 
Standardization and categorization is performed on 
queries and documents. DR-LINK's overall precision 
for proper noun categorization was 93%, based on 589 
proper nouns occurring in the evaluation set.
