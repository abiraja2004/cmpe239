 
hfformation structure can be of great use 
in linguistic applications, especially in those 
involving a speech component. However, fo- 
cus marking by prosody is often ambiguous. 
Existing theories capture this by rules that 
produce alternative focus structures. This 
disjunction is hard to handle computation- 
ally. In this paper, a compact, graphically 
underspecified representation is proposed, 
along with composition principles and a res- 
olution routine based on context informa- 
tion.
