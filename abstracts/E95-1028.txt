 
I describe a compiler and development 
environment for feature-augmented wo- 
level morphology rules integrated into 
a full NLP system. The compiler is 
optimized for a class of languages in- 
cluding many or most European ones, 
and for rapid development and debug- 
ging of descriptions of new languages. 
The key design decision is to compose 
morphophonological and morphosyntac- 
tic information, but not the lexicon, 
when compiling the description. This 
results in typical compilation times of 
about a minute, and has allowed a rea- 
sonably full, feature-based description of 
French inflectional morphology to be de- 
veloped in about a month by a linguist 
new to the system.
