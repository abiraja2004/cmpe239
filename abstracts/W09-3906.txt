We describe an approach to dealing with
interpretation errors in a tutorial dialogue
system. Allowing students to provide ex-
planations and generate contentful talk can
be helpful for learning, but the language
that can be understood by a computer sys-
tem is limited by the current technology.
Techniques for dealing with understanding
problems have been developed primarily for
spoken dialogue systems in information-
seeking domains, and are not always appro-
priate for tutorial dialogue. We present a
classification of interpretation errors and our
approach for dealing with them within an
implemented tutorial dialogue system.
