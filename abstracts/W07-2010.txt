We made use of parallel texts to gather train-
ing and test examples for the English lexi-
cal sample task. Two tracks were organized
for our task. The first track used examples
gathered from an LDC corpus, while the
second track used examples gathered from
a Web corpus. In this paper, we describe
the process of gathering examples from the
parallel corpora, the differences with similar
tasks in previous SENSEVAL evaluations,
and present the results of participating sys-
tems.
