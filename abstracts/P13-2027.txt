The current topic modeling approaches for
Information Retrieval do not allow to ex-
plicitly model query-oriented latent top-
ics. More, the semantic coherence of the
topics has never been considered in this
field. We propose a model-based feedback
approach that learns Latent Dirichlet Al-
location topic models on the top-ranked
pseudo-relevant feedback, and we mea-
sure the semantic coherence of those top-
ics. We perform a first experimental eval-
uation using two major TREC test collec-
tions. Results show that retrieval perfor-
mances tend to be better when using topics
with higher semantic coherence.
