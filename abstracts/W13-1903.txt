The clinical narrative contains a great deal
of valuable information that is only under-
standable in a temporal context. Events,
time expressions, and temporal relations
convey information about the time course
of a patient?s clinical record that must be
understood for many applications of inter-
est. In this paper, we focus on extracting
information about how time expressions
and events are related by narrative con-
tainers. We use support vector machines
with composite kernels, which allows for
integrating standard feature kernels with
tree kernels for representing structured
features such as constituency trees. Our
experiments show that using tree kernels
in addition to standard feature kernels im-
proves F1 classification for this task.
