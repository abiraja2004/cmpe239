This paper addresses two remaining chal-
lenges in Chinese word segmentation. The
challenge in HLT is to find a robust seg-
mentation method that requires no prior lex-
ical knowledge and no extensive training to
adapt to new types of data. The challenge
in modelling human cognition and acqui-
sition it to segment words efficiently with-
out using knowledge of wordhood. We pro-
pose a radical method of word segmenta-
tion to meet both challenges. The most
critical concept that we introduce is that
Chinese word segmentation is the classifi-
cation of a string of character-boundaries
(CB?s) into either word-boundaries (WB?s)
and non-word-boundaries. In Chinese, CB?s
are delimited and distributed in between two
characters. Hence we can use the distri-
butional properties of CB among the back-
ground character strings to predict which
CB?s are WB?s.
