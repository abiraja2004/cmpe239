This paper presents a new word align-
ment method which incorporates knowl-
edge about Bilingual Multi-Word Expres-
sions (BMWEs). Our method of word
alignment first extracts such BMWEs in
a bidirectional way for a given corpus and
then starts conventional word alignment,
considering the properties of BMWEs in
their grouping as well as their alignment
links. We give partial annotation of align-
ment links as prior knowledge to the word
alignment process; by replacing the max-
imum likelihood estimate in the M-step
of the IBM Models with the Maximum A
Posteriori (MAP) estimate, prior knowl-
edge about BMWEs is embedded in the
prior in this MAP estimate. In our exper-
iments, we saw an improvement of 0.77
Bleu points absolute in JP?EN. Except
for one case, our method gave better re-
sults than the method using only BMWEs
grouping. Even though this paper does
not directly address the issues in Cross-
Lingual Information Retrieval (CLIR), it
discusses an approach of direct relevance
to the field. This approach could be
viewed as the opposite of current trends
in CLIR on semantic space that incorpo-
rate a notion of order in the bag-of-words
model (e.g. co-occurences).
