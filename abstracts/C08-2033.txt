Computing the similarity between entities
is a core component of many NLP tasks
such as measuring the semantic similarity
of terms for generating a distributional the-
saurus. In this paper, we study the problem
of explaining post-hoc why a set of terms
are similar. Given a set of terms, our task is
to generate a small set of explanations that
best characterizes the similarity of those
terms. Our contributions include: 1) an
information-theoretic objective function
for quantifying the utility of an explana-
tion set; 2) a survey of psycholinguistics
and philosophy for evidence of different
sources of explanations such as descriptive
properties and prototypes; 3) computa-
tional baseline models for automatically
generating various types of explanations;
and 4) a qualitative evaluation of our
explanation generation engine.
