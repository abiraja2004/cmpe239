We present an open-source toolkit which
allows (i) to reconstruct past states of
Wikipedia, and (ii) to efficiently access the
edit history of Wikipedia articles. Recon-
structing past states of Wikipedia is a pre-
requisite for reproducing previous experimen-
tal work based on Wikipedia. Beyond that,
the edit history of Wikipedia articles has been
shown to be a valuable knowledge source for
NLP, but access is severely impeded by the
lack of efficient tools for managing the huge
amount of provided data. By using a dedi-
cated storage format, our toolkit massively de-
creases the data volume to less than 2% of
the original size, and at the same time pro-
vides an easy-to-use interface to access the re-
vision data. The language-independent design
allows to process any language represented in
Wikipedia. We expect this work to consolidate
NLP research using Wikipedia in general, and
to foster research making use of the knowl-
edge encoded in Wikipedia?s edit history.
