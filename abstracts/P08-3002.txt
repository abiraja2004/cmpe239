The aim of this research is to provide a prin-
cipled account of the generation of embed-
ded constructions (called parentheticals) and
to implement the results in a natural language
generation system. Parenthetical construc-
tions are frequently used in texts written in a
good writing style and have an important role
in text understanding. We propose a frame-
work to model the rhetorical properties of par-
entheticals based on a corpus study and de-
velop a unified natural language generation ar-
chitecture which integrates syntax, semantics,
rhetorical and document structure into a com-
plex representation, which can be easily ex-
tended to handle parentheticals.
