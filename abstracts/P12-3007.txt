 
This system demonstration paper presents 
IRIS (Informal Response Interactive Sys-
tem), a chat-oriented dialogue system based 
on the vector space model framework. The 
system belongs to the class of example-
based dialogue systems and builds its chat 
capabilities on a dual search strategy over a 
large collection of dialogue samples. Addi-
tional strategies allowing for system adap-
tation and learning implemented over the 
same vector model space framework are 
also described and discussed.
