 
This paper discusses several issues in Arabic 
orthography that were encountered in the 
process of performing morphology analysis 
and POS tagging of 542,543 Arabic words in 
three newswire corpora at the LDC during 
2002-2004, by means of the Buckwalter 
Arabic Morphological Analyzer. The most 
important issues involved variation in the 
orthography of Modern Standard Arabic that 
called for specific changes to the Analyzer 
algorithm, and also a more rigorous definition 
of typographic errors. Some orthographic 
anomalies had a direct impact on word 
tokenization, which in turn affected the 
morphology analysis and assignment of POS 
tags.
