We present a demo of our conversational 
system POLLy (POliteness in Language 
Learning) which uses a common planning 
representation to generate actions to be per-
formed by embodied agents in a virtual en-
vironment and to generate spoken utter-
ances for dialogues about the steps in-
volved in completing the task. In order to 
generate socially appropriate dialogue, 
Brown and Levinson?s theory of politeness 
is used to constrain the dialogue generation 
process.
