The first step in graph-based semi-supervised
classification is to construct a graph from in-
put data. While the k-nearest neighbor graphs
have been the de facto standard method of
graph construction, this paper advocates using
the less well-known mutual k-nearest neigh-
bor graphs for high-dimensional natural lan-
guage data. To compare the performance
of these two graph construction methods, we
run semi-supervised classification methods on
both graphs in word sense disambiguation and
document classification tasks. The experi-
mental results show that the mutual k-nearest
neighbor graphs, if combined with maximum
spanning trees, consistently outperform the k-
nearest neighbor graphs. We attribute better
performance of the mutual k-nearest neigh-
bor graph to its being more resistive to mak-
ing hub vertices. The mutual k-nearest neigh-
bor graphs also perform equally well or even
better in comparison to the state-of-the-art
b-matching graph construction, despite their
lower computational complexity.
