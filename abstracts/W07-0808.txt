Computational linguistics methods are typ-
ically first developed and tested in English.
When applied to other languages, assump-
tions from English data are often applied
to the target language. One of the most
common such assumptions is that a ?stan-
dard? part-of-speech (POS) tagset can be
used across languages with only slight vari-
ations. We discuss in this paper a specific is-
sue related to the definition of a POS tagset
for Modern Hebrew, as an example to clar-
ify the method through which such varia-
tions can be defined. It is widely assumed
that Hebrew has no syntactic category of
modals. There is, however, an identified
class of words which are modal-like in their
semantics, and can be characterized through
distinct syntactic and morphologic criteria.
We have found wide disagreement among
traditional dictionaries on the POS tag at-
tributed to such words. We describe three
main approaches when deciding how to tag
such words in Hebrew. We illustrate the im-
pact of selecting each of these approaches
on agreement among human taggers, and on
the accuracy of automatic POS taggers in-
duced for each method. We finally recom-
mend the use of a ?modal? tag in Hebrew
and provide detailed guidelines for this tag.
Our overall conclusion is that tagset defini-
tion is a complex task which deserves appro-
priate methodology.
