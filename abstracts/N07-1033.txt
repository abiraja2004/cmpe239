We propose a new framework for supervised ma-
chine learning. Our goal is to learn from smaller
amounts of supervised training data, by collecting a
richer kind of training data: annotations with ?ra-
tionales.? When annotating an example, the hu-
man teacher will also highlight evidence support-
ing this annotation?thereby teaching the machine
learner why the example belongs to the category. We
provide some rationale-annotated data and present a
learning method that exploits the rationales during
training to boost performance significantly on a sam-
ple task, namely sentiment classification of movie
reviews. We hypothesize that in some situations,
providing rationales is a more fruitful use of an an-
notator?s time than annotating more examples.
