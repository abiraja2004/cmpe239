We investigate statistical dependency parsing
of two closely related languages, Croatian and
Serbian. As these two morphologically com-
plex languages of relaxed word order are gen-
erally under-resourced ? with the topic of de-
pendency parsing still largely unaddressed, es-
pecially for Serbian ? we make use of the
two available dependency treebanks of Croa-
tian to produce state-of-the-art parsing models
for both languages. We observe parsing accu-
racy on four test sets from two domains. We
give insight into overall parser performance
for Croatian and Serbian, impact of prepro-
cessing for lemmas and morphosyntactic tags
and influence of selected morphosyntactic fea-
tures on parsing accuracy.
