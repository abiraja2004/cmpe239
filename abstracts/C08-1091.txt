We present an algorithm for unsupervised
induction of labeled parse trees. The al-
gorithm has three stages: bracketing, ini-
tial labeling, and label clustering. Brack-
eting is done from raw text using an un-
supervised incremental parser. Initial la-
beling is done using a merging model that
aims at minimizing the grammar descrip-
tion length. Finally, labels are clustered
to a desired number of labels using syn-
tactic features extracted from the initially
labeled trees. The algorithm obtains 59%
labeled f-score on the WSJ10 corpus, as
compared to 35% in previous work, and
substantial error reduction over a random
baseline. We report results for English,
German and Chinese corpora, using two
label mapping methods and two label set
sizes.
