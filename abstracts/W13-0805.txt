Abstract
We describe a novel approach to combin-
ing lexicalized, POS-based and syntactic tree-
based word reordering in a phrase-based ma-
chine translation system. Our results show
that each of the presented reordering meth-
ods leads to improved translation quality on its
own. The strengths however can be combined
to achieve further improvements. We present
experiments on German-English and German-
French translation. We report improvements
of 0.7 BLEU points by adding tree-based and
lexicalized reordering. Up to 1.1 BLEU points
can be gained by POS and tree-based reorder-
ing over a baseline with lexicalized reorder-
ing. A human analysis, comparing subjec-
tive translation quality as well as a detailed er-
ror analysis show the impact of our presented
tree-based rules in terms of improved sentence
quality and reduction of errors related to miss-
ing verbs and verb positions.
