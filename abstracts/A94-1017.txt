 
This paper proposes a model using associative 
processors (APs) for real-time spoken language 
translation. Spoken language translation re- 
quires (1) an accurate translation and (2) a real- 
time response. We have already proposed a 
model, TDMT (Transfer-Driven Machine Trans- 
lation), that translates a sentence utilizing ex- 
amples effectively and performs accurate struc- 
tural disambiguation and target word selection. 
This paper will concentrate on the second re- 
quirement. In TDMT, example-retrieval (ER), 
i.e., retrieving examples most similar to an in- 
put expression, is the most dominant part of the 
total processing time. Our study has concluded 
that we only need to implement the ER for ex- 
pressions including a frequent word on APs. Ex- 
perimental results how that the ER can be dras- 
tically speeded up. Moreover, a study on com- 
munications between APs demonstrates the scal- 
ability against vocabulary size by extrapolation. 
Thus, our model, TDMT on APs, meets the vital 
requirements of spoken language translation.
