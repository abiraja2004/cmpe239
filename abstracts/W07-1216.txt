The development of robust ?deep? linguis-
tic parsers is known to be a difficult task.
Few such systems can claim to satisfy the
needs of large-scale NLP applications in
terms of robustness, efficiency, granular-
ity or precision. Adapting such systems
to more than one language makes the task
even more challenging.
This paper describes some of the proper-
ties of Fips, a multilingual parsing sys-
tem that has been for a number of years
(and still is) under development at LATL.
Based on Chomsky?s generative grammar
for its grammatical aspects, and on object-
oriented (OO) sofware engineering tech-
niques for its implementation, Fips is de-
signed to efficiently parse the four Swiss
?national? languages (German, French,
Italian and English) to which we also
added Spanish and (more recently) Greek.
