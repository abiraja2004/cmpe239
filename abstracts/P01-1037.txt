This paper presents an open-domain
textual Question-Answering system
that uses several feedback loops to en-
hance its performance. These feedback
loops combine in a new way statistical
results with syntactic, semantic or
pragmatic information derived from
texts and lexical databases. The paper
presents the contribution of each feed-
back loop to the overall performance of
76% human-assessed precise answers.
