Electronic Health Records (EHRs) contain
a large amount of free text documentation
which is potentially very useful for Infor-
mation Retrieval and Text Mining appli-
cations. We have, in an initial annotation
trial, annotated 6 739 sentences randomly
extracted from a corpus of Swedish EHRs
for sentence level (un)certainty, and token
level speculative keywords and negations.
This set is split into different clinical prac-
tices and analyzed by means of descrip-
tive statistics and pairwise Inter-Annotator
Agreement (IAA) measured by F
1
-score.
We identify geriatrics as a clinical prac-
tice with a low average amount of uncer-
tain sentences and a high average IAA,
and neurology with a high average amount
of uncertain sentences. Speculative words
are often n-grams, and uncertain sentences
longer than average. The results of this
analysis is to be used in the creation of a
new annotated corpus where we will refine
and further develop the initial annotation
guidelines and introduce more levels of di-
mensionality. Once we have finalized our
guidelines and refined the annotations we
plan to release the corpus for further re-
search, after ensuring that no identifiable
information is included.
