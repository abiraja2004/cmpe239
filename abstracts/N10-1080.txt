Translation systems are generally trained to
optimize BLEU, but many alternative metrics
are available. We explore how optimizing
toward various automatic evaluation metrics
(BLEU, METEOR, NIST, TER) affects the re-
sulting model. We train a state-of-the-art MT
system using MERT on many parameteriza-
tions of each metric and evaluate the result-
ing models on the other metrics and also us-
ing human judges. In accordance with popular
wisdom, we find that it?s important to train on
the same metric used in testing. However, we
also find that training to a newer metric is only
useful to the extent that the MT model?s struc-
ture and features allow it to take advantage of
the metric. Contrasting with TER?s good cor-
relation with human judgments, we show that
people tend to prefer BLEU and NIST trained
models to those trained on edit distance based
metrics like TER or WER. Human prefer-
ences for METEOR trained models varies de-
pending on the source language. Since using
BLEU or NIST produces models that are more
robust to evaluation by other metrics and per-
form well in human judgments, we conclude
they are still the best choice for training.
