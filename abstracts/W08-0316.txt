We describe the Cambridge University En-
gineering Department phrase-based statisti-
cal machine translation system for Spanish-
English and French-English translation in the
ACL 2008 Third Workshop on Statistical Ma-
chine Translation Shared Task. The CUED
system follows a generative model of trans-
lation and is implemented by composition of
component models realised as Weighted Fi-
nite State Transducers, without the use of a
special-purpose decoder. Details of system
tuning for both Europarl and News translation
tasks are provided.
