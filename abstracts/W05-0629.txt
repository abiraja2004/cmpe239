In this paper, we describe our systems for
the CoNLL-2005 shared task. The aim of
the task is semantic role labeling using a
machine-learning algorithm. We apply the
Support Vector Machines to the task. We
added new features based on full parses
and manually categorized words. We also
report on system performance and what
effect the newly added features had.
