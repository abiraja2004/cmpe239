Finding appropriate, authentic reading mate-
rials is a challenge for language instructors.
The Web is a vast resource of texts, but most
pages are not suitable for reading practice, and
commercial search engines are not well suited
to finding texts that satisfy pedagogical con-
straints such as reading level, length, text qual-
ity, and presence of target vocabulary. We
present a system that uses various language
technologies to facilitate the retrieval and pre-
sentation of authentic reading materials gath-
ered from the Web. It is currently deployed in
two English as a Second Language courses at
the University of Pittsburgh.
