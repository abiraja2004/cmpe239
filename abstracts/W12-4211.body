 
Verb plays a crucial role of specifying the 
action or function performed in a sentence. 
In translating English to morphologically 
richer language like Hindi, the organization 
and the order of verbal constructs 
contributes to the fluency of the language. 
Mere statistical methods of machine 
translation are not sufficient enough to 
consider this aspect. Identification of verb 
parts in a sentence is essential for its 
understanding and they constitute as if they 
are a single entity. Considering them as a 
single entity improves the translation of the 
verbal construct and thus the overall 
quality of the translation. The paper 
describes a strategy for pre-processing and 
for identification of verb parts in source 
and target language corpora. The steps 
taken towards reducing sparsity further 
helped in improving the translation results.
