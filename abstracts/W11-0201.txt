The extraction of protein-protein interactions
(PPIs) reported in scientific publications is one
of the most studied topics in Text Mining in
the Life Sciences, as such algorithms can sub-
stantially decrease the effort for databases cu-
rators. The currently best methods for this
task are based on analyzing the dependency
tree (DT) representation of sentences. Many
approaches exploit only topological features
and thus do not yet fully exploit the informa-
tion contained in DTs. We show that incor-
porating the grammatical information encoded
in the types of the dependencies in DTs no-
ticeably improves extraction performance by
using a pattern matching approach. We au-
tomatically infer a large set of linguistic pat-
terns using only information about interact-
ing proteins. Patterns are then refined based
on shallow linguistic features and the seman-
tics of dependency types. Together, these lead
to a total improvement of 17.2 percent points
in F1, as evaluated on five publicly available
PPI corpora. More than half of that improve-
ment is gained by properly handling depen-
dency types. Our method provides a general
framework for building task-specific relation-
ship extraction methods that do not require an-
notated training data. Furthermore, our obser-
vations offer methods to improve upon rela-
tion extraction approaches.
