We describe an extension of the Wysiwym
technology for knowledge editing through nat-
ural language feedback. Previous applications
have addressed relatively simple tasks requiring
a very limited range of nominal and clause pat-
terns. We show that by adding a further editing
operation called reconfiguration, the technology
can achieve a far wider coverage more in line
with other general-purpose generators. The ex-
tension will be included in a Java-based library
package for producing Wysiwym applications.
