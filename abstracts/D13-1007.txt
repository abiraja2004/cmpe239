We present a unified unsupervised statistical
model for text normalization. The relation-
ship between standard and non-standard to-
kens is characterized by a log-linear model,
permitting arbitrary features. The weights
of these features are trained in a maximum-
likelihood framework, employing a novel se-
quential Monte Carlo training algorithm to
overcome the large label space, which would
be impractical for traditional dynamic pro-
gramming solutions. This model is im-
plemented in a normalization system called
UNLOL, which achieves the best known re-
sults on two normalization datasets, outper-
forming more complex systems. We use the
output of UNLOL to automatically normalize
a large corpus of social media text, revealing a
set of coherent orthographic styles that under-
lie online language variation.
