The information retrieval (IR) commu-
nity has investigated many different tech-
niques to retrieve passages from large col-
lections of documents for question answer-
ing (QA). In this paper, we specifically ex-
amine and quantitatively compare the im-
pact of passage retrieval for QA using slid-
ing windows and disjoint windows. We
consider two different data sets, the TREC
2002?2003 QA data set, and 93 why-
questions against INEX Wikipedia. We
discovered that, compared to disjoint win-
dows, using sliding windows results in im-
proved performance of TREC-QA in terms
of TDRR, and in improved performance of
why-QA in terms of success@n and MRR.
