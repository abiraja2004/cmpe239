Recent advances in large-margin learning
have shown that better generalization can
be achieved by incorporating higher order
information into the optimization, such as
the spread of the data. However, these so-
lutions are impractical in complex struc-
tured prediction problems such as statis-
tical machine translation. We present an
online gradient-based algorithm for rela-
tive margin maximization, which bounds
the spread of the projected data while max-
imizing the margin. We evaluate our op-
timizer on Chinese-English and Arabic-
English translation tasks, each with small
and large feature sets, and show that our
learner is able to achieve significant im-
provements of 1.2-2 BLEU and 1.7-4.3
TER on average over state-of-the-art opti-
mizers with the large feature set.
