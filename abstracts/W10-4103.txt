 
Sentence segmentation is a fundamental 
issue in Classical Chinese language 
processing. To facilitate reading and 
processing of the raw Classical Chinese 
data, we propose a statistical method to 
split unstructured Classical Chinese text 
into smaller pieces such as sentences and 
clauses. The segmenter based on the 
conditional random field (CRF) model is 
tested under different tagging schemes 
and various features including n-gram, 
jump, word class, and phonetic informa-
tion. We evaluated our method on four 
datasets from several eras (i.e., from the 
5th century BCE to the 19th century). 
Our CRF segmenter achieves an F-score 
of 83.34% and can be applied on a varie-
ty of data from different eras.
