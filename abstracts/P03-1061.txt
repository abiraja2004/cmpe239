This paper describes two methods for de-
tecting word segments and their morpho-
logical information in a Japanese sponta-
neous speech corpus, and describes how
to tag a large spontaneous speech corpus
accurately by using the two methods. The
first method is used to detect any type of
word segments. The second method is
used when there are several definitions for
word segments and their POS categories,
and when one type of word segments in-
cludes another type of word segments. In
this paper, we show that by using semi-
automatic analysis we achieve a precision
of better than 99% for detecting and tag-
ging short words and 97% for long words;
the two types of words that comprise the
corpus. We also show that better accuracy
is achieved by using both methods than by
using only the first.
