  
A proposal to deal with tenses in the framework of 
Discourse Representation Theory is presented, ms it 
has been implemented for a fragment at the IMS for 
the project LILOG. It is based on the theory of tenses 
of H. Kamp and Ch. Rohrer. The system uses tile 
tense and aspect information, the information about 
the temporal discourse structure of tile preceding text 
stored in a specific list of possible reference times, and 
background knowledge. These types of information 
interact in order to choose a suited temporal anchor 
for the event of a new sentence. 
With respect o extended texts, choosing the right 
reference time for a new event is a problem which has 
been largely neglected in the literature.
