We present a system for extracting biomedical
events (detailed descriptions of biomolecular
interactions) from research articles. This sys-
tem was developed for the BioNLP?11 Shared
Task and extends our BioNLP?09 Shared Task
winning Turku Event Extraction System. It
uses support vector machines to first detect
event-defining words, followed by detection
of their relationships. The theme of the
BioNLP?11 Shared Task is generalization, ex-
tending event extraction to varied biomedical
domains. Our current system successfully pre-
dicts events for every domain case introduced
in the BioNLP?11 Shared Task, being the only
system to participate in all eight tasks and all
of their subtasks, with best performance in
four tasks.
