We propose an ontology-based framework
for linguistic annotation of written texts.
We argue that linguistic annotation can be
actually considered a special case of se-
mantic annotation with regard to an on-
tology such as pursued within the con-
text of the Semantic Web. Furthermore,
we present CREAM, a semantic annota-
tion framework, as well as its concrete im-
plementation OntoMat and show how they
can be used for the purpose of linguistic
annotation. We demonstrate the value of
our framework by applying it to the an-
notation of anaphoric relations in written
texts.
