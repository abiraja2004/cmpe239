 
Urdu is spoken by more than 100 million 
people across a score countries and is the 
national language of Pakistan (http://www. 
ethnologue.com).  There is a great need for 
developing a text-to-speech system for Urdu 
because this population has low literacy rate 
and therefore speech interface would greatly 
assist in providing them access to information.  
One of the significant parts of a text-to-speech 
system is a natural language processor which 
takes textual input and converts it into an 
annotated phonetic string.  To enable this, it is 
necessary to develop models which map 
textual input onto phonetic content.  These 
models may be very complex for various 
languages having unpredictable behaviour 
(e.g. English), but Urdu shows a relatively 
regular behaviour and thus Urdu pronunciation 
may be modelled from Urdu text by defining 
fairly regular rules.  These rules have been 
identified and explained in this paper.
