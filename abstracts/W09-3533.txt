 
There are generally many ways to translite-
rate a name from one language script into 
another. The resulting ambiguity can make it 
very difficult to ?untransliterate? a name by 
reverse engineering the process. In this paper, 
we present a highly successful cross-script 
name matching system that we developed by 
combining the creativity of human intuition 
with the power of machine learning. Our sys-
tem determines whether a name in Roman 
script and a name in Chinese script match 
each other with an F-score of 96%. In addi-
tion, for name pairs that satisfy a computa-
tional test, the F-score is 98%.
