This paper reports on the first shared task on
statistical parsing of morphologically rich lan-
guages (MRLs). The task features data sets
from nine languages, each available both in
constituency and dependency annotation. We
report on the preparation of the data sets, on
the proposed parsing scenarios, and on the eval-
uation metrics for parsing MRLs given dif-
ferent representation types. We present and
analyze parsing results obtained by the task
participants, and then provide an analysis and
comparison of the parsers across languages and
frameworks, reported for gold input as well as
more realistic parsing scenarios.
