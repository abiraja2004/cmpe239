This paper presents a general architec-
ture and four algorithms that use Natu-
ral Language Processing for automatic on-
tology matching. The proposed approach
is purely instance based, i.e., only the
instance documents associated with the
nodes of ontologies are taken into account.
The four algorithms have been evaluated
using real world test data, taken from the
Google and LookSmart online directories.
The results show that NLP techniques ap-
plied to instance documents help the sys-
tem achieve higher performance.
