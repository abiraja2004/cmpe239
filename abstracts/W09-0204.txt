This paper discusses a new convolu-
tion tree kernel by introducing local
alignments. The main idea of the new
kernel is to allow some syntactic al-
ternations during each match between
subtrees. In this paper, we give an
algorithm to calculate the composite
kernel. The experiment results show
promising improvements on two tasks:
semantic role labeling and question
classification.
