XML documents annotated by differ-
ent NLP tools accommodate multi-
dimensional markup in a single hier-
archy. To query such documents one
has to account for different possible
nesting structures of the annotations
and the original markup of a docu-
ment. We propose an expressive pat-
tern language with extended seman-
tics of the sequence pattern, support-
ing negation, permutation and regu-
lar patterns that is especially appropri-
ate for querying XML annotated docu-
ments with multi-dimensional markup.
The concept of fuzzy matching allows
matching of sequences that contain tex-
tual fragments and known XML ele-
ments independently of how concurrent
annotations and original markup are
merged. We extend the usual notion of
sequence as a sequence of siblings al-
lowing matching of sequence elements
on the different levels of nesting and
abstract so from the hierarchy of the
XML document. Extended sequence
semantics in combination with other
language patterns allows more power-
ful and expressive queries than queries
based on regular patterns.
