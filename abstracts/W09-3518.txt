We propose a framework for translit-
eration which uses (i) a word-origin
detection engine (pre-processing) (ii) a
CRF based transliteration engine and (iii)
a re-ranking model based on lexicon-
lookup (post-processing). The results
obtained for English-Hindi and English-
Kannada transliteration show that the pre-
processing and post-processing modules
improve the top-1 accuracy by 7.1%.
