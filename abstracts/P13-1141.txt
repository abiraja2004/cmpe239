Words often gain new senses in new do-
mains. Being able to automatically iden-
tify, from a corpus of monolingual text,
which word tokens are being used in a pre-
viously unseen sense has applications to
machine translation and other tasks sensi-
tive to lexical semantics. We define a task,
SENSESPOTTING, in which we build sys-
tems to spot tokens that have new senses
in new domain text. Instead of difficult
and expensive annotation, we build a gold-
standard by leveraging cheaply available
parallel corpora, targeting our approach to
the problem of domain adaptation for ma-
chine translation. Our system is able to
achieve F-measures of as much as 80%,
when applied to word types it has never
seen before. Our approach is based on
a large set of novel features that capture
varied aspects of how words change when
used in new domains.
