We present langid.py, an off-the-shelf lan-
guage identification tool. We discuss the de-
sign and implementation of langid.py, and
provide an empirical comparison on 5 long-
document datasets, and 2 datasets from the mi-
croblog domain. We find that langid.py
maintains consistently high accuracy across
all domains, making it ideal for end-users that
require language identification without want-
ing to invest in preparation of in-domain train-
ing data.
