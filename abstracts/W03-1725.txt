 
This paper presents a Unicode based 
Chinese word segmentor. It can handle 
Chinese text in Simplified, Traditional, or 
mixed mode. The system uses the strategy 
of divide-and-conquer to handle the 
recognition of personal names, numbers, 
time and numerical values, etc in the pre-
processing stage. The segmentor further 
uses tagging information to work on 
disambiguation. Adopting a modular 
design approach, different functional parts 
are separately implemented using 
different modules and each module 
tackles one problem at a time providing 
more flexibility and extensibility. Results 
show that with added pre-processing 
modules and accessorial modules, the 
accuracy of the segmentor is increased 
and the system is easily adaptive to 
different applications.
