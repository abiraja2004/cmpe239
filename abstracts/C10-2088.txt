In this paper, we propose a review se-
lection approach towards accurate esti-
mation of feature ratings for services on
participatory websites where users write
textual reviews for these services. Our
approach selects reviews that compre-
hensively talk about a feature of a service
by using information distance of the re-
views on the feature. The rating estima-
tion of the feature for these selected re-
views using machine learning techniques
provides more accurate results than that
for other reviews. The average of these
estimated feature ratings also better rep-
resents an accurate overall rating for the
feature of the service, which provides
useful feedback for other users to choose
their satisfactory services.
