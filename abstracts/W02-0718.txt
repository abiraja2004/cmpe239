 
Significant progress has been made in the 
field of human language technologies. 
Various tasks like continuous speech rec-
ognition for large vocabulary, speaker and 
language identification, spoken informa-
tion inquiry, information extraction and 
cross-language retrieval in restricted do-
mains are today feasible and different pro-
totypes and systems are running. The 
spoken translation problem on the other 
hand is still a significant challenge: 
?Good text translation was hard enough to 
pull off. Speech to speech MT was be-
yond going to the Moon ? it was Mars?? 
[Steve Silbermann, Wired Magazine]. 
Considering the major achievements of 
the last years obtained in the field and the 
related challenges, a question arise: what 
next ? Is it possible to  foresee in the next 
decade real services and applications ? 
How can we reach this goal ? Shall we re-
think the approach ? Shall we need much 
more critical mass ? How about data ? To 
answer to these questions a new prepara-
tory action, TC_STAR_P, funded in the V 
framework, has been settled in Europe. 
Goals, objective  and activities of this 
preparatory action will also be discussed 
in this paper
