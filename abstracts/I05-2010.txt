 
This paper describes a mix word-pair 
mix-WP) identifier to resolve homo-
nym/segmentation ambiguities as well 
as perform STW conversion effec-
tively for Chinese input. The mix-WP 
identifier includes a specific word-pair 
(SWP) identifier and a common word-
pair (CWP) identifier. It is designed as 
a supporting processing with Chinese 
input systems. Our experiments show 
that by applying the mix-WP identifier, 
together with the Microsoft input 
method editor 2003 (MSIME) and an 
optimized bigram model (BiGram), 
the tonal and toneless STW perform-
ance of the two input systems can be 
improved.
