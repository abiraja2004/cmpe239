We present a framework for interfacing
a PCFG parser with lexical information
from an external resource following a dif-
ferent tagging scheme than the treebank.
This is achieved by defining a stochas-
tic mapping layer between the two re-
sources. Lexical probabilities for rare
events are estimated in a semi-supervised
manner from a lexicon and large unanno-
tated corpora. We show that this solu-
tion greatly enhances the performance of
an unlexicalized Hebrew PCFG parser, re-
sulting in state-of-the-art Hebrew parsing
results both when a segmentation oracle is
assumed, and in a real-word parsing sce-
nario of parsing unsegmented tokens.
