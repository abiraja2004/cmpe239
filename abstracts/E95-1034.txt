 
Multiset-CCG is a combinatory catego- 
rial formalism that can capture the syn- 
tax and interpretation of "free" word or- 
der in languages uch as Turkish. The 
formalism compositionally derives the 
predicate-argument structure and the in- 
formation structure (e.g. topic, focus) 
of a sentence, and uniformly handles 
word order variation among arguments 
and adjuncts within a clause, as well 
as in complex clauses and across clause 
boundaries.
