In this paper we compare the performance
of two methods for speech translation.
One is a statistical dependency transduc-
tion model using head transducers, the
other a case-based transduction model in-
volving a lexical similarity measure. Ex-
amples of translated utterance transcrip-
tions are used in training both models,
though the case-based model also uses se-
mantic labels classifying the source utter-
ances. The main conclusion is that while
the two methods provide similar transla-
tion accuracy under the experimental con-
ditions and accuracy metric used, the sta-
tistical dependency transduction method
is significantly faster at computing trans-
lations.
