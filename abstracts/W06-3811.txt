Synonyms extraction is a difficult task to
achieve and evaluate. Some studies have
tried to exploit general dictionaries for
that purpose, seeing them as graphs where
words are related by the definition they ap-
pear in, in a complex network of an ar-
guably semantic nature. The advantage
of using a general dictionary lies in the
coverage, and the availability of such re-
sources, in general and also in specialised
domains. We present here a method ex-
ploiting such a graph structure to compute
a distance between words. This distance
is used to isolate candidate synonyms for
a given word. We present an evaluation of
the relevance of the candidates on a sam-
ple of the lexicon.
