In this paper, we present a novel training
method for a localized phrase-based predic-
tion model for statistical machine translation
(SMT). The model predicts blocks with orien-
tation to handle local phrase re-ordering. We
use a maximum likelihood criterion to train a
log-linear block bigram model which uses real-
valued features (e.g. a language model score)
as well as binary features based on the block
identities themselves, e.g. block bigram fea-
tures. Our training algorithm can easily handle
millions of features. The best system obtains
a   % improvement over the baseline on a
standard Arabic-English translation task.
