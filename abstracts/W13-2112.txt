In this overview paper we present the out-
come of the first content selection chal-
lenge from open semantic web data, fo-
cusing mainly on the preparatory stages
for defining the task and annotating the
data. The task to perform was described
in the challenge?s call as follows: given a
set of RDF triples containing facts about
a celebrity, select those triples that are re-
flected in the target text (i.e., a short bi-
ography about that celebrity). From the
initial nine expressions of interest, finally
two participants submitted their systems
for evaluation.
