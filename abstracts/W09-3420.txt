 
This paper describes semi-automatic construc-
tion of Thai WordNet and the applied method 
for Asian wordNet. Based on the Princeton 
WordNet, we develop a method in generating 
a WordNet by using an existing bi-lingual dic-
tionary. We align the PWN synset to a bi-
lingual dictionary through the English equiva-
lent and its part-of-speech (POS), automati-
cally. Manual translation is also employed af-
ter the alignment. We also develop a web-
based collaborative workbench, called KUI 
(Knowledge Unifying Initiator), for revising 
the result of synset assignment and provide a 
framework to create Asian WordNet via the 
linkage through PWN synset.
