The extension to new languages is a well
known bottleneck for rule-based systems.
Considerable human effort, which typi-
cally consists in re-writing from scratch
huge amounts of rules, is in fact required
to transfer the knowledge available to the
system from one language to a new one.
Provided sufficient annotated data, ma-
chine learning algorithms allow to mini-
mize the costs of such knowledge trans-
fer but, up to date, proved to be ineffec-
tive for some specific tasks. Among these,
the recognition and normalization of tem-
poral expressions still remains out of their
reach. Focusing on this task, and still ad-
hering to the rule-based framework, this
paper presents a bunch of experiments on
the automatic porting to Italian of a system
originally developed for Spanish. Differ-
ent automatic rule translation strategies are
evaluated and discussed, providing a com-
prehensive overview of the challenge.
