This paper presents techniques for reference-
free, automatic prediction of Machine Trans-
lation output quality at both sentence- and
document-level. In addition to helping with
document-level quality estimation, sentence-
level predictions are used for system selection,
improving the quality of the output transla-
tions. We present three system selection tech-
niques and perform evaluations that quantify
the gains across multiple domains and lan-
guage pairs.
