This paper presents a weakly-supervised
method for Chinese sentiment analysis
by incorporating lexical prior knowledge
obtained from English sentiment lexi-
cons through machine translation. A
mechanism is introduced to incorpo-
rate the prior information about polarity-
bearing words obtained from existing
sentiment lexicons into latent Dirichlet
allocation (LDA) where sentiment labels
are considered as topics. Experiments
on Chinese product reviews on mobile
phones, digital cameras, MP3 players,
and monitors demonstrate the feasibil-
ity and effectiveness of the proposed ap-
proach and show that the weakly su-
pervised LDA model performs as well
as supervised classifiers such as Naive
Bayes and Support vector Machines with
an average of 83% accuracy achieved
over a total of 5484 review documents.
Moreover, the LDA model is able to
extract highly domain-salient polarity
words from text.
