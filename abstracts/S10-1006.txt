SemEval-2 Task 8 focuses on Multi-way
classification of semantic relations between
pairs of nominals. The task was designed
to compare different approaches to seman-
tic relation classification and to provide a
standard testbed for future research. This
paper defines the task, describes the train-
ing and test data and the process of their
creation, lists the participating systems (10
teams, 28 runs), and discusses their results.
