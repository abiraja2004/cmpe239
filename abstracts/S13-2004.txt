In this paper we present the results of exper-
iments comparing (a) rich syntactic and se-
mantic feature sets and (b) big context win-
dows, for the TempEval time expression and
event segmentation and classification tasks.
We show that it is possible for models using
only lexical features to approach the perfor-
mance of models using rich syntactic and se-
mantic feature sets.
