We discuss a tagging scheme to tag data for
training information extraction models which
can extract the features of a product/service
and opinions about them from textual reviews,
and which can be used across different do-
mains with minimal adaptation. A simple tag-
ging scheme results in a large number of do-
main dependent opinion phrases and impedes
the usefulness of the trained models across do-
mains. We show that by using minor mod-
ifications to this simple tagging scheme the
number of domain dependent opinion phrases
are reduced from 36% to 17%, which leads to
models more useful across domains.
