In this paper, we present a system for Ara-
bic semantic role labeling (SRL) based on
SVMs and standard features. The system is
evaluated on the released SEMEVAL 2007
development and test data. The results show
an F?=1 score of 94.06 on argument bound-
ary detection and an overall F?=1 score of
81.43 on the complete semantic role label-
ing task using gold parse trees.
