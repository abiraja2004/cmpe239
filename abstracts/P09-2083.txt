In this paper, we analyze the impact of
different automatic annotation methods on
the performance of supervised approaches
to the complex question answering prob-
lem (defined in the DUC-2007 main task).
Huge amount of annotated or labeled
data is a prerequisite for supervised train-
ing. The task of labeling can be ac-
complished either by humans or by com-
puter programs. When humans are em-
ployed, the whole process becomes time
consuming and expensive. So, in order
to produce a large set of labeled data we
prefer the automatic annotation strategy.
We apply five different automatic anno-
tation techniques to produce labeled data
using ROUGE similarity measure, Ba-
sic Element (BE) overlap, syntactic sim-
ilarity measure, semantic similarity mea-
sure, and Extended String Subsequence
Kernel (ESSK). The representative super-
vised methods we use are Support Vec-
tor Machines (SVM), Conditional Ran-
dom Fields (CRF), Hidden Markov Mod-
els (HMM), and Maximum Entropy (Max-
Ent). Evaluation results are presented to
show the impact.
