We re-investigate the rationale for and the ef-
fectiveness of adopting the notions of depth
and density in WordNet-based semantic sim-
ilarity measures. We show that the intuition
for including these notions in WordNet-based
similarity measures does not always stand up
to empirical examination. In particular, the
traditional definitions of depth and density
as ordinal integer values in the hierarchical
structure of WordNet does not always corre-
late with human judgment of lexical semantic
similarity, which imposes strong limitations
on their contribution to an accurate similarity
measure. We thus propose several novel defi-
nitions of depth and density, which yield sig-
nificant improvement in degree of correlation
with similarity. When used in WordNet-based
semantic similarity measures, the new defini-
tions consistently improve performance on a
task of correlating with human judgment.
