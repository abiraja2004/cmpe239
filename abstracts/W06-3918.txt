This paper introduces the Alligator theorem prover for Dependent Type Systems (dts).
We start with highlighting a number of properties of dts that make them specifically suited
for computational semantics. We then briefly introduce dts and our implementation. The
paper concludes with an example of a dts proof that illustrates the suitability of dts for
modelling anaphora resolution.
