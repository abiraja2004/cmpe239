In order to realize the full potential of
dependency-based syntactic parsing, it is
desirable to allow non-projective depen-
dency structures. We show how a data-
driven deterministic dependency parser,
in itself restricted to projective structures,
can be combined with graph transforma-
tion techniques to produce non-projective
structures. Experiments using data from
the Prague Dependency Treebank show
that the combined system can handle non-
projective constructions with a precision
sufficient to yield a significant improve-
ment in overall parsing accuracy. This
leads to the best reported performance for
robust non-projective parsing of Czech.
