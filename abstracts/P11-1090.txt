This paper describes an unsupervised dynamic
graphical model for morphological segmen-
tation and bilingual morpheme alignment for
statistical machine translation. The model ex-
tends Hidden Semi-Markov chain models by
using factored output nodes and special struc-
tures for its conditional probability distribu-
tions. It relies on morpho-syntactic and lex-
ical source-side information (part-of-speech,
morphological segmentation) while learning a
morpheme segmentation over the target lan-
guage. Our model outperforms a competi-
tive word alignment system in alignment qual-
ity. Used in a monolingual morphological seg-
mentation setting it substantially improves ac-
curacy over previous state-of-the-art models
on three Arabic and Hebrew datasets.
