Electroencephalography (EEG) and magne-
toencephalography (MEG) are closely related
neuroimaging technologies that both measure
summed electrical activity of synchronous
sources of neural activity. However they dif-
fer in the portions of the brain to which they
are more sensitive, in the frequency bands they
can detect, and to the amount of noise to which
they are subject. Since semantic representa-
tions are thought to be widely distributed in
the brain, this preliminary study considered
if the broader coverage offered by simulta-
neous EEG/MEG recordings would increase
sensitivity to these cognitive states. The re-
sults showed that MEG data allowed stim-
uli in two semantic categories (mammals and
tools) to be distinguished more accurately, de-
spite some experimental settings that were op-
timised for EEG. The addition of EEG data
did not prove informative, indicating that it
may be redundant relative to MEG, even when
using dimensionality reduction techniques to
combat overfitting.
