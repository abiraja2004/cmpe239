Even though historical texts reveal a lot of
interesting information on culture and social
structure in the past, information access is lim-
ited and in most cases the only way to find the
information you are looking for is to manually
go through large volumes of text, searching
for interesting text segments. In this paper we
will explore the idea of facilitating this time-
consuming manual effort, using existing natu-
ral language processing techniques. Attention
is focused on automatically identifying verbs
in early modern Swedish texts (1550?1800).
The results indicate that it is possible to iden-
tify linguistic categories such as verbs in texts
from this period with a high level of precision
and recall, using morphological tools devel-
oped for present-day Swedish, if the text is
normalised into a more modern spelling be-
fore the morphological tools are applied.
