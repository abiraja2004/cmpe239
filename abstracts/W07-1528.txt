We propose a new XML format for repre-
senting interlinearized glossed text (IGT),
particularly in the context of the documen-
tation and description of endangered lan-
guages. The proposed representation, which
we call IGT-XML, builds on previous mod-
els but provides a more loosely coupled and
flexible representation of different annota-
tion layers. Designed to accommodate both
selective manual reannotation of individual
layers and semi-automatic extension of an-
notation, IGT-XML is a first step toward par-
tial automation of the production of IGT.
