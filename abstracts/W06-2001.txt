This paper presents the automatic exten-
sion to other languages of TERSEO, a
knowledge-based system for the recogni-
tion and normalization of temporal ex-
pressions originally developed for Span-
ish1. TERSEO was first extended to En-
glish through the automatic translation of
the temporal expressions. Then, an im-
proved porting process was applied to Ital-
ian, where the automatic translation of
the temporal expressions from English and
from Spanish was combined with the ex-
traction of new expressions from an Ital-
ian annotated corpus. Experimental re-
sults demonstrate how, while still adher-
ing to the rule-based paradigm, the devel-
opment of automatic rule translation pro-
cedures allowed us to minimize the ef-
fort required for porting to new languages.
Relying on such procedures, and without
any manual effort or previous knowledge
of the target language, TERSEO recog-
nizes and normalizes temporal expressions
in Italian with good results (72% precision
and 83% recall for recognition).
