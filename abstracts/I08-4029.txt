 
In Chinese, most of the language process-
ing starts from word segmentation and 
part-of-speech (POS) tagging. These two 
steps tokenize the word from a sequence 
of characters and predict the syntactic la-
bels for each segmented word. In this pa-
per, we present two distinct sequential 
tagging models for the above two tasks. 
The first word segmentation model was 
basically similar to previous work which 
made use of conditional random fields 
(CRF) and set of predefined dictionaries 
to recognize word boundaries. Second, we 
revise and modify support vector ma-
chine-based chunking model to label the 
POS tag in the tagging task. Our method 
in the WS task achieves moderately rank 
among all participants, while in the POS 
tagging task, it reaches very competitive 
results.
