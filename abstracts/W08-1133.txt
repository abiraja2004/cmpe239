In the first REG competition, researchers
proposed several general-purpose algorithms
for attribute selection for referring expression
generation. However, most of this work did
not take into account: a) stylistic differences
between speakers; or b) trainable surface re-
alization approaches that combine semantic
and word order information. In this paper we
describe and evaluate several end-to-end re-
ferring expression generation algorithms that
take into consideration speaker style and use
data-driven surface realization techniques.
