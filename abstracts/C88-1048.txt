 
Viewing the syntactic analysis of natural anguage as a 
search problem, the right choice of parsing strategy 
plays an important role in the performance of natural 
language \[arsers. After a motivatim: of the use of 
various heuristic riteria, a fl'amework for defining and 
testing par:;\[ng strategies i  presented. On this basis 
systematic tests on different parsing strategies have 
been performed, the results of which are dicussed. 
Generally ;hese tests show that a "guided" depth- 
oriented strategy gives a considerable reduction of 
search effort eompared to the classical depth.first 
strategy.
