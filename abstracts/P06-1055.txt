We present an automatic approach to tree annota-
tion in which basic nonterminal symbols are alter-
nately split and merged to maximize the likelihood
of a training treebank. Starting with a simple X-
bar grammar, we learn a new grammar whose non-
terminals are subsymbols of the original nontermi-
nals. In contrast with previous work, we are able
to split various terminals to different degrees, as ap-
propriate to the actual complexity in the data. Our
grammars automatically learn the kinds of linguistic
distinctions exhibited in previous work on manual
tree annotation. On the other hand, our grammars
are much more compact and substantially more ac-
curate than previous work on automatic annotation.
Despite its simplicity, our best grammar achieves
an F1 of 90.2% on the Penn Treebank, higher than
fully lexicalized systems.
