 
We present a word alignment procedure based 
on a syntactic dependency analysis of 
French/English parallel corpora called 
?alignment by syntactic propagation?. Both 
corpora are analysed with a deep and robust 
parser. Starting with an anchor pair consisting 
of two words which are potential translations 
of one another within aligned sentences, the 
alignment link is propagated to the 
syntactically connected words. The method 
was tested on two corpora and achieved a 
precision of 94.3 and 93.1% as well as a recall 
of 58 and 56%, respectively for each corpus.
