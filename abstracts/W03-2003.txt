 
We describe the overview of patent re-
trieval task at NTCIR-3. The main task was 
the technical survey task, where participants 
tried to retrieve relevant patents to news ar-
ticles. In this paper, we introduce the task 
design, the patent collections, the character-
istics of the submitted systems, and the re-
sults overview. We also arranged the free-
styled task, where participants could try 
anything they want as far as the patent col-
lections were used. We describe the brief 
summaries of the proposals submitted to the 
free-styled task.
