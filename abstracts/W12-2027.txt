Some grammatical error detection methods,
including the ones currently used by the Edu-
cational Testing Service?s e-rater system (At-
tali and Burstein, 2006), are tuned for pre-
cision because of the perceived high cost
of false positives (i.e., marking fluent En-
glish as ungrammatical). Precision, however,
is not optimal for all tasks, particularly the
HOO 2012 Shared Task on grammatical er-
rors, which uses F-score for evaluation. In this
paper, we extend e-rater?s preposition and de-
terminer error detection modules with a large-
scale n-gram method (Bergsma et al, 2009)
that complements the existing rule-based and
classifier-based methods. On the HOO 2012
Shared Task, the hybrid method performed
better than its component methods in terms of
F-score, and it was competitive with submis-
sions from other HOO 2012 participants.
