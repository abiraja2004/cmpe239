This article discusses the detection of dis-
course markers (DM) in dialog transcriptions,
by human annotators and by automated
means. After a theoretical discussion of the
definition of DMs and their relevance to natu-
ral language processing, we focus on the role
of like as a DM. Results from experiments
with human annotators show that detection of
DMs is a difficult but reliable task, which re-
quires prosodic information from soundtracks.
Then, several types of features are defined for
automatic disambiguation of like: colloca-
tions, part-of-speech tags and duration-based
features. Decision-tree learning shows that for
like, nearly 70% precision can be reached,
with near 100% recall, mainly using colloca-
tion filters. Similar results hold for well, with
about 91% precision at 100% recall.
