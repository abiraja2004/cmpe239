Natural Language Interfaces to Databases
(NLIs) can benefit from the advances in statis-
tical parsing over the last fifteen years or so.
However, statistical parsers require training on
a massive, labeled corpus, and manually cre-
ating such a corpus for each database is pro-
hibitively expensive. To address this quandary,
this paper reports on the PRECISE NLI, which
uses a statistical parser as a ?plug in?. The pa-
per shows how a strong semantic model cou-
pled with ?light re-training? enables PRECISE
to overcome parser errors, and correctly map
from parsed questions to the corresponding
SQL queries. We discuss the issues in using
statistical parsers to build database-independent
NLIs, and report on experimental results with
the benchmark ATIS data set where PRECISE
achieves 94% accuracy.
