We propose a novel approach to the iden-
tification of biomedical terms in research
publications using the Perceptron HMM
algorithm. Each important term is iden-
tified and classified into a biomedical con-
cept class. Our proposed system achieves
a 68.6% F-measure based on 2,000 train-
ing Medline abstracts and 404 unseen
testing Medline abstracts. The system
achieves performance that is close to the
state-of-the-art using only a small feature
set. The Perceptron HMM algorithm pro-
vides an easy way to incorporate many po-
tentially interdependent features.
