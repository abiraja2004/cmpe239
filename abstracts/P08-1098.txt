We extend the classical single-task active
learning (AL) approach. In the multi-task ac-
tive learning (MTAL) paradigm, we select ex-
amples for several annotation tasks rather than
for a single one as usually done in the con-
text of AL. We introduce two MTAL meta-
protocols, alternating selection and rank com-
bination, and propose a method to implement
them in practice. We experiment with a two-
task annotation scenario that includes named
entity and syntactic parse tree annotations on
three different corpora. MTAL outperforms
random selection and a stronger baseline, one-
sided example selection, in which one task is
pursued using AL and the selected examples
are provided also to the other task.
