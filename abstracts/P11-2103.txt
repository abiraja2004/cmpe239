Although Subjectivity and Sentiment Analysis
(SSA) has been witnessing a flurry of novel re-
search, there are few attempts to build SSA
systems for Morphologically-Rich Languages
(MRL). In the current study, we report efforts
to partially fill this gap. We present a newly
developed manually annotated corpus of Mod-
ern Standard Arabic (MSA) together with a
new polarity lexicon.The corpus is a collec-
tion of newswire documents annotated on the
sentence level. We also describe an automatic
SSA tagging system that exploits the anno-
tated data. We investigate the impact of differ-
ent levels of preprocessing settings on the SSA
classification task. We show that by explicitly
accounting for the rich morphology the system
is able to achieve significantly higher levels of
performance.
