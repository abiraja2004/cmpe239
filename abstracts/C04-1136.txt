This paper presents a statistical model that in-
terprets the evaluation of ranking methods as
a random experiment. This model predicts the
variability of evaluation results, so that appro-
priate significance tests for the results can be
derived. The paper concludes with an empirical
validation of the model on a collocation extrac-
tion task.
