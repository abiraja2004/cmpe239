. Partial parsing techniques try to recover syntactic informa-
tion efficiently and reliably by sacrificing completeness and depth of anal-
ysis. One of the difficulties of partial parsing is finding a means to extract
the grammar involved automatically. In this paper, we present a method
for automatically extracting partial parsing rules from a tree-annotated
corpus using decision tree induction. We define the partial parsing rules
as those that can decide the structure of a substring in an input sentence
deterministically. This decision can be considered as a classification; as
such, for a substring in an input sentence, a proper structure is chosen
among the structures occurred in the corpus. For the classification, we
use decision tree induction, and induce partial parsing rules from the
decision tree. The acquired grammar is similar to a phrase structure
grammar, with contextual and lexical information, but it allows building
structures of depth one or more. Our experiments showed that the pro-
posed partial parser using the automatically extracted rules is not only
accurate and efficient, but also achieves reasonable coverage for Korean.
