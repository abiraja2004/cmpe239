This paper examines the resolution of the
second person English pronoun you in
multi-party dialogue. Following previous
work, we attempt to classify instances as
generic or referential, and in the latter case
identify the singular or plural addressee.
We show that accuracy and robustness can
be improved by use of simple lexical fea-
tures, capturing the intuition that different
uses and addressees are associated with
different vocabularies; and we show that
there is an advantage to treating referen-
tiality and addressee identification as sep-
arate (but connected) problems.
