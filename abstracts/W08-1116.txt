 
This paper explores how the main question 
addressed in Text Planning has evolved over 
the last twenty years. Earlier approaches to 
text planning asked the question: How do we 
write a good text?, and whatever answers 
were found were programmed directly into 
code. With the introduction of search-based 
text planning in recent years, the focus shifted 
to the evaluation function, and thus the ques-
tion became: How do we tell if a text is good? 
This paper will explore these evolving ques-
tions, and subsequent refinements of them as 
the field matures.
