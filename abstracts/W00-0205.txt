 
Machine translation between any two languages re- 
quires the generation of information that is implicit 
in the source language. In translating from Chinese 
to English, tense and other temporal information 
must be inferred from other grammatical and lex- 
ical cues. Moreover, Chinese multiple-clause sen- 
tences may contain inter-clausal relations (temporal 
or otherwise) that must be explicit in English (e.g., 
by means of a discourse marker). Perfective and im- 
perfective grammatical aspect markers can provide 
cues to temporal structure, but such information is 
not present in every sentence. We report on a project 
to use the \]exical aspect features of (a)te\]icity re- 
flected in the Lexical Conceptual Structure of the 
input text to suggest ense and discourse structure 
in the English translation of a Chinese newspaper 
corpus.
