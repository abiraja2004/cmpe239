Coordination disambiguation remains a dif-
ficult sub-problem in parsing despite the
frequency and importance of coordination
structures. We propose a method for disam-
biguating coordination structures. In this
method, dual decomposition is used as a
framework to take advantage of both HPSG
parsing and coordinate structure analysis
with alignment-based local features. We
evaluate the performance of the proposed
method on the Genia corpus and the Wall
Street Journal portion of the Penn Tree-
bank. Results show it increases the per-
centage of sentences in which coordination
structures are detected correctly, compared
with each of the two algorithms alone.
