 
The previously proposed semanl ic -head-dr iw ' .n  Ken -
eration methods run into problems if none of the 
daughter eonstituents in the syntact.o-semantic rule 
schemata of a grammar fits the definition of a semantic 
head given in \[Shieber et al, 1990\]. This is the case 
for the semantic analysis rnles of certain constraint- 
based semantic representations, e.g. Underspecified 
Discourse R,epresentation Structures (UI)RSs) \[l!'rank 
and R.eyle, 1992\]. 
Since head-driven generation in general has its me> 
its, we simply return to a syntactic definition of 
qmad' and demonstrate the feasibility of synlac l ic -  
head-clriveu generation. In addition to its generality, 
a syntactic-head-driven algorithm provides a basis for 
a logically well-defined treatment of the nmvement of 
(syntactic) heads, for which only ad-hoc solutions ex- 
isted, so far.
