The paper presents an application of
Structural Correspondence Learning
(SCL) (Blitzer et al, 2006) for domain
adaptation of a stochastic attribute-value
grammar (SAVG). So far, SCL has
been applied successfully in NLP for
Part-of-Speech tagging and Sentiment
Analysis (Blitzer et al, 2006; Blitzer
et al, 2007). An attempt was made
in the CoNLL 2007 shared task to ap-
ply SCL to non-projective dependency
parsing (Shimizu and Nakagawa, 2007),
however, without any clear conclusions.
We report on our exploration of applying
SCL to adapt a syntactic disambiguation
model and show promising initial results
on Wikipedia domains.
