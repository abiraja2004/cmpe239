In this paper, we address the problem of
identifying relevant product aspects in a
collection of online customer reviews. Be-
ing able to detect such aspects represents
an important subtask of aspect-based re-
view mining systems, which aim at auto-
matically generating structured summaries
of customer opinions. We cast the task as
a terminology extraction problem and ex-
amine the utility of varying term acquisi-
tion heuristics, filtering techniques, vari-
ant aggregation methods, and relevance
measures. We evaluate the different ap-
proaches on two distinct datasets (hotel
and camera reviews). For the best config-
uration, we find significant improvements
over a state-of-the-art baseline method.
