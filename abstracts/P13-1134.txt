We present a new bilingual FrameNet lex-
icon for English and German. It is cre-
ated through a simple, but powerful ap-
proach to construct a FrameNet in any
language using Wiktionary as an inter-
lingual representation. Our approach is
based on a sense alignment of FrameNet
and Wiktionary, and subsequent transla-
tion disambiguation into the target lan-
guage. We perform a detailed evaluation
of the created resource and a discussion of
Wiktionary as an interlingual connection
for the cross-language transfer of lexical-
semantic resources. The created resource
is publicly available at http://www.
ukp.tu-darmstadt.de/fnwkde/.
