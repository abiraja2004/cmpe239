Cross-lingual adaptation aims to learn a pre-
diction model in a label-scarce target lan-
guage by exploiting labeled data from a label-
rich source language. An effective cross-
lingual adaptation system can substantially re-
duce the manual annotation effort required in
many natural language processing tasks. In
this paper, we propose a new cross-lingual
adaptation approach for document classifica-
tion based on learning cross-lingual discrim-
inative distributed representations of words.
Specifically, we propose to maximize the log-
likelihood of the documents from both lan-
guage domains under a cross-lingual log-
bilinear document model, while minimizing
the prediction log-losses of labeled docu-
ments. We conduct extensive experiments on
cross-lingual sentiment classification tasks of
Amazon product reviews. Our experimental
results demonstrate the efficacy of the pro-
posed cross-lingual adaptation approach.
