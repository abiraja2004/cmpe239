We describe the methodology for constructing axioms defining event-related words, anchored
in core theories of change of state and causality. We first derive from WordNet senses a smaller
set of abstract, general ?supersenses?. We encode axioms for these, and we test them on textual
entailment pairs. We look at two specific examples in detail to illustrate both the power of the
method and the holes in the knowledge base that it exposes. Then we address the problem of holes
more systematically, asking, for example, what kinds of ?pairwise interactions? are possible for core
theory predicates like change and cause.1
