This paper describes a non-statistical
approach for semantic annotation of
documents by analysing their syntax
and by using semantic/syntactic behav-
iour patterns described in VerbNet. We
use a two-stage approach, firstly iden-
tifying the semantic roles in a sen-
tence, and then using these roles to rep-
resent some of the relations between
the concepts in the sentence and a list
of noun behaviour patterns to resolve
some of the unknown (generic) rela-
tions between concepts. All outlined
algorithms were tested on two corpora
which differs in size, type, style and
genre, and the performance does not
vary significantly.
