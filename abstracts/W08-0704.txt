This paper describes a variety of non-
parametric Bayesian models of word segmen-
tation based on Adaptor Grammars that model
different aspects of the input and incorporate
different kinds of prior knowledge, and ap-
plies them to the Bantu language Sesotho.
While we find overall word segmentation ac-
curacies lower than these models achieve on
English, we also find some interesting dif-
ferences in which factors contribute to better
word segmentation. Specifically, we found lit-
tle improvement to word segmentation accu-
racy when we modeled contextual dependen-
cies, while modeling morphological structure
did improve segmentation accuracy.
