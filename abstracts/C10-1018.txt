Relation extraction is the task of recog-
nizing semantic relations among entities.
Given a particular sentence supervised ap-
proaches to Relation Extraction employed
feature or kernel functions which usu-
ally have a single sentence in their scope.
The overall aim of this paper is to pro-
pose methods for using knowledge and re-
sources that are external to the target sen-
tence, as a way to improve relation ex-
traction. We demonstrate this by exploit-
ing background knowledge such as rela-
tionships among the target relations, as
well as by considering how target rela-
tions relate to some existing knowledge
resources. Our methods are general and
we suggest that some of them could be ap-
plied to other NLP tasks.
