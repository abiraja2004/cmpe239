This paper presents a deterministic pars-
ing algorithm for projective dependency
grammar. In a bottom-up way the al-
gorithm finds the local optimum dynam-
ically. A constraint procedure is made
to use more structure information. The
algorithm parses sentences in linear time
and labeling is integrated with the parsing.
This parser achieves 63.29% labeled at-
tachment score on the average in CoNLL-
X Shared Task.
