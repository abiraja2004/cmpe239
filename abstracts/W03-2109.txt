Recently the technology for speech recog-
nition and language processing for spoken
dialogue systems has been improved, and
speech recognition systems and dialogue
systems have been developed to the ex-
tent of practical usage. In order to become
more practical, not only those fundamen-
tal techniques but also the techniques of
portability and expansibility should be de-
veloped. In our previous research, we
demonstrated the portability of the speech
recognition module to a developed portal
spoken dialogue system. And we con-
structed a dialogue strategy design tool
of dialogue script for controlling the dia-
logue strategy.
In this paper, we report a highly portable
interpreter using a commercial electronic
dictionary. We apply this to three do-
mains/tasks and confirm the validity of the
interpreter for each domain/task.
Keywords: spoken dialogue system, robust inter-
