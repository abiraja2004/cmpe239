This paper describes a log-linear model with
an n-gram reference distribution for accurate
probabilistic HPSG parsing. In the model,
the n-gram reference distribution is simply
defined as the product of the probabilities
of selecting lexical entries, which are pro-
vided by the discriminative method with ma-
chine learning features of word and POS
n-gram as defined in the CCG/HPSG/CDG
supertagging. Recently, supertagging be-
comes well known to drastically improve
the parsing accuracy and speed, but su-
pertagging techniques were heuristically in-
troduced, and hence the probabilistic mod-
els for parse trees were not well defined.
We introduce the supertagging probabilities
as a reference distribution for the log-linear
model of the probabilistic HPSG. This is the
first model which properly incorporates the
supertagging probabilities into parse tree?s
probabilistic model.
