 
This paper describes the development and 
use of an interface for visually evaluating 
distance measures. The combination of 
multidimensional scaling plots, histograms 
and tables allows for different stages of 
overview and detail. The interdisciplinary 
project Rule-based search in text databases 
with nonstandard orthography develops a 
fuzzy full text search engine and uses dis-
tance measures for historical text document 
retrieval. This engine should provide easier 
text access for experts as well as interested 
amateurs.
