This paper describes SENSELEARNER ? a
minimally supervised word sense disam-
biguation system that attempts to disam-
biguate all content words in a text using
WordNet senses. We evaluate the accu-
racy of SENSELEARNER on several stan-
dard sense-annotated data sets, and show
that it compares favorably with the best re-
sults reported during the recent SENSEVAL
evaluations.
