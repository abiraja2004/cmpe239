We present a novel machine translation model
which models translation by a linear sequence
of operations. In contrast to the ?N-gram?
model, this sequence includes not only trans-
lation but also reordering operations. Key
ideas of our model are (i) a new reordering
approach which better restricts the position to
which a word or phrase can be moved, and
is able to handle short and long distance re-
orderings in a unified way, and (ii) a joint
sequence model for the translation and re-
ordering probabilities which is more flexi-
ble than standard phrase-based MT. We ob-
serve statistically significant improvements in
BLEU over Moses for German-to-English and
Spanish-to-English tasks, and comparable re-
sults for a French-to-English task.
