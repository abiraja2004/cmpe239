The R2D2 systems for the English All-Words and
Lexical Sample tasks at SENSEVAL-3 are based on
several supervised and unsupervised methods com-
bined by means of a voting procedure. Main goal
was to take advantage of training data when avail-
able, and getting maximum coverage with the help
of methods that not need such learning examples.
The results reported in this paper show that super-
vised and unsupervised methods working in par-
allel, and a simple sequence of preferences when
comparing the answers of such methods, is a feasi-
ble method. . .
The whole system is, in fact, a cascade of deci-
sions of what label to assign to a concrete instance
based on the agreement of pairs of systems, when
it is possible, or selecting the available answer from
one of them. In this way, supervised are preferred to
unsupervised methods, but these last ones are able
to tag such words that not have available training
data.
