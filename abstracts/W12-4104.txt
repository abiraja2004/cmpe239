We learn graph-based similarity measures for
the task of extracting word synonyms from a
corpus of parsed text. A constrained graph
walk variant that has been successfully ap-
plied in the past in similar settings is shown to
outperform a state-of-the-art syntactic vector-
based approach on this task. Further, we show
that learning specialized similarity measures
for different word types is advantageous.
