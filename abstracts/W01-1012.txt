 
Decanter illustrates a heuristic 
approach to extraction for information 
retrieval and question answering. 
Generic information about 
argumentative text is found and 
stored, easing user-focused, question-
driven access to the core information.  
The emphasis is placed on the 
argumentative dimension, to address 
in particular three types of questions: 
?What are the points??, ?Based on 
what?? ?What are the comments??. 
The areas of application of this 
approach include: question-answering, 
information retrieval, summarization, 
critical thinking and assistance to 
speed reading.
