Inspired by the success of English
grapheme-to-phoneme research in speech
synthesis, many researchers have pro-
posed phoneme-based English-to-Chinese
transliteration models. However, such ap-
proaches have severely suffered from the
errors in Chinese phoneme-to-grapheme
conversion. To address this issue,
we propose a new English-to-Chinese
transliteration model and make system-
atic comparisons with the conventional
models. Our proposed model relies on
the joint use of Chinese phonemes and
their corresponding English graphemes
and phonemes. Experiments showed that
Chinese phonemes in our proposed model
can contribute to the performance im-
provement in English-to-Chinese translit-
eration.
