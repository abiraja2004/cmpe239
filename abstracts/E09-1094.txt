This paper presents a new, exemplar-based
model of thematic fit. In contrast to pre-
vious models, it does not approximate
thematic fit as argument plausibility or
?fit with verb selectional preferences?, but
directly as semantic role plausibility for
a verb-argument pair, through similarity-
based generalization from previously seen
verb-argument pairs. This makes the
model very robust for data sparsity. We
argue that the model is easily extensible to
a model of semantic role ambiguity reso-
lution during online sentence comprehen-
sion.
The model is evaluated on human seman-
tic role plausibility judgments. Its predic-
tions correlate significantly with the hu-
man judgments. It rivals two state-of-the-
art models of thematic fit and exceeds their
performance on previously unseen or low-
frequency items.
