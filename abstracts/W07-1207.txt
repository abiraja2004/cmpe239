We describe a framework for deep linguis-
tic processing for natural language under-
standing in task-oriented spoken dialogue
systems. The goal is to create domain-
general processing techniques that can be
shared across all domains and dialogue
tasks, combined with domain-specific op-
timization based on an ontology mapping
from the generic LF to the application  on-
tology. This framework has been tested in
six domains that involve tasks such as in-
teractive planning, coordination operations,
tutoring, and learning.
