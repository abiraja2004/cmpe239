 
We present a comparison of two approaches for 
Arabic-Chinese machine translation using Eng-
lish as a pivot language: sentence pivoting and 
phrase-table pivoting. Our results show that 
using English as a pivot in either approach out-
performs direct translation from Arabic to Chi-
nese.  Our best result is the phrase-pivot system 
which scores higher than direct translation by 
1.1 BLEU points. An error analysis of our best 
system shows that we successfully handle many 
complex Arabic-Chinese syntactic variations.
