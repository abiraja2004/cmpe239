In this paper we provide a formalization of
a set of default rules that we claim are re-
quired for the transfer of information such
as causation, event rate and duration in the
interpretation of metaphor. Such rules are
domain-independent and are identified as in-
variant adjuncts to any conceptual metaphor.
We also show a way of embedding the in-
variant mappings in a semantic framework.
