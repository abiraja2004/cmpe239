During the course of first language acquisi-
tion, children produce linguistic forms that do
not conform to adult grammar. In this paper,
we introduce a data set and approach for sys-
tematically modeling this child-adult grammar
divergence. Our corpus consists of child sen-
tences with corrected adult forms. We bridge
the gap between these forms with a discrim-
inatively reranked noisy channel model that
translates child sentences into equivalent adult
utterances. Our method outperforms MT and
ESL baselines, reducing child error by 20%.
Our model allows us to chart specific aspects
of grammar development in longitudinal stud-
ies of children, and investigate the hypothesis
that children share a common developmental
path in language acquisition.
