 
Human annotation for Co-reference Resolu-
tion (CRR) is labor intensive and costly, and 
only a handful of annotated corpora are cur-
rently available. However, corpora with 
Named Entity (NE) annotations are widely 
available. Also, unlike current CRR systems, 
state-of-the-art NER systems have very high 
accuracy and can generate NE labels that are 
very close to the gold standard for unlabeled 
corpora.  We propose a new set of metrics col-
lectively called CONE for Named Entity Co-
reference Resolution (NE-CRR) that use a 
subset of gold standard annotations, with the 
advantage that this subset can be easily ap-
proximated using NE labels when gold stan-
dard CRR annotations are absent. We define 
CONE B3 and CONE CEAF metrics based on 
the traditional B3 and CEAF metrics and show 
that CONE B3 and CONE CEAF scores of any 
CRR system on any dataset are highly corre-
lated with its B3 and CEAF scores respectively. 
We obtain correlation factors greater than 0.6 
for all CRR systems across all datasets, and a 
best-case correlation factor of 0.8. We also 
present a baseline method to estimate the gold 
standard required by CONE metrics, and show 
that CONE B3 and CONE CEAF scores using 
this estimated gold standard are also correlated 
with B3 and CEAF scores respectively. We 
thus demonstrate the suitability of CONE 
B3and CONE CEAF for automatic evaluation 
of NE-CRR.
