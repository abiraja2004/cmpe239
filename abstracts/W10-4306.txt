We introduce a novel approach for robust
belief tracking of user intention within
a spoken dialog system. The space of
user intentions is modeled by a proba-
bilistic extension of the underlying do-
main ontology called a probabilistic on-
tology tree (POT). POTs embody a prin-
cipled approach to leverage the dependen-
cies among domain concepts and incorpo-
rate corroborating or conflicting dialog ob-
servations in the form of interpreted user
utterances across dialog turns. We tailor
standard inference algorithms to the POT
framework to efficiently compute the user
intentions in terms of m-best most proba-
ble explanations. We empirically validate
the efficacy of our POT and compare it to
a hierarchical frame-based approach in ex-
periments with users of a tourism informa-
tion system.
