 
This paper explores the contribution 
of a broad range of syntactic features 
to WSD: grammatical relations coded 
as the presence of adjuncts/arguments 
in isolation or as subcategorization 
frames, and instantiated grammatical 
relations between words. We have 
tested the performance of syntactic 
features using two different ML 
algorithms (Decision Lists and 
AdaBoost) on the Senseval-2 data. 
Adding syntactic features to a basic 
set of traditional features improves 
performance, especially for AdaBoost. 
In addition, several methods to build 
arbitrarily high accuracy WSD 
systems are also tried, showing that 
syntactic features allow for a precision 
of 86% and a coverage of 26% or 95% 
precision and 8% coverage.
