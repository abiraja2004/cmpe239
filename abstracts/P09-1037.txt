Hierarchical phrase-based models are at-
tractive because they provide a consis-
tent framework within which to character-
ize both local and long-distance reorder-
ings, but they also make it difcult to
distinguish many implausible reorderings
from those that are linguistically plausi-
ble. Rather than appealing to annotation-
driven syntactic modeling, we address this
problem by observing the inuential role
of function words in determining syntac-
tic structure, and introducing soft con-
straints on function word relationships as
part of a standard log-linear hierarchi-
cal phrase-based model. Experimentation
on Chinese-English and Arabic-English
translation demonstrates that the approach
yields signicant gains in performance.
