We report on work in progress on using
very simple statistics in an unsupervised
fashion to re-rank search engine results
when review-oriented queries are issued;
the goal is to bring opinionated or subjec-
tive results to the top of the results list. We
find that our proposed technique performs
comparably to methods that rely on sophis-
ticated pre-encoded linguistic knowledge,
and that both substantially improve the ini-
tial results produced by the Yahoo! search
engine.
