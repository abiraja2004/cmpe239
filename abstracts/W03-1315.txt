The classification task is an integral part of
named entity extraction. This task has not
received much attention in the biomedi-
cal setting, partly due to the fact that pro-
tein name recognition has been the focus
of the majority of the work in this field.
We study this problem and focus on dif-
ferent sources of information that can be
utilized for the classification task and in-
vestigate the extent of their contributions
for classification in this domain. However,
while developing a specific algorithm for
the classification of the names is not our
main focus, we make use of some simple
techniques to investigate different sources
of information and verify our intuitions
about their usefulness.
