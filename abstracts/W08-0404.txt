We investigate translation modeling based on
exponential estimates which generalize essen-
tial components of standard translation mod-
els. In application to a hierarchical phrase-
based system the simplest generalization al-
lows its models of lexical selection and re-
ordering to be conditioned on arbitrary at-
tributes of the source sentence and its anno-
tation. Viewing these estimates as approxi-
mations of sentence-level probabilities moti-
vates further elaborations that seek to exploit
general syntactic and morphological patterns.
Dimensionality control with `1 regularizers
makes it possible to negotiate the tradeoff be-
tween translation quality and decoding speed.
Putting together and extending several recent
advances in phrase-based translation we ar-
rive at a flexible modeling framework that al-
lows efficient leveraging of monolingual re-
sources and tools. Experiments with features
derived from the output of Chinese and Arabic
parsers and an Arabic lemmatizer show signif-
icant improvements over a strong baseline.
