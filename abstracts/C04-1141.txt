We introduce a new, linguistically grounded
measure of collocativity based on the property
of limited modifiability and test it on German
PP-verb combinations. We show that our mea-
sure not only significantly outperforms the stan-
dard lexical association measures typically em-
ployed for collocation extraction, but also yields
a valuable by-product for the creation of col-
location databases, viz. possible structural and
lexical attributes. Our approach is language-,
structure-, and domain-independent because it
only requires some shallow syntactic analysis
(e.g., a POS-tagger and a phrase chunker).
