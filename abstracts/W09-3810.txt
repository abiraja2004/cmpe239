Several formalisms have been proposed
for modeling trees with discontinuous
phrases. Some of these formalisms allow
for synchronous rewriting. However, it
is unclear whether synchronous rewriting
is a necessary feature. This is an impor-
tant question, since synchronous rewrit-
ing greatly increases parsing complexity.
We present a characterization of recursive
synchronous rewriting in constituent tree-
banks with discontinuous annotation. An
empirical investigation reveals that syn-
chronous rewriting is actually a neces-
sary feature. Furthermore, we transfer this
property to grammars extracted from tree-
banks.
