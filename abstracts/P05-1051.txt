 
Information extraction systems incorpo-
rate multiple stages of linguistic analysis.  
Although errors are typically compounded 
from stage to stage, it is possible to re-
duce the errors in one stage by harnessing 
the results of the other stages.  We dem-
onstrate this by using the results of 
coreference analysis and relation extrac-
tion to reduce the errors produced by a 
Chinese name tagger.  We use an N-best 
approach to generate multiple hypotheses 
and have them re-ranked by subsequent 
stages of processing.  We obtained 
thereby a reduction of 24% in spurious 
and incorrect name tags, and a reduction 
of 14% in missed tags.
