 
Performance in speech recognition systems has progressed to the point where it is now realistic to begin 
integrating speech with natural language systems to produce spoken language systems. Two factors have 
contributed to the advances in speech: statistical modeling of the input signal and language constraints. 
To produce spoken language systems, then, the grammar formalisms used in natural language systems 
must incorporate statistical information and efficient parsers for these stochastic language models must be 
developed. In this paper we outline how chart parsing techniques provide advantages in both computation 
and accuracy for spoken language systems. We describe asystem that models all levels of the spoken language 
system using stochastic language models and present experimental results.
