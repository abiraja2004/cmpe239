 
We present an approach for extracting re-
lations from texts that exploits linguistic 
and empirical strategies, by means of a 
pipeline method involving a parser, part-
of-speech tagger, named entity recogni-
tion system, pattern-based classification 
and word sense disambiguation models, 
and resources such as ontology, knowl-
edge base and lexical databases. The rela-
tions extracted can be used for various 
tasks, including semantic web annotation 
and ontology learning. We suggest that 
the use of knowledge intensive strategies 
to process the input text and corpus-
based techniques to deal with unpredicted 
cases and ambiguity problems allows to 
accurately discover the relevant relations 
between pairs of entities in that text.
