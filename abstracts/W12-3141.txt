This paper describes LIMSI?s submissions to
the shared translation task. We report results
for French-English and German-English in
both directions. Our submissions use n-code,
an open source system based on bilingual
n-grams. In this approach, both the transla-
tion and target language models are estimated
as conventional smoothed n-gram models; an
approach we extend here by estimating the
translation probabilities in a continuous space
using neural networks. Experimental results
show a significant and consistent BLEU im-
provement of approximately 1 point for all
conditions. We also report preliminary experi-
ments using an ?on-the-fly? translation model.
