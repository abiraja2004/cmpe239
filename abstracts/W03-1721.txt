This paper presents a primarily data-driven Chi-
nese word segmentation system and its perfor-
mances on the closed track using two corpora at
the first international Chinese word segmentation
bakeoff. The system consists of a new words rec-
ognizer, a base segmentation algorithm, and pro-
cedures for combining single characters, suffixes,
and checking segmentation consistencies.
