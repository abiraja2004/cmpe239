The task of identifying redundant infor-
mation in documents that are generated
from multiple sources provides a signifi-
cant challenge for summarization and QA
systems. Traditional clustering techniques
detect redundancy at the sentential level
and do not guarantee the preservation of
all information within the document. We
discuss an algorithm that generates a novel
graph-based representation for a document
and then utilizes a set cover approximation
algorithm to remove redundant text from it.
Our experiments show that this approach
offers a significant performance advantage
over clustering when evaluated over an an-
notated dataset.
