In this paper we investigate the use of sev-
eral types of lexico-semantic information
for query expansion in the passage retrieval
component of our QA system. We have
used four corpus-based methods to acquire
semantically related words, and we have
used one hand-built resource. We eval-
uate our techniques on the Dutch CLEF
QA track.1 In our experiments expansions
that try to bridge the terminological gap
between question and document collection
do not result in any improvements. How-
ever, expansions bridging the knowledge
gap show modest improvements.
