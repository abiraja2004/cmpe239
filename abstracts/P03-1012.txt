Word alignment plays a crucial role in sta-
tistical machine translation. Word-aligned
corpora have been found to be an excellent
source of translation-related knowledge.
We present a statistical model for comput-
ing the probability of an alignment given a
sentence pair. This model allows easy in-
tegration of context-specific features. Our
experiments show that this model can be
an effective tool for improving an existing
word alignment.
