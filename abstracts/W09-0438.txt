In this paper we present a novel translit-
eration technique which is based on deep
belief networks. Common approaches
use finite state machines or other meth-
ods similar to conventional machine trans-
lation. Instead of using conventional NLP
techniques, the approach presented here
builds on deep belief networks, a tech-
nique which was shown to work well for
other machine learning problems. We
show that deep belief networks have cer-
tain properties which are very interesting
for transliteration and possibly also for
translation and that a combination with
conventional techniques leads to an im-
provement over both components on an
Arabic-English transliteration task.
