A challenging problem for spoken dialog sys-
tems is the design of utterance generation mod-
ules that are fast, flexible and general, yet pro-
duce high quality output in particular domains.
A promising approach is trainable generation,
which uses general-purpose linguistic knowledge
automatically adapted to the application do-
main. This paper presents a trainable sentence
planner for the MATCH dialog system. We
show that trainable sentence planning can pro-
duce output comparable to that of MATCH?s
template-based generator even for quite com-
plex information presentations.
