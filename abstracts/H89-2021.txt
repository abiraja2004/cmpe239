 
To study the spoken language interface in the context of a 
complex problem-solving task, a group of users were asked 
to perform a spreadsheet task, alternating voice and 
keyboard input. A total of 40 tasks were performed by each 
participant, the first thirty in a group (over several days), the 
remaining ones a month later. The voice spreadsheet 
program used in this study was extensively instrumented to 
provide detailed information about the components of the 
interaction. These data, as well as analysis of the 
participants's utterances and recognizer output, provide a 
fairly detailed picture of spoken language interaction. 
Although task completion by voice took longer than by 
keyboard, analysis hows that users would be able to per- 
form the spreadsheet task faster by voice, if two key criteria 
could be met: recognition occurs in real-time, and the error 
rate is sufficiently low. This initial experience with a spoken 
language system also allows us to identify several metrics, 
beyond those traditionally associated with speech recog- 
nition, that can be used to characterize system performance.
