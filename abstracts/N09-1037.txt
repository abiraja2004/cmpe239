For many language technology applications,
such as question answering, the overall sys-
tem runs several independent processors over
the data (such as a named entity recognizer, a
coreference system, and a parser). This eas-
ily results in inconsistent annotations, which
are harmful to the performance of the aggre-
gate system. We begin to address this prob-
lem with a joint model of parsing and named
entity recognition, based on a discriminative
feature-based constituency parser. Our model
produces a consistent output, where the named
entity spans do not conflict with the phrasal
spans of the parse tree. The joint represen-
tation also allows the information from each
type of annotation to improve performance
on the other, and, in experiments with the
OntoNotes corpus, we found improvements of
up to 1.36% absolute F1 for parsing, and up to
9.0% F1 for named entity recognition.
