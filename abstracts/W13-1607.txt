This paper describes a novel approach for sex-
ual predator detection in chat conversations
based on sequences of classifiers. The pro-
posed approach divides documents into three
parts, which, we hypothesize, correspond to
the different stages that a predator employs
when approaching a child. Local classifiers
are trained for each part of the documents and
their outputs are combined by a chain strat-
egy: predictions of a local classifier are used
as extra inputs for the next local classifier.
Additionally, we propose a ring-based strat-
egy, in which the chaining process is iterated
several times, with the goal of further improv-
ing the performance of our method. We re-
port experimental results on the corpus used
in the first international competition on sex-
ual predator identification (PAN?12). Experi-
mental results show that the proposed method
outperforms a standard (global) classification
technique for the different settings we con-
sider; besides the proposed method compares
favorably with most methods evaluated in the
PAN?12 competition.
