We present a light-weight tool for the an-
notation of linguistic data on multiple lev-
els. It is based on the simplification of an-
notations to sets of markables having at-
tributes and standing in certain relations
to each other. We describe the main fea-
tures of the tool, emphasizing its simplic-
ity, customizability and versatility.
