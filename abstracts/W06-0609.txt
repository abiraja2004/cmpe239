 
The PropBank primarily adds semantic 
role labels to the syntactic constituents in 
the parsed trees of the Treebank. The 
goal is for automatic semantic role label-
ing to be able to use the domain of local-
ity of a predicate in order to find its ar-
guments. In principle, this is exactly what 
is wanted, but in practice the PropBank 
annotators often make choices that do not 
actually conform to the Treebank parses. 
As a result, the syntactic features ex-
tracted by automatic semantic role label-
ing systems are often inconsistent and 
contradictory. This paper discusses in de-
tail the types of mismatches between the 
syntactic bracketing and the semantic 
role labeling that can be found, and our 
plans for reconciling them.
