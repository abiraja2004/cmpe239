This paper introduces a new application of boost-
ing for parse reranking. Several parsers have been
proposed that utilize the all-subtrees representa-
tion (e.g., tree kernel and data oriented parsing).
This paper argues that such an all-subtrees repre-
sentation is extremely redundant and a compara-
ble accuracy can be achieved using just a small
set of subtrees. We show how the boosting algo-
rithm can be applied to the all-subtrees representa-
tion and how it selects a small and relevant feature
set efficiently. Two experiments on parse rerank-
ing show that our method achieves comparable or
even better performance than kernel methods and
also improves the testing efficiency.
