Sentence fusion is a text-to-text (revision-like) gen-
eration task which takes related sentences as input
and merges these into a single output sentence. In
this paper we describe our ongoing work on de-
veloping a sentence fusion module for Dutch. We
propose a generalized version of alignment which
not only indicates which words and phrases should
be aligned but also labels these in terms of a small
set of primitive semantic relations, indicating how
words and phrases from the two input sentences re-
late to each other. It is shown that human label-
ers can perform this task with a high agreement (F-
score of .95). We then describe and evaluate our
adaptation of an existing automatic alignment al-
gorithm, and use the resulting alignments, plus the
semantic labels, in a generalized fusion and gen-
eration algorithm. A small-scale evaluation study
reveals that most of the resulting sentences are ad-
equate to good.
