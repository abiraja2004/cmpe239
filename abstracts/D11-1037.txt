In order to obtain a fine-grained evaluation of
parser accuracy over naturally occurring text,
we study 100 examples each of ten reason-
ably frequent linguistic phenomena, randomly
selected from a parsed version of the En-
glish Wikipedia. We construct a correspond-
ing set of gold-standard target dependencies
for these 1000 sentences, operationalize map-
pings to these targets from seven state-of-the-
art parsers, and evaluate the parsers against
this data to measure their level of success in
identifying these dependencies.
