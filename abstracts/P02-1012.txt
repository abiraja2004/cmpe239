Previous approaches to pronominalization
have largely been theoretical rather than
applied in nature. Frequently, such meth-
ods are based on Centering Theory, which
deals with the resolution of anaphoric pro-
nouns. But it is not clear that complex the-
oretical mechanisms, while having satis-
fying explanatory power, are necessary for
the actual generation of pronouns. We first
illustrate examples of pronouns from vari-
ous domains, describe a simple method for
generating pronouns in an implemented
multi-page generation system, and present
an evaluation of its performance.
