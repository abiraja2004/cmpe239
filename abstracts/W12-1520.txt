This paper proposes the use of NLG to en-
hance public engagement during the course of
species reintroductions. We examine whether
ecological insights can be effectively commu-
nicated through blogs about satellite-tagged
individuals, and whether such blogs can help
create a positive perception of the species in
readers? minds, a requirement for successful
reintroduction. We then discuss the impli-
cations for NLG systems that generate blogs
from satellite-tag data.
