We present experiments with part-of-
speech tagging for Bulgarian, a Slavic lan-
guage with rich inflectional and deriva-
tional morphology. Unlike most previous
work, which has used a small number of
grammatical categories, we work with 680
morpho-syntactic tags. We combine a large
morphological lexicon with prior linguis-
tic knowledge and guided learning from a
POS-annotated corpus, achieving accuracy
of 97.98%, which is a significant improve-
ment over the state-of-the-art for Bulgarian.
