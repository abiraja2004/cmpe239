We propose a global algorithm for learn-
ing entailment relations between predi-
cates. We define a graph structure over
predicates that represents entailment rela-
tions as directed edges, and use a global
transitivity constraint on the graph to learn
the optimal set of edges, by formulating
the optimization problem as an Integer
Linear Program. We motivate this graph
with an application that provides a hierar-
chical summary for a set of propositions
that focus on a target concept, and show
that our global algorithm improves perfor-
mance by more than 10% over baseline al-
gorithms.
