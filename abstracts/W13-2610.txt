Discourse connectives play an impor-
tant role in making a text coherent
and helping humans to infer relations
between spans of text. Using the
Penn Discourse Treebank, we investi-
gate what information relevant to in-
ferring discourse relations is conveyed
by discourse connectives, and whether
the specificity of discourse relations re-
flects general cognitive biases for estab-
lishing coherence. We also propose an
approach to measure the effect of a dis-
course marker on sense identification
according to the different levels of a re-
lation sense hierarchy. This will open a
way to the computational modeling of
discourse processing.
