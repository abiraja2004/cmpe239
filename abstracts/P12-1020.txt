During early language acquisition, infants must
learn both a lexicon and a model of phonet-
ics that explains how lexical items can vary
in pronunciation?for instance ?the? might be
realized as [Di] or [D@]. Previous models of ac-
quisition have generally tackled these problems
in isolation, yet behavioral evidence suggests
infants acquire lexical and phonetic knowledge
simultaneously. We present a Bayesian model
that clusters together phonetic variants of the
same lexical item while learning both a lan-
guage model over lexical items and a log-linear
model of pronunciation variability based on ar-
ticulatory features. The model is trained on
transcribed surface pronunciations, and learns
by bootstrapping, without access to the true
lexicon. We test the model using a corpus of
child-directed speech with realistic phonetic
variation and either gold standard or automati-
cally induced word boundaries. In both cases
modeling variability improves the accuracy of
the learned lexicon over a system that assumes
each lexical item has a unique pronunciation.
