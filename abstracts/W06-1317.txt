In this paper we consider the problem of
identifying and classifying discourse co-
herence relations. We report initial re-
sults over the recently released Discourse
GraphBank (Wolf and Gibson, 2005). Our
approach considers, and determines the
contributions of, a variety of syntactic and
lexico-semantic features. We achieve 81%
accuracy on the task of discourse relation
type classification and 70% accuracy on
relation identification.
