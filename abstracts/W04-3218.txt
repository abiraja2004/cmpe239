We are interested in the problem of modeling
and evaluating spoken language systems in the
context of human-machine dialogs. Spoken di-
alog corpora allow for a multidimensional anal-
ysis of speech recognition and language under-
standing models of dialog systems. Therefore
language models can be directly trained based
either on the dialog history or its equivalence
class (or cluster). In this paper we propose an
algorithm to mine dialog traces which exhibit
similar patterns and are identified by the same
class. For this purpose we apply data clustering
methods to large human-machine spoken dia-
logue corpora. The resulting clusters can be
used for system evaluation and language mod-
eling. By clustering dialog traces we expect to
learn about the behavior of the system with re-
gards to not only the automation rate but the
nature of the interaction (e.g. easy vs difficult
dialogs). The equivalence classes can also be
used in order to automatically adapt the lan-
guage model, the understanding module and the
dialogue strategy to better fit the kind of in-
teraction detected. This paper investigates dif-
ferent ways for encoding dialogues into multi-
dimensional structures and different clustering
methods. Preliminary results are given for clus-
ter interpretation and dynamic model adapta-
tion using the clusters obtained.
