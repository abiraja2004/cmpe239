Given a parallel corpus, semantic projec-
tion attempts to transfer semantic role an-
notations from one language to another,
typically by exploiting word alignments.
In this paper, we present an improved
method for obtaining constituent align-
ments between parallel sentences to guide
the role projection task. Our extensions
are twofold: (a) we model constituent
alignment as minimum weight edge cov-
ers in a bipartite graph, which allows us to
find a globally optimal solution efficiently;
(b) we propose tree pruning as a promising
strategy for reducing alignment noise. Ex-
perimental results on an English-German
parallel corpus demonstrate improvements
over state-of-the-art models.
