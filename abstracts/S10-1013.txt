Domain portability and adaptation of NLP
components and Word Sense Disambigua-
tion systems present new challenges. The
difficulties found by supervised systems to
adapt might change the way we assess the
strengths and weaknesses of supervised
and knowledge-based WSD systems. Un-
fortunately, all existing evaluation datasets
for specific domains are lexical-sample
corpora. This task presented all-words
datasets on the environment domain for
WSD in four languages (Chinese, Dutch,
English, Italian). 11 teams participated,
with supervised and knowledge-based sys-
tems, mainly in the English dataset. The
results show that in all languages the par-
ticipants where able to beat the most fre-
quent sense heuristic as estimated from
general corpora. The most successful ap-
proaches used some sort of supervision in
the form of hand-tagged examples from
the domain.
