 
In this paper, we describe the Chinese 
word sense induction task at CLP2010. 
Seventeen teams participated in this task 
and nineteen system results were 
submitted. All participant systems are 
evaluated on a dataset containing 100 
target words and 5000 instances using 
the standard cluster evaluation. We will 
describe the participating systems and 
the evaluation results, and then find the 
most suitable method by comparing the 
different Chinese word sense induction 
systems.
