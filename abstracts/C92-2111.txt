 
This paper discusses aspects of the 
planning of explanatory texts for logic 
based systems. It presents a method for 
deriving Natural Language text plans from 
Natural Deduction-based structures. This 
approach allows for the planning of 
explanatory texts in a general-purpose 
logic based system framework, ensuring a 
greater degree of portability across 
domains.
