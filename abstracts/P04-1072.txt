This paper presents a multi-layered Question An-
swering (Q.A.) architecture suitable for enhanc-
ing current Q.A. capabilities with the possibility of
processing complex questions. That is, questions
whose answer needs to be gathered from pieces
of factual information scattered in different docu-
ments. Specifically, we have designed a layer ori-
ented to process the different types of temporal
questions. Complex temporal questions are first de-
composed into simpler ones, according to the tem-
poral relationships expressed in the original ques-
tion.
In the same way, the answers of each simple ques-
tion are re-composed, fulfilling the temporal restric-
tions of the original complex question.
Using this architecture, a Temporal Q.A. system
has been developed.
In this paper, we focus on explaining the first part
of the process: the decomposition of the complex
questions. Furthermore, it has been evaluated with
the TERQAS question corpus of 112 temporal ques-
tions. For the task of question splitting our system
has performed, in terms of precision and recall, 85%
and 71%, respectively.
