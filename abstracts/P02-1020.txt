In this paper we present results from
the METER (MEasuring TExt Reuse)
project whose aim is to explore issues
pertaining to text reuse and derivation,
especially in the context of newspapers
using newswire sources. Although the
reuse of text by journalists has been
studied in linguistics, we are not aware
of any investigation using existing com-
putational methods for this particular
task. We investigate the classication
of newspaper articles according to their
degree of dependence upon, or deriva-
tion from, a newswire source using a
simple 3-level scheme designed by jour-
nalists. Three approaches to measur-
ing text similarity are considered: n-
gram overlap, Greedy String Tiling,
and sentence alignment. Measured
against a manually annotated corpus of
source and derived news text, we show
that a combined classier with fea-
tures automatically selected performs
best overall for the ternary classica-
tion achieving an average F
1
-measure
score of 0.664 across all three cate-
gories.
