This paper presents a novel method for the com-
putation of word meaning in context. We make
use of a factorization model in which words, to-
gether with their window-based context words
and their dependency relations, are linked to
latent dimensions. The factorization model al-
lows us to determine which dimensions are im-
portant for a particular context, and adapt the
dependency-based feature vector of the word
accordingly. The evaluation on a lexical substi-
tution task ? carried out for both English and
French ? indicates that our approach is able to
reach better results than state-of-the-art meth-
ods in lexical substitution, while at the same
time providing more accurate meaning repre-
sentations.
