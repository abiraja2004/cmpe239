Current NER approaches include:
dictionary-based, rule-based, or ma-
chine learning. Since there is no
consolidated nomenclature for most
biomedical NEs, most NER systems
relying on limited dictionaries or rules
do not perform satisfactorily. In this
paper, we apply Maximum Entropy
(ME) to construct our NER framework.
We represent shallow linguistic infor-
mation as linguistic features in our ME
model. On the GENIA 3.02 corpus, our
system achieves satisfactory F-scores
of 74.3% in protein and 70.0% overall
without using any dictionary. Our
system performs significantly better
than dictionary-based systems. Using
partial match criteria, our system
achieves an F-score of 81.3%. Using
appropriate domain knowledge to
modify the boundaries, our system has
the potential to achieve an F-score of
over 80%.
