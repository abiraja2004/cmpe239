 
This paper proposes a segmentation stan- 
dard for Chinese natural language processing. 
The standard is proposed to achieve linguis- 
tic felicity, computational feasibility, and 
data uniformity. Linguistic felicity is main- 
tained by defining a segmentation unit to be 
equivalent to the theoretical definition of 
word, and by providing a set of segmentation 
principles that are equivalent o a functional 
definition of a word. Computational feasi- 
bility is ensured by the fact that the above 
functional definitions are procedural in na- 
ture and can be converted to segmentation 
algorithms, as well as by the implementable 
heuristic guidelines which deal with specific 
linguistic categories. Data uniformity is 
achieved by stratification of the standard 
itself and by defining a standard lexicon as 
part of the segmentation standard.
