Sociolinguistic theories (e.g., Lakoff (1973))
postulate that women?s language styles differ
from that of men. In this paper, we explore
statistical techniques that can learn to iden-
tify the gender of authors in modern English
text, such as web blogs and scientific papers.
Although recent work has shown the efficacy
of statistical approaches to gender attribution,
we conjecture that the reported performance
might be overly optimistic due to non-stylistic
factors such as topic bias in gender that can
make the gender detection task easier. Our
work is the first that consciously avoids gender
bias in topics, thereby providing stronger evi-
dence to gender-specific styles in language be-
yond topic. In addition, our comparative study
provides new insights into robustness of var-
ious stylometric techniques across topic and
genre.
