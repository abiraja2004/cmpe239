 
This demo introduces a suite of web-based 
English lexical knowledge resources, called 
StringNet and StringNet Navigator 
(http://nav.stringnet.org), designed to 
provide access to the immense territory of 
multiword expressions that falls between 
what the lexical entries encode in lexicons 
on the one hand and what productive 
grammar rules cover on the other. 
StringNet?s content consists of 1.6 billion 
hybrid n-grams, strings in which word 
forms and parts of speech grams can co-
occur. Subordinate and super-ordinate 
relations among hybrid n-grams are 
indexed, making StringNet a navigable 
web rather than a list. Applications include 
error detection and correction tools and 
web browser-based tools that detect 
patterns in the webpages that a user 
browses.
