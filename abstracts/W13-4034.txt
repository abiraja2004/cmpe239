In a complex task-oriented domain in which information is ex-changed via parallel, interleaved dialogue and task streams, effective dialogue management models should be able to make dialogue moves based on both the dialogue and the task context. This paper presents a data-driven ap-proach to learning dialogue management mod-els that determine when to make dialogue moves to assist users? task completion activi-ties, as well as the type of dialogue move that should be selected for a given user interaction context. Combining features automatically ex-tracted from the dialogue and the task, we compare two alternate modeling approaches. The results of an evaluation indicate the learned models are effective in predicting both the timing and the type of system dialogue moves. 1
