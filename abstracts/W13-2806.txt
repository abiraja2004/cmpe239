Chinese and Japanese have a different sen-
tence structure. Reordering methods are
effective, but need reliable parsers to ex-
tract the syntactic structure of the source
sentences. However, Chinese has a loose
word order, and Chinese parsers that ex-
tract the phrase structure do not perform
well. We propose a framework where only
POS tags and unlabeled dependency parse
trees are necessary, and linguistic knowl-
edge on structural difference can be en-
coded in the form of reordering rules. We
show significant improvements in transla-
tion quality of sentences from news do-
main, when compared to state-of-the-art
reordering methods.
