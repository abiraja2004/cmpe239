 
This paper describes a categorization mod-
ule for improving the performance of a 
Spanish into Spanish Sign Language (LSE) 
translation system. This categorization 
module replaces Spanish words with asso-
ciated tags. When implementing this mod-
ule, several alternatives for dealing with 
non-relevant words have been studied. Non-
relevant words are Spanish words not rele-
vant in the translation process. The catego-
rization module has been incorporated into 
a phrase-based system and a Statistical Fi-
nite State Transducer (SFST). The evalua-
tion results reveal that the BLEU has 
increased from 69.11% to 78.79% for the 
phrase-based system and from 69.84% to 
75.59% for the SFST.
