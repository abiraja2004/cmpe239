Discovering and summarizing opinions from
online reviews is an important and challeng-
ing task. A commonly-adopted framework
generates structured review summaries with
aspects and opinions. Recently topic mod-
els have been used to identify meaningful re-
view aspects, but existing topic models do
not identify aspect-specific opinion words. In
this paper, we propose a MaxEnt-LDA hy-
brid model to jointly discover both aspects
and aspect-specific opinion words. We show
that with a relatively small amount of train-
ing data, our model can effectively identify as-
pect and opinion words simultaneously. We
also demonstrate the domain adaptability of
our model.
