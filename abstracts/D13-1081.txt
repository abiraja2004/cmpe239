Most of the machine translation systems rely
on a large set of translation rules. These rules
are treated as discrete and independent events.
In this short paper, we propose a novel method
to model rules as observed generation output
of a compact hidden model, which leads to
better generalization capability. We present a
preliminary generative model to test this idea.
Experimental results show about one point im-
provement on TER-BLEU over a strong base-
line in Chinese-to-English translation.
