 
In this paper, we present the 
HybridTrim system which uses a 
machine learning technique to combine 
linguistic, statistical and positional 
information to identify topic labels for 
headlines in a text. We compare our 
system with the Topiary system which, 
in contrast, uses a statistical learning 
approach to finding topic descriptors 
for headlines. The Topiary system, 
developed at the University of 
Maryland with BBN, was the top 
performing headline generation system 
at DUC 2004. Topiary-style headlines 
consist of a number of general topic 
labels followed by a compressed 
version of the lead sentence of a news 
story. The Topiary system uses a 
statistical learning approach to finding 
topic labels. The performance of these 
systems is evaluated using the ROUGE 
evaluation suite on the DUC 2004 news 
stories collection.
