 
A style checker is a tool which supports 
authors during the process of writing: 
Certain style markers are analyzed, their 
values are compared with a given norm, 
deviations are detected, and 
recommendations are given to the author. 
The power of a style checker depends on 
available tools such as lexica, parser, etc. 
This paper describes a style checker which 
will be integrated m a workbench 
(Translator's Workbench) and which has 
access to lexica and parser. The style 
checker can be used for different languages 
and for different kinds of text. 
defined with the help of these values: A 
stylistic norm fl~r technical texts, for user 
manuals, for a certain author, etc. 
With respect to these premises we now 
define style checking as: matching the 
densities of the features in a given text 
against he densities of the corresponding 
features in the norm. "Correct style" is 
correct style concerning a certain (group 
based) norm. "Incorrect style" is the degree 
of deviation between the norm values of 
the style markers and the values in the 
actual text.
