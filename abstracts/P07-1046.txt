 
In this paper we explore the utility of the 
Navigation Map (NM), a graphical repre-
sentation of the discourse structure. We run 
a user study to investigate if users perceive 
the NM as helpful in a tutoring spoken dia-
logue system. From the users? perspective, 
our results show that the NM presence al-
lows them to better identify and follow the 
tutoring plan and to better integrate the in-
struction. It was also easier for users to 
concentrate and to learn from the system if 
the NM was present. Our preliminary 
analysis on objective metrics further 
strengthens these findings.
