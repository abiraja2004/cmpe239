In this paper, we present an approach
to automatically revealing phonological
correspondences within historically re-
lated languages. We create two bilingual
pronunciation dictionaries for the lan-
guage pairs German-Dutch and German-
English. The data is used for automat-
ically learning phonological similarities
between the two language pairs via EM-
based clustering. We apply our models
to predict from a phonological German
word the phonemes of a Dutch and an
English cognate. The similarity scores
show that German and Dutch phonemes
are more similar than German and En-
glish phonemes, which supplies statistical
evidence of the common knowledge that
German is more closely related to Dutch
than to English. We assess our approach
qualitatively, finding meaningful classes
caused by historical sound changes. The
classes can be used for language learning.
