Linking implicit semantic roles is a challeng-
ing problem in discourse processing. Unlike
prior work inspired by SRL, we cast this prob-
lem as an anaphora resolution task and embed
it in an entity-based coreference resolution
(CR) architecture. Our experiments clearly
show that CR-oriented features yield strongest
performance exceeding a strong baseline. We
address the problem of data sparsity by apply-
ing heuristic labeling techniques, guided by
the anaphoric nature of the phenomenon. We
achieve performance beyond state-of-the art.
