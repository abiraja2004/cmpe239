Multidocument extractive summarization relies on
the concept of sentence centrality to identify the
most important sentences in a document. Central-
ity is typically defined in terms of the presence of
particular important words or in terms of similarity
to a centroid pseudo-sentence. We are now consid-
ering an approach for computing sentence impor-
tance based on the concept of eigenvector centrality
(prestige) that we call LexPageRank. In this model,
a sentence connectivity matrix is constructed based
on cosine similarity. If the cosine similarity be-
tween two sentences exceeds a particular predefined
threshold, a corresponding edge is added to the con-
nectivity matrix. We provide an evaluation of our
method on DUC 2004 data. The results show that
our approach outperforms centroid-based summa-
rization and is quite successful compared to other
summarization systems.
