Our hypothesis is that conversational im-
plicatures are a rich source of clarification
questions. In this paper we do two things.
First, we motivate the hypothesis in theo-
retical, practical and empirical terms. Sec-
ond, we present a framework for generat-
ing the clarification potential of an instruc-
tion by inferring its conversational impli-
catures with respect to a particular con-
text. General means-ends inference, be-
yond classical planning, turns out to be
crucial.
