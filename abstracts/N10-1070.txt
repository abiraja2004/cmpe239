Many implementations of Latent Dirichlet Al-
location (LDA), including those described in
Blei et al (2003), rely at some point on the
removal of stopwords, words which are as-
sumed to contribute little to the meaning of
the text. This step is considered necessary be-
cause otherwise high-frequency words tend to
end up scattered across many of the latent top-
ics without much rhyme or reason. We show,
however, that the ?problem? of high-frequency
words can be dealt with more elegantly, and
in a way that to our knowledge has not been
considered in LDA, through the use of appro-
priate weighting schemes comparable to those
sometimes used in Latent Semantic Indexing
(LSI). Our proposed weighting methods not
only make theoretical sense, but can also be
shown to improve precision significantly on a
non-trivial cross-language retrieval task.
