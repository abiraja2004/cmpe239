We present a normalisation framework for linguistic representations and illustrate its use
by normalising the Stanford Dependency graphs (SDs) produced by the Stanford parser into
Labelled Stanford Dependency graphs (LSDs). The normalised representations are evaluated
both on a testsuite of constructed examples and on free text. The resulting representations
improve on standard Predicate/Argument structures produced by SRL by combining role la-
belling with the semantically oriented features of SDs. Furthermore, the proposed normalisa-
tion framework opens the way to stronger normalisation processes which should be useful in
reducing the burden on inference.
