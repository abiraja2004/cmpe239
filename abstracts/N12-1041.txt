This paper proposes an improved approach to extrac-
tive summarization of spoken multi-party interac-
tion, in which integrated random walk is performed
on a graph constructed on topical/ lexical relations.
Each utterance is represented as a node of the graph,
and the edges? weights are computed from the topi-
cal similarity between the utterances, evaluated us-
ing probabilistic latent semantic analysis (PLSA),
and from word overlap. We model intra-speaker
topics by partially sharing the topics from the same
speaker in the graph. In this paper, we perform ex-
periments on automatically and manually generated
transcripts. For automatic transcripts, our results
show that intra-speaker topic sharing and integrating
topical/ lexical relations can help include the impor-
tant utterances.
