 
Speech research has made tremendous progress in the 
past using the following paradigm: 
? define the research problem, 
? collect a corpus to objectively measure progress, and 
? solve the research problem. 
Natural language research, on the other hand, has typ- 
ically progressed without the benefit of any corpus of 
data with which to test research hypotheses. We de- 
scribe the Air Travel Information System (ATIS) pilot 
corpus, a corpus designed to measure progress in Spo- 
ken Language Systems that include both a speech and 
natural anguage component. This pilot marks the first 
full-scale attempt o collect such a corpus and provides 
guidelines for future efforts.
