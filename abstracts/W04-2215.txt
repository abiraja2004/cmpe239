The PolyphraZ tool is being developed in the
framework of the TraCorpEx project
(Translation of Corpora of Examples), to
manage parallel multilingual corpora through
the web. Corpus files (monolingual or
multilingual) are firstly converted to a
standard coding (CXM.dtd, UTF8). Then, they
are assembled (CPXM.dtd) to visualize them
in parallel through the web. In a third stage,
they are put in a Multilingual Polyphraz
Memory (MPM). A "polyphrase" is a structure
containing an original sentence and various
proposals of equivalent sentences, in the same
and other languages. An MPM stores one or
more corpora of polyphrazes. The MPM part
of PolyphraZ has 3 main web interfaces. One
is a web-oriented translator workstation
(TWS), where suggestions or translations
come from the MPM itself, which functions as
its own translation memory, and from calls to
MT systems. Another serves to send sentences
to MT systems with appropriate parameters,
and to run various evaluation measures (NIST,
BLEU, and distance computations) in order to
propose to the translator a "best" proposal. A
third interface is planned for giving feedbacks
to the developers of the MT systems, in the
form of lists of unknown or wrongly translated
words, with suggestions for correct
translations, and of parallel presentation of
pairs of translations showing the "editing
work" to be done to get one from the other.
The first 2 stages are operational, and used for
experimentation and MT evaluation on the
CSTAR 5-lingual BTEC corpus and on the
Japanese-English Tanaka corpus used as a
source of examples in electronic dictionaries
(JDict, Papillon). A main goal of this effort is
to offer occasional and volunteer translators
and posteditors access to a free TWS and to
sharable translation memories put in the MPM
format.
