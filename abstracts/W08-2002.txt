We argue in favor of using a graph-based
representation for language meaning and
propose a novel learning method to map
natural language text to its graph-based
meaning representation. We present a
grammar formalism, which combines syn-
tax and semantics, and has ontology con-
straints at the rule level. These constraints
establish links between language expres-
sions and the entities they refer to in the
real world. We present a relational learning
algorithm that learns these grammars from
a small representative set of annotated ex-
amples, and show how this grammar in-
duction framework and the ontology-based
semantic representation allow us to di-
rectly map text to graph-based meaning
representations.
