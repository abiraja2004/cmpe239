Via an oracle experiment, we show that the
upper bound on accuracy of a CCG parser
is significantly lowered when its search space
is pruned using a supertagger, though the su-
pertagger also prunes many bad parses. In-
spired by this analysis, we design a single
model with both supertagging and parsing fea-
tures, rather than separating them into dis-
tinct models chained together in a pipeline.
To overcome the resulting increase in com-
plexity, we experiment with both belief prop-
agation and dual decomposition approaches to
inference, the first empirical comparison of
these algorithms that we are aware of on a
structured natural language processing prob-
lem. On CCGbank we achieve a labelled de-
pendency F-measure of 88.8% on gold POS
tags, and 86.7% on automatic part-of-speeoch
tags, the best reported results for this task.
