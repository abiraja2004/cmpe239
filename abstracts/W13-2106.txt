We present an Integer Linear Program-
ming model of content selection, lexical-
ization, and aggregation that we devel-
oped for a system that generates texts from
OWL ontologies. Unlike pipeline archi-
tectures, our model jointly considers the
available choices in these three text gen-
eration stages, to avoid greedy decisions
and produce more compact texts. Experi-
ments with two ontologies confirm that it
leads to more compact texts, compared to
a pipeline with the same components, with
no deterioration in the perceived quality of
the generated texts. We also present an ap-
proximation of our model, which allows
longer texts to be generated efficiently.
