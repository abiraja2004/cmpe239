The task of named entity annotation of unseen
text has recently been successfully automated
with near-human performance.
But the full task involves more than annotation,
i.e. identifying the scope of each (continuous)
text span and its class (such as place name). It
also involves grounding the named entity (i.e.
establishing its denotation with respect to the
world or a model). The latter aspect has so far
been neglected.
In this paper, we show how geo-spatial named
entities can be grounded using geographic co-
ordinates, and how the results can be visual-
ized using off-the-shelf software. We use this
to compare a ?textual surrogate? of a newspa-
per story, with a ?visual surrogate? based on
geographic coordinates.
