As part of our work on automatically build-
ing knowledge structures from text, we apply
machine learning to determine which clauses
from multiple narratives describing similar sit-
uations should be grouped together as descrip-
tions of the same type of occurrence. Our
approach to the problem uses textual similar-
ity and context from other clauses. Besides
training data, our system uses only a partial
parser as outside knowledge. We present re-
sults evaluating the cohesiveness of the aggre-
gated clauses and a brief overview of how this
work fits into our overall system.
