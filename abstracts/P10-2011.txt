Current Referring Expression Generation
algorithms rely on domain dependent pref-
erences for both content selection and lin-
guistic realization. We present two exper-
iments showing that human speakers may
opt for dispreferred properties and dispre-
ferred modifier orderings when these were
salient in a preceding interaction (without
speakers being consciously aware of this).
We discuss the impact of these findings for
current generation algorithms.
