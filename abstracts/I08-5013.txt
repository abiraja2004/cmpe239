Much work has already been done on 
building named entity recognition systems. 
However most of this work has been con-
centrated on English and other European
languages. Hence, building a named entity 
recognition (NER) system for South Asian 
Languages (SAL) is still an open problem
because they exhibit characteristics differ-
ent from English. This paper builds a 
named entity recognizer which also identi-
fies nested name entities for the Hindi lan-
guage using machine learning algorithm, 
trained on an annotated corpus. However,
the algorithm is designed in such a manner 
that it can easily be ported to other South
Asian Languages provided the necessary 
NLP tools like POS tagger and chunker are 
available for that language. I compare re-
sults of Hindi data with English data of 
CONLL shared task of 2003.
