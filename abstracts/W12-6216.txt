This paper presents a finite-state approach
to phrase-based statistical machine translation
where a log-linear modelling framework is im-
plemented by means of an on-the-fly com-
position of weighted finite-state transducers.
Moses, a well-known state-of-the-art system,
is used as a machine translation reference in
order to validate our results by comparison.
Experiments on the TED corpus achieve a
similar performance to that yielded by Moses.
