In statistical machine translation, the gen-
eration of a translation hypothesis is com-
putationally expensive. If arbitrary word-
reorderings are permitted, the search prob-
lem is NP-hard. On the other hand, if
we restrict the possible word-reorderings
in an appropriate way, we obtain a
polynomial-time search algorithm.
In this paper, we compare two different re-
ordering constraints, namely the ITG con-
straints and the IBM constraints. This
comparison includes a theoretical dis-
cussion on the permitted number of re-
orderings for each of these constraints.
We show a connection between the ITG
constraints and the since 1870 known
Schro?der numbers.
We evaluate these constraints on two
tasks: the Verbmobil task and the Cana-
dian Hansards task. The evaluation con-
sists of two parts: First, we check how
many of the Viterbi alignments of the
training corpus satisfy each of these con-
straints. Second, we restrict the search to
each of these constraints and compare the
resulting translation hypotheses.
The experiments will show that the base-
line ITG constraints are not sufficient
on the Canadian Hansards task. There-
fore, we present an extension to the ITG
constraints. These extended ITG con-
straints increase the alignment coverage
from about 87% to 96%.
