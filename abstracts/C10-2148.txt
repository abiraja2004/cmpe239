In this paper we present a novel phrase 
structure parsing approach with the help 
of dependency structure. Different with 
existing phrase parsers, in our approach 
the inference procedure is guided by 
dependency structure, which makes the 
parsing procedure flexibly.  The 
experimental results show our approach is 
much more accurate. With the help of 
golden dependency trees, F1 score of our 
parser achieves 96.08% on Penn English 
Treebank and 90.61% on Penn Chinese 
Treebank. With the help of N-best 
dependency trees generated by modified 
MSTParser, F1 score achieves 90.54% 
for English and 83.93% for Chinese.
