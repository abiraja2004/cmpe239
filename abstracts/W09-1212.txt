We present a system developed for the
CoNLL-2009 Shared Task (Hajic? et al, 2009).
We extend the Carreras (2007) parser to
jointly annotate syntactic and semantic depen-
dencies. This state-of-the-art parser factor-
izes the built tree in second-order factors. We
include semantic dependencies in the factors
and extend their score function to combine
syntactic and semantic scores. The parser is
coupled with an on-line averaged perceptron
(Collins, 2002) as the learning method. Our
averaged results for all seven languages are
71.49 macro F1, 79.11 LAS and 63.06 seman-
tic F1.
