 
This paper describes the UPM system for 
translation task at the EMNLP 2011 workshop 
on statistical machine translation 
(http://www.statmt.org/wmt11/), and it has 
been used for both directions: Spanish-English 
and English-Spanish. This system is based on 
Moses with two new modules for pre and post 
processing the sentences. The main 
contribution is the method proposed (based on 
the similarity with the source language test set) 
for selecting the sentences for training the 
models and adjusting the weights. With 
system, we have obtained a 23.2 BLEU for 
Spanish-English and 21.7 BLEU for English-
Spanish.
