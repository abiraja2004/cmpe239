 
In this paper we describe a method of acquiring word 
order fl'om corpora. Word order is defined as the or- 
der of modifiers, or the order of phrasal milts called 
'bunsetsu' which depend on the stone modifiee. The 
method uses a model which automatically discovers 
what the tendency of the word order in Japanese is 
by using various kinds of information in and around 
the target bunsetsus. This model shows us to what 
extent each piece of information contributes to de- 
ciding the word order mid which word order tends to 
be selected when several kinds of information con- 
flict. The contribution rate of each piece of informa- 
tion in deciding word order is eiIiciently learned by a 
model within a maximum entropy framework. The 
performance of this traiimd model can be ewfluated 
by checking how many instances of word order st- 
letted by the model agree with those in the original 
text. In this paper, we show t, hat even a raw cor- 
pits that has not been tagged can be used to train 
the model, if it is first analyzed by a parser. This 
is possible because the word order of the text in the 
corpus is correct.
