 
In this paper we discuss how generation issues 
affect the design of a computer-assisted language 
learning tool designed to teach written English as 
a second language to deaf users of American Sign 
Language. We discuss a dual-component linguis- 
tic model that attempts to reflect the generation 
process of the learners. The first model compo- 
nent captures the influence of the first language on 
the acquisition of the second. The second model 
component captures the process of second lan- 
guage acquisition itself. 
The linguistic model helps the system identify 
errors along with their probable source(s). This 
information is crucial for effective correction. It is 
also useful in the response phase of the system to 
focus tutoring on the errors that are most benefi- 
cial to correct. In addition, the linguistic model 
can be used to tailor the system's realization of its 
response. In this way, the syntactic onstructions 
generated by the system will provide understand- 
able and positive exemplars of the language fea- 
tures currently being acquired by the leamer.
