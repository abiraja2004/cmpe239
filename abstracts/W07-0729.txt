This paper presents a new paradigm for
translation from inflectionally rich lan-
guages that was used in the University
of Maryland statistical machine transla-
tion system for the WMT07 Shared Task.
The system is based on a hierarchical
phrase-based decoder that has been aug-
mented to translate ambiguous input given
in the form of a confusion network (CN),
a weighted finite state representation of a
set of strings. By treating morphologi-
cally derived forms of the input sequence
as possible, albeit more ?costly? paths that
the decoder may select, we find that sig-
nificant gains (10% BLEU relative) can
be attained when translating from Czech,
a language with considerable inflectional
complexity, into English.
