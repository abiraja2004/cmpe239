In this paper, we investigate different usages
of feature representations in the web person
name disambiguation task which has been suf-
fering from the mismatch of vocabulary and
lack of clues in web environments. In litera-
ture, the latter receives less attention and re-
mains more challenging. We explore the fea-
ture space in this task and argue that collecting
person specific evidences from a corpus level
can provide a more reasonable and robust es-
timation for evaluating a feature?s importance
in a given web page. This can alleviate the
lack of clues where discriminative features can
be reasonably weighted by taking their corpus
level importance into account, not just relying
on the current local context. We therefore pro-
pose a topic-based model to exploit the person
specific global importance and embed it into
the person name similarity. The experimen-
tal results show that the corpus level topic in-
formation provides more stable evidences for
discriminative features and our method out-
performs the state-of-the-art systems on three
WePS datasets.
