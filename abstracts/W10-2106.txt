We provide a detailed comparison of
strategies for implementing medium-to-
low frequency phenomena such as Ger-
man adverbial participles in a broad-
coverage, rule-based parsing system. We
show that allowing for general adverb con-
version of participles in the German LFG
grammar seriously affects its overall per-
formance, due to increased spurious am-
biguity. As a solution, we present a
corpus-based cross-lingual induction tech-
nique that detects adverbially used par-
ticiples in parallel text. In a grammar-
based evaluation, we show that the auto-
matically induced resource appropriately
restricts the adverb conversion to a limited
class of participles, and improves parsing
quantitatively as well as qualitatively.
