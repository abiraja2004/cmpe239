In this paper, we describe a new rerank-
ing strategy named word lattice reranking,
for the task of joint Chinese word segmen-
tation and part-of-speech (POS) tagging.
As a derivation of the forest reranking
for parsing (Huang, 2008), this strategy
reranks on the pruned word lattice, which
potentially contains much more candidates
while using less storage, compared with
the traditional n-best list reranking. With a
perceptron classifier trained with local fea-
tures as the baseline, word lattice rerank-
ing performs reranking with non-local fea-
tures that can?t be easily incorporated into
the perceptron baseline. Experimental re-
sults show that, this strategy achieves im-
provement on both segmentation and POS
tagging, above the perceptron baseline and
the n-best list reranking.
