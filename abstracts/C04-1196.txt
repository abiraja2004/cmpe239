Precise Natural Language Understanding is
needed in Geometry Tutoring to accurately
determine the semantic content of students?
explanations. The paper presents an NLU
system developed in the context of the
Geometry Explanation Tutor. The system
combines unification-based syntactic
processing with description logics based
semantics to achieve the necessary accuracy
level. Solutions to specific semantic problems
dealing with equivalence of semantic
representations are described. Experimental
results on classification accuracy are also
presented.
