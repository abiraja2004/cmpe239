Even though open-domain conversational
dialogue systems are required in many
fields, their development is complicated
because of the flexibility and variety of
user utterances. To address this flexibil-
ity, previous research on conversational di-
alogue systems has selected system utter-
ances from web articles based on surface
cohesion and shallow semantic coherence;
however, the generated utterances some-
times contain irrelevant sentences with re-
spect to the input user utterance. We pro-
pose a template-based approach that fills
templates with the most salient words in
a user utterance and with related words
that are extracted using web-scale depen-
dency structures gathered from Twitter.
Our open-domain conversational dialogue
system outperforms retrieval-based con-
ventional systems in chat experiments.
