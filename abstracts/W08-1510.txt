  
S-MINDS is a speech translation system, 
which allows an English speaker to commu-
nicate with a limited English proficiency 
speaker easily within a question-and-answer, 
interview-style format. It can handle dialogs 
in specific settings such as nurse-patient in-
teraction, or medical triage.  We have built 
and tested an English-Spanish system for ena-
bling nurse-patient interaction in a number of 
domains in Kaiser Permanente achieving a to-
tal translation accuracy of 92.8% (for both 
English and Spanish).  We will give an over-
view of the system as well as the quantitative 
and qualitatively system performance.
