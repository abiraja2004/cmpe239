Named entity (NE) translation plays
an important role in many applications.
In this paper, we focus on translating
NEs from Korean to Chinese to improve
Korean-Chinese cross-language informa-
tion retrieval (KCIR). The ideographic
nature of Chinese makes NE translation
difficult because one syllable may map to
several Chinese characters. We propose
a hybrid NE translation system. First,
we integrate two online databases to ex-
tend the coverage of our bilingual dic-
tionaries. We use Wikipedia as a trans-
lation tool based on the inter-language
links between the Korean edition and
the Chinese or English editions. We
also use Naver.com?s people search en-
gine to find a query name?s Chinese or
English translation. The second compo-
nent is able to learn Korean-Chinese (K-
C), Korean-English (K-E), and English-
Chinese (E-C) translation patterns from
the web. These patterns can be used to
extract K-C, K-E and E-C pairs from
Google snippets. We found KCIR per-
formance using this hybrid configura-
tion over five times better than that
a dictionary-based configuration using
only Naver people search. Mean average
precision was as high as 0.3385 and recall
reached 0.7578. Our method can han-
dle Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and non-
CJK NE translation and improve perfor-
mance of KCIR substantially.
