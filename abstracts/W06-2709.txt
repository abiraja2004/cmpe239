We present ANNIS, a linguistic database
that aims at facilitating the process of ex-
ploiting richly annotated language data by
naive users. We describe the role of the
database in our research project and the
project requirements, with a special focus
on aspects of multilevel annotation. We
then illustrate the usability of the database
by illustrative examples. We also address
current challenges and next steps.
