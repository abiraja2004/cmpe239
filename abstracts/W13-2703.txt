Differences between large-scale historical
population archives and small decentral-
ized databases can be used to improve data
quality and record connectedness in both
types of databases. A parser is developed
to account for differences in syntax and
data representation models. A matching
procedure is described to discover records
from different databases referring to the
same historical event. The problem of ver-
ification without reliable benchmark data
is addressed by matching on a subset of
record attributes and measuring support
for the match using a different subset of
attributes. An application of the matching
procedure for comparison of family trees
is discussed. A visualization tool is de-
scribed to present an interactive overview
of comparison results.
