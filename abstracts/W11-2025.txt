 
Instructional efficacy of automated Con-
versational Agents designed to help small 
groups of students achieve higher learning 
outcomes can be improved by the use of 
social interaction strategies. These strate-
gies help the tutor agent manage the atten-
tion of the students while delivering useful 
instructional content. Two technical chal-
lenges involving the use of social interac-
tion strategies include determining the 
appropriate policy for triggering these 
strategies and regulating the amount of so-
cial behavior performed by the tutor. In this 
paper, a comparison of six different trigger-
ing policies is presented. We find that a 
triggering policy learnt from human beha-
vior in combination with a filter that keeps 
the amount of social behavior comparable 
to that performed by human tutors offers 
the most effective solution to the these 
challenges.
