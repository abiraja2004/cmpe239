This interactive presentation describes
LexNet, a graphical environment for
graph-based NLP developed at the Uni-
versity of Michigan. LexNet includes
LexRank (for text summarization), bi-
ased LexRank (for passage retrieval), and
TUMBL (for binary classification). All
tools in the collection are based on random
walks on lexical graphs, that is graphs
where different NLP objects (e.g., sen-
tences or phrases) are represented as nodes
linked by edges proportional to the lexi-
cal similarity between the two nodes. We
will demonstrate these tools on a variety of
NLP tasks including summarization, ques-
tion answering, and prepositional phrase
attachment.
