 This paper discusses a new, open-source software program, called Phon, that is de-signed for the transcription, coding, and analysis of phonological corpora. Phon provides support for multimedia data link-age, segmentation, multiple-blind transcrip-tion, transcription validation, syllabifica-tion, alignment of target and actual forms, and data analysis. All of these functions are available through a user-friendly graphical interface. Phon, available on most com-puter platforms, supports data exchange among researchers with the TalkBank XML document format and the Unicode character set.. This program provides the basis for the elaboration of PhonBank, a database project that seeks to broaden the scope of CHILDES into phonological de-velopment and disorders. 1
