We present an adaptive technique that en-
ables users to produce a high quality dic-
tionary parsed into its lexicographic com-
ponents (headwords, pronunciations, parts
of speech, translations, etc.) using an
extremely small amount of user provided
training data. We use transformation-
based learning (TBL) as a postprocessor at
two points in our system to improve per-
formance. The results using two dictio-
naries show that the tagging accuracy in-
creases from 83% and 91% to 93% and
94% for individual words or ?tokens?, and
from 64% and 83% to 90% and 93% for
contiguous ?phrases? such as definitions
or examples of usage.
