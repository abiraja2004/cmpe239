We propose a new method of selecting hy-
potheses for machine transliteration. We
generate a set of Chinese, Japanese, and Ko-
rean transliteration hypotheses for a given
English word. We then use the set of translit-
eration hypotheses as a guide to finding rel-
evant Web pages and mining contextual in-
formation for the transliteration hypotheses
from the Web page. Finally, we use the
mined information for machine-learning al-
gorithms including support vector machines
and maximum entropy model designed to
select the correct transliteration hypothesis.
In our experiments, our proposed method
based on Web mining consistently outper-
formed systems based on simple Web counts
used in previous work, regardless of the lan-
guage.
