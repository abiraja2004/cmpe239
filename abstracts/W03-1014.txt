This paper presents a bootstrapping process
that learns linguistically rich extraction pat-
terns for subjective (opinionated) expressions.
High-precision classifiers label unannotated
data to automatically create a large training set,
which is then given to an extraction pattern
learning algorithm. The learned patterns are
then used to identify more subjective sentences.
The bootstrapping process learns many subjec-
tive patterns and increases recall while main-
taining high precision.
