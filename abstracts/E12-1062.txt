Microblogging websites such as Twitter
offer a wealth of insight into a popu-
lation?s current mood. Automated ap-
proaches to identify general sentiment to-
ward a particular topic often perform two
steps: Topic Identification and Sentiment
Analysis. Topic Identification first identi-
fies tweets that are relevant to a desired
topic (e.g., a politician or event), and Sen-
timent Analysis extracts each tweet?s atti-
tude toward the topic. Many techniques for
Topic Identification simply involve select-
ing tweets using a keyword search. Here,
we present an approach that instead uses
distant supervision to train a classifier on
the tweets returned by the search. We show
that distant supervision leads to improved
performance in the Topic Identification task
as well in the downstream Sentiment Anal-
ysis stage. We then use a system that incor-
porates distant supervision into both stages
to analyze the sentiment toward President
Obama expressed in a dataset of tweets.
Our results better correlate with Gallup?s
Presidential Job Approval polls than pre-
vious work. Finally, we discover a sur-
prising baseline that outperforms previous
work without a Topic Identification stage.
