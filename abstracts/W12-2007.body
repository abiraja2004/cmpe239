We describe a study aimed at measuring the
use of factual information in test-taker essays
and assessing its effectiveness for predicting
essay scores. We found medium correlations
with the proposed measures, that remained
significant after the effect of essay length was
factored out. The correlations did not dif-
fer substantionally between a simple, rela-
tively robust measure vs a more sophisticated
measure with better construct validity. Impli-
cations for development of automated essay
scoring systems are discussed.
