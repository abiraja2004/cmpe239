We present a brief overview of the main
challenges in the extraction of semantic
relations from English text, and discuss the
shortcomings of previous data sets and shared
tasks. This leads us to introduce a new
task, which will be part of SemEval-2010:
multi-way classification of mutually exclusive
semantic relations between pairs of common
nominals. The task is designed to compare
different approaches to the problem and to
provide a standard testbed for future research,
which can benefit many applications in
Natural Language Processing.
