Hierarchical organization is a well known prop-
erty of language, and yet the notion of hierarchi-
cal structure has been largely absent from the best
performing machine translation systems in recent
community-wide evaluations. In this paper, we dis-
cuss a new hierarchical phrase-based statistical ma-
chine translation system (Chiang, 2005), present-
ing recent extensions to the original proposal, new
evaluation results in a community-wide evaluation,
and a novel technique for fine-grained comparative
analysis of MT systems.
