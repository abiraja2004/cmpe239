 
This paper describes a data source and 
methodology for producing customized test 
suites for molecular biology entity 
identification systems.  The data consists of: 
(a) a set of gene names and symbols classified 
by a taxonomy of features that are relevant to 
the performance of entity identification 
systems, and (b) a set of sentential 
environments into which names and symbols 
are inserted to create test data and the 
associated gold standard.  We illustrate the 
utility of test sets producible by this 
methodology by applying it to five entity 
identification systems and describing the error 
patterns uncovered by it, and investigate 
relationships between performance on a 
customized test suite generated from this data 
and the performance of a system on two 
corpora.
