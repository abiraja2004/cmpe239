In this paper we investigate an applica-
tion of feature clustering for word sense
disambiguation, and propose a semi-
supervised feature clustering algorithm.
Compared with other feature clustering
methods (ex. supervised feature cluster-
ing), it can infer the distribution of class
labels over (unseen) features unavailable
in training data (labeled data) by the use of
the distribution of class labels over (seen)
features available in training data. Thus,
it can deal with both seen and unseen fea-
tures in feature clustering process. Our ex-
perimental results show that feature clus-
tering can aggressively reduce the dimen-
sionality of feature space, while still main-
taining state of the art sense disambigua-
tion accuracy. Furthermore, when com-
bined with a semi-supervised WSD algo-
rithm, semi-supervised feature clustering
outperforms other dimensionality reduc-
tion techniques, which indicates that using
unlabeled data in learning process helps to
improve the performance of feature clus-
tering and sense disambiguation.
