This paper reports about our three par-
ticipating systems in SemEval-2 Japanese
WSD task. The first one is a clustering
based method, which chooses a sense for,
not individual instances, but automatically
constructed clusters of instances. The sec-
ond one is a classification method, which
is an ordinary SVM classifier with simple
domain adaptation techniques. The last is
an ensemble of these two systems. Results
of the formal run shows the second system
is the best. Its precision is 0.7476.
