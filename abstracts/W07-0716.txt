Most state-of-the-art statistical machine
translation systems use log-linear models,
which are defined in terms of hypothesis fea-
tures and weights for those features. It is
standard to tune the feature weights in or-
der to maximize a translation quality met-
ric, using held-out test sentences and their
corresponding reference translations. How-
ever, obtaining reference translations is ex-
pensive. In this paper, we introduce a new
full-sentence paraphrase technique, based
on English-to-English decoding with an MT
system, and we demonstrate that the result-
ing paraphrases can be used to drastically re-
duce the number of human reference transla-
tions needed for parameter tuning, without a
significant decrease in translation quality.
