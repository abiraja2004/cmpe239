While some linguistic questions pose chal-
lenges that could be met by developing
and applying NLP techniques, other prob-
lems can best be approached with a blend
of old-fashioned linguistic investigation
and the use of simple, well-established
NLP tools. Unfortunately, this means that
the NLP component is too simple to be
of interest to the computationally-minded,
while existing tools are often difficult for
the programming novice to use. For NLP
to come to the aid of research in theoreti-
cal linguistics, a continuing investment of
effort is required to bridge the gap. This
investment can be made from both sides.
