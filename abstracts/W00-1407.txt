 
We propose an argumentation strategy for 
generating evaluative arguments that can be 
applied in systems erving as personal assistants 
or advisors. By following guidelines from 
argumentation theory and by employing a 
quantitative model of the user's preferences, the 
strategy generates arguments hat are tailored to 
the user, properly arranged and concise. Our 
proposal extends the scope of previous 
approaches both in terms of types of arguments 
generated, and in terms of compliance with 
principles from argumentation theory.
