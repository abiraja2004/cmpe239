We present a new and unique para-
phrase resource, which contains meaning-
preserving transformations between infor-
mal user-generated text. Sentential para-
phrases are extracted from a compara-
ble corpus of temporally and topically
related messages on Twitter which of-
ten express semantically identical infor-
mation through distinct surface forms. We
demonstrate the utility of this new re-
source on the task of paraphrasing and
normalizing noisy text, showing improve-
ment over several state-of-the-art para-
phrase and normalization systems 1.
