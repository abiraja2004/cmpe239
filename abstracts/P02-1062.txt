This paper describes algorithms which
rerank the top N hypotheses from a
maximum-entropy tagger, the applica-
tion being the recovery of named-entity
boundaries in a corpus of web data. The
first approach uses a boosting algorithm
for ranking problems. The second ap-
proach uses the voted perceptron algo-
rithm. Both algorithms give compara-
ble, significant improvements over the
maximum-entropy baseline. The voted
perceptron algorithm can be considerably
more efficient to train, at some cost in
computation on test examples.
