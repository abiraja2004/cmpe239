 
In this paper, we describe the Universal Networking Language, an interlingua 
to be plugged in a Web environment aiming at allowing for many-to-many 
information exchange, 'many' here referring to many natural anguages. The 
interlingua is embedded in a Knowledge-Base MT system whose language- 
dependent modules comprise an encoder, a decoder, and linguistic resources 
that have been developed by native speakers of each language involved in the 
project. Issues concerning both the interlingua formalism and its foundational 
issues are discussed.
