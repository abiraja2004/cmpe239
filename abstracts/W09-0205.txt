We introduce a way to represent word pairs
instantiating arbitrary semantic relations that
keeps track of the contexts in which the words
in the pair occur both together and indepen-
dently. The resulting features are of sufficient
generality to allow us, with the help of a stan-
dard supervised machine learning algorithm,
to tackle a variety of unrelated semantic tasks
with good results and almost no task-specific
tailoring.
