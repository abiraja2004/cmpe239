Letter-phoneme alignment is usually gen-
erated by a straightforward application of
the EM algorithm. We explore several al-
ternative alignment methods that employ
phonetics, integer programming, and sets
of constraints, and propose a novel ap-
proach of refining the EM alignment by
aggregation of best alignments. We per-
form both intrinsic and extrinsic evalua-
tion of the assortment of methods. We
show that our proposed EM-Aggregation
algorithm leads to the improvement of the
state of the art in letter-to-phoneme con-
version on several different data sets.
