In this paper, semantic role labeling(SRL)
on Chinese FrameNet is divided into the
subtasks of boundary identification(BI)
and semantic role classification(SRC).
These subtasks are regarded as the se-
quential tagging problem at the word
level, respectively. We use the conditional
random fields(CRFs) model to train and
test on a two-fold cross-validation data
set. The extracted features include 11
word-level and 15 shallow syntactic fea-
tures derived from automatic base chunk
parsing. We use the orthogonal array of
statistics to arrange the experiment so that
the best feature template is selected. The
experimental results show that given the
target word within a sentence, the best
F-measures of SRL can achieve 60.42%.
For the BI and SRC subtasks, the best F-
measures are 70.55 and 81%, respectively.
The statistical t-test shows that the im-
provement of our SRL model is not signif-
icant after appending the base chunk fea-
tures.
