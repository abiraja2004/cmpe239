In this paper, we present an automated,
quantitative, knowledge-poor method to
evaluate the randomness of a collection
of documents (corpus), with respect to a
number of biased partitions. The method
is based on the comparison of the word
frequency distribution of the target corpus
to word frequency distributions from cor-
pora built in deliberately biased ways. We
apply the method to the task of building a
corpus via queries to Google. Our results
indicate that this approach can be used,
reliably, to discriminate biased and unbi-
ased document collections and to choose
the most appropriate query terms.
