 
In this paper, we propose a method for 
anaphora resolution of zero subjects in 
Japanese manual sentences based on both 
the nature of language xpressions and the 
ontology of ordinary instruction manuals. 
In instruction manuals written in Japanese, 
zero subjects often introduce ambiguity 
into sentences. In order to resolve them, 
we consider the property of several types of 
expressions including some forms of verbal 
phrases and some conjunctives of clauses, 
and so on. As the result, we have a set 
of constraints and defaults for zero subject 
resolution. We examine the precision of the 
constraints and defaults with real manual 
sentences, and we have the result that they 
make a good estimate with precision of over 
80%.
