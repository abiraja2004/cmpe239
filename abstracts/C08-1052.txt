This paper tackles textual demand analy-
sis, the task of capturing what people want
or need, rather than identifying what they
like or dislike, on which much conven-
tional work has focused. It exploits syn-
tactic patterns as clues to detect previously
unknown demands, and requires domain-
dependent knowledge to get high recall. To
build such patterns we created an unsuper-
vised pattern induction method relying on
the hypothesis that there are commonly de-
sired aspects throughout a domain corpus.
Experimental results show that the pro-
posed method detects twice to four times
as many demand expressions in Japanese
discussion forums compared to a baseline
method.
