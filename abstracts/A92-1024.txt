 
While complete understanding of arbitrary input text 
remains in the future, it is currently possible to construct 
natural anguage processing systems that provide a partial 
understanding of text with limited accuracy. Moreover, 
such systems can provide cost-effective solutions to 
commercially-significant business problems. This paper 
describes one such system: JASPER. JASPER is a fact 
extraction system recently developed and deployed by 
Carnegie Group for Reuters Ltd. JASPER uses a 
template-driven approach, partial understanding 
techniques, and heuristic procedures to extract certain key 
pieces of information from a limited range of text. 
We believe that many significant business problems can 
be solved by fact extraction applications which involve 
locating and extracting specific, predefined types of 
information from a limited range of text. The information 
extracted by such systems can be used in a variety of 
ways, such as filling in values in a database, generating 
summaries of the input text, serving as a part of the 
knowledge in an expert system, or feeding into another 
program which bases decisions on it. We expect to 
develop many such applications in the future using similar 
techniques.
