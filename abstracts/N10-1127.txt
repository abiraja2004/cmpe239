model with novel syntax-based features for sta-
tistical machine translation.  Reordering models 
address the problem of reordering source lan-
guage into the word order of the target language.  
IBM Models 3 through 5 have reordering com-
ponents that use surface word information but 
very  little context information to determine the 
traversal order of the source sentence.  Since the 
late 1990s, phrase-based machine translation 
solves much of the local reorderings by using 
phrasal translations.  The problem of long-
distance reordering has become a central re-
search topic in modeling distortions.  We present 
a syntax driven maximum entropy reordering 
model that directly predicts the source traversal 
order and is able to model arbitrarily long dis-
tance word movement.  We show that this model 
significantly improves machine translation qual-
ity.
