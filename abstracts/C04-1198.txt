This paper deals with contextual aspects of loca-
tive preposition processing. Firstly, accordingly to a
study on the referential behavior of the pronominal
adverb ?y? in its locative uses, we show that static
locative prepositions are functions, not only at the
conceptual level (as shown in previous studies), but
also from a contextual point of view. Such functions
introduce new objects in the discourse context, that
have to be taken into account in classical contex-
tual processing tasks, such as reference resolution or
question answering. Then, we show how these phe-
nomena can fit into contextual formalisms like DRT
and DPL.
