The natural language generation litera-
ture provides many algorithms for the
generation of referring expressions. In
this paper, we explore the question of
whether these algorithms actually produce
the kinds of expressions that people pro-
duce. We compare the output of three ex-
isting algorithms against a data set consist-
ing of human-generated referring expres-
sions, and identify a number of significant
differences between what people do and
what these algorithms do. On the basis of
these observations, we suggest some ways
forward that attempt to address these dif-
ferences.
