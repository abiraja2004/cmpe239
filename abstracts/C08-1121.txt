Various types of structural information -
e.g., about the type of constructions in
which binding constraints apply, or about
the structure of names - play a central role
in coreference resolution, often in combi-
nation with lexical information (as in ex-
pletive detection). Kernel functions ap-
pear to be a promising candidate to capture
structure-sensitive similarities and com-
plex feature combinations, but care is re-
quired to ensure they are exploited in the
best possible fashion. In this paper we
propose kernel functions for three subtasks
of coreference resolution - binding con-
straint detection, expletive identification,
and aliasing - together with an architec-
ture to integrate them within the standard
framework for coreference resolution.
