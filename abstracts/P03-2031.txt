In this paper, we present a method that
automatically constructs a Named En-
tity (NE) tagged corpus from the web
to be used for learning of Named En-
tity Recognition systems. We use an NE
list and an web search engine to col-
lect web documents which contain the
NE instances. The documents are refined
through sentence separation and text re-
finement procedures and NE instances are
finally tagged with the appropriate NE cat-
egories. Our experiments demonstrates
that the suggested method can acquire
enough NE tagged corpus equally useful
to the manually tagged one without any
human intervention.
