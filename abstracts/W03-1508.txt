We address the problem of transliterating
English names using Chinese orthogra-
phy in support of cross-lingual speech and
text processing applications. We demon-
strate the application of statistical ma-
chine translation techniques to ?translate?
the phonemic representation of an En-
glish name, obtained by using an auto-
matic text-to-speech system, to a sequence
of initials and finals, commonly used sub-
word units of pronunciation for Chinese.
We then use another statistical translation
model to map the initial/final sequence
to Chinese characters. We also present
an evaluation of this module in retrieval
of Mandarin spoken documents from the
TDT corpus using English text queries.
