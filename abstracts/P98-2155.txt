 
Near-perfect automatic accent assignment is at- 
tainable for citation-style speech, but better com- 
putational models are needed to predict accent 
in extended, spontaneous discourses. This paper 
presents an empirically motivated theory of the dis- 
course focusing nature of accent in spontaneous 
speech. Hypotheses based on this theory lead to a 
new approach to accent prediction, in which pat- 
terns of deviation from citation form accentuation, 
defined at the constituent or noun phrase level, 
are atttomatically earned from an annotated cor- 
pus. Machine learning experiments on 1031 noun 
phrases from eighteen spontaneous direction-giving 
monologues how that accent assignment can be 
significantly improved by up to 4%-6% relative to 
a hypothetical baseline system that wotdd produce 
only citation-form accentuation, giving error rate 
reductions of 11%-25%.
