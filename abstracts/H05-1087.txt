We consider the problem of training logis-
tic regression models for binary classifi-
cation in information extraction and infor-
mation retrieval tasks. Fitting probabilis-
tic models for use with such tasks should
take into account the demands of the task-
specific utility function, in this case the
well-known F-measure, which combines
recall and precision into a global measure
of utility. We develop a training proce-
dure based on empirical risk minimiza-
tion / utility maximization and evaluate it
on a simple extraction task.
