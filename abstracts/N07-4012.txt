In this demonstration we present a con-
versational dialog system for automobile
drivers. The system provides a voice-
based interface to playing music, finding
restaurants, and navigating while driving.
The design of the system as well as the
new technologies developed will be pre-
sented. Our evaluation showed that the
system is promising, achieving high task
completion rate and good user satisfation.
