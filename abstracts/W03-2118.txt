 
We describe a coding scheme for ma-
chine translation of spoken task-
oriented dialogue. The coding scheme 
covers two levels of speaker intention ? 
domain independent speech acts and 
domain dependent domain actions. Our 
database contains over 14,000 tagged 
sentences in English, Italian, and Ger-
man. We argue that domain actions, and 
not speech acts, are the relevant dis-
course unit for improving translation 
quality. We also show that, although 
domain actions are domain specific, the 
approach scales up to large domains 
without an explosion of domain actions 
and can be coded with high inter-coder 
reliability across research sites. Fur-
thermore, although the number of do-
main actions is on the order of ten times 
the number of speech acts, sparseness is 
not a problem for the training of classi-
fiers for identifying the domain action. 
We describe our work on developing 
high accuracy speech act and domain 
action classifiers, which is the core of 
the source language analysis module of 
our NESPOLE machine translation sys-
tem.
