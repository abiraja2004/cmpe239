Lexical classes, when tailored to the appli-
cation and domain in question, can provide
an effective means to deal with a num-
ber of natural language processing (NLP)
tasks. While manual construction of such
classes is difficult, recent research shows
that it is possible to automatically induce
verb classes from cross-domain corpora
with promising accuracy. We report a
novel experiment where similar technol-
ogy is applied to the important, challeng-
ing domain of biomedicine. We show that
the resulting classification, acquired from
a corpus of biomedical journal articles,
is highly accurate and strongly domain-
specific. It can be used to aid BIO-NLP
directly or as useful material for investi-
gating the syntax and semantics of verbs
in biomedical texts.
