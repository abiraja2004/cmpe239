This paper presents the Chinese word seg-
mentation systems developed by Speech
and Hearing Research Group of Na-
tional Laboratory on Machine Perception
(NLMP) at Peking University, which were
evaluated in the third International Chi-
nese Word Segmentation Bakeoff held by
SIGHAN. The Chinese character-based
maximum entropy model, which switches
the word segmentation task to a classi-
fication task, is adopted in system de-
veloping. To integrate more linguistics
information, an n-gram language model
as well as several post processing strate-
gies are also employed. Both the closed
and open tracks regarding to all four cor-
pora MSRA, UPUC, CITYU, CKIP are
involved in our systems? evaluation, and
good performance are achieved. Espe-
cially, in the closed track on MSRA, our
system ranks 1st.
