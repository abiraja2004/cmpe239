We present a new approach for mapping
natural language sentences to their for-
mal meaning representations using string-
kernel-based classifiers. Our system learns
these classifiers for every production in the
formal language grammar. Meaning repre-
sentations for novel natural language sen-
tences are obtained by finding the most
probable semantic parse using these string
classifiers. Our experiments on two real-
world data sets show that this approach
compares favorably to other existing sys-
tems and is particularly robust to noise.
