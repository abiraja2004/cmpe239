For many years, statistical machine trans-
lation relied on generative models to pro-
vide bilingual word alignments. In 2005,
several independent efforts showed that
discriminative models could be used to
enhance or replace the standard genera-
tive approach. Building on this work,
we demonstrate substantial improvement
in word-alignment accuracy, partly though
improved training methods, but predomi-
nantly through selection of more and bet-
ter features. Our best model produces the
lowest alignment error rate yet reported on
Canadian Hansards bilingual data.
