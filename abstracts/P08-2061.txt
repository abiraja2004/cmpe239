 We present a novel fine-grained semantic rep-resentation of text and an approach to con-structing it. This representation is largely extractable by today?s technologies and facili-tates more detailed semantic analysis. We dis-cuss the requirements driving the representation, suggest how it might be of value in the automated tutoring domain, and provide evidence of its validity. 1
