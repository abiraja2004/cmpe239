Speaker identification is the task of at-
tributing utterances to characters in a lit-
erary narrative. It is challenging to auto-
mate because the speakers of the majority
of utterances are not explicitly identified in
novels. In this paper, we present a super-
vised machine learning approach for the
task that incorporates several novel fea-
tures. The experimental results show that
our method is more accurate and general
than previous approaches to the problem.
