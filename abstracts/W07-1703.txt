We present a language independent ap-
proach for fine-grained categorization and
discrimination of names on the basis of text
semantic similarity information. The exper-
iments are conducted for languages from the
Romance (Spanish) and Slavonic (Bulgar-
ian) language groups. Despite the fact that
these languages have specific characteristics
as word-order and grammar, the obtained
results are encouraging and show that our
name entity method is scalable not only to
different categories, but also to different lan-
guages. In an exhaustive experimental eval-
uation, we have demonstrated that our ap-
proach yields better results compared to a
baseline system.
