The Workbench for Intelligent exploraTion
of Human ComputeR conversaTions is
a new platform-independent open-source
workbench designed for the analysis, min-
ing and management of large spoken di-
alogue system corpora. What makes
Witchcraft unique is its ability to visual-
ize the effect of classification and predic-
tion models on ongoing system-user inter-
actions. Witchcraft is now able to handle
predictions from binary and multi-class
discriminative classifiers as well as regres-
sion models. The new XML interface al-
lows a visualization of predictions stem-
ming from any kind of Machine Learning
(ML) framework. We adapted the wide-
spread CMU Let?s Go corpus to demon-
strate Witchcraft.
