We investigate techniques for generating al-
ternative output sentences with varying sen-
timent, using (an approximation to) the
Valentino method, based on SentiWordNet, of
Guerini et al We extend this method by filter-
ing out unacceptable candidate sentences, us-
ing bigrams sourced from different corpora to
determine whether lexical substitutions are ap-
propriate in the given context. We also com-
pare the generated candidates against human
judgements of whether the desired sentiment
shift has occurred: our results suggest limi-
tations with the overall knowledge-based ap-
proach, and we propose potential directions
for improvement.
