 
This paper employs morphological struc-
tures and relations between sentence seg-
ments for opinion analysis on words and 
sentences.  Chinese words are classified 
into eight morphological types by two 
proposed classifiers, CRF classifier and 
SVM classifier.  Experiments show that 
the injection of morphological information 
improves the performance of the word po-
larity detection.  To utilize syntactic struc-
tures, we annotate structural trios to repre-
sent relations between sentence segments.  
Experiments show that considering struc-
tural trios is useful for sentence opinion 
analysis.  The best f-score achieves 0.77 
for opinion word extraction, 0.62 for opin-
ion word polarity detection, 0.80 for opin-
ion sentence extraction, and 0.54 for opin-
ion sentence polarity detection.
