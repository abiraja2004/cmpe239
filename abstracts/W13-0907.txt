A metaphor is a figure of speech that refers
to one concept in terms of another, as in ?He
is such a sweet person?. Metaphors are ubiq-
uitous and they present NLP with a range
of challenges for WSD, IE, etc. Identifying
metaphors is thus an important step in lan-
guage understanding. However, since almost
any word can serve as a metaphor, they are
impossible to list. To identify metaphorical
use, we assume that it results in unusual se-
mantic patterns between the metaphor and its
dependencies. To identify these cases, we use
SVMs with tree-kernels on a balanced corpus
of 3872 instances, created by bootstrapping
from available metaphor lists.1 We outper-
form two baselines, a sequential and a vector-
based approach, and achieve an F1-score of
0.75.
