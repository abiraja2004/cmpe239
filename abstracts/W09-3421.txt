This paper reports prototype multilin-
gual query expansion system relying on
LMF compliant lexical resources. The
system is one of the deliverables of a
three-year project aiming at establish-
ing an international standard for language
resources which is applicable to Asian
languages. Our important contributions
to ISO 24613, standard Lexical Markup
Framework (LMF) include its robustness
to deal with Asian languages, and its ap-
plicability to cross-lingual query tasks, as
illustrated by the prototype introduced in
this paper.
