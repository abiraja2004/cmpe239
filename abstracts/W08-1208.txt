We have built a parallel treebank that
includes word and phrase alignment.
The alignment information was manually
checked using a graphical tool that al-
lows the annotator to view a pair of trees
from parallel sentences. We found the
compilation of clear alignment guidelines
to be a difficult task. However, experi-
ments with a group of students have shown
that we are on the right track with up to
89% overlap between the student annota-
tion and our own. At the same time these
experiments have helped us to pin-point
the weaknesses in the guidelines, many of
which concerned unclear rules related to
differences in grammatical forms between
the languages.
