We present a default-unification-based approach to
ellipsis resolution that is based on experience in
long running multimodal dialog projects, where it
played an essential role in discourse processing. We
extend default unification to non-parallel structures,
which is important for speech and multimodal di-
alog systems. We introduce new control mecha-
nisms for ellipsis resolution by considering dialog
structure with respect to specification, variation and
results of tasks and combine this with the analysis
of relations between the information elements con-
tained in antecedent and elliptic structures.
