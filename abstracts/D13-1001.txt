Since many applications such as timeline sum-
maries and temporal IR involving temporal
analysis rely on document timestamps, the
task of automatic dating of documents has
been increasingly important. Instead of using
feature-based methods as conventional mod-
els, our method attempts to date documents
in a year level by exploiting relative tempo-
ral relations between documents and events,
which are very effective for dating documents.
Based on this intuition, we proposed an event-
based time label propagation model called
confidence boosting in which time label in-
formation can be propagated between docu-
ments and events on a bipartite graph. The ex-
periments show that our event-based propaga-
tion model can predict document timestamps
in high accuracy and the model combined with
a MaxEnt classifier outperforms the state-of-
the-art method for this task especially when
the size of the training set is small.
