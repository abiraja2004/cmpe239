 
This paper addresses the issue of text nor-
malization, an important yet often over-
looked problem in natural language proc-
essing. By text normalization, we mean 
converting ?informally inputted? text into 
the canonical form, by eliminating ?noises? 
in the text and detecting paragraph and sen-
tence boundaries in the text. Previously, 
text normalization issues were often under-
taken in an ad-hoc fashion or studied sepa-
rately. This paper first gives a formaliza-
tion of the entire problem. It then proposes 
a unified tagging approach to perform the 
task using Conditional Random Fields 
(CRF). The paper shows that with the in-
troduction of a small set of tags, most of 
the text normalization tasks can be per-
formed within the approach. The accuracy 
of the proposed method is high, because 
the subtasks of normalization are interde-
pendent and should be performed together. 
Experimental results on email data cleaning 
show that the proposed method signifi-
cantly outperforms the approach of using 
cascaded models and that of employing in-
dependent models.
