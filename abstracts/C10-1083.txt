We study the problem of integrating scat-
tered online opinions. For this purpose,
we propose to exploit structured ontology
to obtain well-formed relevant aspects to
a topic and use them to organize scattered
opinions to generate a structured sum-
mary. Particularly, we focus on two main
challenges in implementing this idea, (1)
how to select the most useful aspects from
a large number of aspects in the ontology
and (2) how to order the selected aspects
to optimize the readability of the struc-
tured summary. We propose and explore
several methods for solving these chal-
lenges. Experimental results on two dif-
ferent data sets (US Presidents and Digital
Cameras) show that the proposed methods
are effective for selecting aspects that can
represent the major opinions and for gen-
erating coherent ordering of aspects.
