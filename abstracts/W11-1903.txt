This paper describes the participation of
RELAXCOR in the CoNLL-2011 shared
task: ?Modeling Unrestricted Coreference in
Ontonotes?. RELAXCOR is a constraint-based
graph partitioning approach to coreference
resolution solved by relaxation labeling. The
approach combines the strengths of groupwise
classifiers and chain formation methods in one
global method.
