While dialogue acts provide a useful
schema for characterizing dialogue be-
haviors in human-computer and human-
human dialogues, their utility is limited
by the huge effort involved in hand-
labelling dialogues with a dialogue act la-
belling scheme. In this work, we exam-
ine whether it is possible to fully auto-
mate the tagging task with the goal of en-
abling rapid creation of corpora for eval-
uating spoken dialogue systems and com-
paring them to human-human dialogues.
We report results for training and test-
ing an automatic classifier to label the in-
formation provider?s utterances in spoken
human-computer and human-human dia-
logues with DATE (Dialogue Act Tagging
for Evaluation) dialogue act tags. We
train and test the DATE tagger on var-
ious combinations of the DARPA Com-
municator June-2000 and October-2001
human-computer corpora, and the CMU
human-human corpus in the travel plan-
ning domain. Our results show that we
can achieve high accuracies on the human-
computer data, and surprisingly, that the
human-computer data improves accuracy
on the human-human data, when only
small amounts of human-human training
data are available.
