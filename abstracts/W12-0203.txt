In statistical NLP, Semantic Vector Spaces
(SVS) are the standard technique for the
automatic modeling of lexical semantics.
However, it is largely unclear how these
black-box techniques exactly capture word
meaning. To explore the way an SVS struc-
tures the individual occurrences of words,
we use a non-parametric MDS solution of
a token-by-token similarity matrix. The
MDS solution is visualized in an interac-
tive plot with the Google Chart Tools. As
a case study, we look at the occurrences of
476 Dutch nouns grouped in 214 synsets.
