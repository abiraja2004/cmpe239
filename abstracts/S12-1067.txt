In this paper, we describe the system we sub-
mitted to the SemEval-2012 Lexical Simplifi-
cation Task. Our system (mmSystem) com-
bines word frequency with decompositional
semantics criteria based on syntactic structure
in order to rank candidate substitutes of lexical
forms of arbitrary syntactic complexity (one-
word, multi-word, etc.) in descending order
of (cognitive) simplicity. We believe that the
proposed approach might help to shed light on
the interplay between linguistic features and
lexical complexity in general.
