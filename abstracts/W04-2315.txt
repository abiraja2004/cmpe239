 
The Speech Graffiti interface is designed to be 
a portable, transparent interface for spoken 
language interaction with simple machines 
and information servers. Because it is a subset 
language, users must learn and adhere to the 
constraints of the language. We conducted a 
user study to determine habitability and found 
that more than 80% of utterances were Speech 
Graffiti-grammatical, suggesting that the lan-
guage is acceptably learnable and usable for 
most users. We also analyzed deviations from 
grammaticality and found that natural lan-
guage input accounted for the most deviations 
from Speech Graffiti. The results will suggest 
changes to the interface and can also inform 
design choices in other speech interfaces.
