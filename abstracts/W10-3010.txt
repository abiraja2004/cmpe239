We extend our prior work on specula-
tive sentence recognition and speculation
scope detection in biomedical text to the
CoNLL-2010 Shared Task on Hedge De-
tection. In our participation, we sought
to assess the extensibility and portability
of our prior work, which relies on linguis-
tic categorization and weighting of hedg-
ing cues and on syntactic patterns in which
these cues play a role. For Task 1B,
we tuned our categorization and weight-
ing scheme to recognize hedging in bio-
logical text. By accommodating a small
number of vagueness quantifiers, we were
able to extend our methodology to de-
tecting vague sentences in Wikipedia arti-
cles. We exploited constituent parse trees
in addition to syntactic dependency rela-
tions in resolving hedging scope. Our re-
sults are competitive with those of closed-
domain trained systems and demonstrate
that our high-precision oriented methodol-
ogy is extensible and portable.
