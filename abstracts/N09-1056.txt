We address the problem of large-scale auto-
matic detection of online reviews without us-
ing any human labels. We propose an efficient
method that combines two basic ideas: Build-
ing a classifier from a large number of noisy
examples and using the structure of the web-
site to enhance the performance of this classi-
fier. Experiments suggest that our method is
competitive against supervised learning meth-
ods that mandate expensive human effort.
