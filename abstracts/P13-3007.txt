In this paper, we propose a method to raise the
accuracy of text classification based on latent
topics, reconsidering the techniques necessary
for good classification ? for example, to de-
cide important sentences in a document, the
sentences with important words are usually re-
garded as important sentences. In this case,
tf.idf is often used to decide important words.
On the other hand, we apply the PageRank al-
gorithm to rank important words in each doc-
ument. Furthermore, before clustering docu-
ments, we refine the target documents by rep-
resenting them as a collection of important
sentences in each document. We then clas-
sify the documents based on latent informa-
tion in the documents. As a clustering method,
we employ the k-means algorithm and inves-
tigate how our proposed method works for
good clustering. We conduct experiments with
Reuters-21578 corpus under various condi-
tions of important sentence extraction, using
latent and surface information for clustering,
and have confirmed that our proposed method
provides better result among various condi-
tions for clustering.
