We have developed an automated Japanese
essay scoring system called Jess. The sys-
tem needs expert writings rather than ex-
pert raters to build the evaluation model.
By detecting statistical outliers of prede-
termined aimed essay features compared
with many professional writings for each
prompt, our system can evaluate essays.
The following three features are exam-
ined: (1) rhetoric ? syntactic variety, or
the use of various structures in the arrange-
ment of phases, clauses, and sentences,
(2) organization ? characteristics associ-
ated with the orderly presentation of ideas,
such as rhetorical features and linguistic
cues, and (3) content ? vocabulary re-
lated to the topic, such as relevant infor-
mation and precise or specialized vocabu-
lary. The final evaluation score is calcu-
lated by deducting from a perfect score as-
signed by a learning process using editori-
als and columns from the Mainichi Daily
News newspaper. A diagnosis for the es-
say is also given.
