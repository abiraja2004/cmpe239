We present a document compression sys-
tem that uses a hierarchical noisy-channel
model of text production. Our compres-
sion system first automatically derives the
syntactic structure of each sentence and
the overall discourse structure of the text
given as input. The system then uses a sta-
tistical hierarchical model of text produc-
tion in order to drop non-important syn-
tactic and discourse constituents so as to
generate coherent, grammatical document
compressions of arbitrary length. The sys-
tem outperforms both a baseline and a
sentence-based compression system that
operates by simplifying sequentially all
sentences in a text. Our results support
the claim that discourse knowledge plays
an important role in document summariza-
tion.
