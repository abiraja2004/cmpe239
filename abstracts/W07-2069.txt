Most of the previous works that disam-
biguate personal names in Web search re-
sults employ agglomerative clustering ap-
proaches. However, these approaches tend
to generate clusters that contain a single el-
ement depending on a certain criterion of
merging similar clusters. In contrast to such
previous works, we have adopted a semi-
supervised clustering approach to integrate
similar documents into a labeled document.
Moreover, our proposed approach is char-
acterized by controlling the fluctuation of
the centroid of a cluster in order to generate
more accurate clusters.
