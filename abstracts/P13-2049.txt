This paper proposes a methodology for
generating specialized Japanese data sets
for textual entailment, which consists of
pairs decomposed into basic sentence rela-
tions. We experimented with our method-
ology over a number of pairs taken from
the RITE-2 data set. We compared
our methodology with existing studies
in terms of agreement, frequencies and
times, and we evaluated its validity by in-
vestigating recognition accuracy.
