Indirect negative evidence is clearly an im-
portant way for learners to constrain over-
generalisation, and yet a good learning
theoretic analysis has yet to be provided
for this, whether in a PAC or a proba-
bilistic identification in the limit frame-
work. In this paper we suggest a theoreti-
cal analysis of indirect negative evidence
that allows the presence of ungrammati-
cal strings in the input and also accounts
for the relationship between grammatical-
ity/acceptability and probability. Given
independently justified assumptions about
lower bounds on the probabilities of gram-
matical strings, we establish that a limited
number of membership queries of some
strings can be probabilistically simulated.
