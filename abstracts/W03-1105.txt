In this paper, we investigate the use of
multivariate Poisson model and feature
weighting to learn naive Bayes text clas-
sifier. Our new naive Bayes text classifi-
cation model assumes that a document is
generated by a multivariate Poisson model
while the previous works consider a doc-
ument as a vector of binary term features
based on the presence or absence of each
term. We also explore the use of feature
weighting for the naive Bayes text classifi-
cation rather than feature selection, which
is a quite costly process when a small
number of the new training documents are
continuously provided.
Experimental results on the two test col-
lections indicate that our new model with
the proposed parameter estimation and the
feature weighting technique leads to sub-
stantial improvements compared to the
unigram language model classifiers that
are known to outperform the original pure
naive Bayes text classifiers.
