 
We show how a treebank can be used to 
cluster words on the basis of their syntac- 
tic behavior. The resulting clusters repre- 
sent distinct types of behavior with much 
more precision than parts of speech. As an 
example we show how prepositions can be 
automatical ly subdivided by their syntac- 
tic behavior and discuss the appropriate- 
ness of such a subdivision. Applications of 
this work are also discussed.
