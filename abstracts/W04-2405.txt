This paper investigates the application of co-
training and self-training to word sense disam-
biguation. Optimal and empirical parameter se-
lection methods for co-training and self-training
are investigated, with various degrees of error
reduction. A new method that combines co-
training with majority voting is introduced, with
the effect of smoothing the bootstrapping learn-
ing curves, and improving the average perfor-
mance.
