 
We describe the development environment 
available to linguistic developers in our lab 
in writing large-scale grammars for 
multiple languages. The environment 
consists of the tools that assist writing 
linguistic rules and running regression 
testing against large corpora, both of which 
are indispensable for realistic development 
of large-scale parsing systems. We also 
emphasize the importance of parser 
efficiency as an integral part of efficient 
parser development. The tools and methods 
described in this paper are actively used in 
the daily development of broad-coverage 
natural language understanding systems in 
seven languages (Chinese, English, French, 
German, Japanese, Korean and Spanish).
