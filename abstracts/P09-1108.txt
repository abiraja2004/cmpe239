A? parsing makes 1-best search efficient by
suppressing unlikely 1-best items. Existing k-
best extraction methods can efficiently search
for top derivations, but only after an exhaus-
tive 1-best pass. We present a unified algo-
rithm for k-best A? parsing which preserves
the efficiency of k-best extraction while giv-
ing the speed-ups of A? methods. Our algo-
rithm produces optimal k-best parses under the
same conditions required for optimality in a
1-best A? parser. Empirically, optimal k-best
lists can be extracted significantly faster than
with other approaches, over a range of gram-
mar types.
