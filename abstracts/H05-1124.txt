Many language processing tasks can be re-
duced to breaking the text into segments
with prescribed properties. Such tasks
include sentence splitting, tokenization,
named-entity extraction, and chunking.
We present a new model of text segmenta-
tion based on ideas from multilabel clas-
sification. Using this model, we can natu-
rally represent segmentation problems in-
volving overlapping and non-contiguous
segments. We evaluate the model on en-
tity extraction and noun-phrase chunking
and show that it is more accurate for over-
lapping and non-contiguous segments, but
it still performs well on simpler data sets
for which sequential tagging has been the
best method.
