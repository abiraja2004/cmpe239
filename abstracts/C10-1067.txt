This paper investigates the use and the
prediction potential of semantic similar-
ity measures for automatic generation of
links across different documents and pas-
sages. First, the correlation between the
way people link content and the results
produced by standard semantic similarity
measures is investigated. The relation be-
tween semantic similarity and the length
of the documents is then also analysed.
Based on these findings a new method for
link generation is formulated and tested.
