In this paper, we present a method for
the semantic tagging of word chunks ex-
tracted from a written transcription of con-
versations. This work is part of an ongo-
ing project for an information extraction
system in the field of maritime Search And
Rescue (SAR). Our purpose is to auto-
matically annotate parts of texts with con-
cepts from a SAR ontology. Our approach
combines two knowledge sources a SAR
ontology and the Wordsmyth dictionary-
thesaurus, and it uses a similarity measure
for the classification. Evaluation is carried
out by comparing the output of the system
with key answers of predefined extraction
templates.
