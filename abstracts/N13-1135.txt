Twitter offers an unprecedented advantage on
live reporting of the events happening around
the world. However, summarizing the Twit-
ter event has been a challenging task that was
not fully explored in the past. In this paper,
we propose a participant-based event summa-
rization approach that ?zooms-in? the Twit-
ter event streams to the participant level, de-
tects the important sub-events associated with
each participant using a novel mixture model
that combines the ?burstiness? and ?cohesive-
ness? properties of the event tweets, and gen-
erates the event summaries progressively. We
evaluate the proposed approach on different
event types. Results show that the participant-
based approach can effectively capture the
sub-events that have otherwise been shadowed
by the long-tail of other dominant sub-events,
yielding summaries with considerably better
coverage than the state-of-the-art.
