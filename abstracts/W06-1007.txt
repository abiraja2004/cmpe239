 
We introduce a new type of lexical struc-
ture called 
 
lexical system
 
, an interopera-
ble model that can feed both monolingual
and multilingual language resources. We
begin with a formal characterization of
lexical systems as ?pure? directed graphs,
solely made up of nodes corresponding to
lexical entities and links. To illustrate our
approach, we present data borrowed from
a lexical system that has been generated
from the French DiCo database. We later
explain how the compilation of the origi-
nal dictionary-like database into a net-like
one has been made possible. Finally, we
discuss the potential of the proposed lexi-
cal structure for designing multilingual
lexical resources.
