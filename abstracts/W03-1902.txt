This work presents the data model we
adopted for annotating coreference. Our
data model includes different levels of an-
notation, such as part-of-speech, syntax
and discourse. We compare our encod-
ing schemes to the abstract XML encod-
ing being proposed as standard. We also
present our tool for coreference resolution
that handles our data model.
