the nature of evidence for a statement. In 
other words, it is the linguistically encoded 
evidence for the trustworthiness of a state-
ment. In this paper, we aim to explore how 
linguistically encoded information of eviden-
tiality can contribute to the prediction of 
trustworthiness in natural language processing 
(NLP). We propose to incorporate evidential-
ity into a framework of machine learning 
based text classification. We first construct a 
taxonomy of evidentials. Then experiments 
involving collaborative question answering 
(CQA) are designed and implemented using 
this taxonomy. The experimental results con-
firm that evidentiality is an important clue for 
text trustworthiness detection. With the bi-
narized vector setting, evidential based text 
representation model has considerably per-
formaned better than both the bag-of-word 
model and the content word based model. 
Most crucially, we show that the best trust-
worthiness detection result is achieved when 
evidentiality is incorporated in a linguistically 
sophisticated model where their meanings are 
interpreted in both semantic and pragmatic 
terms.
