SCXML was proposed as one description
language for dialog control in the W3C
Multimodal Architecture but lacks the fa-
cilities required for grounding and rea-
soning. This prohibits the application of
many dialog modeling techniques for mul-
timodal applications following this W3C
standard. By extending SCXML with a
Prolog datamodel and scripting language,
we enable those techniques to be em-
ployed again. Thereby bridging the gap
between respective dialog modeling re-
search and a standardized architecture to
access and coordinate modalities.
