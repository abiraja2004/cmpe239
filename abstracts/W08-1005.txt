We describe experiments on learning latent
variable grammars for various German tree-
banks, using a language-agnostic statistical
approach. In our method, a minimal ini-
tial grammar is hierarchically refined using an
adaptive split-and-merge EM procedure, giv-
ing compact, accurate grammars. The learn-
ing procedure directly maximizes the likeli-
hood of the training treebank, without the use
of any language specific or linguistically con-
strained features. Nonetheless, the resulting
grammars encode many linguistically inter-
pretable patterns and give the best published
parsing accuracies on three German treebanks.
