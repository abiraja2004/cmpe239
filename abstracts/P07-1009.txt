A standard form of analysis for linguis-
tic typology is the universal implication.
These implications state facts about the
range of extant languages, such as ?if ob-
jects come after verbs, then adjectives come
after nouns.? Such implications are typi-
cally discovered by painstaking hand anal-
ysis over a small sample of languages. We
propose a computational model for assist-
ing at this process. Our model is able to
discover both well-known implications as
well as some novel implications that deserve
further study. Moreover, through a careful
application of hierarchical analysis, we are
able to cope with the well-known sampling
problem: languages are not independent.
