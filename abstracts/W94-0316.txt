 
In this paper, we address one of the central problems 
in text generation: the missing link ("the generation 
gap" in Meteer's terms) between the global discourse 
organization as often provided by text planning mod- 
ules and the linguistic realization of this organiza- 
tion. We argue that the link should be established 
by the lexical choice proces  using resources derived 
from Mel'~uk's Lezical Functions (LFs). In particular, 
we demonstrate hat sequences of LFs may well serve 
as lexical discourse structure relations which link up to 
global discourse relations in the output of a Rhetorical 
Structure Theory style text planner.
