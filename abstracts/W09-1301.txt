We propose a static relation extraction task to
complement biomedical information extrac-
tion approaches. We argue that static re-
lations such as part-whole are implicitly in-
volved in many common extraction settings,
define a task setting making them explicit, and
discuss their integration into previously pro-
posed tasks and extraction methods. We fur-
ther identify a specific static relation extrac-
tion task motivated by the BioNLP?09 shared
task on event extraction, introduce an anno-
tated corpus for the task, and demonstrate the
feasibility of the task by experiments showing
that the defined relations can be reliably ex-
tracted. The task setting and corpus can serve
to support several forms of domain informa-
tion extraction.
