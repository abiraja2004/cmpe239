There is plenty of evidence that emotion
analysis has many valuable applications.
In this study a blog emotion corpus is con-
structed for Chinese emotional expression
analysis. This corpus contains manual an-
notation of eight emotional categories (ex-
pect, joy, love, surprise, anxiety, sorrow,
angry and hate), emotion intensity, emo-
tion holder/target, emotional word/phrase,
degree word, negative word, conjunction,
rhetoric, punctuation and other linguistic
expressions that indicate emotion. An-
notation agreement analyses for emotion
classes and emotional words and phrases
are described. Then, using this corpus,
we explore emotion expressions in Chi-
nese and present the analyses on them.
