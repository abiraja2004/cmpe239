Analogical learning over strings is a holis-
tic model that has been investigated by a
few authors as a means to map forms of a
source language to forms of a target lan-
guage. In this study, we revisit this learn-
ing paradigm and apply it to the translit-
eration task. We show that alone, it per-
forms worse than a statistical phrase-based
machine translation engine, but the com-
bination of both approaches outperforms
each one taken separately, demonstrating
the usefulness of the information captured
by a so-called formal analogy.
