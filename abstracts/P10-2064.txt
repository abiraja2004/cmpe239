Hierarchical A? (HA?) uses of a hierarchy
of coarse grammars to speed up parsing
without sacrificing optimality. HA? pri-
oritizes search in refined grammars using
Viterbi outside costs computed in coarser
grammars. We present Bridge Hierarchi-
cal A? (BHA?), a modified Hierarchial A?
algorithm which computes a novel outside
cost called a bridge outside cost. These
bridge costs mix finer outside scores with
coarser inside scores, and thus consti-
tute tighter heuristics than entirely coarse
scores. We show that BHA? substan-
tially outperforms HA? when the hierar-
chy contains only very coarse grammars,
while achieving comparable performance
on more refined hierarchies.
