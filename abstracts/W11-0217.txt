Increasingly, as full-text scientific papers are
becoming available, scientific queries have
shifted from looking for facts to looking for
arguments. Researchers want to know when
their colleagues are proposing theories, out-
lining evidentiary relations, or explaining dis-
crepancies. We show here that sentence-level
annotation with the CISP schema adapts well
to a corpus of biomedical articles, and we
present preliminary results arguing that the
CISP schema is uniquely suited to recovering
common types of scientific arguments about
hypotheses, explanations, and evidence.
