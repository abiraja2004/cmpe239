Space characters can have an important role
in disambiguating text. However, few, if
any, Chinese information extraction systems
make full use of space characters. However,
it seems that treatment of space characters
is necessary, especially in cases of extract-
ing information from semi-structured docu-
ments. This investigation aims to address
the importance of space characters in Chi-
nese information extraction by parsing some
semi-structured documents with two simi-
lar grammars - one with treatment for space
characters, the other ignoring it. This paper
also introduces two post processing filters
to further improve treatment of space char-
acters. Results show that the grammar that
takes account of spaces clearly out-performs
the one that ignores them, and so concludes
that space characters can play a useful role in
information extraction.
