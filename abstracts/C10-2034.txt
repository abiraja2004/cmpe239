A new approach has been developed 
for acquiring bilingual web pages from 
the result pages of search engines, 
which is composed of two challenging 
tasks. The first task is to detect web 
records embedded in the result pages 
automatically via a clustering method 
of a sample page. Identifying these 
useful records through the clustering 
method allows the generation of highly 
effective features for the next task 
which is high-quality bilingual web 
page acquisition. The task of 
high-quality bilingual web page 
acquisition is a classification problem. 
One advantage of our approach is that it 
is search engine and domain 
independent. The test is based on 2516 
records extracted from six search 
engines automatically and annotated 
manually, which gets a high precision 
of 81.3% and a recall of 94.93%. The 
experimental results indicate that our 
approach is very effective.
