In recent years, error mining approaches were
developed to help identify the most likely
sources of parsing failures in parsing sys-
tems using handcrafted grammars and lexi-
cons. However the techniques they use to enu-
merate and count n-grams builds on the se-
quential nature of a text corpus and do not eas-
ily extend to structured data. In this paper, we
propose an algorithm for mining trees and ap-
ply it to detect the most likely sources of gen-
eration failure. We show that this tree mining
algorithm permits identifying not only errors
in the generation system (grammar, lexicon)
but also mismatches between the structures
contained in the input and the input structures
expected by our generator as well as a few id-
iosyncrasies/error in the input data.
