 
Discriminating vandalism edits from 
non-vandalism edits in Wikipedia is a 
challenging task, as ill-intentioned edits 
can include a variety of content and be 
expressed in many different forms and 
styles. Previous studies are limited to 
rule-based methods and learning based 
on lexical features, lacking in linguistic 
analysis. In this paper, we propose a 
novel Web-based shallow syntactic-
semantic modeling method, which utiliz-
es Web search results as resource and 
trains topic-specific n-tag and syntactic 
n-gram language models to detect van-
dalism. By combining basic task-specific 
and lexical features, we have achieved 
high F-measures using logistic boosting 
and logistic model trees classifiers, sur-
passing the results reported by major 
Wikipedia vandalism detection systems.
