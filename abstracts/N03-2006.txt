 
In order to boost the translation quality of 
EBMT based on a small-sized bilingual cor-
pus, we use an out-of-domain bilingual corpus 
and, in addition, the language model of an in-
domain monolingual corpus. We conducted 
experiments with an EBMT system. The two 
evaluation measures of the BLEU score and 
the NIST score demonstrated the effect of us-
ing an out-of-domain bilingual corpus and the 
possibility of using the language model.
