 
This paper introduces the probabilistic 
paradigm, a probabilistic, declarative 
model of morphological structure. We de-
scribe an algorithm that recursively ap-
plies Latent Dirichlet Allocation with an 
orthogonality constraint to discover mor-
phological paradigms as the latent classes 
within a suffix-stem matrix. We apply the 
algorithm to data preprocessed in several 
different ways, and show that when suf-
fixes are distinguished for part of speech 
and allomorphs  or gender/conjugational 
variants are merged, the model is able to 
correctly learn morphological paradigms 
for English and Spanish. We compare our 
system with Linguistica (Goldsmith 
2001), and discuss the advantages of the 
probabilistic paradigm over Linguistica?s 
signature representation.
