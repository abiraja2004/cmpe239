With the recent rise in popularity and size of
social media, there is a growing need for sys-
tems that can extract useful information from
this amount of data. We address the prob-
lem of detecting new events from a stream of
Twitter posts. To make event detection feasi-
ble on web-scale corpora, we present an algo-
rithm based on locality-sensitive hashing which
is able overcome the limitations of traditional
approaches, while maintaining competitive re-
sults. In particular, a comparison with a state-
of-the-art system on the first story detection
task shows that we achieve over an order of
magnitude speedup in processing time, while
retaining comparable performance. Event de-
tection experiments on a collection of 160 mil-
lion Twitter posts show that celebrity deaths
are the fastest spreading news on Twitter.
