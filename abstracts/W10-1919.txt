Event extraction approaches based on ex-
pressive structured representations of ex-
tracted information have been a significant
focus of research in recent biomedical nat-
ural language processing studies. How-
ever, event extraction efforts have so far
been limited to publication abstracts, with
most studies further considering only the
specific transcription factor-related subdo-
main of molecular biology of the GENIA
corpus. To establish the broader relevance
of the event extraction approach and pro-
posed methods, it is necessary to expand
on these constraints. In this study, we pro-
pose an adaptation of the event extraction
approach to a subdomain related to infec-
tious diseases and present analysis and ini-
tial experiments on the feasibility of event
extraction from domain full text publica-
tions.
