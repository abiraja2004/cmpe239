This paper describes the results of our experi-
ments in building speaker-adaptive recogniz-
ers for talkers with spastic dysarthria. We
study two modifications ? (a) MAP adapta-
tion of speaker-independent systems trained
on normal speech and, (b) using a transition
probability matrix that is a linear interpolation
between fully ergodic and (exclusively) left-
to-right structures, for both speaker-dependent
and speaker-adapted systems. The experi-
ments indicate that (1) for speaker-dependent
systems, left-to-right HMMs have lower word
error rate than transition-interpolated HMMs,
(2) adapting all parameters other than transi-
tion probabilities results in the highest recog-
nition accuracy compared to adapting any
subset of these parameters or adapting all
parameters including transition probabilities,
(3) performing both transition-interpolation
and adaptation gives higher word error rate
than performing adaptation alone and, (4)
dysarthria severity is not a sufficient indica-
tor of the relative performance of speaker-
dependent and speaker-adapted systems.
