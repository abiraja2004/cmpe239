 
This paper presents a speech synthesis system 
for Amharic language and describes and how 
the important prosodic features of the lan-
guage were modeled in the system. The devel-
oped Amharic Text-to-Speech system 
(AmhTTS) is parametric and rule-based that 
employs a cepstral method. The system uses a 
source filter model for speech production and 
a Log Magnitude Approximation (LMA) filter 
as the vocal tract filter. The intelligibility and 
naturalness of the system was evaluated by 
word and sentence listening tests respectively 
and we achieved 98% correct-rates for words 
and an average Mean Opinion Score (MOS) of 
3.2 (which is categorized as good) for sen-
tences listening tests. The synthesized speech 
has high intelligibility and moderate natural-
ness. Comparing with previous similar study, 
our system produced considerably similar 
quality speech with a fairly good prosody. In 
particular our system is mainly suitable for 
building new languages with little modifica-
tion.
