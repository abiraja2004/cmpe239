Several language processing tasks can be
inherently represented by a weighted graph
where the weights are interpreted as a
measure of relatedness between two ver-
tices. Measuring similarity between ar-
bitary pairs of vertices is essential in solv-
ing several language processing problems
on these datasets. Random walk based
measures perform better than other path
based measures like shortest-path. We
evaluate several random walk measures
and propose a new measure based on com-
mute time. We use the psuedo inverse
of the Laplacian to derive estimates for
commute times in graphs. Further, we
show that this pseudo inverse based mea-
sure could be improved by discarding the
least significant eigenvectors, correspond-
ing to the noise in the graph construction
process, using singular value decomposi-
tion.
