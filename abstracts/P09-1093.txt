Conventional sentence compression meth-
ods employ a syntactic parser to compress
a sentence without changing its mean-
ing. However, the reference compres-
sions made by humans do not always re-
tain the syntactic structures of the original
sentences. Moreover, for the goal of on-
demand sentence compression, the time
spent in the parsing stage is not negligi-
ble. As an alternative to syntactic pars-
ing, we propose a novel term weighting
technique based on the positional infor-
mation within the original sentence and
a novel language model that combines
statistics from the original sentence and a
general corpus. Experiments that involve
both human subjective evaluations and au-
tomatic evaluations show that our method
outperforms Hori?s method, a state-of-the-
art conventional technique. Because our
method does not use a syntactic parser, it
is 4.3 times faster than Hori?s method.
