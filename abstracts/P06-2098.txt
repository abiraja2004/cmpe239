There are two decoding algorithms essen-
tial to the area of natural language pro-
cessing. One is the Viterbi algorithm
for linear-chain models, such as HMMs
or CRFs. The other is the CKY algo-
rithm for probabilistic context free gram-
mars. However, tasks such as noun phrase
chunking and relation extraction seem to
fall between the two, neither of them be-
ing the best fit. Ideally we would like to
model entities and relations, with two lay-
ers of labels. We present a tractable algo-
rithm for exact inference over two layers
of labels and chunks with time complexity
O(n2), and provide empirical results com-
paring our model with linear-chain mod-
els.
