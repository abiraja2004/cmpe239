A joint syntactic and semantic dependency
parsing system submitted to the CoNLL-2009
shared task is presented in this paper. The
system is composed of three components: a
syntactic dependency parser, a predicate clas-
sifier and a semantic parser. The first-order
MSTParser is used as our syntactic depen-
dency pasrser. Projective and non-projective
MSTParsers are compared with each other on
seven languages. Predicate classification and
semantic parsing are both recognized as clas-
sification problem, and the Maximum Entropy
Models are used for them in our system. For
semantic parsing and predicate classifying, we
focus on finding optimized features on multi-
ple languages. The average Macro F1 Score
of our system is 73.97 for joint task in closed
challenge.
