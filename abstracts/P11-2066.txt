Word alignment has an exponentially large
search space, which often makes exact infer-
ence infeasible. Recent studies have shown
that inversion transduction grammars are rea-
sonable constraints for word alignment, and
that the constrained space could be efficiently
searched using synchronous parsing algo-
rithms. However, spurious ambiguity may oc-
cur in synchronous parsing and cause prob-
lems in both search efficiency and accuracy. In
this paper, we conduct a detailed study of the
causes of spurious ambiguity and how it ef-
fects parsing and discriminative learning. We
also propose a variant of the grammar which
eliminates those ambiguities. Our grammar
shows advantages over previous grammars in
both synthetic and real-world experiments.
