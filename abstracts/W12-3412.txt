We present an architecture for parsing in two
steps. A phrase-structure parser builds for
each sentence an n-best list of analyses which
are converted to dependency trees. These de-
pendency structures are then rescored by a dis-
criminative reranker. Our method is language
agnostic and enables the incorporation of ad-
ditional information which are useful for the
choice of the best parse candidate. We test
our approach on the the Penn Treebank and
the French Treebank. Evaluation shows a sig-
nificative improvement on different parse met-
rics.
