 
Nominalization is a highly pro- 
ductive phenomena in most lan- 
guages. The process of nominaliza- 
tion ejects a verb from its syntactic 
role into a nominal position. The 
original verb is often replaced by a 
semantically emptied support verb 
(e.g., make a proposal). The choice 
of a support verb for a given nomi- 
nalization is unpredictable, causing 
a problem for language learners as 
well as for natural language pro- 
cessing systems. We present here 
a method of discovering support 
verbs from an untagged corpus via 
low-level syntactic processing and 
comparison of arguments attached 
to verbal forms and potential nom- 
inalized forms. The result of the 
process is a list of potential support 
verbs for the nominalized form of a 
given predicate.
