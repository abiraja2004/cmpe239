In statistical machine translation, the gen-
eration of a translation hypothesis is com-
putationally expensive. If arbitrary re-
orderings are permitted, the search prob-
lem is NP-hard. On the other hand,
if we restrict the possible reorderings
in an appropriate way, we obtain a
polynomial-time search algorithm. We in-
vestigate different reordering constraints
for phrase-based statistical machine trans-
lation, namely the IBM constraints and
the ITG constraints. We present effi-
cient dynamic programming algorithms
for both constraints. We evaluate the con-
straints with respect to translation quality
on two Japanese?English tasks. We show
that the reordering constraints improve
translation quality compared to an un-
constrained search that permits arbitrary
phrase reorderings. The ITG constraints
preform best on both tasks and yield sta-
tistically significant improvements com-
pared to the unconstrained search.
