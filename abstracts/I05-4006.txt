This paper describes the structural an-
notation of a spoken dialogue corpus.
By statistically dealing with the corpus,
the automatic acquisition of dialogue-
structural rules is achieved. The di-
alogue structure is expressed as a bi-
nary tree and 789 dialogues consist-
ing of 8150 utterances in the CIAIR
speech corpus are annotated. To eval-
uate the scalability of the corpus for
creating dialogue-structural rules, a di-
alogue parsing experiment was con-
ducted.
