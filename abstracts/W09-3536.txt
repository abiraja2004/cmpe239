 
We report in this paper a novel hybrid ap-
proach for Urdu to Hindi transliteration that 
combines finite-state machine (FSM) based 
techniques with statistical word language 
model based approach. The output from the 
FSM is filtered with the word language model 
to produce the correct Hindi output. The main 
problem handled is the case of omission of di-
acritical marks from the input Urdu text. Our 
system produces the correct Hindi output even 
when the crucial information in the form of di-
acritic marks is absent. The approach improves 
the accuracy of the transducer-only approach 
from 50.7% to 79.1%. The results reported 
show that performance can be improved using 
a word language model to disambiguate the 
output produced by the transducer-only ap-
proach, especially when diacritic marks are not 
present in the Urdu input.
