Automatically extracting social meaning and
intention from spoken dialogue is an impor-
tant task for dialogue systems and social com-
puting. We describe a system for detecting
elements of interactional style: whether a
speaker is awkward, friendly, or flirtatious.
We create and use a new spoken corpus of 991
4-minute speed-dates. Participants rated their
interlocutors for these elements of style. Us-
ing rich dialogue, lexical, and prosodic fea-
tures, we are able to detect flirtatious, awk-
ward, and friendly styles in noisy natural con-
versational data with up to 75% accuracy,
compared to a 50% baseline. We describe sim-
ple ways to extract relatively rich dialogue fea-
tures, and analyze which features performed
similarly for men and women and which were
gender-specific.
