This paper presents a new fully automatic method for building highly
dense and accurate knowledge bases from existing semantic resources.
Basically, the method uses a wide-coverage and accurate knowledge-
based Word Sense Disambiguation algorithm to assign the most appro-
priate senses to large sets of topically related words acquired from the
web. KnowNet, the resulting knowledge-base which connects large sets
of semantically-related concepts is a major step towards the autonomous
acquisition of knowledge from raw corpora. In fact, KnowNet is several
times larger than any available knowledge resource encoding relations
between synsets, and the knowledge that KnowNet contains outperform
any other resource when empirically evaluated in a common multilingual
framework.
