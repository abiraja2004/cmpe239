We introduce cube summing, a technique
that permits dynamic programming algo-
rithms for summing over structures (like
the forward and inside algorithms) to be
extended with non-local features that vio-
late the classical structural independence
assumptions. It is inspired by cube prun-
ing (Chiang, 2007; Huang and Chiang,
2007) in its computation of non-local
features dynamically using scored k-best
lists, but also maintains additional resid-
ual quantities used in calculating approx-
imate marginals. When restricted to lo-
cal features, cube summing reduces to a
novel semiring (k-best+residual) that gen-
eralizes many of the semirings of Good-
man (1999). When non-local features are
included, cube summing does not reduce
to any semiring, but is compatible with
generic techniques for solving dynamic
programming equations.
