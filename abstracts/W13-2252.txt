This paper gives a detailed description of
the ACT (Accuracy of Connective Trans-
lation) metric, a reference-based metric
that assesses only connective translations.
ACT relies on automatic word-level align-
ment (using GIZA++) between a source
sentence and respectively the reference
and candidate translations, along with
other heuristics for comparing translations
of discourse connectives. Using a dictio-
nary of equivalents, the translations are
scored automatically or, for more accu-
racy, semi-automatically. The accuracy of
the ACT metric was assessed by human
judges on sample data for English/French,
English/Arabic, English/Italian and En-
glish/German translations; the ACT scores
are within 2-5% of human scores.
The actual version of ACT is available
only for a limited language pairs. Conse-
quently, we are participating only for the
English/French and English/German lan-
guage pairs. Our hypothesis is that ACT
metric scores increase with better transla-
tion quality in terms of human evaluation.
