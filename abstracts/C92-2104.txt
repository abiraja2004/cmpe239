 
8EC's machine treuslat ion system "PIVOT" provides 
analysis editing functions. The user can iuterectivel~ 
correct errors in analysis results, such as dependency 
and case. However, without a \]earning mechanism, the 
user must correct similar dependency errors several 
times. We discuss the learning mechanism to u t i l i ze  
dependency and case information specified by the user, 
We compare four types of matching methods by simulation 
and show non-restricted best matching is the most 
effective.
