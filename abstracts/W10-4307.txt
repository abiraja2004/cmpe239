 
Multimodal conversational dialogue sys-
tems consisting of numerous software 
components create challenges for the un-
derlying software architecture and devel-
opment practices. Typically, such sys-
tems are built on separate, often pre-
existing components developed by dif-
ferent organizations and integrated in a 
highly iterative way. The traditional dia-
logue system pipeline is not flexible 
enough to address the needs of highly in-
teractive systems, which include parallel 
processing of multimodal input and out-
put. We present an architectural solution 
for a multimodal conversational social 
dialogue system.
