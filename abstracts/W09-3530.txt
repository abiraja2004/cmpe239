We report on our efforts as part of the
shared task on the NEWS 2009 Machine
Transliteration Shared Task. We applied
an orthographic perceptron character edit
model that we have used previously for
name transliteration, enhancing it in two
ways: by ranking possible transliterations
according to the sum of their scores ac-
cording to two models, one trained to gen-
erate left-to-right, and one right-to-left;
and by constraining generated strings to
be consistent with character bigrams ob-
served in the respective language?s train-
ing data. Our poor showing in the of-
ficial evaluation was due to a bug in
the script used to produce competition-
compliant output. Subsequent evaluation
shows that our approach yielded compara-
tively strong performance on all alphabetic
language pairs we attempted.
