Many NLP applications require information
about locations of objects referenced in text,
or relations between them in space. For ex-
ample, the phrase a book on the desk contains
information about the location of the object
book, as trajector, with respect to another ob-
ject desk, as landmark. Spatial Role Label-
ing (SpRL) is an evaluation task in the infor-
mation extraction domain which sets a goal
to automatically process text and identify ob-
jects of spatial scenes and relations between
them. This paper describes the task in Se-
mantic Evaluations 2013, annotation schema,
corpora, participants, methods and results ob-
tained by the participants.
