 
With the rapidly growing use of electronic 
health records, the possibility of large-scale 
clinical information extraction has drawn 
much attention. It is not, however, easy to ex-
tract information because these reports are 
written in natural language. To address this 
problem, this paper presents a system that 
converts a medical text into a table structure. 
This system?s core technologies are (1) medi-
cal event recognition modules and (2) a nega-
tive event identification module that judges 
whether an event actually occurred or not. 
Regarding the latter module, this paper also 
proposes an SVM-based classifier using syn-
tactic information. Experimental results dem-
onstrate empirically that syntactic information 
can contribute to the method?s accuracy.
