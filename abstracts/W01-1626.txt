This paper presents a corpus study
of evaluative and speculative language.
Knowledge of such language would be
useful in many applications, such as
text categorization and summarization.
Analyses of annotator agreement and of
characteristics of subjective language are
performed. This study yields knowl-
edge needed to design eective machine
learning systems for identifying subjec-
tive language.
