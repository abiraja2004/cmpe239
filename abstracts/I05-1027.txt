. This paper  proposes a two-step method for Chinese text categoriza-
tion (TC). In the first step, a Na?ve Bayesian classifier is used to fix the fuzzy 
area between two categories, and, in the second step, the classifier with more 
subtle and powerful features is used to deal with documents in the fuzzy area, 
which are thought of being unreliable in the first step. The preliminary experi-
ment validated the soundness of this method. Then, the method is extended 
from two-class TC to multi-class TC. In this two-step framework, we try to fur-
ther improve the classifier by taking the dependences among features into con-
sideration in the second step, resulting in a Causality Na?ve Bayesian Classifier.
