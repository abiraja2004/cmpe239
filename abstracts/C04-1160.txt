1 The talk will describe an ongoing project
(modestly named the Neural Theory of
Language) that is attempting to model
language behavior in a way that is both
neurally plausible and computationally
practical. The cornerstone of the effort is a
formalism called Embodied Construction
Grammar (ECG). I will describe the
formalism, a robust semantic parser based
on it, and a variety of applications of
moderate scale. These include a system for
understanding the (probabilistic and
metaphorical) implications of  news stories,
and the first cognitively plausible model of
how children learn grammar.
