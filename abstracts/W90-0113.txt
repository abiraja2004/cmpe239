 
I'his paper describes GENIE, an object-oriented 
architecture that generates text with the intent of extending 
user expertise in interactive environments. Such 
environments present three interesting oals. First, to 
provide information within the task at hand. Second to 
both respond to a user's task related question and 
simultaneously extend their knowledge. Third, to do this in 
a manner that is concise, clear and cohesive. Instead of 
generating text based solely on either discourse goals, 
intentions, or the domain, we found a need to combine 
techniques from each. We have developed an object 
oriented architecture in which the concepts about which 
we talk (domain entities), the goals that may be 
accomplished with them (intentions), end the rhetorical 
acts through which we express them (discourse goals) are 
represented as objects with localized knowledge end 
methods. This paper describes how current ext planning 
methods were insufficient for our needs, and presents our 
object-oriented method as an alternative.
