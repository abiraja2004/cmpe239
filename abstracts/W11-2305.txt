In this paper, we examine several methods
for including dynamic, contextually-sensitive
binary codes within indirect selection typing
methods using a grid with fixed symbol posi-
tions. Using Huffman codes derived from a
character n-gram model, we investigate both
synchronous (fixed latency highlighting) and
asynchronous (self-paced using long versus
short press) scanning. Additionally, we look
at methods that allow for scanning past a tar-
get and returning to it versus methods that re-
move unselected items from consideration. Fi-
nally, we investigate a novel method for dis-
playing the binary codes for each symbol to
the user, rather than using cell highlighting, as
the means for identifying the required input
sequence for the target symbol. We demon-
strate that dynamic coding methods for fixed
position grids can be tailored for very diverse
user requirements.
