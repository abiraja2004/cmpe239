Conventional wisdom dictates that syn-
chronous context-free grammars (SCFGs)
must be converted to Chomsky Normal Form
(CNF) to ensure cubic time decoding. For ar-
bitrary SCFGs, this is typically accomplished
via the synchronous binarization technique of
(Zhang et al, 2006). A drawback to this ap-
proach is that it inflates the constant factors as-
sociated with decoding, and thus the practical
running time. (DeNero et al, 2009) tackle this
problem by defining a superset of CNF called
Lexical Normal Form (LNF), which also sup-
ports cubic time decoding under certain im-
plicit assumptions. In this paper, we make
these assumptions explicit, and in doing so,
show that LNF can be further expanded to
a broader class of grammars (called ?scope-
3?) that also supports cubic-time decoding.
By simply pruning non-scope-3 rules from a
GHKM-extracted grammar, we obtain better
translation performance than synchronous bi-
narization.
