This paper explores the hypothesis that se-
mantic relatedness may be more reliably in-
ferred by using a multilingual space, as com-
pared to the typical monolingual representa-
tion. Through evaluations using several state-
of-the-art semantic relatedness systems, ap-
plied on standard datasets, we show that a
multilingual approach is better suited for this
task, and leads to improvements of up to 47%
with respect to the monolingual baseline.
