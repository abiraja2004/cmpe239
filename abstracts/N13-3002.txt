Effectively exploring and analyzing large text
corpora requires visualizations that provide a
high level summary. Past work has relied on
faceted browsing of document metadata or on
natural language processing of document text.
In this paper, we present a new web-based tool
that integrates topics learned from an unsuper-
vised topic model in a faceted browsing expe-
rience. The user can manage topics, filter doc-
uments by topic and summarize views with
metadata and topic graphs. We report a user
study of the usefulness of topics in our tool.
