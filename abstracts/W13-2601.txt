Cross-linguistic studies on unsupervised
word segmentation have consistently
shown that English is easier to segment
than other languages. In this paper, we
propose an explanation of this finding
based on the notion of segmentation
ambiguity. We show that English has a
very low segmentation ambiguity com-
pared to Japanese and that this difference
correlates with the segmentation perfor-
mance in a unigram model. We suggest
that segmentation ambiguity is linked
to a trade-off between syllable structure
complexity and word length distribution.
