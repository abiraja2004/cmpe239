This paper addresses the automatic clas-
sification of the semantic relations ex-
pressed by the English genitives. A learn-
ing model is introduced based on the sta-
tistical analysis of the distribution of gen-
itives? semantic relations on a large cor-
pus. The semantic and contextual fea-
tures of the genitive?s noun phrase con-
stituents play a key role in the identifica-
tion of the semantic relation. The algo-
rithm was tested on a corpus of approx-
imately 2,000 sentences and achieved an
accuracy of 79% , far better than 44% ac-
curacy obtained with C5.0, or 43% ob-
tained with a Naive Bayes algorithm, or
27% accuracy with a Support Vector Ma-
chines learner on the same corpus.
