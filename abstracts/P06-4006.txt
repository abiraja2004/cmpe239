 
The main aim of the MIMA (Mining In-
formation for Management and Acquisi-
tion) Search System is to achieve ?struc-
turing knowledge? to accelerate knowl-
edge exploitation in the domains of sci-
ence and technology. This system inte-
grates natural language processing includ-
ing ontology development, information 
retrieval, visualization, and database tech-
nology. The ?structuring knowledge? that 
we define indicates 1) knowledge storage, 
2) (hierarchical) classification of knowl-
edge, 3) analysis of knowledge, 4) visu-
alization of knowledge. We aim at inte-
grating different types of databases (pa-
pers and patents, technologies and innova-
tions) and knowledge domains, and simul-
taneously retrieving different types of 
knowledge. Applications for the several 
targets such as syllabus structuring will 
also be mentioned.
