This paper presents an effective algorith-
m of annotation adaptation for constituen-
cy treebanks, which transforms a treebank
from one annotation guideline to anoth-
er with an iterative optimization proce-
dure, thus to build a much larger treebank
to train an enhanced parser without in-
creasing model complexity. Experiments
show that the transformed Tsinghua Chi-
nese Treebank as additional training da-
ta brings significant improvement over the
baseline trained on Penn Chinese Tree-
bank only.
