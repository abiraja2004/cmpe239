In practical applications, decoding speed
is very important. Modern structured
learning technique adopts template based
method to extract millions of features.
Complicated templates bring about abun-
dant features which lead to higher accu-
racy but more feature extraction time. We
propose Two Dimensional Trie (2D Trie),
a novel efficient feature indexing structure
which takes advantage of relationship be-
tween templates: feature strings generated
by a template are prefixes of the features
from its extended templates. We apply
our technique to Maximum Spanning Tree
dependency parsing. Experimental results
on Chinese Tree Bank corpus show that
our 2D Trie is about 5 times faster than
traditional Trie structure, making parsing
speed 4.3 times faster.
