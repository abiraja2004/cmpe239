 
We propose an English-Chinese name transli-
teration system using a maximum N-gram 
Hidden Markov Model. To handle special 
challenges with alphabet-based and character-
based language pair, we apply a two-phase 
transliteration model by building two HMM 
models, one between English and Chinese Pi-
nyin and another between Chinese Pinyin and 
Chinese characters. Our model improves tradi-
tional HMM by assigning the longest prior 
translation sequence of syllables the largest 
weight. In our non-standard runs, we use a 
Web-mining module to boost the performance 
by adding online popularity information of 
candidate translations. The entire model does 
not rely on any dictionaries and the probability 
tables are derived merely from training corpus. 
In participation of NEWS 2009 experiment, 
our model achieved 0.462 Top-1 accuracy and 
0.764 Mean F-score.
