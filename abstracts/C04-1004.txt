 
This paper proposes a discriminative HMM 
(DHMM) with long state dependence (LSD-
DHMM) to segment and label sequential data. 
The LSD-DHMM overcomes the strong context 
independent assumption in traditional generative 
HMMs (GHMMs) and models the sequential data 
in a discriminative way, by assuming a novel 
mutual information independence. As a result, the 
LSD-DHMM separately models the long state 
dependence in its state transition model and the 
observation dependence in its output model. In 
this paper, a variable-length mutual information-
based modeling approach and an ensemble of 
kNN probability estimators are proposed to 
capture the long state dependence and the 
observation dependence respectively. The 
evaluation on shallow parsing shows that the 
LSD-DHMM not only significantly outperforms 
GHMMs but also much outperforms other 
DHMMs. This suggests that the LSD-DHMM can 
effectively capture the long context dependence to 
segment and label sequential data.
