 
The importance ofdealing with unknown words in Natural Language Processing 
(NLP) is growing as NLP systems are used in more and more applications. One aid 
in predicting the lexical class of words that do not appear in the lexicon (referred 
to as unknown words) is the use of syntactic parsing rules. The distinction between 
closed-class and open-class words together with morphological recognition appears 
to be pivotal in increasing the ability of the system to predict he lexical categories of
unknown words. An experiment is performed to investigate he ability of a parser to 
parse unknown words using morphology and syntactic parsing rules without human 
intervention. This experiment shows that the performance of the parser is enhanced 
greatly when morphological recognition is used in conjunction with syntactic rules 
to parse sentences containing unknown words from the TIMIT corpus.
