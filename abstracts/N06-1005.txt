Recognizing textual entailment is a chal-
lenging problem and a fundamental com-
ponent of many applications in natural
language processing. We present a novel
framework for recognizing textual entail-
ment that focuses on the use of syntactic
heuristics to recognize false entailment.
We give a thorough analysis of our sys-
tem, which demonstrates state-of-the-art
performance on a widely-used test set.
