Generating expository dialogue from mono-
logue is a task that poses an interesting and re-
warding challenge for Natural Language Pro-
cessing. This short paper has three aims:
firstly, to motivate the importance of this
task, both in terms of the benefits of ex-
pository dialogue as a way to present in-
formation and in terms of potential applica-
tions; secondly, to introduce a parallel cor-
pus of monologues and dialogues which en-
ables a data-driven approach to this challenge;
and, finally, to describe work-in-progress on
semi-automatic construction of Monologue-
to-Dialogue (M2D) generation rules.
