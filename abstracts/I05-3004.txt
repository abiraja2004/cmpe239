In Chinese, nouns need numeral clas-
sifiers to express quantity. In this pa-
per, we explore the relationship be-
tween classifiers and nouns. We ex-
tract a set of lexical, syntactic and onto-
logical features and the corresponding
noun-classifier pairs from a corpus and
then train SVMs to assign classifers to
nouns. We analyse which features are
most important for this task.
