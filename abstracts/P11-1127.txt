We present minimum Bayes-risk system com-
bination, a method that integrates consen-
sus decoding and system combination into
a unified multi-system minimum Bayes-risk
(MBR) technique. Unlike other MBR meth-
ods that re-rank translations of a single SMT
system, MBR system combination uses the
MBR decision rule and a linear combina-
tion of the component systems? probability
distributions to search for the minimum risk
translation among all the finite-length strings
over the output vocabulary. We introduce ex-
pected BLEU, an approximation to the BLEU
score that allows to efficiently apply MBR in
these conditions. MBR system combination is
a general method that is independent of spe-
cific SMT models, enabling us to combine
systems with heterogeneous structure. Exper-
iments show that our approach bring sig-
nificant improvements to single-system-based
MBR decoding and achieves comparable re-
sults to different state-of-the-art system com-
bination methods.
