Dialog modeling in robotics suffers from
lack of generalizability, due to the fact
that the dialog is heavily influenced by
the tasks the robot is able to perform.
We introduce interleaving interaction pat-
terns together with a general protocol for
task communication which enables us to
systematically specify the relationship be-
tween dialog structure and task structure.
We argue that this approach meets the re-
quirements of advanced dialog modeling
on robots and at the same time exhibits a
better scalability than existing concepts.
