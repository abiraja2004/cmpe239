Wikipedia articles are annotated by volunteer
contributors with numerous links that connect
words and phrases to relevant titles. Links
to general senses of a word are used concur-
rently with links to more specific senses, with-
out being distinguished explicitly. We present
an approach to training coarse to fine grained
sense disambiguation systems in the presence
of such annotation inconsistencies. Experi-
mental results show that accounting for anno-
tation ambiguity in Wikipedia links leads to
significant improvements in disambiguation.
