In this paper, we present a novel approach
which incorporates the web-derived selec-
tional preferences to improve statistical de-
pendency parsing. Conventional selectional
preference learning methods have usually fo-
cused on word-to-class relations, e.g., a verb
selects as its subject a given nominal class.
This paper extends previous work to word-
to-word selectional preferences by using web-
scale data. Experiments show that web-scale
data improves statistical dependency pars-
ing, particularly for long dependency relation-
ships. There is no data like more data, perfor-
mance improves log-linearly with the number
of parameters (unique N-grams). More impor-
tantly, when operating on new domains, we
show that using web-derived selectional pref-
erences is essential for achieving robust per-
formance.
