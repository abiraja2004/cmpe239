 
The amount of information in medical 
publications continues to increase at a 
tremendous rate. Systematic reviews help 
to process this growing body of informa-
tion. They are fundamental tools for evi-
dence-based medicine. In this paper, we 
show that automatic text classification can 
be useful in building systematic reviews 
for medical topics to speed up the review-
ing process. We propose a per-question 
classification method that uses an ensem-
ble of classifiers that exploit the particular 
protocol of a systematic review. We also 
show that when integrating the classifier 
in the human workflow of building a re-
view the per-question method is superior 
to the global method. We test several 
evaluation measures on a real dataset.
