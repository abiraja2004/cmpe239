 
An unsupervised learning method, based 
on corpus linguistics and special lan-
guage terminology, is described that can 
extract time-varying information from 
text streams.  The method is shown to be 
?language-independent? in that its use 
leads to sets of regular-expressions that 
can be used to extract the information in 
typologically distinct languages like Eng-
lish and Arabic.  The method uses the in-
formation related to the distribution of N-
grams, for automatically extracting 
?meaning bearing? patterns of usage in a 
training corpus. The analysis of an Eng-
lish news wire corpus (1,720,142 tokens) 
and Arabic news wire corpus (1,720,154 
tokens) show encouraging results.
