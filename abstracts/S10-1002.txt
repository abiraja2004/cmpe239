In this paper we describe the SemEval-
2010 Cross-Lingual Lexical Substitution
task, where given an English target word
in context, participating systems had to
find an alternative substitute word or
phrase in Spanish. The task is based on
the English Lexical Substitution task run
at SemEval-2007. In this paper we pro-
vide background and motivation for the
task, we describe the data annotation pro-
cess and the scoring system, and present
the results of the participating systems.
