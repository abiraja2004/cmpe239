 
The work1 we present here is concerned 
with the acquisition of deep grammati-
cal information for nouns in Spanish. 
The aim is to build a learner that can 
handle noise, but, more interestingly, 
that is able to overcome the problem of 
sparse data, especially important in the 
case of nouns. We have based our work 
on two main points. Firstly, we have 
used distributional evidences as fea-
tures. Secondly, we made the learner 
deal with all occurrences of a word as a 
single complex unit. The obtained re-
sults show that grammatical features of 
nouns is a level of generalization that 
can be successfully approached with a 
Decision Tree learner.
