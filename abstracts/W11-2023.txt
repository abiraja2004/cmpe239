We propose a method for modelling how dialogue
moves influence and are influenced by the agents?
preferences. We extract constraints on preferences
and dependencies among them, even when they are
expressed indirectly, by exploiting discourse struc-
ture. Our method relies on a study of 20 dia-
logues chosen at random from the Verbmobil cor-
pus. We then test the algorithms predictions against
the judgements of naive annotators on 3 random un-
seen dialogues. The average annotator-algorithm
agreement and the average inter-annotator agree-
ment show that our method is reliable.
