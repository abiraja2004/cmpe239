In this paper, we propose a new method
for semantic class induction. First, we in-
troduce a generative model of sentences,
based on dependency trees and which
takes into account homonymy. Our model
can thus be seen as a generalization of
Brown clustering. Second, we describe
an efficient algorithm to perform inference
and learning in this model. Third, we
apply our proposed method on two large
datasets (108 tokens, 105 words types),
and demonstrate that classes induced by
our algorithm improve performance over
Brown clustering on the task of semi-
supervised supersense tagging and named
entity recognition.
