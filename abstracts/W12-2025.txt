This paper describes the submission of the Na-
tional University of Singapore (NUS) to the
HOO 2012 shared task. Our system uses a
pipeline of confidence-weighted linear classi-
fiers to correct determiner and preposition er-
rors. Our system achieves the highest correc-
tion F1 score on the official test set among all
14 participating teams, based on gold-standard
edits both before and after revision.
