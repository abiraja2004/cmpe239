Automatic opinion recognition involves a
number of related tasks, such as identi-
fying the boundaries of opinion expres-
sion, determining their polarity, and de-
termining their intensity. Although much
progress has been made in this area, ex-
isting research typically treats each of the
above tasks in isolation. In this paper,
we apply a hierarchical parameter shar-
ing technique using Conditional Random
Fields for fine-grained opinion analysis,
jointly detecting the boundaries of opinion
expressions as well as determining two of
their key attributes ? polarity and inten-
sity. Our experimental results show that
our proposed approach improves the per-
formance over a baseline that does not
exploit hierarchical structure among the
classes. In addition, we find that the joint
approach outperforms a baseline that is
based on cascading two separate compo-
nents.
