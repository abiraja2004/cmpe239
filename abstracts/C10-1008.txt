This paper considers the problem of
document-level multi-way sentiment de-
tection, proposing a hierarchical classifier
algorithm that accounts for the inter-class
similarity of tagged sentiment-bearing
texts. This type of classifier also pro-
vides a natural mechanism for reducing
the feature space of the problem. Our re-
sults show that this approach improves on
state-of-the-art predictive performance for
movie reviews with three-star and four-
star ratings, while simultaneously reduc-
ing training times and memory require-
ments.
