The paper presents a novel approach to ex-
tracting dependency information in morpho-
logically rich languages using co-occurrence
statistics based not only on lexical forms
(as in previously described collocation-based
methods), but also on morphosyntactic and
wordnet-derived semantic properties of words.
Statistics generated from a corpus annotated
only at the morphosyntactic level are used
as features in a Machine Learning classifier
which is able to detect which heads of groups
found by a shallow parser are likely to be con-
nected by an edge in the complete parse tree.
The approach reaches the precision of 89%
and the recall of 65%, with an extra 6% re-
call, if only words present in the wordnet are
considered.
