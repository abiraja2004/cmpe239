This paper describes a novel framework
for interactive question-answering (Q/A)
based on predictive questioning. Gen-
erated off-line from topic representations
of complex scenarios, predictive ques-
tions represent requests for information
that capture the most salient (and diverse)
aspects of a topic. We present experimen-
tal results from large user studies (featur-
ing a fully-implemented interactive Q/A
system named FERRET) that demonstrates
that surprising performance is achieved by
integrating predictive questions into the
context of a Q/A dialogue.
