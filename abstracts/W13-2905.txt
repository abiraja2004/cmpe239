The paper discusses the main issues re-
garding the reading skills and compre-
hension proficiency in written Bulgarian
of people with communication difficulties,
and deaf people, in particular. We consider
several key components of text compre-
hension which pose a challenge for deaf
readers and propose a rule-based system
for automatic modification of Bulgarian
texts intended to facilitate comprehension
by deaf people, to assist education, etc. In
order to demonstrate the benefits of such a
system and to evaluate its performance, we
have carried out a study among a group of
deaf people who use Bulgarian Sign Lan-
guage (BulSL) as their primary language
(primary BulSL users), which compares
the comprehensibility of original texts and
their modified versions. The results shows
a considerable improvement in readability
when using modified texts, but at the same
time demonstrates that the level of com-
prehension is still low, and that a complex
set of modifications will have to be imple-
mented to attain satisfactory results.
