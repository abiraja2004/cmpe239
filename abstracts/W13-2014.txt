 
In this paper we present a biomedical event 
extraction system for the BioNLP 2013 event 
extraction task. Our system consists of two 
phases. In the learning phase, a dictionary and 
patterns are generated automatically from 
annotated events. In the extraction phase, the 
dictionary and obtained patterns are applied to 
extract events from input text. When evaluated 
on the GENIA event extraction task of the 
BioNLP 2013 shared task, the system obtained 
the best results on strict matching and the third 
best on approximate span and recursive 
matching, with F-scores of 48.92 and 50.68, 
respectively. Moreover, it has excellent 
performance in terms of speed.
