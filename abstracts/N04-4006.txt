In this paper, we contrast two language model
adaptation approaches: MAP estimation and
the perceptron algorithm. Used in isolation, we
show that MAP estimation outperforms the lat-
ter approach, for reasons which argue for com-
bining the two approaches. When combined,
the resulting system provides a 0.7 percent ab-
solute reduction in word error rate over MAP
estimation alone. In addition, we demonstrate
that, in a multi-pass recognition scenario, it is
better to use the perceptron algorithm on early
pass word lattices, since the improved error rate
improves acoustic model adaptation.
