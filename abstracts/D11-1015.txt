Polarity classification of opinionated sen-
tences with both positive and negative senti-
ments1 is a key challenge in sentiment anal-
ysis. This paper presents a novel unsuper-
vised method for discovering intra-sentence
level discourse relations for eliminating polar-
ity ambiguities. Firstly, a discourse scheme
with discourse constraints on polarity was de-
fined empirically based on Rhetorical Struc-
ture Theory (RST). Then, a small set of cue-
phrase-based patterns were utilized to collect
a large number of discourse instances which
were later converted to semantic sequential
representations (SSRs). Finally, an unsuper-
vised method was adopted to generate, weigh
and filter new SSRs without cue phrases for
recognizing discourse relations. Experimen-
tal results showed that the proposed methods
not only effectively recognized the defined
discourse relations but also achieved signifi-
cant improvement by integrating discourse in-
formation in sentence-level polarity classifica-
tion.
