We present an approach for natural lan-
guage parsing in which dependency and
constituency parses are acquired simul-
taneously. This leads to accurate parses
represented in a specific way, richer than
constituency or dependency tree. It also
allows reducing parsing time complexity.
Within the proposed approach, we show
how to treat some significant phenomena
of the Russian language and also perform
a brief evaluation of the parser implemen-
tation, known as DictaScope Syntax.
