 
Discourse markers foreshadow the message 
thrust of texts and saliently guide their 
rhetorical structure which are important for 
content filtering and text abstraction. This 
paper reports on efforts to automatically 
identify and classify discourse markers in 
Chinese texts using heuristic-based and 
corpus-based ata-mining methods, as an 
integral part of automatic text 
summarization via rhetorical structure and 
Discourse Markers. Encouraging results are 
reported.
