 
Linking heterogeneous resources is a major re-
search challenge in the Semantic Web. This 
paper studies the task of mining equivalent re-
lations from Linked Data, which was insuffi-
ciently addressed before. We introduce an un-
supervised method to measure equivalency of 
relation pairs and cluster equivalent relations. 
Early experiments have shown encouraging 
results with an average of 0.75~0.87 precision 
in predicting relation pair equivalency and 
0.78~0.98 precision in relation clustering.
