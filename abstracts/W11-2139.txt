This paper describes the German-English
translation system developed by the ARK re-
search group at Carnegie Mellon University
for the Sixth Workshop on Machine Trans-
lation (WMT11). We present the results of
several modeling and training improvements
to our core hierarchical phrase-based trans-
lation system, including: feature engineering
to improve modeling of the derivation struc-
ture of translations; better handing of OOVs;
and using development set translations into
other languages to create additional pseudo-
references for training.
