 
This article reports on a corpus annotation 
project that has produced a freely available re-
source for research on handling negation and 
uncertainty in biomedical texts (we call this 
corpus the BioScope corpus). The corpus con-
sists of three parts, namely medical free texts, 
biological full papers and biological scientific 
abstracts. The dataset contains annotations at 
the token level for negative and speculative 
keywords and at the sentence level for their 
linguistic scope. The annotation process was 
carried out by two independent linguist anno-
tators and a chief annotator ? also responsible 
for setting up the annotation guidelines ? who 
resolved cases where the annotators disagreed. 
We will report our statistics on corpus size, 
ambiguity levels and the consistency of anno-
tations.
