This paper describes a novel strategy for
automatic induction of a monolingual de-
pendency grammar under the guidance
of bilingually-projected dependency. By
moderately leveraging the dependency in-
formation projected from the parsed coun-
terpart language, and simultaneously min-
ing the underlying syntactic structure of
the language considered, it effectively in-
tegrates the advantages of bilingual pro-
jection and unsupervised induction, so as
to induce a monolingual grammar much
better than previous models only using
bilingual projection or unsupervised in-
duction. We induced dependency gram-
mar for five different languages under the
guidance of dependency information pro-
jected from the parsed English translation,
experiments show that the bilingually-
guided method achieves a significant
improvement of 28.5% over the unsuper-
vised baseline and 3.0% over the best pro-
jection baseline on average.
