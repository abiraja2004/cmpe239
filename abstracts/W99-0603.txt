of a multilingual Lexical Knowledge Base from 
pre-existing lexical resources. We present a new 
and robust approach for linking already existing 
lexical/semantic hierarchies. We used a con- 
straint satisfaction algorithm (relaxation label- 
ing) to select -among all the candidate trans- 
lations proposed by a bilingual dictionary- the 
right English WordNet synset for each sense in 
a taxonomy automatically derived from a Span- 
ish monolingua\] dictionary. Although on aver- 
age, there are 15 possible WordNet connections 
for each sense in the taxonomy, the method 
achieves an accuracy over 80~. Finally, we also 
propose several ways in which this technique 
could be applied to enrich and improve exist- 
ing lexical databases.
