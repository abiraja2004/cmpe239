 
This paper presents a machine learning 
approach based on an SVM classifier 
coupled with preprocessing rules for cross-
document named entity normalization.  The 
classifier uses lexical, orthographic, 
phonetic, and morphological features.  The 
process involves disambiguating different 
entities with shared name mentions and 
normalizing identical entities with different 
name mentions.  In evaluating the quality of 
the clusters, the reported approach achieves 
a cluster F-measure of 0.93.  The approach 
is significantly better than the two baseline 
approaches in which none of the entities are 
normalized or entities with exact name 
mentions are normalized.  The two baseline 
approaches achieve cluster F-measures of 
0.62 and 0.74 respectively.  The classifier 
properly normalizes the vast majority of 
entities that are misnormalized by the 
baseline system.
