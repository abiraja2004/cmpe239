A strong inductive bias is essential in un-
supervised grammar induction. We ex-
plore a particular sparsity bias in de-
pendency grammars that encourages a
small number of unique dependency
types. Specifically, we investigate
sparsity-inducing penalties on the poste-
rior distributions of parent-child POS tag
pairs in the posterior regularization (PR)
framework of Gra?a et al (2007). In ex-
periments with 12 languages, we achieve
substantial gains over the standard expec-
tation maximization (EM) baseline, with
average improvement in attachment ac-
curacy of 6.3%. Further, our method
outperforms models based on a standard
Bayesian sparsity-inducing prior by an av-
erage of 4.9%. On English in particular,
we show that our approach improves on
several other state-of-the-art techniques.
