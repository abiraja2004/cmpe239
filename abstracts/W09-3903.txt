In this paper, we describe the development
of a meeting assistant agent that helps
remote meeting participants by notifying
them when they are being addressed. We
present experiments that have been con-
ducted to develop machine classifiers to
decide whether ?you are being addressed?
where ?you? refers to a fixed (remote) par-
ticipant in a meeting. The experimental re-
sults back up the choices made regarding
the selection of data, features, and classifi-
cation methods. We discuss variations of
the addressee classification problem that
have been considered in the literature and
how suitable they are for addressee detec-
tion in a system that plays a role in a live
meeting.
