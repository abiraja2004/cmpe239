Existing works on sentiment analysis on
product reviews suffer from the following
limitations: (1) The knowledge of hierar-
chical relationships of products attributes
is not fully utilized. (2) Reviews or sen-
tences mentioning several attributes asso-
ciated with complicated sentiments are not
dealt with very well. In this paper, we pro-
pose a novel HL-SOT approach to label-
ing a product?s attributes and their asso-
ciated sentiments in product reviews by a
Hierarchical Learning (HL) process with a
defined Sentiment Ontology Tree (SOT).
The empirical analysis against a human-
labeled data set demonstrates promising
and reasonable performance of the pro-
posed HL-SOT approach. While this pa-
per is mainly on sentiment analysis on re-
views of one product, our proposed HL-
SOT approach is easily generalized to la-
beling a mix of reviews of more than one
products.
