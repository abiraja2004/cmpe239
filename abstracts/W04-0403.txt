The paper describes an experiment in
detecting a specific type of multiword
expressions in Russian, namely expres-
sions starting with a preposition. This
covers not only prepositional phrases
proper, but also fixed syntactic construc-
tions like v techenie (?in the course of?).
First, we collect lists of such construc-
tions in a corpus of 50 mln words using
a simple mechanism that combines sta-
tistical methods with knowledge about
the structure of Russian prepositional
phrases. Then we analyse the results of
this data collection and estimate the ef-
ficiency of the collected list for the reso-
lution of morphosyntactic and semantic
ambiguity in a corpus.
