In this paper we present our syntactic and
semantic dependency parsing system par-
ticipated in both closed and open compe-
titions of the CoNLL 2008 Shared Task.
By combining the outcome of two state-of-
the-art syntactic dependency parsers, we
achieved high accuracy in syntactic de-
pendencies (87.32%). With MRSes from
grammar-based HPSG parsers, we achieved
significant performance improvement on
semantic role labeling (from 71.31% to
71.89%), especially in the out-domain
evaluation (from 60.16% to 62.11%).
