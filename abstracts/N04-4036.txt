In this paper, we use a machine learning frame-
work for semantic argument parsing, and apply
it to the task of parsing arguments of eventive
nominalizations in the FrameNet database. We
create a baseline system using a subset of fea-
tures introduced by Gildea and Jurafsky (2002),
which are directly applicable to nominal pred-
icates. We then investigate new features which
are designed to capture the novelties in nom-
inal argument structure and show a significant
performance improvement using these new fea-
tures. We also investigate the parsing perfor-
mance of nominalizations in Chinese and com-
pare the salience of the features for the two lan-
guages.
