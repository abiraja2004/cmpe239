This paper describes a CoNLL-style
chunk representation for the Tu?bingen
Treebank of Written German, which as-
sumes a flat chunk structure so that each
word belongs to at most one chunk. For
German, such a chunk definition causes
problems in cases of complex prenominal
modification. We introduce a flat annota-
tion that can handle these structures via a
stranded noun chunk.
