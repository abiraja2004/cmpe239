Simply detecting negation cues is not suffi-
cient to determine the semantics of negation,
scope and focus must be taken into account.
While scope detection has recently seen re-
peated attention, the linguistic notion of focus
is only now being introduced into computa-
tional work. The *Sem2012 Shared Task is
pioneering this effort by introducing a suitable
dataset and annotation guidelines. CLaC?s
NegFocus system is a solid baseline approach
to the task.
