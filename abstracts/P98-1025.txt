 
In relatively free word order languages, grammat- 
ical functions are intricately related to case mark- 
ing. Assuming an ordered representation of the 
predicate-argument structure, this work proposes a
Combinatory Categorial Grammar formulation of 
relating surface case cues to categories and types 
for correctly placing the arguments in the predicate- 
argument structure. This is achieved by treat- 
ing case markers as type shifters. Unlike other 
CG formulations, type shifting does not prolifer- 
ate or cause spurious ambiguity. Categories of 
all argument-encoding grammatical functions fol- 
low from the same principle of category assignment. 
Normal order evaluation of the combinatory form 
reveals the predicate-argument structure. The appli- 
cation of the method to Turkish is shown.
