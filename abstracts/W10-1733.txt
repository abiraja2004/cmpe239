In this paper we focus on the incremental
decoding for a statistical phrase-based ma-
chine translation system. In incremental
decoding, translations are generated incre-
mentally for every word typed by a user,
instead of waiting for the entire sentence
as input. We introduce a novel modifi-
cation to the beam-search decoding algo-
rithm for phrase-based MT to address this
issue, aimed at efficient computation of fu-
ture costs and avoiding search errors. Our
objective is to do a faster translation dur-
ing incremental decoding without signifi-
cant reduction in the translation quality.
