enhancement of English to Arabic statistical 
machine translation quality. Machine Transla-
tion has been defined as the process that utiliz-
es computer software to translate text from one 
natural language to another. Arabic, as a mor-
phologically rich language, is a highly flex-
ional language, in that the same root can lead 
to various forms according to its context. Sta-
tistical machine translation (SMT) engines of-
ten show poor syntax processing especially 
when the language used is morphologically 
rich such as Arabic. In this paper, to overcome 
these shortcomings, we describe our hybrid 
approach which integrates knowledge of the 
Arabic language into statistical machine trans-
lation. In this framework, we propose the use 
of a featured language model SFLM (Sma?li et 
al., 2004) to be able to integrate syntactic and 
grammatical knowledge about each word. In 
this paper, we first discuss some challenges in 
translating from English to Arabic and we ex-
plore various techniques to improve perfor-
mance on this task. We apply a morphological 
segmentation step for Arabic words and we 
present our hybrid approach by identifying 
morpho-syntactic class of each segmented 
word to build up our statistical feature lan-
guage model. We propose the scheme for re-
combining the segmented Arabic word, and 
describe their effect on translation.
