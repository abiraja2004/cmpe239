The LUNA corpus is a multi-lingual, multi-
domain spoken dialogue corpus currently
under development that will be used to de-
velop a robust natural spoken language un-
derstanding toolkit for multilingual dialogue
services. The LUNA corpus will be an-
notated at multiple levels to include an-
notations of syntactic, semantic, and dis-
course information; specialized annotation
tools will be used for the annotation at each
of these levels. In order to synchronize these
multiple layers of annotation, the PAULA
standoff exchange format will be used. In
this paper, we present the corpus and its
PAULA-based architecture.1
