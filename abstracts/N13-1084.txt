Atypical semantic and pragmatic expression is
frequently reported in the language of children
with autism. Although this atypicality often
manifests itself in the use of unusual or un-
expected words and phrases, the rate of use
of such unexpected words is rarely directly
measured or quantified. In this paper, we
use distributional semantic models to automat-
ically identify unexpected words in narrative
retellings by children with autism. The classi-
fication of unexpected words is sufficiently ac-
curate to distinguish the retellings of children
with autism from those with typical develop-
ment. These techniques demonstrate the po-
tential of applying automated language anal-
ysis techniques to clinically elicited language
data for diagnostic purposes.
