This paper describes a new automatic approach for
extracting conceptual distinctions from dictionary
definitions. A broad-coverage dependency parser is
first used to extract the lexical relations from the def-
initions. Then the relations are disambiguated using
associations learned from tagged corpora. This con-
trasts with earlier approaches using manually devel-
oped rules for disambiguation.
