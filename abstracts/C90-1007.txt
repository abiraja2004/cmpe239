 
THALES is a software package for plane 
geometry constructions, supplied with a natural 
language interlace. Using THALES requires no 
knowledge of a programming language. The 
interface is capable of processing practically all 
kinds of instructions within the subset of plane 
geometry English. The "static semantic" module 
has been generated on the basis of a high-level 
attribute specification. Transportability, modifia- 
bility and generality -- the key issues of natural 
language interface design -- are investigated in the 
project note. The notion of specifiability is intro- 
duced to replace the three features mentioned 
above.
