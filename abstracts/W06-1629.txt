For transliterating foreign words into Chi-
nese, the pronunciation of a source word
is spelled out with Kanji characters. Be-
cause Kanji comprises ideograms, an indi-
vidual pronunciation may be represented
by more than one character. However,
because different Kanji characters convey
different meanings and impressions, char-
acters must be selected carefully. In this
paper, we propose a transliteration method
that models both pronunciation and im-
pression, whereas existing methods do not
model impression. Given a source word
and impression keywords related to the
source word, our method derives possible
transliteration candidates and sorts them
according to their probability. We evalu-
ate our method experimentally.
