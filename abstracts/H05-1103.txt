 
In the REAP system, users are automati-
cally provided with texts to read targeted to 
their individual reading levels. To find ap-
propriate texts, the user?s vocabulary 
knowledge must be assessed. We describe 
an approach to automatically generating 
questions for vocabulary assessment. Tra-
ditionally, these assessments have been 
hand-written. Using data from WordNet, 
we generate 6 types of vocabulary ques-
tions. They can have several forms, includ-
ing wordbank and multiple-choice. We 
present experimental results that suggest 
that these automatically-generated ques-
tions give a measure of vocabulary skill 
that correlates well with subject perform-
ance on independently developed human-
written questions. In addition, strong corre-
lations with standardized vocabulary tests 
point to the validity of our approach to 
automatic assessment of word knowledge.
