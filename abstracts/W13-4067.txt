This paper presents a generic dialogue
state tracker that maintains beliefs over
user goals based on a few simple domain-
independent rules, using basic probability
operations. The rules apply to observed
system actions and partially observable
user acts, without using any knowledge
obtained from external resources (i.e.
without requiring training data). The core
insight is to maximise the amount of in-
formation directly gainable from an error-
prone dialogue itself, so as to better lower-
bound one?s expectations on the perfor-
mance of more advanced statistical tech-
niques for the task. The proposed method
is evaluated in the Dialog State Track-
ing Challenge, where it achieves compara-
ble performance in hypothesis accuracy to
machine learning based systems. Conse-
quently, with respect to different scenarios
for the belief tracking problem, the poten-
tial superiority and weakness of machine
learning approaches in general are investi-
gated.
