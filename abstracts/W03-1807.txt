 
Automatic extraction of multiword 
expressions (MWE) presents a tough 
challenge for the NLP community 
and corpus linguistics. Although 
various statistically driven or knowl-
edge-based approaches have been 
proposed and tested, efficient MWE 
extraction still remains an unsolved 
issue. In this paper, we present our 
research work in which we tested 
approaching the MWE issue using a 
semantic field annotator. We use an 
English semantic tagger (USAS) de-
veloped at Lancaster University to 
identify multiword units which de-
pict single semantic concepts. The 
Meter Corpus (Gaizauskas et al, 
2001; Clough et al, 2002) built in 
Sheffield was used to evaluate our 
approach. In our evaluation, this ap-
proach extracted a total of 4,195 
MWE candidates, of which, after 
manual checking, 3,792 were ac-
cepted as valid MWEs, producing a 
precision of 90.39% and an esti-
mated recall of 39.38%. Of the ac-
cepted MWEs, 68.22% or 2,587 are 
low frequency terms, occurring only 
once or twice in the corpus. These 
results show that our approach pro-
vides a practical solution to MWE 
extraction.
