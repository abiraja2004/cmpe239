The task of selecting and ordering infor-
mation appears in multiple contexts in text
generation and summarization. For in-
stance, methods for title generation con-
struct a headline by selecting and order-
ing words from the input text. In this pa-
per, we investigate decoding methods that
simultaneously optimize selection and or-
dering preferences. We formalize decod-
ing as a task of finding an acyclic path
in a directed weighted graph. Since the
problem is NP-hard, finding an exact so-
lution is challenging. We describe a novel
decoding method based on a randomized
color-coding algorithm. We prove bounds
on the number of color-coding iterations
necessary to guarantee any desired likeli-
hood of finding the correct solution. Our
experiments show that the randomized de-
coder is an appealing alternative to a range
of decoding algorithms for selection-and-
ordering problems, including beam search
and Integer Linear Programming.
