In many applications, replacing a complex
word form by its stem can reduce sparsity, re-
vealing connections in the data that would not
otherwise be apparent. In this paper, we focus
on prefix verbs: verbs formed by adding a pre-
fix to an existing verb stem. A prefix verb is
considered compositional if it can be decom-
posed into a semantically equivalent expres-
sion involving its stem. We develop a clas-
sifier to predict compositionality via a range
of lexical and distributional features, includ-
ing novel features derived from web-scale N-
gram data. Results on a new annotated cor-
pus show that prefix verb compositionality can
be predicted with high accuracy. Our system
also performs well when trained and tested on
conventional morphological segmentations of
prefix verbs.
