 
This paper demonstrates a conceptually simple 
but effective method of increasing the accuracy 
of QA systems on factoid-style questions.  We 
define the notion of an inverted question, and 
show that by requiring that the answers to the 
original and inverted questions be mutually con-
sistent, incorrect answers get demoted in confi-
dence and correct ones promoted.  Additionally, 
we show that lack of validation can be used to 
assert no-answer (nil) conditions.  We demon-
strate increases of performance on TREC and 
other question-sets, and discuss the kinds of fu-
ture activities that can be particularly beneficial 
to approaches such as ours.
