This paper focuses on the change of named
entities over time and its influence on the
performance of the named entity tagger.
First, we analyze Japanese named enti-
ties which appear in Mainichi Newspaper
articles published in 1995, 1996, 1997,
1998 and 2005. This analysis reveals that
the number of named entity types and
the number of named entity tokens are
almost steady over time and that 70 ?
80% of named entity types in a certain
year occur in the articles published either
in its succeeding year or in its preceding
year. These facts lead that 20 ? 30%
of named entity types are replaced with
new ones every year. The experiment
against these texts shows that our propos-
ing semi-supervised method which com-
bines a small annotated corpus and a large
unannotated corpus for training works ro-
bustly although the traditional supervised
method is fragile against the change of
name entity distribution.
