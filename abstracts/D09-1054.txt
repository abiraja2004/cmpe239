This paper addresses the issue of extract-
ing contexts and answers of questions
from post discussion of online forums.
We propose a novel and unified model by
customizing the structural Support Vector
Machine method. Our customization has
several attractive properties: (1) it gives a
comprehensive graphical representation of
thread discussion. (2) It designs special
inference algorithms instead of general-
purpose ones. (3) It can be readily ex-
tended to different task preferences by
varying loss functions. Experimental re-
sults on a real data set show that our meth-
ods are both promising and flexible.
