 
In this paper, we present a user study where a 
robot instructs a human on how to draw a 
route on a map, similar to a Map Task. This 
setup has allowed us to study user reactions to 
the robot?s conversational behaviour in order 
to get a better understanding of how to gener-
ate utterances in incremental dialogue systems. 
We have analysed the participants' subjective 
rating, task completion, verbal responses, gaze 
behaviour, drawing activity, and cognitive 
load. The results show that users utilise the ro-
bot?s gaze in order to disambiguate referring 
expressions and manage the flow of the inter-
action. Furthermore, we show that the user?s 
behaviour is affected by how pauses are real-
ised in the robot?s speech.
