Recent studies focussed on the question
whether less-configurational languages like
German are harder to parse than English,
or whether the lower parsing scores are an
artefact of treebank encoding schemes and
data structures, as claimed by Ku?bler et al
(2006). This claim is based on the as-
sumption that PARSEVAL metrics fully re-
flect parse quality across treebank encoding
schemes. In this paper we present new ex-
periments to test this claim. We use the
PARSEVAL metric, the Leaf-Ancestor met-
ric as well as a dependency-based evalua-
tion, and present novel approaches measur-
ing the effect of controlled error insertion
on treebank trees and parser output. We
also provide extensive past-parsing cross-
treebank conversion. The results of the ex-
periments show that, contrary to Ku?bler et
al. (2006), the question whether or not Ger-
man is harder to parse than English remains
undecided.
