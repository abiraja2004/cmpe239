 
In this paper the development of an opi-
nion summarization system that works on 
Bengali News corpus has been described. 
The system identifies the sentiment in-
formation in each document, aggregates 
them and represents the summary infor-
mation in text. The present sys-tem fol-
lows a topic-sentiment model for senti-
ment identification and aggregation. Top-
ic-sentiment model is designed as dis-
course level theme identification and the 
topic-sentiment aggregation is achieved 
by theme clustering (k-means) and Doc-
ument level Theme Relational Graph re-
presentation. The Document Level 
Theme Relational Graph is finally used 
for candidate summary sentence selection 
by standard page rank algorithms used in 
Information Retrieval (IR). As Bengali is 
a resource constrained language, the 
building of annotated gold standard cor-
pus and acquisition of linguistics tools 
for lexico-syntactic, syntactic and dis-
course level features extraction are de-
scribed in this paper. The reported accu-
racy of the Theme detection technique is 
83.60% (precision), 76.44% (recall) and 
79.85% (F-measure). The summarization 
system has been evaluated with Precision 
of 72.15%, Recall of 67.32% and F-
measure of 69.65%.
