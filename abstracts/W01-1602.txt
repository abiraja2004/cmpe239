We describe an approach (\vari-
ant transduction") aimed at reduc-
ing the eort and skill involved
in building spoken language inter-
faces. Applications are created
by specifying a relatively small set
of example utterance-action pairs
grouped into contexts. No interme-
diate semantic representations are
involved in the specication, and
the conrmation requests used in
the dialog are constructed automat-
ically. These properties of vari-
ant transduction arise from combin-
ing techniques for paraphrase gen-
eration, classication, and example-
matching. We describe how a spo-
ken dialog system is constructed
with this approach and also provide
some experimental results on vary-
ing the number of examples used to
build a particular application.
