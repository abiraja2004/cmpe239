Parsing is one of the important
processes for natural language process-
ing and, in general, a large-scale CFG
is used to parse a wide variety of
sentences. For many languages, a
CFG is derived from a large-scale
syntactically annotated corpus, and
many parsing algorithms using CFGs
have been proposed. However, we
could not apply them to Japanese since
a Japanese syntactically annotated
corpus has not been available as of yet.
In order to solve the problem, we have
been building a large-scale Japanese
syntactically annotated corpus. In this
paper, we show the evaluation results
of a CFG derived from our corpus
and compare it with results of some
Japanese dependency analyzers.
