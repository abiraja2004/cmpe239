The work presented in this paper is the first
step in a project which aims to cluster and sum-
marise electronic discussions in the context of
help-desk applications. The eventual objective
of this project is to use these summaries to as-
sist help-desk users and operators. In this pa-
per, we identify features of electronic discus-
sions that influence the clustering process, and
offer a filtering mechanism that removes unde-
sirable influences. We tested the clustering and
filtering processes on electronic newsgroup dis-
cussions, and evaluated their performance by
means of two experiments: coarse-level cluster-
ing and simple information retrieval. Our eval-
uation shows that our filtering mechanism has a
significant positive effect on both tasks.
