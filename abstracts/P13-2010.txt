Distributional models of semantics cap-
ture word meaning very effectively, and
they have been recently extended to ac-
count for compositionally-obtained rep-
resentations of phrases made of content
words. We explore whether compositional
distributional semantic models can also
handle a construction in which grammat-
ical terms play a crucial role, namely de-
terminer phrases (DPs). We introduce a
new publicly available dataset to test dis-
tributional representations of DPs, and we
evaluate state-of-the-art models on this set.
