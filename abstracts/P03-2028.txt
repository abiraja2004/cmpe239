We have been investigating an interactive
approach for Open-domain QA (ODQA)
and have constructed a spoken interactive
ODQA system, SPIQA. The system de-
rives disambiguating queries (DQs) that
draw out additional information. To test
the efficiency of additional information re-
quested by the DQs, the system recon-
structs the user?s initial question by com-
bining the addition information with ques-
tion. The combination is then used for an-
swer extraction. Experimental results re-
vealed the potential of the generated DQs.
