In recent years there has been substantial work
on the important problem of coreference res-
olution, most of which has concentrated on
the development of new models and algo-
rithmic techniques. These works often show
that complex models improve over a weak
pairwise baseline. However, less attention
has been given to the importance of selecting
strong features to support learning a corefer-
ence model.
This paper describes a rather simple pair-
wise classification model for coreference res-
olution, developed with a well-designed set
of features. We show that this produces a
state-of-the-art system that outperforms sys-
tems built with complex models. We suggest
that our system can be used as a baseline for
the development of more complex models ?
which may have less impact when a more ro-
bust set of features is used. The paper also
presents an ablation study and discusses the
relative contributions of various features.
