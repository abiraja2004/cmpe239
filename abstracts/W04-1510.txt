This paper introduces the new grammar formalism
of Extensible Dependency Grammar (XDG), and
emphasizes the benefits of its methodology of ex-
plaining complex phenomena by interaction of sim-
ple principles on multiple dimensions of linguis-
tic description. This has the potential to increase
modularity with respect to linguistic description and
grammar engineering, and to facilitate concurrent
processing and the treatment of ambiguity.
