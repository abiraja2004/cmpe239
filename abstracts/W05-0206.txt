Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis
(PLSA) is an information retrieval tech-
nique proposed to improve the problems
found in Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA).
We have applied both LSA and PLSA in
our system for grading essays written in
Finnish, called Automatic Essay Assessor
(AEA). We report the results comparing
PLSA and LSA with three essay sets from
various subjects. The methods were found
to be almost equal in the accuracy mea-
sured by Spearman correlation between
the grades given by the system and a hu-
man. Furthermore, we propose methods
for improving the usage of PLSA in essay
grading.
