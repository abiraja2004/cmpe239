To support the real-time understanding of
spoken monologue such as lectures and
commentaries, the development of a cap-
tioning system is required. In monologues,
since a sentence tends to be long, each
sentence is often displayed in multi lines
on one screen, it is necessary to insert
linefeeds into a text so that the text be-
comes easy to read. This paper proposes
a technique for inserting linefeeds into a
Japanese spoken monologue text as an el-
emental technique to generate the read-
able captions. Our method appropriately
inserts linefeeds into a sentence by ma-
chine learning, based on the information
such as dependencies, clause boundaries,
pauses and line length. An experiment us-
ing Japanese speech data has shown the ef-
fectiveness of our technique.
