In this paper we describe a method of classifying facts (information) into categories or levels; where
each level signies a dierent degree of syntactic complexity related to a fact. Based on this classication
mechanism, we also propose a method of evaluating a domain by assigning to it a \domain number"
based on the levels of a set of standard facts present in the articles of that domain.
