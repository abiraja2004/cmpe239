We present a new reordering model es-
timated as a standard n-gram language
model with units built from morpho-
syntactic information of the source and
target languages. It can be seen as a
model that translates the morpho-syntactic
structure of the input sentence, in contrast
to standard translation models which take
care of the surface word forms. We take
advantage from the fact that such units
are less sparse than standard translation
units to increase the size of bilingual con-
text that is considered during the trans-
lation process, thus effectively account-
ing for mid-range reorderings. Empirical
results on French-English and German-
English translation tasks show that our
model achieves higher translation accu-
racy levels than those obtained with the
widely used lexicalized reordering model.
