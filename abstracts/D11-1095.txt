Most previous research on verb clustering has
focussed on acquiring flat classifications from
corpus data, although many manually built
classifications are taxonomic in nature. Also
Natural Language Processing (NLP) applica-
tions benefit from taxonomic classifications
because they vary in terms of the granularity
they require from a classification. We intro-
duce a new clustering method called Hierar-
chical Graph Factorization Clustering (HGFC)
and extend it so that it is optimal for the task.
Our results show that HGFC outperforms the
frequently used agglomerative clustering on a
hierarchical test set extracted from VerbNet,
and that it yields state-of-the-art performance
also on a flat test set. We demonstrate how the
method can be used to acquire novel classifi-
cations as well as to extend existing ones on
the basis of some prior knowledge about the
classification.
