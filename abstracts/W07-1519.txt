In this paper, we present a treebank anno-
tation tool developed for processing Turk-
ish sentences. The tool consists of three
different annotation stages; morphological
analysis, morphological disambiguation and
syntax analysis. Each of these stages are
integrated with existing analyzers in order
to guide human annotators. Our semi-
automatic treebank annotation tool is cur-
rently used both for creating new data sets
and correcting the existing Turkish treebank.
