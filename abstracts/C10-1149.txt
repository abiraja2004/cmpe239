This paper proposes a method that lever-
ages multiple machine translation (MT)
engines for paraphrase generation (PG).
The method includes two stages. Firstly,
we use a multi-pivot approach to acquire
a set of candidate paraphrases for a source
sentence S. Then, we employ two kinds
of techniques, namely the selection-based
technique and the decoding-based tech-
nique, to produce a best paraphrase T for
S using the candidates acquired in the first
stage. Experimental results show that:
(1) The multi-pivot approach is effective
for obtaining plenty of valuable candi-
date paraphrases. (2) Both the selection-
based and decoding-based techniques can
make good use of the candidates and pro-
duce high-quality paraphrases. Moreover,
these two techniques are complementary.
(3) The proposed method outperforms a
state-of-the-art paraphrase generation ap-
proach.
