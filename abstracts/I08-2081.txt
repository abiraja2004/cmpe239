 
Query and document representation is a 
key problem for information retrieval and 
filtering. The vector space model (VSM) 
has been widely used in this domain. But 
the VSM suffers from high dimensionality. 
The vectors built from documents always 
have high dimensionality and contain too 
much noise. In this paper, we present a 
novel method that reduces the dimensional-
ity using multilingual resource. We intro-
duce a new metric called TC to measure the 
term consistency constraints. We deduce a 
TC matrix from the multilingual corpus and 
then use this matrix together with the term-
by-document matrix to do the Latent Se-
mantic Indexing (LSI). By adopting differ-
ent TC threshold, we can truncate the TC 
matrix into small size and thus lower the 
computational cost of LSI. The experimen-
tal results show that this dimensionality re-
duction method improves the retrieval per-
formance significantly.
