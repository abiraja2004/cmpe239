 
This study aims to improve the 
performance of identifying 
grammatical functions between an 
adnoun clause and a noun phrase in 
Korean.  The key task is to determine 
the relation between the two 
constituents in terms of such 
functional categories as subject, object, 
adverbial, and appositive. The 
problem is mainly caused by the fact 
that functional morphemes, which are 
considered to be crucial for identifying 
the relation, are frequently omitted in 
the noun phrases. To tackle this 
problem, we propose to employ the 
Support Vector Machines(SVM) in 
determining the grammatical functions. 
Through an experiment with a tagged 
corpus for training SVMs, the 
proposed model is found to be useful.
