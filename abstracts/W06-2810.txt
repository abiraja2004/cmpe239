We investigate whether the Wikipedia cor-
pus is amenable to multilingual analysis
that aims at generating parallel corpora.
We present the results of the application of
two simple heuristics for the identification
of similar text across multiple languages
in Wikipedia. Despite the simplicity of the
methods, evaluation carried out on a sam-
ple of Wikipedia pages shows encouraging
results.
