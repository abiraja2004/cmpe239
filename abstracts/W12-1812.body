Belief tracking is a promising technique for
adding robustness to spoken dialog systems,
but current research is fractured across differ-
ent teams, techniques, and domains. This pa-
per amplifies past informal discussions (Raux,
2011) to call for a belief tracking challenge
task, based on the Spoken dialog challenge
corpus (Black et al., 2011). Benefits, limita-
tions, evaluation design issues, and next steps
are presented.
