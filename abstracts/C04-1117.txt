We deal with the automated acquisition of a
Spanish medical subword lexicon from an al-
ready existing Portuguese seed lexicon. Using
two non-parallel monolingual corpora we de-
termined Spanish lexeme candidates from Por-
tuguese seed lexicon entries by heuristic cog-
nate mapping. We validated the emergent lex-
ical translation hypotheses by determining the
similarity of fixed-window context vectors on
the basis of Portuguese and Spanish text cor-
pora.
