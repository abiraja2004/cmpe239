semi-automatic method to detect 
segmentation errors in a manually 
annotated Chinese corpus in order 
to improve its quality further. A 
particular Chinese character string 
occurring more than once in a 
corpus may be assigned different 
segmentations during a 
segmentation process. Based on 
these differences our approach 
outputs the segmentation error 
candidates found in a segmented 
corpus and then on which the 
segmentation errors are identified 
manually. Segmentation error rate 
of a gold standard corpus can be 
given using our method. In Peking 
University (PK) and Academic 
Sinica (AS) test corpora of Special 
Interest Group for Chinese 
Language Processing (SIGHAN) 
Bakeoff1, 1.29% and 2.26% 
segmentation error rates are 
detected by our method. These 
errors decrease the F-measure of 
SIGHAN Bakeoff1 baseline test by 
1.36% in PK test data and 1.93% in 
AS test data respectively.

Microsoft Research Asia.
