Non-sentential utterances (e.g., short-
answers as in ?Who came to the party???
?Peter.?) are pervasive in dialogue. As
with other forms of ellipsis, the elided ma-
terial is typically present in the context
(e.g., the question that a short answer an-
swers). We present a machine learning
approach to the novel task of identifying
fragments and their antecedents in multi-
party dialogue. We compare the perfor-
mance of several learning algorithms, us-
ing a mixture of structural and lexical fea-
tures, and show that the task of identifying
antecedents given a fragment can be learnt
successfully (f(0.5) = .76); we discuss
why the task of identifying fragments is
harder (f(0.5) = .41) and finally report
on a combined task (f(0.5) = .38).
