 
A high-level language lor the description of inflectional 
morphology is presented, in which the organization of 
word lormation rules into an ii~herilance hierarchy of 
paradigms allows lo ra  natural encoding of the kinds of 
nfles typically pre~uted in grammar txroks. We show 
how tim language, composed of orthographic rides, word 
formation rules, and paradigm inheritance, can be com- 
piled into a run-time data structure for efficient morpho- 
logical analysis and generation with a dynamic secondary 
storage lexicon.
