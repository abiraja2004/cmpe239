 
The RAGS project aims to define a reference ar- 
chitecture for Natural Language Generation (NLG) 
systems. Currently the major part of this archi- 
tecture consists of a set of datatype definitions for 
specifying the input and output formats for mod- 
ules within NLG systems. In this paper we describe 
our efforts to reinterpret an existing NLG system in 
terms of these definitions. The system chosen was 
the Caption Generation System.
