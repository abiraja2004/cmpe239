In this study we apply hierarchical spectral
partitioning of bipartite graphs to a Dutch
dialect dataset to cluster dialect varieties
and determine the concomitant sound cor-
respondences. An important advantage of
this clustering method over other dialec-
tometric methods is that the linguistic ba-
sis is simultaneously determined, bridging
the gap between traditional and quantita-
tive dialectology. Besides showing that
the results of the hierarchical clustering
improve over the flat spectral clustering
method used in an earlier study (Wieling
and Nerbonne, 2009), the values of the
second singular vector used to generate the
two-way clustering can be used to identify
the most important sound correspondences
for each cluster. This is an important ad-
vantage of the hierarchical method as it
obviates the need for external methods to
determine the most important sound corre-
spondences for a geographical cluster.
