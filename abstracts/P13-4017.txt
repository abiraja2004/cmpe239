This paper presents PLIS, an open source
Probabilistic Lexical Inference System
which combines two functionalities: (i)
a tool for integrating lexical inference
knowledge from diverse resources, and (ii)
a framework for scoring textual inferences
based on the integrated knowledge. We
provide PLIS with two probabilistic im-
plementation of this framework. PLIS is
available for download and developers of
text processing applications can use it as
an off-the-shelf component for injecting
lexical knowledge into their applications.
PLIS is easily configurable, components
can be extended or replaced with user gen-
erated ones to enable system customiza-
tion and further research. PLIS includes
an online interactive viewer, which is a
powerful tool for investigating lexical in-
ference processes.
