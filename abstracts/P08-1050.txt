In this work, we develop and evaluate a wide
range of feature spaces for deriving Levin-
style verb classifications (Levin, 1993). We
perform the classification experiments using
Bayesian Multinomial Regression (an effi-
cient log-linear modeling framework which
we found to outperform SVMs for this task)
with the proposed feature spaces. Our exper-
iments suggest that subcategorization frames
are not the most effective features for auto-
matic verb classification. A mixture of syntac-
tic information and lexical information works
best for this task.
