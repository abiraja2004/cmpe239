 
Extraction of relations between entities is 
an important part of Information Extraction 
on free text. Previous methods are mostly 
based on statistical correlation and depend-
ency relations between entities. This paper 
re-examines the problem at the multi-
resolution layers of phrase, clause and sen-
tence using dependency and discourse rela-
tions. Our multi-resolution framework 
ARE (Anchor and Relation) uses clausal 
relations in 2 ways: 1) to filter noisy de-
pendency paths; and 2) to increase reliabil-
ity of dependency path extraction. The re-
sulting system outperforms the previous 
approaches by 3%, 7%, 4% on MUC4, 
MUC6 and ACE RDC domains respec-
tively.
