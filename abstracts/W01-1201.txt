In this paper we analyze two question
answering tasks : the TREC-8 ques-
tion answering task and a set of reading
comprehension exams. First, we show
that Q/A systems perform better when
there are multiple answer opportunities
per question. Next, we analyze com-
mon approaches to two subproblems:
term overlap for answer sentence iden-
tification, and answer typing for short
answer extraction. We present general
tools for analyzing the strengths and
limitations of techniques for these sub-
problems. Our results quantify the limi-
tations of both term overlap and answer
typing to distinguish between compet-
ing answer candidates.
