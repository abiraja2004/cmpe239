The SAMMIE1 system is an in-car multi-
modal dialogue system for an MP3 ap-
plication. It is used as a testing environ-
ment for our research in natural, intuitive
mixed-initiative interaction, with particu-
lar emphasis on multimodal output plan-
ning and realization aimed to produce out-
put adapted to the context, including the
driver?s attention state w.r.t. the primary
driving task.
