We show that a practical translation of MRS de-
scriptions into normal dominance constraints is fea-
sible. We start from a recent theoretical translation
and verify its assumptions on the outputs of the En-
glish Resource Grammar (ERG) on the Redwoods
corpus. The main assumption of the translation?
that all relevant underspecified descriptions are
nets?is validated for a large majority of cases; all
non-nets computed by the ERG seem to be system-
atically incomplete.
