We realize a telephone-based collab-
orative natural language dialogue sys-
tem. Since natural language involves
very various expressions, a large num-
ber of VoiceXML scripts need to be pre-
pared to handle all possible input patterns.
We realize flexible dialogue management
for various user utterances by generating
VoiceXML scripts dynamically. More-
over, we address appropriate user mod-
eling in order to generate cooperative re-
sponses to each user. Specifically, we set
up three dimensions of user models: skill
level to the system, knowledge level on
the target domain and the degree of hasti-
ness. The models are automatically de-
rived by decision tree learning using real
dialogue data collected by the system. Ex-
perimental evaluation shows that the co-
operative responses adapted to individual
users serve as good guidance for novice
users without increasing the dialogue du-
ration for skilled users.
