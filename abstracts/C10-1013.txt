Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) of-
ten relies on a context model or vector
constructed from the words that co-occur
with the target word within the same text
windows. In most cases, a fixed-sized
window is used, which is determined by
trial and error. In addition, words within
the same window are weighted uniformly
regardless to their distance to the target
word. Intuitively, it seems more reason-
able to assign a stronger weight to con-
text words closer to the target word. How-
ever, it is difficult to manually define the
optimal weighting function based on dis-
tance. In this paper, we propose a unsu-
pervised method for determining the op-
timal weights for context words accord-
ing to their distance. The general idea is
that the optimal weights should maximize
the similarity of two context models of the
target word generated from two random
samples. This principle is applied to both
English and Japanese. The context mod-
els using the resulting weights are used
in WSD tasks on Semeval data. Our ex-
perimental results showed that substantial
improvements in WSD accuracy can be
obtained using the automatically defined
weighting schema.
