This paper presents the second round of the
task on Cross-lingual Textual Entailment for
Content Synchronization, organized within
SemEval-2013. The task was designed to pro-
mote research on semantic inference over texts
written in different languages, targeting at the
same time a real application scenario. Par-
ticipants were presented with datasets for dif-
ferent language pairs, where multi-directional
entailment relations (?forward?, ?backward?,
?bidirectional?, ?no entailment?) had to be
identified. We report on the training and test
data used for evaluation, the process of their
creation, the participating systems (six teams,
61 runs), the approaches adopted and the re-
sults achieved.
