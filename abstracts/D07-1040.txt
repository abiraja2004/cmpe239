Most of the text summarization research car-
ried out to date has been concerned with
the summarization of short documents (e.g.,
news stories, technical reports), and very lit-
tle work if any has been done on the sum-
marization of very long documents. In this
paper, we try to address this gap and ex-
plore the problem of book summarization.
We introduce a new data set specifically de-
signed for the evaluation of systems for book
summarization, and describe summarization
techniques that explicitly account for the
length of the documents.
