Open issue trackers are a type of social me-
dia that has received relatively little atten-
tion from the text-mining community. We
investigate the problems inherent in learn-
ing to triage bug reports from time-varying
data. We demonstrate that concept drift is
an important consideration. We show the
effectiveness of online learning algorithms
by evaluating them on several bug report
datasets collected from open issue trackers
associated with large open-source projects.
We make this collection of data publicly
available.
