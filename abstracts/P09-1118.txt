The use of phrases in retrieval models has
been proven to be helpful in the literature,
but no particular research addresses the
problem of discriminating phrases that are
likely to degrade the retrieval performance
from the ones that do not. In this paper, we
present a retrieval framework that utilizes
both words and phrases flexibly, followed
by a general learning-to-rank method for
learning the potential contribution of a
phrase in retrieval. We also present use-
ful features that reflect the compositional-
ity and discriminative power of a phrase
and its constituent words for optimizing
the weights of phrase use in phrase-based
retrieval models. Experimental results on
the TREC collections show that our pro-
posed method is effective.
