 
This paper describes a novel approach pre-
sented to the BioNLP?11 Shared Task on 
GENIA event extraction. The approach con-
sists of three steps. First, a dictionary is auto-
matically constructed based on training 
datasets which is then used to detect candidate 
triggers and determine their event types. Sec-
ond, we apply a set of heuristic algorithms 
which use syntactic patterns and candidate 
triggers detected in the first step to extract 
biological events. Finally, a post-processing is 
used to resolve regulatory events. We 
achieved an F-score of 43.94% using the 
online evaluation system.
