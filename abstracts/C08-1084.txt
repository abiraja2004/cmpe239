This paper presents a novel approach to
the task of semantic role labelling for event
nominalisations, which make up a consider-
able fraction of predicates in running text,
but are underrepresented in terms of train-
ing data and difficult to model. We propose
to address this situation by data expansion.
We construct a model for nominal role la-
belling solely from verbal training data. The
best quality results from salvaging gram-
matical features where applicable, and gen-
eralising over lexical heads otherwise.
