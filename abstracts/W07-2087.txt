SenseClusters is a freely?available open?
source system that served as the Univer-
sity of Minnesota, Duluth entry in the
SENSEVAL-4 sense induction task. For this
task SenseClusters was configured to con-
struct representations of the instances to be
clustered using the centroid of word co-
occurrence vectors that replace the words
in an instance. These instances are then
clustered using k?means where the number
of clusters is discovered automatically using
the Adapted Gap Statistic. In these experi-
ments SenseClusters did not use any infor-
mation outside of the raw untagged text that
was to be clustered, and no tuning of the sys-
tem was performed using external corpora.
