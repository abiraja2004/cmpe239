 
Automatic extraction of opinion holders 
and targets (together referred to as opinion 
entities) is an important subtask of senti-
ment analysis. In this work, we attempt to 
accurately extract opinion entities from 
Urdu newswire. Due to the lack of re-
sources required for training role labelers 
and dependency parsers (as in English) for 
Urdu, a more robust approach based on (i) 
generating candidate word sequences 
corresponding to opinion entities, and (ii) 
subsequently disambiguating these se-
quences as opinion holders or targets is 
presented. Detecting the boundaries of such 
candidate sequences in Urdu is very differ-
ent than in English since in Urdu, 
grammatical categories such as tense, 
gender and case are captured in word 
inflections. In this work, we exploit the 
morphological inflections associated with 
nouns and verbs to correctly identify 
sequence boundaries. Different levels of 
information that capture context are 
encoded to train standard linear and se-
quence kernels. To this end the best per-
formance obtained for opinion entity 
detection for Urdu sentiment analysis is 
58.06% F-Score using sequence kernels 
and 61.55% F-Score using a combination 
of sequence and linear kernels.
