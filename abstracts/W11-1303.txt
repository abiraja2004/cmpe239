Since its introduction into the NLP community,
pointwise mutual information has proven to be
a useful association measure in numerous nat-
ural language processing applications such as
collocation extraction and word space models.
In its original form, it is restricted to the anal-
ysis of two-way co-occurrences. NLP prob-
lems, however, need not be restricted to two-
way co-occurrences; often, a particular prob-
lem can be more naturally tackled when for-
mulated as a multi-way problem. In this pa-
per, we explore two multivariate generaliza-
tions of pointwise mutual information, and ex-
plore their usefulness and nature in the extrac-
tion of subject verb object triples.
