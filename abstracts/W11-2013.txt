 
We report on an empirical study of a multiparty 
turn-taking model for physically situated spo-
ken dialog systems. We present subjective and 
objective performance measures that show how 
the model, supported with a basic set of sensory 
competencies and turn-taking policies, can en-
able interactions with multiple participants in a 
collaborative task setting. The analysis brings 
to the fore several phenomena and frames chal-
lenges for managing multiparty turn taking in 
physically situated interaction.
