The REFLEX-LCTL (Research on En-
glish and Foreign Language Exploitation-
Less Commonly Taught Languages) pro-
gram, sponsored by the United States
government, was an effort in simultane-
ous creation of basic language resources
and technologies for under-resourced lan-
guages, with the aim to enrich sparse ar-
eas in language technology resources and
encourage new research. We were tasked
to produce basic language resources for 8
Asian languages: Bengali, Pashto, Pun-
jabi, Tamil, Tagalog, Thai, Urdu and
Uzbek, and 5 languages from Europe and
Africa, and distribute them to research and
development also funded by the program.
This paper will discuss the streamlined ap-
proach to language resource development
we designed to support simultaneous cre-
ation of multiple resources for multiple lan-
guages.
