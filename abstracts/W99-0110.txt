 
The ways in which the form of referring 
expressions interacts with the structure of 
language are reviewed. Evidence from a 
number of different methods - quantitatively 
analyzed judgements of acceptable 
coreference, reading time, and corpus 
frequency of different types of coreferenfial 
expressions - converges on a fairly simple 
description of patterns of coreference.- A 
model is presented which integrates 
important aspects of Discourse 
Representation Theory and of Centering 
Theory in order to provide an account of 
how referential expressions are interpreted 
as part of constructing a discourse universe 
from a series of utterances.
