This paper presents the results of the
WMT13 Metrics Shared Task. We asked
participants of this task to score the
outputs of the MT systems involved in
WMT13 Shared Translation Task. We
collected scores of 16 metrics from 8 re-
search groups. In addition to that we com-
puted scores of 5 standard metrics such as
BLEU, WER, PER as baselines. Collected
scores were evaluated in terms of system
level correlation (how well each metric?s
scores correlate with WMT13 official hu-
man scores) and in terms of segment level
correlation (how often a metric agrees with
humans in comparing two translations of a
particular sentence).
