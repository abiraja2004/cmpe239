Named-entity recognition (NER) is an impor-
tant task required in a wide variety of ap-
plications. While rule-based systems are ap-
pealing due to their well-known ?explainabil-
ity,? most, if not all, state-of-the-art results
for NER tasks are based on machine learning
techniques. Motivated by these results, we ex-
plore the following natural question in this pa-
per: Are rule-based systems still a viable ap-
proach to named-entity recognition? Specif-
ically, we have designed and implemented
a high-level language NERL on top of Sys-
temT, a general-purpose algebraic informa-
tion extraction system. NERL is tuned to the
needs of NER tasks and simplifies the pro-
cess of building, understanding, and customiz-
ing complex rule-based named-entity annota-
tors. We show that these customized annota-
tors match or outperform the best published
results achieved with machine learning tech-
niques. These results confirm that we can
reap the benefits of rule-based extractors? ex-
plainability without sacrificing accuracy. We
conclude by discussing lessons learned while
building and customizing complex rule-based
annotators and outlining several research di-
rections towards facilitating rule development.
