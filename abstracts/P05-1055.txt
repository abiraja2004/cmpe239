The paper presents the Position Specific
Posterior Lattice, a novel representation
of automatic speech recognition lattices
that naturally lends itself to efficient in-
dexing of position information and subse-
quent relevance ranking of spoken docu-
ments using proximity.
In experiments performed on a collec-
tion of lecture recordings ? MIT iCam-
pus data ? the spoken document rank-
ing accuracy was improved by 20% rela-
tive over the commonly used baseline of
indexing the 1-best output from an auto-
matic speech recognizer. The Mean Aver-
age Precision (MAP) increased from 0.53
when using 1-best output to 0.62 when us-
ing the new lattice representation. The ref-
erence used for evaluation is the output of
a standard retrieval engine working on the
manual transcription of the speech collec-
tion.
Albeit lossy, the PSPL lattice is also much
more compact than the ASR 3-gram lat-
tice from which it is computed ? which
translates in reduced inverted index size
as well ? at virtually no degradation in
word-error-rate performance. Since new
paths are introduced in the lattice, the OR-
ACLE accuracy increases over the origi-
nal ASR lattice.
