This paper presents HITS? coreference reso-
lution system that participated in the CoNLL-
2012 shared task on multilingual unrestricted
coreference resolution. Our system employs a
simple multigraph representation of the rela-
tion between mentions in a document, where
the nodes correspond to mentions and the
edges correspond to relations between the
mentions. Entities are obtained via greedy
clustering. We participated in the closed tasks
for English and Chinese. Our system ranked
second in the English closed task.
