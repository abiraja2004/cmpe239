Identifying hedged information in biomedical
literature is an important subtask in informa-
tion extraction because it would be mislead-
ing to extract speculative information as fac-
tual information. In this paper we present a
machine learning system that finds the scope
of hedge cues in biomedical texts. The sys-
tem is based on a similar system that finds the
scope of negation cues. We show that the same
scope finding approach can be applied to both
negation and hedging. To investigate the ro-
bustness of the approach, the system is tested
on the three subcorpora of the BioScope cor-
pus that represent different text types.
