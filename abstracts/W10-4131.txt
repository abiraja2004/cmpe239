 
This paper describes our participation 
in the Chinese word segmentation task 
of CIPS-SIGHAN 2010. We imple-
mented an n-gram mutual information 
(NGMI) based segmentation algorithm 
with the mixed-up features from unsu-
pervised, supervised and dictionary-
based segmentation methods. This al-
gorithm is also combined with a simple 
strategy for out-of-vocabulary (OOV) 
word recognition. The evaluation for 
both open and closed training shows 
encouraging results of our system. The 
results for OOV word recognition in 
closed training evaluation were how-
ever found unsatisfactory.
