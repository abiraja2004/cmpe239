This work presents translation results for
the three data sets made available in the
shared task ?Exploiting Parallel Texts for
Statistical Machine Translation? of the
HLT-NAACL 2006 Workshop on Statisti-
cal Machine Translation. All results pre-
sented were generated by using the N-
gram-based statistical machine translation
system which has been enhanced from the
last year?s evaluation with a tagged target
language model (using Part-Of-Speech
tags). For both Spanish-English transla-
tion directions and the English-to-French
translation task, the baseline system al-
lows for linguistically motivated source-
side reorderings.
