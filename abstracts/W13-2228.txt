This paper describes QCRI-MES?s sub-
mission on the English-Russian dataset to
the Eighth Workshop on Statistical Ma-
chine Translation. We generate improved
word alignment of the training data by
incorporating an unsupervised translitera-
tion mining module to GIZA++ and build
a phrase-based machine translation sys-
tem. For tuning, we use a variation of PRO
which provides better weights by optimiz-
ing BLEU+1 at corpus-level. We translit-
erate out-of-vocabulary words in a post-
processing step by using a transliteration
system built on the transliteration pairs
extracted using an unsupervised translit-
eration mining system. For the Russian
to English translation direction, we apply
linguistically motivated pre-processing on
the Russian side of the data.
