We describe a statistical approach for modeling
agreements and disagreements in conversational in-
teraction. Our approach first identifies adjacency
pairs using maximum entropy ranking based on a
set of lexical, durational, and structural features that
look both forward and backward in the discourse.
We then classify utterances as agreement or dis-
agreement using these adjacency pairs and features
that represent various pragmatic influences of pre-
vious agreement or disagreement on the current ut-
terance. Our approach achieves 86.9% accuracy, a
4.9% increase over previous work.
