UPV-PRHLT participated in the System
Combination task of the Fifth Workshop
on Statistical Machine Translation (WMT
2010). On each translation direction, all
the submitted systems were combined into
a consensus translation. These consen-
sus translations always improve transla-
tion quality of the best individual system.
