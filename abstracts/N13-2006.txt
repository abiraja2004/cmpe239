Our research investigates the translation of on-
tology labels, which has applications in mul-
tilingual knowledge access. Ontologies are
often defined only in one language, mostly
English. To enable knowledge access across
languages, such monolingual ontologies need
to be translated into other languages. The
primary challenge in ontology label trans-
lation is the lack of context, which makes
this task rather different than document trans-
lation. The core objective therefore, is to
provide statistical machine translation (SMT)
systems with additional context information.
In our approach, we first extend standard SMT
by enhancing a translation model with context
information that keeps track of surrounding
words for each translation. We compute a se-
mantic similarity between the phrase pair con-
text vector from the parallel corpus and a vec-
tor of noun phrases that occur in surrounding
ontology labels. We applied our approach to
the translation of a financial ontology, translat-
ing from English to German, using Europarl as
parallel corpus. This experiment showed that
our approach can provide a slight improve-
ment over standard SMT for this task, with-
out exploiting any additional domain-specific
resources.
