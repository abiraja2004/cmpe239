 
We present a Chinese word segmentation 
system which ran on the closed track of the 
simplified Chinese Word Segmentation task 
of CIPS-SIGHAN-CLP 2010 bakeoffs. Our 
segmenter was built using a HMM. To fulfill 
the cross-domain segmentation task, we use 
semi-supervised machine learning method to 
get the HMM model. Finally we get the 
mean result of four domains: P=0.719, 
R=0.72
