This paper introduces PersPred, the first
manually elaborated syntactic and seman-
tic database for Persian Complex Predicates
(CPs). Beside their theoretical interest, Per-
sian CPs constitute an important challenge in
Persian lexicography and for NLP. The first
delivery, PersPred 11, contains 700 CPs, for
which 22 fields of lexical, syntactic and se-
mantic information are encoded. The seman-
tic classification PersPred provides allows to
account for the productivity of these combi-
nations in a way which does justice to their
compositionality without overlooking their id-
iomaticity.
