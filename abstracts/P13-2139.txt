Identifying news stories that discuss the
same real-world events is important for
news tracking and retrieval. Most exist-
ing approaches rely on the traditional vec-
tor space model. We propose an approach
for recognizing identical real-world events
based on a structured, event-oriented doc-
ument representation. We structure docu-
ments as graphs of event mentions and use
graph kernels to measure the similarity be-
tween document pairs. Our experiments
indicate that the proposed graph-based ap-
proach can outperform the traditional vec-
tor space model, and is especially suitable
for distinguishing between topically simi-
lar, yet non-identical events.
