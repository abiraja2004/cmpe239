We address the problem of identifying mul-
tiword expressions in a language, focus-
ing on English phrasal verbs. Our poly-
glot ranking approach integrates frequency
statistics from translated corpora in 50 dif-
ferent languages. Our experimental eval-
uation demonstrates that combining statisti-
cal evidence from many parallel corpora us-
ing a novel ranking-oriented boosting algo-
rithm produces a comprehensive set of English
phrasal verbs, achieving performance compa-
rable to a human-curated set.
