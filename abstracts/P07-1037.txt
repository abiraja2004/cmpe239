Until quite recently, extending Phrase-based
Statistical Machine Translation (PBSMT)
with syntactic structure caused system per-
formance to deteriorate. In this work we
show that incorporating lexical syntactic de-
scriptions in the form of supertags can yield
significantly better PBSMT systems. We de-
scribe a novel PBSMT model that integrates
supertags into the target language model
and the target side of the translation model.
Two kinds of supertags are employed: those
from Lexicalized Tree-Adjoining Grammar
and Combinatory Categorial Grammar. De-
spite the differences between these two ap-
proaches, the supertaggers give similar im-
provements. In addition to supertagging, we
also explore the utility of a surface global
grammaticality measure based on combina-
tory operators. We perform various experi-
ments on the Arabic to English NIST 2005
test set addressing issues such as sparseness,
scalability and the utility of system subcom-
ponents. Our best result (0.4688 BLEU)
improves by 6.1% relative to a state-of-the-
art PBSMT model, which compares very
favourably with the leading systems on the
NIST 2005 task.
