 
Being expensive and time consuming, human 
knowledge acquisition has consistently been a 
major bottleneck for solving real problems. In 
this paper, we present a practical framework 
for acquiring high quality non-expert knowl-
edge from on-demand workforce using Ama-
zon Mechanical Turk (MTurk). We show how 
to apply this framework to collect large-scale 
human knowledge on AOL query classifica-
tion in a fast and efficient fashion. Based on 
extensive experiments and analysis, we dem-
onstrate how to detect low-quality labels from 
massive data sets and their impact on collect-
ing high-quality knowledge. Our experimental 
findings also provide insight into the best 
practices on balancing cost and data quality for 
using MTurk.
