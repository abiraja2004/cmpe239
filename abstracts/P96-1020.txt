 
This paper proposes the use of "pattern- 
based" context-free grammars as a basis 
for building machine translation (MT) sys- 
tems, which are now being adopted as per- 
sonal tools by a broad range of users in 
the cyberspace society. We discuss ma- 
jor requirements for such tools, including 
easy customization for diverse domains, 
the efficiency of the translation algorithm, 
and scalability (incremental improvement 
in translation quality through user interac- 
tion), and describe how our approach meets 
these requirements.
