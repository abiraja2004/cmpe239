Entity detection and tracking (EDT) is
the task of identifying textual mentions
of real-world entities in documents, ex-
tending the named entity detection and
coreference resolution task by consider-
ing mentions other than names (pronouns,
definite descriptions, etc.). Like NE tag-
ging and coreference resolution, most so-
lutions to the EDT task separate out the
mention detection aspect from the corefer-
ence aspect. By doing so, these solutions
are limited to using only local features for
learning. In contrast, by modeling both
aspects of the EDT task simultaneously,
we are able to learn using highly com-
plex, non-local features. We develop a
new joint EDT model and explore the util-
ity of many features, demonstrating their
effectiveness on this task.
