A growing body of work has highlighted the
challenges of identifying the stance a speaker
holds towards a particular topic, a task that in-
volves identifying a holistic subjective dispo-
sition. We examine stance classification on
a corpus of 4873 posts across 14 topics on
ConvinceMe.net, ranging from the playful to
the ideological. We show that ideological de-
bates feature a greater share of rebuttal posts,
and that rebuttal posts are significantly harder
to classify for stance, for both humans and
trained classifiers. We also demonstrate that
the number of subjective expressions varies
across debates, a fact correlated with the per-
formance of systems sensitive to sentiment-
bearing terms. We present results for iden-
tifing rebuttals with 63% accuracy, and for
identifying stance on a per topic basis that
range from 54% to 69%, as compared to un-
igram baselines that vary between 49% and
60%. Our results suggest that methods that
take into account the dialogic context of such
posts might be fruitful.
