Treebank annotation is a labor-intensive
and time-consuming task. In this paper,
we show that a simple statistical ranking
model can significantly improve treebank-
ing efficiency by prompting human an-
notators, well-trained in disambiguation
tasks for treebanking but not necessarily
grammar experts, to the most relevant lin-
guistic disambiguation decisions. Experi-
ments were carried out to evaluate the im-
pact of such techniques on annotation ef-
ficiency and quality. The detailed analysis
of outputs from the ranking model shows
strong correlation to the human annotator
behavior. When integrated into the tree-
banking environment, the model brings a
significant annotation speed-up with im-
proved inter-annotator agreement.?
