 
Although Minimum Distance Parsing 
(MDP) offers a theoretically attractive so- 
lution to the problem of extragrammat- 
icality, it is often computationally infea- 
sible in large scale practical applications. 
In this paper we present an alternative ap- 
proach where the labor is distributed be- 
tween a more restrictive partial parser and 
a repair module. Though two stage ap- 
proaches have grown in popularity in re- 
cent years because of their efficiency, they 
have done so at the cost of requiring hand 
coded repair heuristics (Ehrlich and Han- 
rieder, 1996; Danieli and Gerbino, 1995). 
In contrast, our two stage approach does 
not require any hand coded knowledge 
sources dedicated to repair, thus making 
it possible to achieve a similar run time 
advantage over MDP without losing the 
quality of domain independence.
