Information graphics that appear in newspa-
pers and magazines generally have a message that
the viewer is intended to recognize. This paper ar-
gues that understanding such information graph-
ics is a discourse-level problem. In particular,
it requires assimilating information from multi-
ple knowledge sources to recognize the intended
message of the graphic, just as recognizing in-
tention in text does. Moreover, when an article
is composed of text and graphics, the intended
message of the information graphic (its discourse
intention) must be integrated into the discourse
structure of the surrounding text and contributes
to the overall discourse intention of the article.
This paper describes how we extend plan-based
techniques that have been used for understanding
traditional discourse to the understanding of in-
formation graphics. This work is part of a project
to develop an interactive natural language system
that provides sight-impaired users with access to
information graphics.
