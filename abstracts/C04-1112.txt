In this paper, we present a corpus-based super-
vised word sense disambiguation (WSD) sys-
tem for Dutch which combines statistical classi-
fication (maximum entropy) with linguistic in-
formation. Instead of building individual clas-
sifiers per ambiguous wordform, we introduce
a lemma-based approach. The advantage of
this novel method is that it clusters all inflec-
ted forms of an ambiguous word in one classi-
fier, therefore augmenting the training material
available to the algorithm. Testing the lemma-
based model on the Dutch SENSEVAL-2 test
data, we achieve a significant increase in accur-
acy over the wordform model. Also, the WSD
system based on lemmas is smaller and more
robust.
