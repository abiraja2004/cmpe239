Abstract
Most previous studies on meeting summariza-
tion have focused on extractive summariza-
tion. In this paper, we investigate if we can
apply sentence compression to extractive sum-
maries to generate abstractive summaries. We
use different compression algorithms, includ-
ing integer linear programming with an addi-
tional step of filler phrase detection, a noisy-
channel approach using Markovization for-
mulation of grammar rules, as well as hu-
man compressed sentences. Our experiments
on the ICSI meeting corpus show that when
compared to the abstractive summaries, using
sentence compression on the extractive sum-
maries improves their ROUGE scores; how-
ever, the best performance is still quite low,
suggesting the need of language generation for
abstractive summarization.
