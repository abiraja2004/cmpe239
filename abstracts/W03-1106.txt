We present a simple approach for Asian
language text classification without word
segmentation, based on statistical  -gram
language modeling. In particular, we ex-
amine Chinese and Japanese text classi-
fication. With character  -gram models,
our approach avoids word segmentation.
However, unlike traditional ad hoc  -gram
models, the statistical language model-
ing based approach has strong informa-
tion theoretic basis and avoids explicit fea-
ture selection procedure which potentially
loses significantly amount of useful infor-
mation. We systematically study the key
factors in language modeling and their in-
fluence on classification. Experiments on
Chinese TREC and Japanese NTCIR topic
detection show that the simple approach
can achieve better performance compared
to traditional approaches while avoiding
word segmentation, which demonstrates
its superiority in Asian language text clas-
sification.
