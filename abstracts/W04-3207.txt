We describe how simple, commonly understood statisti-
cal models, such as statistical dependency parsers, proba-
bilistic context-free grammars, and word-to-word trans-
lation models, can be effectively combined into a uni-
fied bilingual parser that jointly searches for the best En-
glish parse, Korean parse, and word alignment, where
these hidden structures all constrain each other. The
model used for parsing is completely factored into the
two parsers and the TM, allowing separate parameter es-
timation. We evaluate our bilingual parser on the Penn
Korean Treebank and against several baseline systems
and show improvements parsing Korean with very lim-
ited labeled data.
