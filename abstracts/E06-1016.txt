The degree of dominance of a sense of a
word is the proportion of occurrences of
that sense in text. We propose four new
methods to accurately determine word
sense dominance using raw text and a pub-
lished thesaurus. Unlike the McCarthy
et al (2004) system, these methods can
be used on relatively small target texts,
without the need for a similarly-sense-
distributed auxiliary text. We perform an
extensive evaluation using artificially gen-
erated thesaurus-sense-tagged data. In the
process, we create a word?category co-
occurrence matrix, which can be used for
unsupervised word sense disambiguation
and estimating distributional similarity of
word senses, as well.
