This paper presents a machine learning
approach to acronym generation. We for-
malize the generation process as a se-
quence labeling problem on the letters in
the definition (expanded form) so that a
variety of Markov modeling approaches
can be applied to this task. To con-
struct the data for training and testing, we
extracted acronym-definition pairs from
MEDLINE abstracts and manually anno-
tated each pair with positional informa-
tion about the letters in the acronym. We
have built an MEMM-based tagger using
this training data set and evaluated the
performance of acronym generation. Ex-
perimental results show that our machine
learning method gives significantly bet-
ter performance than that achieved by the
standard heuristic rule for acronym gen-
eration and enables us to obtain multi-
ple candidate acronyms together with their
likelihoods represented in probability val-
ues.
