This paper describes an algorithm for open text shal-
low semantic parsing. The algorithm relies on a
frame dataset (FrameNet) and a semantic network
(WordNet), to identify semantic relations between
words in open text, as well as shallow semantic fea-
tures associated with concepts in the text. Parsing
semantic structures allows semantic units and con-
stituents to be accessed and processed in a more
meaningful way than syntactic parsing, moving the
automation of understanding natural language text
to a higher level.
