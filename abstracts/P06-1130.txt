We present a novel PCFG-based archi-
tecture for robust probabilistic generation
based on wide-coverage LFG approxima-
tions (Cahill et al, 2004) automatically
extracted from treebanks, maximising the
probability of a tree given an f-structure.
We evaluate our approach using string-
based evaluation. We currently achieve
coverage of 95.26%, a BLEU score of
0.7227 and string accuracy of 0.7476 on
the Penn-II WSJ Section 23 sentences of
length ?20.
