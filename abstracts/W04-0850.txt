Two systems from the University of Minnesota,
Duluth participated in various SENSEVAL-3 lexi-
cal sample tasks. The supervised learning system
is based on lexical features and bagged decision
trees. It participated in lexical sample tasks for
the English, Spanish, Catalan, Basque, Romanian
and MultiLingual English-Hindi data. The unsuper-
vised system uses measures of semantic relatedness
to find the sense of the target word that is most re-
lated to the senses of its neighbors. It participated
in the English lexical sample task.
