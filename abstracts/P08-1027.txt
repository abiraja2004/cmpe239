There are many possible different semantic re-
lationships between nominals. Classification
of such relationships is an important and dif-
ficult task (for example, the well known noun
compound classification task is a special case
of this problem). We propose a novel pat-
tern clusters method for nominal relationship
(NR) classification. Pattern clusters are dis-
covered in a large corpus independently of
any particular training set, in an unsupervised
manner. Each of the extracted clusters cor-
responds to some unspecified semantic rela-
tionship. The pattern clusters are then used
to construct features for training and classifi-
cation of specific inter-nominal relationships.
Our NR classification evaluation strictly fol-
lows the ACL SemEval-07 Task 4 datasets and
protocol, obtaining an f-score of 70.6, as op-
posed to 64.8 of the best previous work that
did not use the manually provided WordNet
sense disambiguation tags.
