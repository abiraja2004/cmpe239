 
The paper deals with the issue of how and to what extent 
WordNet-like resources provide the necessary information 
for an assessment of semantic similarity which is useful for 
practical applications. The general point is made that 
taxonomical information should be complemented with 
distributional evidence. The claim is substantiated through 
experimental ~t8 and an illustration of a word sense 
disambiguation system (SENSE) capable of using 
contextually-relevant semantic similarity.
