This paper proposes a method to analyze
Japanese anaphora, in which zero pronouns
(omitted obligatory cases) are used to refer to
preceding entities (antecedents). Unlike the
case of general coreference resolution, zero pro-
nouns have to be detected prior to resolution
because they are not expressed in discourse.
Our method integrates two probability param-
eters to perform zero pronoun detection and
resolution in a single framework. The first pa-
rameter quantifies the degree to which a given
case is a zero pronoun. The second parame-
ter quantifies the degree to which a given entity
is the antecedent for a detected zero pronoun.
To compute these parameters efficiently, we use
corpora with/without annotations of anaphoric
relations. We show the effectiveness of our
method by way of experiments.
