 
The paper adresses the problem of reasoning with 
ambiguities. Semantic representations are presented 
that leave scope relations between quantifiers and/or 
other operators unspecified. Truth conditions are 
provided for these representations and different con- 
sequence relations are judged on the basis of intuitive 
correctness. Finally inference patterns are presented 
that operate directly on these underspecified struc- 
tures, i.e. do not rely on any translation into the set 
of their disambiguations.
