The quality of automatic translation is af-
fected by many factors. One is the diver-
gence between the specific source and tar-
get languages. Another lies in the source
text itself, as some texts are more com-
plex than others. One way to handle such
texts is to modify them prior to transla-
tion. Yet, an important factor that is of-
ten overlooked is the source translatabil-
ity with respect to the specific translation
system and the specific model that are be-
ing used. In this paper we present an in-
teractive system where source modifica-
tions are induced by confidence estimates
that are derived from the translation model
in use. Modifications are automatically
generated and proposed for the user?s ap-
proval. Such a system can reduce post-
editing effort, replacing it by cost-effective
pre-editing that can be done by monolin-
guals.
