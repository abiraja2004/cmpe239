This paper presents a study of the impact
of using simple and complex morphological
clues to improve the classification of rare and
unknown words for parsing. We compare
this approach to a language-independent tech-
nique often used in parsers which is based
solely on word frequencies. This study is ap-
plied to three languages that exhibit different
levels of morphological expressiveness: Ara-
bic, French and English. We integrate infor-
mation about Arabic affixes and morphotac-
tics into a PCFG-LA parser and obtain state-
of-the-art accuracy. We also show that these
morphological clues can be learnt automati-
cally from an annotated corpus.
