  
The problem of word segmentation affects 
all aspects of Chinese language processing, 
including the development of text-to-speech 
synthesis systems. In synthesizing a Hong 
Kong Cantonese text, for example, words 
must be identified in order to model fusion 
of coda [p] with initial [h], and other similar 
effects that differentiate word-internal 
syllable boundaries from syllable edges that 
begin or end words. Accurate segmentation 
is necessary also for developing any list of 
words large enough to identify the word-
internal cross-syllable sequences that must 
be recorded to model such effects using 
concatenated synthesis units. This paper 
describes our use of the Segmentation 
Corpus to constrain such units.
