In this paper, we focus on the challenge
of automatically converting a constituency
treebank (source treebank) to fit the stan-
dard of another constituency treebank (tar-
get treebank). We formalize the conver-
sion problem as an informed decoding
procedure: information from original an-
notations in a source treebank is incorpo-
rated into the decoding phase of a parser
trained on a target treebank during the
parser assigning parse trees to sentences in
the source treebank. Experiments on two
Chinese treebanks show significant im-
provements in conversion accuracy over
baseline systems, especially when training
data used for building the parser is small
in size.
