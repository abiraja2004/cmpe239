During conversations, addressees produce
conversational acts?verbal and nonverbal
backchannels?that facilitate turn-taking,
acknowledge speakership, and communicate
common ground without disrupting the
speaker?s speech. These acts play a key role
in achieving fluent conversations. Therefore,
gaining a deeper understanding of how these
acts interact with speaker behaviors in shap-
ing conversations might offer key insights
into the design of technologies such as
computer-mediated communication systems
and embodied conversational agents. In this
paper, we explore how a regression-based
approach might offer such insights into mod-
eling predictive relationships between speaker
behaviors and addressee backchannels in
a storytelling scenario. Our results reveal
speaker eye contact as a significant predictor
of verbal, nonverbal, and bimodal backchan-
nels and utterance boundaries as predictors of
nonverbal and bimodal backchannels.
