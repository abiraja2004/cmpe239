This paper describes the system has been
developed for the HOO 2012 Shared Task.
The task was to correct determiner and
preposition errors. I explore the possibil-
ity of learning error correcting rules from
the given manually annotated data using
features such as word length and word
endings only. Furthermore, I employ er-
ror correction ranking based on the ratio
of the sentence probabilities using original
and corrected language models. Our sys-
tem has been ranked for the ninth posi-
tion out of thirteen teams. The best result
was achieved in correcting missing prepo-
sitions, which was ranked for the sixth po-
sition.
