In this paper we propose a completely un-
supervised method for open-domain en-
tity extraction and clustering over query
logs. The underlying hypothesis is that
classes defined by mining search user activ-
ity may significantly differ from those typ-
ically considered over web documents, in
that they better model the user space, i.e.
users? perception and interests. We show
that our method outperforms state of the art
(semi-)supervised systems based either on
web documents or on query logs (16% gain
on the clustering task). We also report evi-
dence that our method successfully supports
a real world application, namely keyword
generation for sponsored search.
