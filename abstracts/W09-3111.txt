 
This paper addresses the notion of parallel, 
noisy parallel and comparable corpora in the 
sign language research field. As it is quite a 
new field, the categorization of sign language 
corpora is not well established, and does not 
rely on a straightforward basis. Nevertheless, 
several kinds of corpora are now available 
and could raise interesting issues, provided 
that adapted tools and techniques are devel-
oped.
