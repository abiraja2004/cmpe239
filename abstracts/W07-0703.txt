We provide an in-depth analysis of the in-
tegration of an Arabic-to-English translit-
eration system into a general-purpose 
phrase-based statistical machine translation 
system. We study the integration from dif-
ferent aspects and evaluate the improve-
ment that can be attributed to the integra-
tion using the BLEU metric. Our experi-
ments show that a transliteration module 
can help significantly in the situation where 
the test data is rich with previously unseen 
named entities. We obtain 70% and 53% of 
the theoretical maximum improvement we 
could achieve, as measured by an oracle on 
development and test sets respectively for 
OOV words (out of vocabulary source 
words not appearing in the phrase table).
