Most dialogue systems are built with a sin-
gle task in mind. This makes the exten-
sion of an existing system one of the ma-
jor problems in the field as large parts of
the system have to be modified. Some re-
cent work has shown that ontologies have
a role on the domain knowledge represen-
tation as the knowledge collected in an on-
tology can be used in all the modules. This
work aims to follow the footsteps of the
use of ontologies in dialogue systems and
take it further as the current state of the art
only uses taxonomical knowledge.
