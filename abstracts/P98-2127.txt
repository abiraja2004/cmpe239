 
Bootstrapping semantics from text is one of the 
greatest challenges in natural language learning. 
We first define a word similarity measure based on 
the distributional pattern of words. The similarity 
measure allows us to construct a thesaurus using a 
parsed corpus. We then present a new evaluation 
methodology for the automatically constructed the- 
saurus. The evaluation results show that the the- 
saurns is significantly closer to WordNet han Roget 
Thesaurus is.
