We present an algorithmic framework for
learning multiple related tasks. Our frame-
work exploits a form of prior knowledge that
relates the output spaces of these tasks. We
present PAC learning results that analyze the
conditions under which such learning is pos-
sible. We present results on learning a shal-
low parser and named-entity recognition sys-
tem that exploits our framework, showing con-
sistent improvements over baseline methods.
