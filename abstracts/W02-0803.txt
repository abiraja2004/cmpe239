philosophical questions related to the 
treatment of abstract and underspecified 
prepositions. We consider three issues in 
particular: (i) the relation between sense 
and meanings, (ii) the privileged status of 
abstract meanings in the spectrum of 
contextual instantiations of basic senses, 
and finally (iii) the difference between 
prediction and inference. The discussion 
will be based on the study of avec (with) 
and the analysis of its abstract meaning of 
comitativity in particular. A model for 
avec semantic variability will also be 
suggested.
