This paper describes the two systems for
determining the semantic similarity of short
texts submitted to the SemEval 2012 Task 6.
Most of the research on semantic similarity
of textual content focuses on large documents.
However, a fair amount of information is con-
densed into short text snippets such as social
media posts, image captions, and scientific ab-
stracts. We predict the human ratings of sen-
tence similarity using a support vector regres-
sion model with multiple features measuring
word-overlap similarity and syntax similarity.
Out of 89 systems submitted, our two systems
ranked in the top 5, for the three overall eval-
uation metrics used (overall Pearson ? 2nd
and 3rd, normalized Pearson ? 1st and 3rd,
weighted mean ? 2nd and 5th).
