 
In this paper we are concerned with 
identifying the topics of sentences in Chinese 
texts. The key elements of the centering model 
of local discourse coherence are employed to 
identify the topic which is the most salient 
element in a Chinese sentence. Due to the 
phenomenon of zero anaphora occurring in 
Chinese texts frequently, in addition to the 
centering model, we further employ the 
constraint rules to identify the antecedents of 
zero anaphors. Unlike most traditional 
approaches to parsing sentences based on the 
integration of complex linguistic information 
and domain knowledge, we work on the 
output of a part-of-speech tagger and use 
shallow parsing instead of complex parsing to 
identify the topics from sentences.
