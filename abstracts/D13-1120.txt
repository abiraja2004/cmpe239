A precise syntacto-semantic analysis of En-
glish requires a large detailed lexicon with the
possibility of treating multiple tokens as a sin-
gle meaning-bearing unit, a word-with-spaces.
However parsing with such a lexicon, as in-
cluded in the English Resource Grammar, can
be very slow. We show that we can apply
supertagging techniques over an ambiguous
token lattice without resorting to previously
used heuristics, a process we call ubertagging.
Our model achieves an ubertagging accuracy
that can lead to a four to eight fold speed up
while improving parser accuracy.
