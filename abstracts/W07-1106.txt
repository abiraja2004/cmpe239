Much work on idioms has focused on type
identification, i.e., determining whether a se-
quence of words can form an idiomatic ex-
pression. Since an idiom type often has a
literal interpretation as well, token classifi-
cation of potential idioms in context is criti-
cal for NLP. We explore the use of informa-
tive prior knowledge about the overall syn-
tactic behaviour of a potentially-idiomatic
expression (type-based knowledge) to de-
termine whether an instance of the expres-
sion is used idiomatically or literally (token-
based knowledge). We develop unsuper-
vised methods for the task, and show that
their performance is comparable to that of
state-of-the-art supervised techniques.
