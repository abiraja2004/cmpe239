This paper presents the experiments con-
ducted by the Machine Translation group
at DCU and Prompsit Language Engineer-
ing for the WMT13 translation task. Three
language pairs are considered: Spanish-
English and French-English in both direc-
tions and German-English in that direc-
tion. For the Spanish-English pair, the use
of linguistic information to select paral-
lel data is investigated. For the French-
English pair, the usefulness of the small in-
domain parallel corpus is evaluated, com-
pared to an out-of-domain parallel data
sub-sampling method. Finally, for the
German-English system, we describe our
work in addressing the long distance re-
ordering problem and a system combina-
tion strategy.
