We describe a WordNet-based system for
the extraction of semantic relations be-
tween pairs of nominals appearing in
English texts. The system adopts a
lightweight approach, based on training
a Bayesian Network classifier using large
sets of binary features. Our features con-
sider: i) the context surrounding the an-
notated nominals, and ii) different types
of knowledge extracted from WordNet, in-
cluding direct and explicit relations be-
tween the annotated nominals, and more
general and implicit evidence (e.g. seman-
tic boundary collocations). The system
achieved a Macro-averaged F1 of 68.02%
on the ?Multi-Way Classification of Se-
mantic Relations Between Pairs of Nom-
inals? task (Task #8) at SemEval-2010.
