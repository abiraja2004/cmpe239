Plug and Play is an increasingly im-
portant concept in system and network
architectures. We introduce and de-
scribe a spoken language dialogue sys-
tem architecture which supports Plug
and Playable networks of objects in its
domain. Each device in the network car-
ries the linguistic and dialogue manage-
ment information which is pertinent to it
and uploads it dynamically to the rele-
vant language processing components in
the spoken language interface. We de-
scribe the current state of our plug and
play demonstrator and discuss theoreti-
cal issues that arise from our work. Plug
and Play forms a central topic for the
DHomme project.
