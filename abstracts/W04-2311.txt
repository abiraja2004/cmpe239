Surface realization in statistical natural lan-
guage generation is based on the idea that when
there are many ways to say the same thing, the
most frequent option based on corpus counts
is the best. Based on data from English and
Finnish, we argue instead that all options are
not equivalent, and the most frequent one can
be incoherent in some contexts. A statistical
NLG system where word order choice is based
only on frequency counts of forms cannot cap-
ture the contextually-appropriate use of word
order. We describe an alternative method for
word order selection and show how it outper-
forms a frequency-only approach.
