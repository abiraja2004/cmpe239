 
This paper describes a system capable of 
semi-automatically filling an XML template 
from free texts in the clinical domain (prac-
tice guidelines). The XML template includes 
semantic information not explicitly encoded 
in the text (pairs of conditions and ac-
tions/recommendations). Therefore, there is 
a need to compute the exact scope of condi-
tions over text sequences expressing the re-
quired actions. We present a system devel-
oped for this task. We show that it yields 
good performance when applied to the 
analysis of French practice guidelines.
