Ranked lists of output trees from syn-
tactic statistical NLP applications fre-
quently contain multiple repeated entries.
This redundancy leads to misrepresenta-
tion of tree weight and reduced informa-
tion for debugging and tuning purposes.
It is chiefly due to nondeterminism in the
weighted automata that produce the re-
sults. We introduce an algorithm that de-
terminizes such automata while preserv-
ing proper weights, returning the sum of
the weight of all multiply derived trees.
We also demonstrate our algorithm?s ef-
fectiveness on two large-scale tasks.
