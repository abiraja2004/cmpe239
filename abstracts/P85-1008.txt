 
To facilitate work in discourse interpretation, the logical form of 
English sentences should be both close to English and syntacti- 
cally simple. In this paper i propose s logical notation which is 
first-order and uonintensional, sad for which semantic tnmsla- 
tion can be naively compositional. The key move is to expand 
what kinds of entities one allows in one's ontology, rather than 
complicating the logical notation, the logical form of sentences, 
or the semantic translation process. Three classical problems -
opaque adverbials, the distinction between de re and de ditto 
belief reports, and the problem of identity in intensional con- 
texts - are examined for the dil~cuities they pose for this logical 
notation, and it is shown that the difficulties can be overcome. 
The paper closes with s statement about the view of semantics 
that is presupposed by this appro,-'h. 
1 Motivation 
The real problem in natural language processing is the inter- 
pretation of discourse. Therefore, the other aspects of the total 
process hould be in the service of discourse interpretation. This 
includes the semantic translation of sentences into s logical form, 
and indeed the logical notation itsel? Discourse interpretation 
processes, as ! see them, are inferential processes that manipu- 
late or perform deductions on logical expressions encoding the 
information in the text and on other logical expressions encoding 
the speaker's and helper's background knowledge. These con- 
siderations lead to two principal criteria for ? logical notation. 
Criterion I: The notation should be as close to English as 
possible. This makes it easier to specify the rules for translation 
between English and the formal language, mad also makes it 
easier to encode in logical notation facts we normally think of in 
English. The ideal choice by this criterion is English itself, but 
it fails monumentally on the second criterion. 
Criterion lh The notation should be syntactically simple. 
Since discourse processes are to be defined primarily in terms 
of manipulations performed on expressions in the logical nota- 
tion, the simpler that notation, the easier it will be to define the 
discourse operations. 
The development of such a logical notation is usually taken 
to be a very hard problem, i believe this is because researchers 
have imposed upon themselves several additional constraints - 
to adhere to stringent ontological scruples, to explain a number 
of mysterious yntactic facts ms a by-product of the notation, 
and to encode efficient deduction techniques in the notation. 
Most representational difficulties go ?way if one rejects these 
constraints, and there are good reasons for rejecting each of the 
constr~nts. 
Ontological scruples: Researchers in philosophy and lint~uis- 
tics have typically restricted themselves to very few (altho*Igh 
? strange assortment of) kinds of entities - physical objects, 
numbers, sets, times, possible worlds, propositions, events, and 
situations - mad all of these but the first have been controversial. 
Quine has been the greatest exponent of ontological chastity, ills 
argument is that in any scientific theory, "we adopt, at \[east in- 
sofas* as we are reasonable, the simplest conceptual scheme into 
which the disordered fragments of our experience can be fitted 
and arranged.* (Quine, 1953, p. 16.) But he goes on to say 
that "simplicity ... is not a clear and unambiguous idea; and it 
is quite capable of presenting a double or multiple standard." 
(Ibid., p. 17.) Minimising kinds of entities is not the only way 
to achieve simplicity in a theory. The aim in this enterprise is 
to achieve simplicity by minimizing the complexity of the rules 
in the system. It turns out this can be achieved by multiplying 
kinds of entities, by' allowing as an entity everything that can be 
referred to by a noun phrase. 
Syntactic explanation: The argument here is easy. It would 
be pleasant if an explanation of, say, the syntactic behavior of 
count nouns and mass nouns fell out of our underlying onto- 
logical structure at no extra cost, but if the extra cost is great 
complication in statements of discourse operations, it would be 
quite unpleasant. In constructing a theory of discourse interpre- 
tation, it doesn't make sense for us to tie our hands by requiring 
syntsctie explanations as well. The problem of discourse is at 
least an order of maguitude harder than the problem of syntax, 
and syntax shouldn't be in the driver's seat. 
Efficient deduction: There is ? long tradition in artificial 
intelligence of building control information into the notation. 
and indeed much work in knowledge representation is driven by 
this consideration. Semantic networks and other notational sys- 
tems built ,round hierarchies (Quillian, 1068; .~immons, 1973; 
Hendrix, 1975) implicitly assign a low cost to certain types 
of syllogistic remmning. The KL-ONE representation language 
(Schmolze and Brat.brunn, 1982) has a variety of notational de- 
vices, each with an associated efficient deduction procedure. 
Hayes (1979) has argued that frame representations (Minsky, 
1975; Bobrow and Winogrsd, 1977) should be viewed am sets 
of predicate calculus axioms together with a control component 
for drawing certain kinds of inferences quickly. In quite a differ- 
ent vein, Moore (1980) uses a possible worlds notation to model 
knowledge mad action in part to avoid inefficiencies in theorem- 
proving. 
By contrast, l would argue against building et?ciencies into 
the notation. From a psychological point of view, this allows us 
to abstract away from the details of implementation a partic- 
ular computational device, increasing the generality of the the- 
ory. From a technological point of view, it reflects a belief that 
we must first determine mpirically the must common classes of 
inferences required for discourse processing and only then seek 
algorithms for optimizing them. 
In this paper I propme s fl it logical notation with an ontolog- 
ically promiscuous semantics. One's first naive guess as to how 
to represent a simple sentence like 
A boy builds s boat. 
is as follows: 
(3z, y)build(z, g) A boy(z) ^  boat(v) 
This simple approach seems to break down when we encounter 
the more d i tcu i t  phenomena of natural language, like tense, 
intensional contexts, and adverbials, as in the sentence 
A boy wanted to build a boat quickly. 
These phenomena have led students of language to introduce 
significant complications in their logical notations for represent- 
ing sentences. My approach will be to maintain the syntactic 
simplicity of the logical notation and expand the theory of the 
world implicit in the semantics to accommodate this simplicity. 
The representation f the =hove sentence, as is justified below, 
is 
(::lCl, ?Z, el, Z, V) Past(el  )AwnnLl(et, Z, ez)Aquiekl(e2, us) 
Abmld~(es, z g) A bey(z) A boat(g) 
That is, el occurred in the peat, where el is z's wanting e~,  
which is the quickness of us, which is z's building of y, where z 
is a boy and y is a boat. 
In brief, the logical form of natural anguage sentences will be 
a conjunction of atomic predications in which all variables are 
existentially quantified with the widest poesible scope. Predi- 
cates will be identical or nearly identical to natural language 
morphemes. There will be no ftmctious, fun?*ionals, nested 
quantifiers, disjunctions, negations, or modal or inteusional op 
erators. 
3 The Logical Notation 
Davidson (1967) proposed a treatment of action sentences in 
which events are treated as individuals. This facilitated the 
representation f sentences with time and place adverbials. Thus 
we can view the sentences 
John ran on Monday. 
John ran in Sin Fnmciaco. 
as mmerting the existence of & ruxming event by John and assert- 
ing a relation between the event and Monday or San Francisco. 
We can similarly view the sentence 
John ran slowly. 
as expressing an attribute about a running event. Treating 
events as individuals is abe useful beemme they can be acgu- 
merits of statements about cremes: 
Because he wanted to get there first, John ran. 
Because John ran, he arrived sooner than anyone else. 
They can be the objects of propositional attitudes: 
Bill was surprised that John ran. 
Finally, this approach accomodates the facts that events can be 
nominalized and can be referred to pronominally: 
John's running tired him out. 
John ran, and Bill saw it. 
But virtually every predication that can he made in natural 
language can be specified u to time and place, be modified 
adverbially, function a~ a cause or effect of something else, be 
the object of a propositional attitude, be nominalized, and be 
referred to by a pronoun. It is therefore convenient to extend 
Davidson's approach to all predications. That is, corresponding 
to any predication that can he made in natural lan~tage, we 
will say there is an event, or state, or condition, or sitl=ation. 
or "eventual i ty ' ,  or whatever, in the world that it refer~ to. 
This approach might he called "ontnlogical promiscuity' .  0 l ie 
abandons all ontological scruples. 
Thus we would like to have in our logical notation the possi- 
bi l i ty of an extra argument in e~h predication referring to the 
"condition" that exists when that predication is true. However. 
especially for expository convenience, we would like to retain 
the option of not specifying that extra argument when it is not 
needed and would only get in our way. Ilence, I propose a logical 
notation that provides two sets of predicates fhat are ~ystem- 
atically related, by introducing what might I)e railed a "nomi- 
nalization" operator '. (:orresponding lu every rl-ary predicate 
p there will he an n + I-ary predicalc i ~t who.~e (i~t argqlnlenl 
can he thought of a.~ the condil ion that }mhl~ '*hen p is rnw 
of the suhsequent ar~lments. Thus. if r . . ( J )  me,~ns that .John 
runs, run ' (E ,  J) means that /': is a running event hy ,John. or 
John's running, if slipperv(F ) means that floor F is slippery, 
then Jlipperv~(E, F) means that ~" is the condition of F's being 
slippery, or F's slipperiness. The effect of this notational ma- 
neuver is to provide handles by which various predications can 
be grasped by higher predications. A similar approach haL~ been 
in many AI systems. 
In discourse one not only makes predications about such ephe- 
mera as events, states and conditions. One also refers to crttities 
that do not actually exist. Our notation must thus have a way 
of referring to such entities. We therefore take our model to he a 
Platonic universe which contains everything that can he spoken 
of - objects, events, states, conditions - whether they exist in 
the real world or not. It then may or may not be a property of 
such entities that they exist in the real world. In the sentence 
( l ) John worships Zeus, 
the worshipping event and John, but not Zeus, exist in the real 
world, but all three exist in the (overpopulated) Platonic uni- 
veto.  Similarly, in 
John wants to fly. 
62 
John's flying exists in the Platonic universe but not in the real 
world. l "  
The logical notation then is just first-order predicate calculus, 
where the universe of discourse is a rich set of individuals, which 
are real, possible auad even impossible objects, events, conditions, 
eventualities, and so on. 
Existence and truth in the actual universe are treated as pred- 
ications about individuals in the Platonic universe. For this pur- 
pose, we use a predicate Ezist. The formula Ez is t ( JO l lN)  says 
that the individual in the Platonic universe denoted by JOHN 
exists in the actual universe, s The formula 
(2) Ezist{g)  ^  run ' (E ,  JOHN)  
says that the condition E of John's r~mning exists in the ac- 
tual universe, or more simply that "John rains" is true, or still 
more simply, that John runs. A shorter way to write it is 
run( JO lf N). 
Although for a simple sentence like "John rmls ~, a logical form 
like (2) seems a bit overblown, when we rome to real sentences 
in English discourse with their variety of tenses, modalities and 
adverbial modifiers, the more elaborated logical form is neces- 
sary. Adopting the notation of (2) has Hw eth,ct of splitting a 
sentence into its propositional content - run'(L', JOHN)  and 
its assertional claim - gzist(E) .  This frequently turns out to 
be useful, as the latter is often in doubt until substantial work 
has been done by discourse interpretation processes. An entire 
sentence may be embedded within aa indirect proof or other 
extended counts{factual. 
We are now in a position to state formally the systematic re- 
lation between the unprimed and primed prrt l icat~ as an axiom 
schema. For every n-sty predicate p, 
(Vet . . . . .  z , i )p(  z l  . . . . .  z, i)  ~ (3e)  Ez i , , t (e )Ap ' (e ,  zt . . . . .  z, i)  
That is, if p is true of zl ..... z,s, then there is a condition e of p's 
being true of zt, ..., z~, amd ~ exists. Conversely, 
(re, zl  ..... z , , )gz i s t (e )  A p'(e, z ,  . . . . .  z, ,)  ~ p(z ,  . . . . .  z, ,)  
Thai  is. if ? is the condition of p's being tnle of zt ..... Jr,,, and e 
exists, then p is true of =,, . . . ,  z,,. We can compress these axiom 
schemas into one formula: 
{'31 (V i i  . . . . .  Zei)p(,,Z'l . . . . .  Z,l) --= (3elgzist(e)A p'(e.,z I . . . . .  z,,i) 
A sentence in English asserts the existence of one or more 
eventualities in the real world, and this may or may not imply 
the existence of other individuals. The logical form of sentence 
( I )  is 
Ezistl E) A morshipt( E, JOHN, ZEUS) 
This implies ~'zist( JOHN) but not Ezist(Zbft;,b')..~imilarly, 
the logical form of "John wants to fly" is 
IOns need not adhere to Platonism to accept the Platonic universe. It ran 
be viewed a~ t socially constituted, or conventional, con.true:ion, which 
is never~hele~ highly constrained by :he way the (not directly accessible} 
material world is. The degree of constraint is variable. We are more 
constrained by the miteriaJ world to belie~ in trees and chairs, le~ so 
to believe in patriotism or ghosts. 
iThe re~der might chaos# to think ot" the Platonic universe u the univenm 
of pmmibln individuals, although 1 do not want to exclude Io~eallll im- 
possible individua/s, such - the condition John he l io~ to exist when he 
believe; 6 + 7 -- 15. 
IM?Cal~hy (1997) employs a simtlar technique. 
E=ist(E:)  ^  wand(E: ,  JOHN,  El) A fly'(E~, JOHN)  
This implies Ez is t{ JOHN)  but not Ezist(EI). When the ex- 
istence of the condition corresponding to some predication im- 
plies the existence of one of the arguments of the predication, we 
will say that the predicate is transparent in that argument, and 
opaque otherwise, i Thus, worship and want are transparent in 
their first arguments and opaque in their secottd arguments. In 
general if a predicate p is transparent in its nth argument z, this 
can be encoded by the axiom 
(re . . . . .  =, . . . )p ' (e  . . . . .  =, . . .)  ^ Ezi~t(e) ~ Ezist(z) s 
That is, if e is p's being true of z and e exists, then z exists. 
Equivalently, 
(V..., x, ...)p( .... z, ...) 3 E.'zist(.~) 
In the absence of such axioms, predicates are a.ssltmed to be 
opaqne.

NS and the at relation E4, which in turn implies the existence 
of the veto and the meeting. These then imply the existence of 
Margaret Thatcher MT and President Mitterand PM,  but not 
the Channel Tunnel CT. Of course, we know about the exis- 
tence of some of these entities, such ms Margaret Thatcher and 
President Mitterand, for reasons other than the transparency of
predicates. 
Sentence (4) shows that virtually anything can be embedded 
in a higher predication. This is the reason, in the logical nots- 
tins, for flattening everything into predications about individu- 
Ms. 
There are four serious problems that must be dealt with if 
this approach is to work - quantifiers, opaque adverbials, the 
distinction between de re and de ditto readings of belief reports, 
and the problem of identity in intensional contexts. 
I have described a solution to the quantifier problem else- 
where (Hobbs, 1983). Briefly, universally quantified variables 
are reified ms typical elements of sets, existential quantification 
inside the scope of universally quantified variables are handled 
by means of dependency functions, and the quantifier structure 
of sentences i encoded in indices on predicates. In this paper i 
will address only the other three problems in detail. 
3 Opaque Adverbials 
\[t seems reasonably natural to treat transparent adverbials as 
properties of events. For opaque adverbials, like "almost", it 
seems lees natural, and one is inclined to follow Reichenbach 
(1947} in treating them ms ftmctionais mapping predicates into 
predicates. Thus, 
John is almost a man. 
would he represented 
almo,t( man )( J ) 
That is, almos~ maps the predicate man into the predicate "al- 
most a man' ,  which is then applied to John. 
This representation is undesirable for our purposes ince it is 
not first-order. It would be preferable to treat opaque operators 
as we do transparent ones, ms properties of events or conditions. 
The sentence would be represented 
almost(E) A manl( E, J) 
But does this get as into dil~cuity? 
First note that this representation does not imply that John 
is a man, for we have not asserted g 's  existence in the real 
world, and almo,t is opaque and does not imply its argument's 
existence. 
But is there enough information in E to allow one to determine 
the truth value of aimomt(E) in isolation; without appeal to 
other facts? The answer is that there could he. We can construct 
a model i~ which for every functional F there is a corresponding 
equivalent predicate q, such that 
(vp, ~(F (p) (z )  -- (-3s)q(~) ^  p'(e, : ) )  
The existence of the model shows that this condition is not nec- 
essarily contradictory. 
Let the ,miverse of discourse D be the class of finite sets built 
out of a finite set of urelements. The interpretation ofa constant 
X will be some element of D; call it I (X). The interpretation 
of s monsdic predicate p will a subset of D; call it lip). Then 
if E is such that p'(E, X), we define the interpretation of E to 
be < l(p), \ [ (X) >. 
Now suppose we have a functional F mapping predicates into 
predicates. We can define the corresponding predicate q to be 
such that 
q(E) is true iff there are a predicate p and a constant 
X where the interpretation of E is < I(p), \[(X) > 
and F(p)(X) is true. 
The fact that we can define such a predicate q in a moderately 
rich model means that we are licensed to treat opaque adverbials 
as properties of events and conditions. 
The purpose of this exercise is only to show the viability of 
the approach. I am not claiming that a running event *8 an 
ordered pair of the runner and the .set of all runners, although 
it should he harmless enough for those irredeemably committed 
to set-theoretic semantics to view it like that. 
It should be noted that this treatment of adverbials has con- 
sequences for the individuating criteria on eventualities. We can 
say "John is almost a man ~ without wishing to imply "John is 
almost a mammal," so we would not want to say that John's be- 
ing a man is the same condition as his being a mammal. We are 
forced, though not unwillingly, into a position of individuating 
eventualities ,,,'cording to very fine-grained criteria. 
4 De Re and De Dicto Belief Reports 
The next problem concerns the distinction (due to Quine (19.56)) 
between de re and de ditto belief reports. A belief report like 
(5) John believes a man at the next table is a spy. 
has two interpretations. The de dieto interpretation is likely in 
the circumstmace in which John and some man are at adjacent 
tables and John observes uspicious behavior. The de re inter. 
pretat ion is l ikely i f  some man is s i t t ing at the table next to the 
speaker of the sentence, and John is nowhere around but knows 
the man otherwise and suspects him to be a spy. A sentence 
that very nearly forces the de re reading is 
John believes Bill's mistress is Bill's wife/ 
whereas the sentence 
John believes Russian consulate mployees are spies. 
strongly indicates a de ditto reading. In the tie re reading of 
(5), John is not necessarily taken to know that the man is in 
fact at the next table, but he is normally a.ssumed to be able to 
identify the man somehow. More on ~identil'y" below. In the de 
divan reading John believes there is a man who is both at the 
next table and t spy, but may be otherwise unable to identify 
the man. The de re reading of (5) is usually taken to support 
the inference 
(6) There is someone John believes to be a spy. 
whereas the de ditto reading supports the weaker inference 
(7) John believes that someone is a spy. 
YThi- ,~x"~mple is due to Moore and Hendrix (1982). 
64 
As Quine has pointed out, as usually interpreted, the first of 
these sentences is false for most of us, the second one true. A 
common notational maneuver (though one that Quine rejects) 
is to represent this distinction as a scope ambigafity. Sentence 
(6) is encoded as (8) and (7) as (9): 
(8) (~z)believe(J, spy(z)) 
(9) believe(J, (3z)spy(z) )  
If one adopts this notation and stipulates what the expressions 
mean, then there are certainly distinct ways of representing the 
two sentences. But the interpretation of the two expressions 
is not obvious. It is not obvious for example that (8) could 
not cover the case where there is an individual such that John 
believes him to be a spy but has never seen him and knows 
absolutely nothing else about him - not his name, nor his ap- 
pearance, nor his location at any point in time - beyond the fact 
that he is a spy. 
In fact. the notation we propose takes (8) to be the most 
neutral representation. Since quantification is over entities in 
the Platonic universe, (8) says that there is some ent i ty in the 
Platonic universe such that John believes of that. entity that it 
is a spy. Expression (8) commits us to no other beliefs on the 
part of .John. When understood in this way, expression (8) is 
a representation of what is conveyed in a de ditto belief report. 
Translated into the flat notation and introducing a constant for 
the existentially quantified variable. (8) becomes 
(10) believe{J. P) A spy'(P.S) 
Anything else that John believes about this entity must be 
stated explicitly. In particular, the de dieto reading of (5) would 
be represented by something like 
(11) believe(J, P) A spy'(P, S) A believe( J, Q) A at'(Q, S, T) 
where T is the next table. That is, John believes that S is a 
spy and that .q is at the next table. John may know many other 
propcriies about S and still fall short of knowing ,rho the spy 
is. There is a range of possibilities for John's knowledge, from 
the bare statements of (lO) and ( I t )  that correspond to a ,le 
ditto reading to the full-blown knowledge of S's hh'ntity that is 
normally present in a de re reading. In fact, an FBI agent would 
progress through just such a range of belief states on his way to 
identifying the spy. 
To state John's knowledge of S's identity properly, we wo*tld 
have to state explicitly John's belief in a potentially very large 
collection of properties of the spy. To arrive at a succinct way of 
representing knowledge of identity in our notation, let us con. 
sider the two pairs of equivalent sentences: 
What is that? 
Identify that. 
The FBI doesn't  know who the spy is. 
The FBI doesn't  know the spy's identity. 
The answer to the question "Who are you?" and what is re- 
quired before we can say that we know who someone is or that 
we know their identity is a highly context-dependent matter. 
Several years ago, before I had ever seen Kripke, if someone had 
asked me whether I knew who Saul Kripke was, I would have 
said, ~Yes. tle's the author of Naming and Neeessd~.  Then 
once ! was at a workshop which I knew was being attended by 
Kripke, but I didn't  yet know what he looked like. If someone 
had asked me whether I knew who Kripke was, I would have had 
to say, "No. * The relevant property in that context, was not, his 
authorship of some paper, but any property that distinguished 
him from the others present, such as "the malt in the back row 
holding a cup of coffee*. 
Knowledge of a person's identity is then a matter of know- 
ing some context-dependent essential property that serves to 
identify that person for present purposes - that is, a matter of 
knowing who he or she is. 
Therefore, we need a kind of place-holder predicate to stand 
for this essential property, that in any particular context can

whether sentence 5 is appropriatc in these circllms/ances, but it 
is certain that the sentence

It seems then that the ton i ,nets  know(J.  R) and ~,h'(R.S)

John doesn't know that the man is at the next table, there must 
be some other description under which John is familiar with the 
man. The story I just told provides uch a description, but not 
one sufficient for identifying the man. 
This analysis is attractive since it allows us to view the de re - 
de dicto distinction problem u just one instance of a much more 
general problem, namely, the existential status of the grammat- 
ically subordinated material in sentences. Generally, such ma- 
terial takes on the tense of the sentence. Thus, in 
The boy built the boat. 
a building event by z of y takes place in the past, and we assume 
that a was a boy in the past, at the time of the building. But in 
Many rich men studied computer science in college. 
the most natural reading is not that the men were rich when they 
were studying computer science but that they are rich now. In 
The flower is artificial. 
there is an entity z which is described as a flower, and z exists, 
but its "flower-hess" does not exist in the real world. Rather, 
it is a condition which is embedded in the opaque predicate 
"artificial'. 
It was stated above that the representation (10) for the de 
ditto reading conveys no properties of S other than that John 
believes him to be a spy. In particular, it does not convey S's 
existence in the real world. S thus refers to a possible individual, 
who may turn out to be ,wtual if, for example, John ever comes 
to be able to identify the person whom he believes to be the spy, 
or if there is some actual spy who has given John good cause for 
his suspicions. 
However, S may not be actual, only possible. Suppose this is 
the case. One common objection to possible individuals is that 
they may seem to violate the Law of the Excluded Middle. Is 
S married or not married? Our intuition is that the question 
is inappropriate, and indeed the answer given in our formalism 
has this flavor. By axiom (3), married(S) is really just an ab- 
breviation for married'( g, S) ^ gzist(E). This is false, for the 
existence of E in the real world would imply the existence of S. 
So married(S) is also false. But its falsity has nothing to do 
with S's marital status, only his existential status. The predi- 
cation unmarried(S) is false for the same reason. The primed 
predicates are basic, and for them the problem of the excluded 
middle does not arise. The predication maeried'(E, S) is true 
or false depending on whether E is the condition of S's being 
married. An unprimed, trmxsparent predicate carries along with 
it the existence of its arguments, and it can fail to be true of 
an entity either through the entity being actual but not having 
that property or through the nonexistence of the entity. 
5 Identity in Bel ief  Contexts  
The final problem I will consider arises in de dieto belief reports. 
It is the problem of identity in intensional contexts, raised by 
grege (1892). One way of stating the problem is this. Why is it 
that if 
(14) John believes the Evening Star is rising. 
and if the Evening Star is identical to the Morning Star, it is 
not necessarily true that 
(15) John believes the Morning Star is rising. 
By Leibniz's Law, we ought to be able to substitute for an entity 
any entity that is identical to it. 
This puzzle survives translation into the logical notation, if 
John knows of the existence of the Morning Star and if proper 
names are unique. The representation for (the de dicto reading 
of) sentence (14) is 
(16) believe(J, P, ) A rise:( FI, ES) A believe( J, Q t) 
AEveninpStar:(QI, ES) 
John's belief in the Morning Star would he represented 
believe(J, Q2) A Morning.Star:(Q2, MS)  
The existence of the Evening Star and the Moromg Star is ex- 
pressed by 
Ezist(Qi)  ^  Ezist(Q2) 
The uniqueness of the proper name "Evening Star" is expressed 
by the axiom 
(Vz, y)Evenin?-Star(z) A Evensn?-Star(y) D .z = y 
The identity of the Evening Star and the Morning Star is ex- 
pressed 
(V~)Eoening-,~;lar(~) ---- Aforning-b'tar(z) 
From all of this we can infer that the Morning Star M,q is also 
an Evening Star and hence is identical to ES;, and hence can be 
substituted into ri.se'(Pi, E.S') to give rise'(PI, MS). Then we 
have  
believe( J, P, ) A vine'( P,, M S ) A believe( J, Q: ) 
AMorning-b'tar'(Q:, MS) 
This is a representation for tile paradoxical sentence (15). 
There are three possibilities for dealing with this proi)lem. 
The first is to discard or restrict I,eibniz's Law. The second is to 
deny that the Evening ~tar and the Morning Star are identical a.s 
entities in the Platonic universe; they only happen to he identical 
in the real world, and that is not sullieient for intersubstitutivity 
The third is to deny that expression (16) represents ~entence 
(14) because "the Evening Star" in (14) does not refer to what 
it seems to refer to. 
The first possibility is the approach of researchers who treat 
belief as an operator rather than as a predicate, and then re. 
strict substitution inside the operator. ~ We cannot avail our- 
selves of this. solution bec.ause of the flatness of our notation. 
The predicate rtse is surely referentially transparent, so if ES 
and MS are identical, M,S" can he substituted for E:S in the 
expression rine'(l'l,Eb') to give rtse'(l'\].M.S'). Then the ex- 
pression belier,e( J, I'1) wouhl not even require substitution to he 
a belief about the Morning Star. 
In any case, this approach does not seem wise in view of 
the central importance played ia discourse interpretation by the 
identity of differently presented entities, i.e. by coreference. Free 
intersubstitutibility of identicals eems a desirable property to 
preser'se. 
The second possible answer to Frege's problem is to say that 
in the Platonic universe, the Morning Star and the Evening Star 
*This ia a purely syntactic approach, and whPn one tries to construct ?
semantics for it, one is generally driven to the third possibility. 
86 
are different entities. It just happens chu in the res/world they 
are idemical. But it is not true that E$  = MS, for equality, like 
quantification, is over entities in the Platonic universe. The fact 
that E,.~ and MS ate identical in the real wodd (call this relation 
rw-identicai) must be stated explicitly, say, by the expression 
r~-identical( E S, MS)  
or more properly, 
(~:, ~t)Moming-Star(:) A Euenin~.Stav(y) 
D r~.4dcntical(z, If)
For reuonin~ shout "r~-idmtical" entities, thm~ is, Platonic 
entities th~ mrs identical in the real world, we may cake the fol- 
Iowin~ approach- Substitution in re(erenmdly trsmsparent con- 
texts wonld be ,z:hieved by ~so o( the sx/om schema 
(17) (Vel, es. e4 .... )p/(et ..... ?s .... ) A rw.idsnticed(e4, eS) 
D (::leZ)p~(ez ..... e4, ...) A r~n.4dsnfica~(ez, e! ) 
where es is the /cth argument of p sad p is referentially cras~, 
parent in im kth ar~ment .  That is, if et is p's being true of 
{S ~ e$ ~ e4 SA'~ identical in the real world, then there is a 
condition ?z o(p's bein~ true of e4, ~ ez is identical to e~ in the 
real worid. Substitution o/' h'w.identicab" in s condition resulra 
not in the same condition but in ,n "rw-identical" condition. 
Them would be such an sx/om for the ~? u.gument o( bei*eve 
but not for its referentially opaque second srlrumeut. 
A.z/ome will express the fact that r,~.idzntiea~ is an equlvs. 
lence relation: 
(~z)r~u-idsnticat( z, ~t) 
(~=, v )~w.identieal( =, V) D e~.4dentie~(v, z) 
('V=, ~, s)r~.4denticai( z, ~) A re.identical(V, s)
m ,.-id,,,tie=/(z, ,) 
Finally, cl~ followins Lziom, co .her  with Lziom (17), wou/d 
exprem L~ibnis's L,w: 
(Ve~, e~)r,,,-identica(s,, q)  ~ (~,t(s,) s ~=ist(s~)) 
From all of (hi, we can prove that if the gVenin~ Star 
then the Momin~ Star rises, but we clmsot prove from John's 
belief chat the Evening Star r im that John believes the Morning 
Star rises. If John knows the Mornln? Star sad the Evening 
Star are identical, sad he knows ,xiom (17), then his belief that 
eke Moruin? $~m' r im can be proved u one would prove 
belief in the consequences of ~y  o*h~ syilot~m whose premises 
he believed, in accordance with ? m.*s~ment of resmmn? shout 
belief developed in * Iont~.,r vere/on o( th/s pal.ee. 
This solution is in the spirit of our whole representational ~p. 
preach in ch*~ it forces tm co be paln(ully expticit about every. 
chm~. The notation does no magic for us. There is a sit, nificant 
cost a~.socis:ed with th~s olution, however. When proper names 
? re represented u predicates ad not u constants, the natural 
way co state the uniqueness o( proper names is by mesas o( 
axioms of the foiiowin? sort: 
(~=, y)Euen,ng*~tar(z) A "~uensng-Star(g) D Z I y 
BUt since from ~he sX/oms for r~-identieai we can show chat 
"~veninf-~tar(~fS), it would follow chsc M~ = ~S.  We mnst 
thus restate the axiom for \[he umqueness o( proper uames a= 
(V=, y)Evenin~.Star(=) ^ Eveninf-Star(v) 
3 r~.ident,cal(z, ~) 
A similar modification mus, be made for functions. Since we are 
using only predicates, the uniqueness of the value of a function 
must be encoded with an axiom like 
(?=, V, :)father(=, z) ^  father{v, z) ~ = = y 
If = and y are both fathem o/" z, {hen z and y are the same. This 
wonld have to be replaced by the axiom 
(V=, y, z ) father( =, :)^father(y, z) 3 rw-identicai( =, V) 
The very common problems involving ressomn K shout equality, 
which can be done elRciently, are thus translated into problems 
involvinf resmnm~ shout the predicate re.identical, which is 
very cumbersome. 
One way to view Ch/s second solution is ~ a l~x co the first so- 
lucian. For "=*" we substitute the relation r~;-qden~,cad, ~md by 
means of axiom schema (17), we force substitutions co propagate 
to the eventualities they occur in, and we force the distinction 
between referentially transparent and referentially opaque predi- 
cates to be made explicitly. It is thus an indirect way of rejecting 
L,eibnis' Law. 
The third solution is to say that "the Eveninf Star* in sen- 
tents (14) does not really refer to the Evening Star, but co some 
abstract entity somehow related to the Evenin~ Star. That is. 
sentence (14) is re-fly en example of metonymy. This may seem 
counterintuitive, sad even bizarre, at first blush. But in fact 
the most widely *,'espied clmmical solutions to the problem of 
identiw ate of thn, flavor. Foe Fre~e (1892) "the Evening Star ~ 
in sentence (14) does no* refer co the Evenin~ Star but co the 
tenme of the phrsac "the Evening Star ~. \[n a more recent ap- 
proar.h, Zalta (1983) ts~es such noun phrases co refer co "ab- 
strict objects" related to the resJ object. In both approaches 
noun phrues in intemional context~ refer co senses or abstract 
objects, while other noun phrues refer co actual entities, sad so 
it is necessary co specify which predicates are intensioa*,l. \[n a 
Manta{avian approach, "the Evening Star" would be taken to 
refer co the inter.on o( the Evening Star, not its e=te~*on in 
the real world, sad noun phrases would al,vays be taken co refer 
co intensions, -Ithough for nonintensional predicates there would 
be mesmng postulates chat make this equivalent co reference co 
extensions. 
Thus, in all these approaches intentional and extensional pred- 
icates must be distintmished explicitly, sad noun phrs~s in in- 
tensional contexts are systematically interpreted metonymically. 
It would be em,y enouch in our framework co implement these 
q3proaches. We c,m define a function a o( three arguments - the 
actual entity, the co,niter, sad the condition used co describe 
the entity - chat returns the sense, or intention, or abstract 
entity, corresponding co the ~ctual entity for chat ?ognizer ~nd 
that condition. Sentence (14) would be represented, not ~ (16). 
but u 
(18) betievse(d, Pt) ^ rise~(Pt,a(E S, d, Ql)) ^ beiieve(J, Qt) 
AEusninf.Sta?(Qc, F,S) 
l tend r.o prefer co cl~nk o( the vaJue o( a(ES, J, Qt ) as 
sa abstract entity. Whatever it is, it is necessary chat the 
vMue of a(E2, J, Qs) be something different from the value of 
a( ES, J. Q~.) where Movninq-StarJ(Q:, ES). That is. different 
~tr 'ac t  objects must correspond co the condition QI of being 
the Evening Star and the coaditioo Q: o( being the Morning 
Star. It is because o( this feature ~hat we escape the problem 
67 
o( intenmbstitutivity of identieakt, fur substitution o( MS for 
ES in (18) yields "...Ariee/(Pt,a(MS, J Q1))A..." rather than 
"...Ariee~(Pl,,~(M$, J,Q=)) A...', which would be the represen- 
tation of sentence (15). 
The dif~culty with this approach is that it makes the interpee- 
ration o/" noun phrases dependent on their embedding context: 
\[ntensionai context  -*  me?onymlc interpretation 
Extensional  context  - -  noumetonymic  interpretation 
It thus violates, though not soriousiy, the nmve com~t iona i i ty  
that \[ have been at so many pehm to preserve. Metonymy is a 
very common phenomenon i  discourse, but l prefer to think o( 
it as occurring irregularly, sad not 8a siKnalled systematieafly

Having laid out the three possible solutious and their sho~- 
?ominKs, \[ find tha~ \[ would like to avoid the problem o/" identity

6 The tLole of Semant ics  
Let me cla~ by making some commenm about ways of doing 
semantics. Semangcs i the =temp~.d specification of the re- 
In, ion between language and ?he world. However, this requires 
a theory of the world. There is a ,peetrtun of choices one can 
make in this retard. At one end o/' the spectrum - l~'s say the 
right end - one can *,/opt the "coreeet" theory of the wodd, the 
theory Oven by quantum mechsmcs u~/ the other sciences. If 
or=. doe= this, .emantics become= impmmbte because it is no lem 
than Ill of sr../e~m, a fset that has led Fodur (1980) to exp~ 
some deapmr. Thor's mo much o( a m/smasch between the way 
we view the wodd and the way che wodd reaily is. At ~he left 
end, oue can mmume a theory o( the w~dd that is isomorphic to 
the way we caik -hour it. Whmt \[ have been doing in this paper, 
in fact, is an effort to work out the deem ~- in such = theory. In 
this cue. semantics becomes very neudy trivial Meet activity 
in ~emmtics today is slightly to toe ,~t  of the extreme left end 
of this spectrum. One makes certam smumptious about the na- 
ture of the wodd that timely mflt~t 18nKumle, and doesn't make 
certain other alumptions. Where one h .= fa~ed to m -~,. the 
neceeac~, aesumpoons, pusaies app~w, tnd semanr~i?~ becomes 
an effort to soive those puzzles. Neve~heiess, it fsils to move 
far enough away from langms~e to re, reseat d~nifieant p ~gre~ 
cows~t he tight end of the sl~.etrum. The pmition \[ advocate 
is that there is no remmn to make our task mo~ difficult. We 
wdl have pus~des nough to mlve when we get m diseourae.
