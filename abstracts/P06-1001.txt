Statistical machine translation is quite ro-
bust when it comes to the choice of in-
put representation. It only requires con-
sistency between training and testing. As
a result, there is a wide range of possi-
ble preprocessing choices for data used
in statistical machine translation. This
is even more so for morphologically rich
languages such as Arabic. In this paper,
we study the effect of different word-level
preprocessing schemes for Arabic on the
quality of phrase-based statistical machine
translation. We also present and evalu-
ate different methods for combining pre-
processing schemes resulting in improved
translation quality.
