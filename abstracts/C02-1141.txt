A standard architecture for an NLG system has
been defined in (Reiter and Dale, 2000). Their
work describes the modularization of an NLG
system and the tasks of each module. How-
ever, they do not indicate what kind of tools can
be used by each module. Nevertheless, we be-
lieve that certain tools widely used by the AI or
NLU community are appropriate for NLG tasks.
This paper presents a complete integrated NLG
system which uses a Description logic for the
content determination module, Segmented Dis-
course Representation Theory for the document
structuring module and a lexicalized formalism
for the tactical component. The NLG system,
which takes into account a user model, is illus-
trated with a generator which produces texts
explaining the steps taken by a proof assistant.
