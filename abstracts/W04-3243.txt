We address the issue of judging the significance of
rare events as it typically arises in statistical natural-
language processing. We first define a general ap-
proach to the problem, and we empirically com-
pare results obtained using log-likelihood-ratios and
Fisher?s exact test, applied to measuring strength of
bilingual word associations.
