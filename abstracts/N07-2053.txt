Phrase-based statistical machine transla-
tion systems depend heavily on the knowl-
edge represented in their phrase transla-
tion tables. However, the phrase pairs
included in these tables are typically se-
lected using simple heuristics that poten-
tially leave much room for improvement.
In this paper, we present a technique for
selecting the phrase pairs to include in
phrase translation tables based on their es-
timated quality according to a translation
model. This method not only reduces the
size of the phrase translation table, but
also improves translation quality as mea-
sured by the BLEU metric.
