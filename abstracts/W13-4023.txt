 
This demo paper describes our Artificial Intel-
ligent Dialogue Agent (AIDA), a dialogue 
management and orchestration platform under 
development at the Institute for Infocomm Re-
search. Among other features, it integrates dif-
ferent human-computer interaction engines 
across multiple domains and communication 
styles such as command, question answering, 
task-oriented dialogue and chat-oriented dia-
logue. The platform accepts both speech and 
text as input modalities by either direct micro-
phone/keyboard connections or by means of 
mobile device wireless connection. The output 
interface, which is supported by a talking ava-
tar, integrates speech and text along with other 
visual aids.
