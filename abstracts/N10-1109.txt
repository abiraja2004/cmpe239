We present Quantized Contour Modeling (QCM), a
Bayesian approach to the classification of acoustic
contours. We evaluate the performance of this tech-
nique in the classification of prosodic events. We
find that, on BURNC, this technique can success-
fully classify pitch accents with 63.99% accuracy
(.4481 CER), and phrase ending tones with 72.91%
accuracy.
