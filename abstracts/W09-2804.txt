We introduce a content selection method
for opinion summarization based on a
well-studied, formal mathematical model,
the p-median clustering problem from fa-
cility location theory. Our method re-
places a series of local, myopic steps to
content selection with a global solution,
and is designed to allow content and re-
alization decisions to be naturally inte-
grated. We evaluate and compare our
method against an existing heuristic-based
method on content selection, using human
selections as a gold standard. We find that
the algorithms perform similarly, suggest-
ing that our content selection method is
robust enough to support integration with
other aspects of summarization.
