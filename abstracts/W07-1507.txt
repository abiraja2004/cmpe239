This paper describes an annotation system
for Sa?mi language corpora, which consists
of structured, running texts. The annotation
of the texts is fully automatic, starting from
the original documents in different formats.
The texts are first extracted from the origi-
nal documents preserving the original struc-
tural markup. The markup is enhanced by a
document-specific XSLT script which con-
tains document-specific formatting instruc-
tions. The overall maintenance is achieved
by system-wide XSLT scripts.
