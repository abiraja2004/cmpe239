Creating a language-independent meaning
representation would benefit many cross-
lingual NLP tasks. We introduce the first un-
supervised approach to this problem, learn-
ing clusters of semantically equivalent English
and French relations between referring expres-
sions, based on their named-entity arguments
in large monolingual corpora. The clusters
can be used as language-independent semantic
relations, by mapping clustered expressions
in different languages onto the same relation.
Our approach needs no parallel text for train-
ing, but outperforms a baseline that uses ma-
chine translation on a cross-lingual question
answering task. We also show how to use the
semantics to improve the accuracy of machine
translation, by using it in a simple reranker.
