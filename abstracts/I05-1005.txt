. Japanese relative clause constructions (RCC?s) are defined as
being the NP?s of structure ?S NP?, noting the lack of a relative pronoun
or any other explicit form of noun-clause demarcation. Japanese relative
clause modification should be classified into at least two major semantic
types: case-slot gapping and head restrictive. However, these types for
relative clause modification cannot apparently be distinguished. In this
paper we propose a method of identifying a RCC?s type with a machine
learning technique. The features used in our approach are not only rep-
resenting RCC?s characteristics, but also automatically obtained from
large corpora. The results we obtained from evaluation revealed that our
method outperformed the traditional case frame-based method, and the
features that we presented were effective in identifying RCC?s types.
