 
This paper claims that reliance on discourse focus to 
guide the production of rhetorically structured texts is 
insufficient over lengthier stretches of prose. Instead, 
this paper argues that at least hree distinct attentional 
constraints are required: discourse focus \[Sidner, 
1979, 1983; Grosz and Sidner, 1986\], temporal focus 
\[Webber, 1988\], and a novel notion of spatial focus. 
The paper illustrates the operation of this tripartite 
theory of focus in a computational system 
(TEXPLAN) that plans multisentential text.
