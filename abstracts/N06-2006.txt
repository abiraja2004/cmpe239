The performance of automatic speech
summarisation has been improved in pre-
vious experiments by using linguistic
model adaptation. We extend such adapta-
tion to the use of class models, whose ro-
bustness further improves summarisation
performance on a wider variety of objec-
tive evaluation metrics such as ROUGE-2
and ROUGE-SU4 used in the text sum-
marisation literature. Summaries made
from automatic speech recogniser tran-
scriptions benefit from relative improve-
ments ranging from 6.0% to 22.2% on all
investigated metrics.
