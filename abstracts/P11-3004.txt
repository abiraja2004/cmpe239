Named entity disambiguation is the task of
linking an entity mention in a text to the cor-
rect real-world referent predefined in a knowl-
edge base, and is a crucial subtask in many
areas like information retrieval or topic detec-
tion and tracking. Named entity disambigua-
tion is challenging because entity mentions
can be ambiguous and an entity can be refer-
enced by different surface forms. We present
an approach that exploits Wikipedia relations
between entities co-occurring with the am-
biguous form to derive a range of novel fea-
tures for classifying candidate referents. We
find that our features improve disambiguation
results significantly over a strong popularity
baseline, and are especially suitable for recog-
nizing entities not contained in the knowledge
base. Our system achieves state-of-the-art re-
sults on the TAC-KBP 2009 dataset.
