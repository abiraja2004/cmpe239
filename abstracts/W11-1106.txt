In this paper, we present GrawlTCQ, a new
bootstrapping algorithm for building special-
ized terminology, corpora and queries, based
on a graph model. We model links be-
tween documents, terms and queries, and use
a random walk with restart algorithm to com-
pute relevance propagation. We have evalu-
ated GrawlTCQ on an AFP English corpus of
57,441 news over 10 categories. For corpora
building, GrawlTCQ outperforms the Boot-
CaT tool, which is vastly used in the domain.
For 1,000 documents retrieved, we improve
mean precision by 25%. GrawlTCQ has also
shown to be faster and more robust than Boot-
CaT over iterations.
