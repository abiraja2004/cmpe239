In this paper, we introduce the German ver-
sion of the multilingual Fips parsing system.
We focus on the evaluation of its part-of-
speech tagging component with the help of the
TIGER treebank. We explain how Fips can be
adapted to the tagset used by TIGER and re-
port first results of this study: currently, 87%
of words are tagged correctly. We also discuss
some common errors and explore a possible
extension of this study to parsing.
