We report on our work to automatically build a
corpus of instructional text annotated with lex-
ical semantics information. We have coupled
the parser LCFLEX with a lexicon and ontol-
ogy derived from two lexical resources, Verb-
Net for verbs and CoreLex for nouns. We dis-
cuss how we built our lexicon and ontology,
and the parsing results we obtained.
