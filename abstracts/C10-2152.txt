 
Recent years have witnessed a large body of 
research works on cross-domain sentiment 
classification problem, where most of the re-
search endeavors were based on a supervised 
learning strategy which builds models from 
only the labeled documents or only the labeled 
sentiment words. Unfortunately, such kind of 
supervised learning method usually fails to 
uncover the full knowledge between docu-
ments and sentiment words. Taking account of 
this limitation, in this paper, we propose an it-
erative reinforcement learning approach for 
cross-domain sentiment classification by si-
multaneously utilizing documents and words 
from both source domain and target domain. 
Our new method can make full use of the rein-
forcement between documents and words by 
fusing four kinds of relationships between 
documents and words. Experimental results 
indicate that our new method can improve the 
performance of cross-domain sentiment classi-
fication dramatically.
