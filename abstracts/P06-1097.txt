We introduce a semi-supervised approach
to training for statistical machine transla-
tion that alternates the traditional Expecta-
tion Maximization step that is applied on a
large training corpus with a discriminative
step aimed at increasing word-alignment
quality on a small, manually word-aligned
sub-corpus. We show that our algorithm
leads not only to improved alignments
but also to machine translation outputs of
higher quality.
