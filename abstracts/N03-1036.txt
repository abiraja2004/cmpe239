This paper describes an unsupervised algo-
rithm for placing unknown words into a taxon-
omy and evaluates its accuracy on a large and
varied sample of words. The algorithm works
by first using a large corpus to find semantic
neighbors of the unknown word, which we ac-
complish by combining latent semantic analy-
sis with part-of-speech information. We then
place the unknown word in the part of the tax-
onomy where these neighbors are most concen-
trated, using a class-labelling algorithm devel-
oped especially for this task. This method is
used to reconstruct parts of the existing Word-
Net database, obtaining results for common
nouns, proper nouns and verbs. We evaluate
the contribution made by part-of-speech tag-
ging and show that automatic filtering using the
class-labelling algorithm gives a fourfold im-
provement in accuracy.
