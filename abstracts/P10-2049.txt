Current work on automatic opinion min-
ing has ignored opinion targets expressed
by anaphorical pronouns, thereby missing
a significant number of opinion targets. In
this paper we empirically evaluate whether
using an off-the-shelf anaphora resolution
algorithm can improve the performance of
a baseline opinion mining system. We
present an analysis based on two different
anaphora resolution systems. Our exper-
iments on a movie review corpus demon-
strate, that an unsupervised anaphora reso-
lution algorithm significantly improves the
opinion target extraction. We furthermore
suggest domain and task specific exten-
sions to an off-the-shelf algorithm which
in turn yield significant improvements.
