While recent retrieval techniques do not
limit the number of index terms, out-of-
vocabulary (OOV) words are crucial in
speech recognition. Aiming at retrieving
information with spoken queries, we fill
the gap between speech recognition and
text retrieval in terms of the vocabulary
size. Given a spoken query, we gener-
ate a transcription and detect OOV words
through speech recognition. We then cor-
respond detected OOV words to terms in-
dexed in a target collection to complete the
transcription, and search the collection for
documents relevant to the completed tran-
scription. We show the effectiveness of
our method by way of experiments.
