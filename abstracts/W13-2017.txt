In this paper we propose a system which uses 
hybrid methods that combine both rule-based 
and machine learning (ML)-based approaches 
to solve GENIA Event Extraction of BioNLP 
Shared Task 2013. We apply UIMA1 Frame-
work to support coding. There are three main 
stages in model: Pre-processing, trigger detec-
tion and biomedical  event  detection.  We use 
dictionary and support vector machine classifi-
er to detect event triggers.  Event detection is 
applied on syntactic patterns which are com-
bined with features extracted for classification.
