This article studies the resolution of references
made by speakers to documents discussed during
a meeting. The focus is on transcribed record-
ings of press review meetings, in French. After
an overview of the required framework for refer-
ence resolution?specification of the task, data an-
notation, and evaluation procedure?we propose,
analyze and evaluate an algorithm for the resolu-
tion of references to documents (ref2doc) based on
anaphora tracking and context matching. Appli-
cations to speech-to-document alignment and more
generally to meeting processing and retrieval are fi-
nally discussed.
