People rarely articulate explicitly what a na-
tive speaker of a language is already assumed
to know. So to acquire the stereotypical
knowledge that underpins much of what is
said in a given culture, one must look to what
is implied by language rather than what is
overtly stated. Similes are a convenient ve-
hicle for this kind of knowledge, insofar as
they mark out the most salient aspects of the
most frequently evoked concepts. In this pa-
per we perform a multilingual exploration of
the space of common-place similes, by min-
ing a large body of Chinese similes from the
web and comparing these to the English sim-
iles harvested by Veale and Hao (2007). We
demonstrate that while the simile-frame is in-
herently leaky in both languages, a multilin-
gual analysis allows us to filter much of the
noise that otherwise hinders the knowledge
extraction process. In doing so, we can also
identify a core set of stereotypical descrip-
tions that exist in both languages and accu-
rately map these descriptions onto a multilin-
gual lexical ontology like HowNet. Finally,
we demonstrate that conceptual descriptions
that are derived from common-place similes
are extremely compact and predictive of onto-
logical structure.
