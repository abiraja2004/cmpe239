Like most natural language disambiguation
tasks, word sense disambiguation (WSD) re-
quires world knowledge for accurate predic-
tions. Several proxies for this knowledge
have been investigated, including labeled cor-
pora, user-contributed knowledge, and ma-
chine readable dictionaries, but each of these
proxies requires significant manual effort to
create, and they do not cover all of the ambigu-
ous terms in a language. We investigate the
task of automatically extracting world knowl-
edge, in the form of glosses, from an unlabeled
corpus. We demonstrate how to use these
glosses to automatically label a training cor-
pus to build a statistical WSD system that uses
no manually-labeled data, with experimental
results approaching that of a supervised SVM-
based classifier.
