 
We believe that language is a complex adaptive 
system that emerges from adaptive interactions 
between language users and continues to evolve 
and adapt through repeated interactions. Our 
research looks at the mechanisms and processes 
involved in such emergence and adaptation. To 
provide a basis for our computer simulations, 
we have implemented an open-ended, extensi- 
ble testbed called Babel which allows rapid con- 
struction of experiments and flexible visualiza- 
tion of results.
