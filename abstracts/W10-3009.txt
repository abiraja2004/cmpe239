RelHunter is a Machine Learning based
method for the extraction of structured in-
formation from text. Here, we apply Rel-
Hunter to the Hedge Detection task, pro-
posed as the CoNLL-2010 Shared Task1.
RelHunter?s key design idea is to model
the target structures as a relation over enti-
ties. The method decomposes the original
task into three subtasks: (i) Entity Iden-
tification; (ii) Candidate Relation Gener-
ation; and (iii) Relation Recognition. In
the Hedge Detection task, we define three
types of entities: cue chunk, start scope
token and end scope token. Hence, the
Entity Identification subtask is further de-
composed into three token classification
subtasks, one for each entity type. In
the Candidate Relation Generation sub-
task, we apply a simple procedure to gen-
erate a ternary candidate relation. Each in-
stance in this relation represents a hedge
candidate composed by a cue chunk, a
start scope token and an end scope to-
ken. For the Relation Recognition sub-
task, we use a binary classifier to discrim-
inate between true and false candidates.
The four classifiers are trained with the
Entropy Guided Transformation Learning
algorithm. When compared to the other
hedge detection systems of the CoNLL
shared task, our scheme shows a competi-
tive performance. The F -score of our sys-
tem is 54.05 on the evaluation corpus.
