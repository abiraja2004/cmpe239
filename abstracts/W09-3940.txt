We hypothesize that monitoring the accu-
racy of the ?feeling of another?s know-
ing? (FOAK) is a useful predictor of tu-
torial dialogue system performance. We
test this hypothesis in the context of a
wizarded spoken dialogue tutoring system,
where student learning is the primary per-
formance metric. We first present our cor-
pus, which has been annotated with re-
spect to student correctness and uncer-
tainty. We then discuss the derivation of
FOAK measures from these annotations,
for use in building predictive performance
models. Our results show that monitoring
the accuracy of FOAK is indeed predictive
of student learning, both in isolation and in
conjunction with other predictors.
