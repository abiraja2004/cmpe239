 
We describe a readability assessment ap-
proach to support the process of text simplifi-
cation for poor literacy readers. Given an in-
put text, the goal is to predict its readability 
level, which corresponds to the literacy level 
that is expected from the target reader: rudi-
mentary, basic or advanced. We complement 
features traditionally used for readability as-
sessment with a number of new features, and 
experiment with alternative ways to model 
this problem using machine learning methods, 
namely classification, regression and ranking. 
The best resulting model is embedded in an 
authoring tool for Text Simplification.
