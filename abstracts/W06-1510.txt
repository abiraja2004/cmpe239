Relative quantifier scope in German de-
pends, in contrast to English, very much
on word order. The scope possibilities of a
quantifier are determined by its surface po-
sition, its base position and the type of the
quantifier. In this paper we propose a mul-
ticomponent analysis for German quanti-
fiers computing the scope of the quantifier,
in particular its minimal nuclear scope, de-
pending on the syntactic configuration it
occurs in.
