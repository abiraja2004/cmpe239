We propose a framework for dependency
parsing based on a combination of dis-
criminative and generative models. We
use a discriminative model to obtain a k-
best list of candidate parses, and subse-
quently rerank those candidates using a
generative model. We show how this ap-
proach allows us to evaluate a variety of
generative models, without needing differ-
ent parser implementations. Moreover, we
present empirical results that show a small
improvement over state-of-the-art depen-
dency parsing of English sentences.
