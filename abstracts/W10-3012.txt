This paper reports experiments for the
CoNLL-2010 shared task on learning to
detect hedges and their scope in natu-
ral language text. We have addressed
the experimental tasks as supervised lin-
ear maximum margin prediction prob-
lems. For sentence level hedge detection
in the biological domain we use an L1-
regularised binary support vector machine,
while for sentence level weasel detection
in the Wikipedia domain, we use an L2-
regularised approach. We model the in-
sentence uncertainty cue and scope de-
tection task as an L2-regularised approxi-
mate maximum margin sequence labelling
problem, using the BIO-encoding. In ad-
dition to surface level features, we use a
variety of linguistic features based on a
functional dependency analysis. A greedy
forward selection strategy is used in ex-
ploring the large set of potential features.
Our official results for Task 1 for the bio-
logical domain are 85.2 F1-score, for the
Wikipedia set 55.4 F1-score. For Task 2,
our official results are 2.1 for the entire
task with a score of 62.5 for cue detec-
tion. After resolving errors and final bugs,
our final results are for Task 1, biologi-
cal: 86.0, Wikipedia: 58.2; Task 2, scopes:
39.6 and cues: 78.5.
