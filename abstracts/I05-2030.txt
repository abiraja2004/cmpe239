This paper addresses the task of extract-
ing opinions from a given document
collection. Assuming that an opinion
can be represented as a tuple ?Subject,
Attribute, Value?, we propose a compu-
tational method to extract such tuples
from texts. In this method, the main
task is decomposed into (a) the pro-
cess of extracting Attribute-Value pairs
from a given text and (b) the process of
judging whether an extracted pair ex-
presses an opinion of the author. We
apply machine-learning techniques to
both subtasks. We also report on the
results of our experiments and discuss
future directions.
