One major aim of research in affective nat-
ural language generation is to be able to
use language intelligently to induce effects
on the emotions of the reader/ hearer. Al-
though varying the content of generated
language (?strategic? choices) might be
expected to change the effect on emotions,
it is not obvious that varying the form of
the language (?tactical? choices) can do
this. Indeed, previous experiments have
been unable to show emotional effects of
tactical variations. Building on what has
been discovered in previous experiments,
we present a new experiment which does
demonstrate such effects. This represents
an important step towards the empirical
evaluation of affective NLG systems.
