In this paper, we present an algorithm for
learning a generative model of natural lan-
guage sentences together with their for-
mal meaning representations with hierarchi-
cal structures. The model is applied to the
task of mapping sentences to hierarchical rep-
resentations of their underlying meaning. We
introduce dynamic programming techniques
for efficient training and decoding. In exper-
iments, we demonstrate that the model, when
coupled with a discriminative reranking tech-
nique, achieves state-of-the-art performance
when tested on two publicly available cor-
pora. The generative model degrades robustly
when presented with instances that are differ-
ent from those seen in training. This allows
a notable improvement in recall compared to
previous models.
