We investigate the semantic relationship be-
tween a noun and its adjectival modifiers.
We introduce a class of probabilistic mod-
els that enable us to to simultaneously cap-
ture both the semantic similarity of nouns
and modifiers, and adjective-noun selectional
preference. Through a combination of novel
and existing evaluations we test the degree to
which adjective-noun relationships can be cat-
egorised. We analyse the effect of lexical con-
text on these relationships, and the efficacy of
the latent semantic representation for disam-
biguating word meaning.
