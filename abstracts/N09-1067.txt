We describe a statistical model over linguis-
tic areas and phylogeny. Our model recov-
ers known areas and identifies a plausible hi-
erarchy of areal features. The use of areas
improves genetic reconstruction of languages
both qualitatively and quantitatively according
to a variety of metrics. We model linguistic
areas by a Pitman-Yor process and linguistic
phylogeny by Kingman?s coalescent.
