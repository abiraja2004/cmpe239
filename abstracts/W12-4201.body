We integrate semantic information at two
stages of the translation process of a state-of-
the-art SMT system. A Word Sense Disam-
biguation (WSD) classifier produces a proba-
bility distribution over the translation candi-
dates of source words which is exploited in
two ways. First, the probabilities serve to
rerank a list of n-best translations produced by
the system. Second, the WSD predictions are
used to build a supplementary language model
for each sentence, aimed to favor translations
that seem more adequate in this specific sen-
tential context. Both approaches lead to sig-
nificant improvements in translation perfor-
mance, highlighting the usefulness of source
side disambiguation for SMT.
