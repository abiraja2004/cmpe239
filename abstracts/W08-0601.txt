In this paper, we propose a graph kernel
based approach for the automated extraction
of protein-protein interactions (PPI) from sci-
entific literature. In contrast to earlier ap-
proaches to PPI extraction, the introduced all-
dependency-paths kernel has the capability
to consider full, general dependency graphs.
We evaluate the proposed method across five
publicly available PPI corpora providing the
most comprehensive evaluation done for a ma-
chine learning based PPI-extraction system.
Our method is shown to achieve state-of-the-
art performance with respect to comparable
evaluations, achieving 56.4 F-score and 84.8
AUC on the AImed corpus. Further, we iden-
tify several pitfalls that can make evaluations
of PPI-extraction systems incomparable, or
even invalid. These include incorrect cross-
validation strategies and problems related to
comparing F-score results achieved on differ-
ent evaluation resources.
