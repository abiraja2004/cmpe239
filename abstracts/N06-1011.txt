Named Entity recognition (NER) is an im-
portant part of many natural language pro-
cessing tasks. Most current approaches
employ machine learning techniques and
require supervised data. However, many
languages lack such resources. This paper
presents an algorithm to automatically dis-
cover Named Entities (NEs) in a resource
free language, given a bilingual corpora
in which it is weakly temporally aligned
with a resource rich language. We ob-
serve that NEs have similar time distribu-
tions across such corpora, and that they
are often transliterated, and develop an al-
gorithm that exploits both iteratively. The
algorithm makes use of a new, frequency
based, metric for time distributions and a
resource free discriminative approach to
transliteration. We evaluate the algorithm
on an English-Russian corpus, and show
high level of NEs discovery in Russian.
