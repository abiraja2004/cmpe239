 
Alignment of phonetic sequences i  a necessary 
step in many applications in computational phonol- 
ogy. After discussing various approaches to pho- 
netic alignment, I present a new algorithm that com- 
bines a number of techniques developed for se- 
quence comparison with a scoring scheme for com- 
puting phonetic similarity on the basis of multival- 
ued features. The algorithm performs better on cog- 
nate alignment, in terms of accuracy and efficiency, 
than other algorithms reported in the literature.
