Semantic Role Labeling annotation task de-
pends on the correct identification of pred-
icates, before identifying arguments and as-
signing them role labels. However, most pred-
icates are not constituted only by a verb: they
constitute Complex Predicates (CPs) not yet
available in a computational lexicon. In order
to create a dictionary of CPs, this study em-
ploys a corpus-based methodology. Searches
are guided by POS tags instead of a limited list
of verbs or nouns, in contrast to similar stud-
ies. Results include (but are not limited to)
light and support verb constructions. These
CPs are classified into idiomatic and less id-
iomatic. This paper presents an in-depth anal-
ysis of this phenomenon, as well as an original
resource containing a set of 773 annotated ex-
pressions. Both constitute an original and rich
contribution for NLP tools in Brazilian Por-
tuguese that perform tasks involving seman-
tics.
