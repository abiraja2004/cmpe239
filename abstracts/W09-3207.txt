Both vector space models and graph ran-
domwalk models can be used to determine
similarity between concepts. Noting that
vectors can be regarded as local views of
a graph, we directly compare vector space
models and graph random walk models on
standard tasks of predicting human simi-
larity ratings, concept categorization, and
semantic priming, varying the size of the
dataset from which vector space and graph
are extracted.
