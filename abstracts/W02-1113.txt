to the elaboration of linguistic resources 
for a versatile Information Extraction 
system. In order to decrease the time 
spent on the elaboration of resources for 
the IE system and guide the end-user in 
a new domain, we suggest to use a 
machine learning system that helps 
defining new templates and associated 
resources. This knowledge is 
automatically derived from the text 
collection, in interaction with a large 
semantic network.
