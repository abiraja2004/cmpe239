This paper studies a strategy for identify-
ing and using multi-word expressions in
Statistical Machine Translation. The per-
formance of the proposed strategy for var-
ious types of multi-word expressions (like
nouns or verbs) is evaluated in terms of
alignment quality as well as translation ac-
curacy. Evaluations are performed by us-
ing real-life data, namely the European
Parliament corpus. Results from trans-
lation tasks from English-to-Spanish and
from Spanish-to-English are presented and
discussed.
