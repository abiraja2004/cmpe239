This paper presents a supervised pronoun
anaphora resolution system based on factorial
hidden Markov models (FHMMs). The ba-
sic idea is that the hidden states of FHMMs
are an explicit short-term memory with an an-
tecedent buffer containing recently described
referents. Thus an observed pronoun can find
its antecedent from the hidden buffer, or in
terms of a generative model, the entries in the
hidden buffer generate the corresponding pro-
nouns. A system implementing this model is
evaluated on the ACE corpus with promising
performance.
