We propose a new language learning model
that learns a syntactic-semantic grammar
from a small number of natural language
strings annotated with their semantics, along
with basic assumptions about natural lan-
guage syntax. We show that the search space
for grammar induction is a complete gram-
mar lattice, which guarantees the uniqueness
of the learned grammar.
