Inspired by previous preprocessing ap-
proaches to SMT, this paper proposes a
novel, probabilistic approach to reordering
which combines the merits of syntax and
phrase-based SMT. Given a source sentence
and its parse tree, our method generates,
by tree operations, an n-best list of re-
ordered inputs, which are then fed to stan-
dard phrase-based decoder to produce the
optimal translation. Experiments show that,
for the NIST MT-05 task of Chinese-to-
English translation, the proposal leads to
BLEU improvement of 1.56%.
