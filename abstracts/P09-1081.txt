We present a graph-based semi-supervised
learning for the question-answering (QA)
task for ranking candidate sentences. Us-
ing textual entailment analysis, we obtain
entailment scores between a natural lan-
guage question posed by the user and the
candidate sentences returned from search
engine. The textual entailment between
two sentences is assessed via features rep-
resenting high-level attributes of the en-
tailment problem such as sentence struc-
ture matching, question-type named-entity
matching based on a question-classifier,
etc. We implement a semi-supervised
learning (SSL) approach to demonstrate
that utilization of more unlabeled data
points can improve the answer-ranking
task of QA. We create a graph for labeled
and unlabeled data using match-scores of
textual entailment features as similarity
weights between data points. We apply
a summarization method on the graph to
make the computations feasible on large
datasets. With a new representation of
graph-based SSL on QA datasets using
only a handful of features, and under lim-
ited amounts of labeled data, we show im-
provement in generalization performance
over state-of-the-art QA models.
