The Prague Czech-English Dependency Tree-
bank (PCEDT) is a new syntactically annotated
Czech-English parallel resource. The Penn
Treebank has been translated to Czech, and its
annotation automatically transformed into de-
pendency annotation scheme. The dependency
annotation of Czech is done from plain text by
automatic procedures. A small subset of cor-
responding Czech and English sentences has
been annotated by humans. We discuss some
of the problems we have experienced during
the automatic transformation between annota-
tion schemes and hint at some of the difficulties
to be tackled by potential guidelines for depen-
dency annotation of English.
