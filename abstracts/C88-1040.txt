 
This paper describes a technique for enabling a speech 
understanding system to deal with sentences for which 
some monosyllabic words are not recognized. Such words 
are supposed to act as mere syntactic markers within the 
system linguistic domain. This result is achieved by com- 
bining a modified caseframe approach to linguistic knowl- 
edge representation with a parsing strategy able to inte- 
grate expectations from the language model and predic- 
tions from words. Experimental results show that the 
proposed technique permits to greatly increase the quota 
of corrupted sentences correctly understandable without 
sensibly decreasing parsing efficiency.
