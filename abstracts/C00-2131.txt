 
In this paper, we describe a system and meth- 
ods for finding structural correspondences from the 
paired dependency structures of a source sentence 
and its translation in a target language. The sys- 
tem we have developed finds word correspondences 
first, then finds phrasal correspon(tences based on 
word correspondences. We have also developed a
GUI system with which a user can check and cor- 
rect tile correspondences retrieved by the system. 
These structural correspondences will be used as 
raw translation I)atterns in a corpus-based transla- 
tion system.
