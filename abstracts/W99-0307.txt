 
We discuss a tagging schema nd a tagging tool for 
labeling the rhetorical structure of texts. We also 
propose a statistical method for measuring agree- 
ment of hierarchical structure annotations and we 
discuss its strengths and weaknesses. The statis- 
tical measure we use suggests that annotators can 
achieve good levels of agreement on the task of 
determining the high-level, rhetorical structure of 
texts. Our empirical experiments also suggest that 
building discourse parsers that incrementally de- 
rive correct rhetorical structures of unrestricted texts 
without applying any form of backtracking is unfea- 
sible.
