In this paper we study a set of prob-
lems that are of considerable importance
to Statistical Machine Translation (SMT)
but which have not been addressed satis-
factorily by the SMT research community.
Over the last decade, a variety of SMT
algorithms have been built and empiri-
cally tested whereas little is known about
the computational complexity of some of
the fundamental problems of SMT. Our
work aims at providing useful insights into
the the computational complexity of those
problems. We prove that while IBM Mod-
els 1-2 are conceptually and computation-
ally simple, computations involving the
higher (and more useful) models are hard.
Since it is unlikely that there exists a poly-
nomial time solution for any of these hard
problems (unless P = NP and P#P =
P), our results highlight and justify the
need for developing polynomial time ap-
proximations for these computations. We
also discuss some practical ways of deal-
ing with complexity.
