We develop a novel generative model of con-
versation that jointly captures both the top-
ical content and the speech act type asso-
ciated with each utterance. Our model ex-
presses both token emission and state tran-
sition probabilities as log-linear functions of
separate components corresponding to topics
and speech acts (and their interactions). We
apply this model to a dataset comprising anno-
tated patient-physician visits and show that the
proposed joint approach outperforms a base-
line univariate model.
