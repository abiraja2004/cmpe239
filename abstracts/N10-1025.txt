Out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words represent an
important source of error in large vocabulary
continuous speech recognition (LVCSR) sys-
tems. These words cause recognition failures,
which propagate through pipeline systems im-
pacting the performance of downstream ap-
plications. The detection of OOV regions in
the output of a LVCSR system is typically ad-
dressed as a binary classification task, where
each region is independently classified using
local information. In this paper, we show that
jointly predicting OOV regions, and includ-
ing contextual information from each region,
leads to substantial improvement in OOV de-
tection. Compared to the state-of-the-art, we
reduce the missed OOV rate from 42.6% to
28.4% at 10% false alarm rate.
