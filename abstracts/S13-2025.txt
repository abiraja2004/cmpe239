In this paper, we describe SemEval-2013 Task
4: the definition, the data, the evaluation and
the results. The task is to capture some of the
meaning of English noun compounds via para-
phrasing. Given a two-word noun compound,
the participating system is asked to produce
an explicitly ranked list of its free-form para-
phrases. The list is automatically compared
and evaluated against a similarly ranked list
of paraphrases proposed by human annota-
tors, recruited and managed through Ama-
zon?s Mechanical Turk. The comparison of
raw paraphrases is sensitive to syntactic and
morphological variation. The ?gold? ranking
is based on the relative popularity of para-
phrases among annotators. To make the rank-
ing more reliable, highly similar paraphrases
are grouped, so as to downplay superficial dif-
ferences in syntax and morphology. Three
systems participated in the task. They all beat
a simple baseline on one of the two evalua-
tion measures, but not on both measures. This
shows that the task is difficult.
