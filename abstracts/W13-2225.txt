This paper describes the University of
Cambridge submission to the Eighth
Workshop on Statistical Machine Transla-
tion. We report results for the Russian-
English translation task. We use mul-
tiple segmentations for the Russian in-
put language. We employ the Hadoop
framework to extract rules. The decoder
is HiFST, a hierarchical phrase-based de-
coder implemented using weighted finite-
state transducers. Lattices are rescored
with a higher order language model and
minimum Bayes-risk objective.
