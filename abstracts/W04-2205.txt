In the framework of projects ChinFaDial and
ERIM we have developed in recent years
several platforms allowing to handle various
aspects of bilingual spoken dialogues on the
web ?mainly, spontaneous speech corpus
collection through distant human interpreting.
Current development of the core ERIM-Interp
and ERIM-Collect platforms now includes
multimodal user interaction, integration of
some machine aids (such as speech turn logs
through speech recognition, or tentatively
speech machine translation, both based on
server-grounded market products), and next,
online aids to speakers and/or interpreters.
First collected data should be made available
on the web in fall 2004 (DistribDial) along
with, as soon as available, a robust version of
the collecting platform, in order to promote
collaborative building, and sharing, of "raw"
unannotated multilingual speech corpora.
A variant of the ERIM environment is to
extend to distant e-training in interpreting,
possibly creating situations which should in
turn, in our view, foster larger-scale data
collection and sharing in open access mode.
