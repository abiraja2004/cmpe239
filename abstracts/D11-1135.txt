We explore unsupervised approaches to rela-
tion extraction between two named entities;
for instance, the semantic bornIn relation be-
tween a person and location entity. Con-
cretely, we propose a series of generative
probabilistic models, broadly similar to topic
models, each which generates a corpus of ob-
served triples of entity mention pairs and the
surface syntactic dependency path between
them. The output of each model is a cluster-
ing of observed relation tuples and their as-
sociated textual expressions to underlying se-
mantic relation types. Our proposed models
exploit entity type constraints within a relation
as well as features on the dependency path be-
tween entity mentions. We examine effective-
ness of our approach via multiple evaluations
and demonstrate 12% error reduction in preci-
sion over a state-of-the-art weakly supervised
baseline.
