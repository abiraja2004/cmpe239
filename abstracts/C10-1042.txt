Surface realisation with grammars inte-
grating flat semantics is known to be NP
complete. In this paper, we present a new
algorithm for surface realisation based on
Feature Based Tree Adjoining Grammar
(FTAG) which draws on the observation
that an FTAG can be translated into a Reg-
ular Tree Grammar describing its deriva-
tion trees. We carry out an extensive test-
ing of several variants of this algorithm
using an automatically produced testsuite
and compare the results obtained with
those obtained using GenI, another FTAG
based surface realiser.
