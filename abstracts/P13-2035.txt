In this paper, we relook at the problem
of pronunciation of English words using
native phone set. Specifically, we in-
vestigate methods of pronouncing English
words using Telugu phoneset in the con-
text of Telugu Text-to-Speech. We com-
pare phone-phone substitution and word-
phone mapping for pronunciation of En-
glish words using Telugu phones. We are
not considering other than native language
phoneset in all our experiments. This dif-
ferentiates our approach from other works
in polyglot speech synthesis.
