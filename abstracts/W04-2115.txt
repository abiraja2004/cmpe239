 
In this paper, we present the current state of 
development of a large-scale lexicon built at 
LabEL1 for Portuguese. We will concentrate on 
multiword expressions (MWE), particularly on 
multiword nouns, (i) illustrating their most relevant 
morphological features, and (ii) pointing out the 
methods and techniques adopted to generate  the 
inflected forms from lemmas. Moreover, we 
describe a corpus-based aproach for the acquisition 
of new multiword nouns, which  led to a 
significant enlargement of the existing lexicon. 
Evaluation results concerning lexical coverage in 
the corpus are also discussed.
