The distortion cost function used in Moses-
style machine translation systems has two
flaws. First, it does not estimate the future
cost of known required moves, thus increas-
ing search errors. Second, all distortion is
penalized linearly, even when appropriate re-
orderings are performed. Because the cost
function does not effectively constrain search,
translation quality decreases at higher dis-
tortion limits, which are often needed when
translating between languages of different ty-
pologies such as Arabic and English. To ad-
dress these problems, we introduce a method
for estimating future linear distortion cost, and
a new discriminative distortion model that pre-
dicts word movement during translation. In
combination, these extensions give a statis-
tically significant improvement over a base-
line distortion parameterization. When we
triple the distortion limit, our model achieves
a +2.32 BLEU average gain over Moses.
