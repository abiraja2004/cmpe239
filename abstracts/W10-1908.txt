Forums and mailing lists dedicated to par-
ticular diseases are increasingly popular
online. Automatically inferring the health
status of a patient can be useful for both
forum users and health researchers who
study patients? online behaviors. In this
paper, we focus on breast cancer forums
and present a method to predict the stage
of patients? cancers from their online dis-
course. We show that what the patients
talk about (content-based features) and
whom they interact with (social network-
based features) provide complementary
cues to predicting cancer stage and can be
leveraged for better prediction. Our meth-
ods are extendable and can be applied to
other tasks of acquiring contextual infor-
mation about online health forum partici-
pants.
