Supervised training procedures for seman-
tic parsers produce high-quality semantic
parsers, but they have difficulty scaling
to large databases because of the sheer
number of logical constants for which
they must see labeled training data. We
present a technique for developing seman-
tic parsers for large databases based on
a reduction to standard supervised train-
ing algorithms, schema matching, and pat-
tern learning. Leveraging techniques from
each of these areas, we develop a semantic
parser for Freebase that is capable of pars-
ing questions with an F1 that improves by
0.42 over a purely-supervised learning al-
gorithm.
