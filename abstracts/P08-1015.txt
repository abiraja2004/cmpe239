 
Grounded language models represent the rela-
tionship between words and the non-linguistic 
context in which they are said.  This paper de-
scribes how they are learned from large cor-
pora of unlabeled video, and are applied to the 
task of automatic speech recognition of sports 
video.  Results show that grounded language 
models improve perplexity and word error 
rate over text based language models, and fur-
ther, support video information retrieval better 
than human generated speech transcriptions.
