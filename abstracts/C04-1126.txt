Some Information Extraction (IE) systems
are limited to extracting events expressed
in a single sentence. It is not clear what ef-
fect this has on the difficulty of the extrac-
tion task. This paper addresses the prob-
lem by comparing a corpus which has been
annotated using two separate schemes: one
which lists all events described in the text
and another listing only those expressed
within a single sentence. It was found that
only 40.6% of the events in the first anno-
tation scheme were fully contained in the
second.
