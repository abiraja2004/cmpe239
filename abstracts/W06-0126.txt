 
We have participated in three open tracks 
of Chinese word segmentation and 
named entity recognition tasks of 
SIGHAN Bakeoff3. We take a 
probabilistic feature based Maximum 
Entropy (ME) model as our basic frame 
to combine multiple sources of 
knowledge. Our named entity recognizer 
achieved the highest F measure for 
MSRA, and word segmenter achieved the 
medium F measure for MSRA. We find 
effective combining of the external 
multi-knowledge is crucial to improve 
performance of word segmentation and 
named entity recognition.
