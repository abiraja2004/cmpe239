As supervised machine learning methods are
increasingly used in language technology, the
need for high-quality annotated language data
becomes imminent. Active learning (AL) is
a means to alleviate the burden of annotation.
This paper addresses the problem of knowing
when to stop the AL process without having
the human annotator make an explicit deci-
sion on the matter. We propose and evaluate
an intrinsic criterion for committee-based AL
of named entity recognizers.
