Today there exist a growing number of
framenet-like resources offering seman-
tic and syntactic phrase specifications that
can be exploited by natural language gen-
eration systems. In this paper we present
on-going work that provides a starting
point for exploiting framenet information
for multilingual natural language genera-
tion. We describe the kind of information
offered by modern computational lexical
resources and discuss how template-based
generation systems can benefit from them.
