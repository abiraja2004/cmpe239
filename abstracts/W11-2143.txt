We present the Carnegie Mellon University
Stat-XFER group submission to the WMT
2011 shared translation task. We built a hy-
brid syntactic MT system for French?English
using the Joshua decoder and an automati-
cally acquired SCFG. New work for this year
includes training data selection and grammar
filtering. Expanded training data selection
significantly increased translation scores and
lowered OOV rates, while results on grammar
filtering were mixed.
