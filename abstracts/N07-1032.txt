In unsupervised learning, where no train-
ing takes place, one simply hopes that
the unsupervised learner will work well
on any unlabeled test collection. How-
ever, when the variability in the data is
large, such hope may be unrealistic; a
tuning of the unsupervised algorithm may
then be necessary in order to perform well
on new test collections. In this paper,
we show how to perform such a tuning
in the context of unsupervised document
clustering, by (i) introducing a degree of
freedom, ?, into two leading information-
theoretic clustering algorithms, through
the use of generalized mutual informa-
tion quantities; and (ii) selecting the value
of ? based on clusterings of similar, but
supervised document collections (cross-
instance tuning). One option is to perform
a tuning that directly minimizes the error
on the supervised data sets; another option
is to use ?strapping? (Eisner and Karakos,
2005), which builds a classifier that learns
to distinguish good from bad clusterings,
and then selects the ? with the best pre-
dicted clustering on the test set. Experi-
ments from the ?20 Newsgroups? corpus
show that, although both techniques im-
prove the performance of the baseline al-
gorithms, ?strapping? is clearly a better
choice for cross-instance tuning.
