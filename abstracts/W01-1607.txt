While researchers have many intuitions
about the differences between human-
computer and human-human interac-
tions, most of these have not previously
been subject to empirical scrutiny. This
work presents some initial experiments
in this direction, with the ultimate goal
being to use what we learn to improve
computer dialogue systems. Working
with data from the air travel domain,
we identified a number of striking dif-
ferences between the human-human and
human-computer interactions.
