We compare two different types of extraction
patterns for automatically deriving semantic
information from text: lexical patterns, built
from words and word class information, and
dependency patterns with syntactic informa-
tion obtained from a full parser. We are partic-
ularly interested in whether the richer linguis-
tic information provided by a parser allows for
a better performance of subsequent informa-
tion extraction work. We evaluate automatic
extraction of hypernym information from text
and conclude that the application of depen-
dency patterns does not lead to substantially
higher precision and recall scores than using
lexical patterns.
