The most difficult task in machine translation is the elimination of  ambiguity in human
languages. A certain word in English as well as Vietnamese often has different  meanings
which depend on their syntactical position in the sentence and the actual context. In order to
solve this ambiguation, formerly, people used to resort to many hand-coded rules.
Nevertheless, manually building these rules  is a time-consuming and exhausting task. So,
we suggest an automatic method to solve the above-mentioned problem by using
semantically tagged corpus. In this paper, we mainly present building a semantically tagged
bilingual corpus to word sense disambiguation (WSD) in English texts. To assign semantic
tags, we have taken advantage of  bilingual texts via word alignments with semantic class
names of LLOCE (Longman Lexicon of Contemporary English). So far, we have built
5,000,000-word bilingual corpus in which 1,000,000 words have been semantically
annotated with the accuracy of 70%. We have evaluated our result of semantic tagging by
comparing with SEMCOR on SUSANNE part of our corpus. This semantically annotated
corpus will be used to extract disambiguation rules automatically by TBL (Transformation-
based Learning) method. These rules will be manually revised  before being applied to the
WSD module in the English-to-Vietnamese Translation (EVT) system.
