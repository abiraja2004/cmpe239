English noun/verb (N/V) pairs (contract,
cement) have undergone complex patterns
of change between 3 stress patterns for
several centuries. We describe a longitu-
dinal dataset of N/V pair pronunciations,
leading to a set of properties to be ac-
counted for by any computational model.
We analyze the dynamics of 5 dynamical
systems models of linguistic populations,
each derived from a model of learning by
individuals. We compare each model?s dy-
namics to a set of properties observed in
the N/V data, and reason about how as-
sumptions about individual learning affect
population-level dynamics.
