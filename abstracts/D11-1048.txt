This paper presents a generative model for
the automatic discovery of relations between
entities in electronic medical records. The
model discovers relation instances and their
types by determining which context tokens ex-
press the relation. Additionally, the valid se-
mantic classes for each type of relation are de-
termined. We show that the model produces
clusters of relation trigger words which bet-
ter correspond with manually annotated re-
lations than several existing clustering tech-
niques. The discovered relations reveal some
of the implicit semantic structure present in
patient records.
