Semantic parsing is the problem of de-
riving a structured meaning representation
from a natural language utterance. Here
we approach it as a straightforward ma-
chine translation task, and demonstrate
that standard machine translation com-
ponents can be adapted into a semantic
parser. In experiments on the multilingual
GeoQuery corpus we find that our parser
is competitive with the state of the art,
and in some cases achieves higher accu-
racy than recently proposed purpose-built
systems. These results support the use of
machine translation methods as an infor-
mative baseline in semantic parsing evalu-
ations, and suggest that research in seman-
tic parsing could benefit from advances in
machine translation.
