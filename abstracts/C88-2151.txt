 
Complex categories are caracteristic of unification grammars as for 
example GPSG \[Shieber86a\]. They are sets of pairs of feature.s and 
values. The unification, which can be applied to two or more 
categories, is the essential operation. 
The papers of \[Shieber85\], \[Barton85\] and \[Ristad86\] deal with the 
influence of complex categories on the efficiency of the parsing 
algorithm. This is one problem from using complex categories, 
another one arises when using a constructive version of GPSG (see 
\[Busemann/Hanensehild88\] in thisvolume). Namely that the appli- 
cation of admissibility conditions, e.g. LP statements and FCRs 1, to 
a local tree t is prevented because particular feature values of eat- 
egories in t are not yet specified, but they will be instantiated later 
somewhere else in the complete tree. Similar problems are described 
? in \[Karttunen86\] for D-PATR. 
This work describes the latter problem and will present a solution 
working with computation, evaluation and propagation of 
constraints within local trees (depth 1). The constraint evaluation 
will reject local trees if the constraints of the subtrees of the 
daughters are violated.
