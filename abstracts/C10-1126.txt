Syntax based reordering has been shown
to be an effective way of handling word
order differences between source and
target languages in Statistical Machine
Translation (SMT) systems. We present
a simple, automatic method to learn rules
that reorder source sentences to more
closely match the target language word or-
der using only a source side parse tree and
automatically generated alignments. The
resulting rules are applied to source lan-
guage inputs as a pre-processing step and
demonstrate significant improvements in
SMT systems across a variety of lan-
guages pairs including English to Hindi,
English to Spanish and English to French
as measured on a variety of internal test
sets as well as a public test set.
