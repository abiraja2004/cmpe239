 
This paper proposes a novel approach that uti-
lizes a machine learning method to improve 
pivot-based statistical machine translation 
(SMT). For language pairs with few bilingual 
data, a possible solution in pivot-based SMT 
using another language as a "bridge" to gen-
erate source-target translation. However, one 
of the weaknesses is that some useful source-
target translations cannot be generated if the 
corresponding source phrase and target phrase 
connect to different pivot phrases. To allevi-
ate the problem, we utilize Markov random 
walks to connect possible translation phrases 
between source and target language. Experi-
mental results on European Parliament data, 
spoken language data and web data show that 
our method leads to significant improvements 
on all the tasks over the baseline system.
