This paper deals with the problem
of recognizing and extracting acronym-
definition pairs in Swedish medical texts.
This project applies a rule-based method
to solve the acronym recognition task and
compares and evaluates the results of dif-
ferent machine learning algorithms on the
same task. The method proposed is based
on the approach that acronym-definition
pairs follow a set of patterns and other
regularities that can be usefully applied
for the acronym identification task. Su-
pervised machine learning was applied to
monitor the performance of the rule-based
method, using Memory Based Learning
(MBL). The rule-based algorithm was
evaluated on a hand tagged acronym cor-
pus and performance was measured using
standard measures recall, precision and f-
score. The results show that performance
could further improve by increasing the
training set and modifying the input set-
tings for the machine learning algorithms.
An analysis of the errors produced indi-
cates that further improvement of the rule-
based method requires the use of syntactic
information and textual pre-processing.
