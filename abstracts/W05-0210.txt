  
This paper proposes the automatic generation 
of Fill-in-the-Blank Questions (FBQs) together 
with testing based on Item Response Theory 
(IRT) to measure English proficiency. First, the 
proposal generates an FBQ from a given sen-
tence in English. The position of a blank in the 
sentence is determined, and the word at that 
position is considered as the correct choice. 
The candidates for incorrect choices for the 
blank are hypothesized through a thesaurus. 
Then, each of the candidates is verified by us-
ing the Web. Finally, the blanked sentence, the 
correct choice and the incorrect choices surviv-
ing the verification are together laid out to 
form the FBQ. Second, the proficiency of non-
native speakers who took the test consisting of 
such FBQs is estimated through IRT.  
Our experimental results suggest that: 
(1) the generated questions plus IRT estimate 
the non-native speakers? English proficiency; 
(2) while on the other hand, the test can be 
completed almost perfectly by English native 
speakers; and (3) the number of questions can 
be reduced by using item information in IRT.  
The proposed method provides teach-
ers and testers with a tool that reduces time 
and expenditure for testing English profi-
ciency.
