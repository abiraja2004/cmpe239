This paper describes a hybrid system for WSD, pre-
sented to the English all-words and lexical-sample
tasks, that relies on two different unsupervised ap-
proaches. The first one selects the senses according
to mutual information proximity between a context
word a variant of the sense. The second heuristic
analyzes the examples of use in the glosses of the
senses so that simple syntactic patterns are inferred.
This patterns are matched against the disambigua-
tion contexts. We show that the first heuristic ob-
tains a precision and recall of .58 and .35 respec-
tively in the all words task while the second obtains
.80 and .25. The high precision obtained recom-
mends deeper research of the techniques. Results
for the lexical sample task are also provided.
