Recently, various synchronous grammars
are proposed for syntax-based machine
translation, e.g. synchronous context-free
grammar and synchronous tree (sequence)
substitution grammar, either purely for-
mal or linguistically motivated. Aim-
ing at combining the strengths of differ-
ent grammars, we describes a synthetic
synchronous grammar (SSG), which ten-
tatively in this paper, integrates a syn-
chronous context-free grammar (SCFG)
and a synchronous tree sequence substitu-
tion grammar (STSSG) for statistical ma-
chine translation. The experimental re-
sults on NIST MT05 Chinese-to-English
test set show that the SSG based transla-
tion system achieves significant improve-
ment over three baseline systems.
