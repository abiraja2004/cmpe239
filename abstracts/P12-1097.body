In this work, we introduce the TESLA-
CELAB metric (Translation Evaluation of
Sentences with Linear-programming-based
Analysis ? Character-level Evaluation for
Languages with Ambiguous word Bound-
aries) for automatic machine translation eval-
uation. For languages such as Chinese where
words usually have meaningful internal struc-
ture and word boundaries are often fuzzy,
TESLA-CELAB acknowledges the advantage
of character-level evaluation over word-level
evaluation. By reformulating the problem in
the linear programming framework, TESLA-
CELAB addresses several drawbacks of the
character-level metrics, in particular the mod-
eling of synonyms spanning multiple char-
acters. We show empirically that TESLA-
CELAB significantly outperforms character-
level BLEU in the English-Chinese translation
evaluation tasks.
