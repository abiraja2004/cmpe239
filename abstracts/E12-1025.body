Translation needs have greatly increased
during the last years. In many situa-
tions, text to be translated constitutes an
unbounded stream of data that grows con-
tinually with time. An effective approach
to translate text documents is to follow
an interactive-predictive paradigm in which
both the system is guided by the user
and the user is assisted by the system to
generate error-free translations. Unfortu-
nately, when processing such unbounded
data streams even this approach requires an
overwhelming amount of manpower. Is in
this scenario where the use of active learn-
ing techniques is compelling. In this work,
we propose different active learning tech-
niques for interactive machine translation.
Results show that for a given translation
quality the use of active learning allows us
to greatly reduce the human effort required
to translate the sentences in the stream.
