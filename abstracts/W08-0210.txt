This paper describes a Computational Lin-
guistics course designed for Linguistics stu-
dents. The course is structured around the ar-
chitecture of a Spoken Dialogue System and
makes extensive use of the dialogue system
tools and examples available in the Regu-
lus Open Source Project. Although only a
quarter long course, students learn Computa-
tional Linguistics and programming sufficient
to build their own Spoken Dialogue System as
a course project.
