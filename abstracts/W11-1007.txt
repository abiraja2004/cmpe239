In this paper we propose several novel ap-
proaches to improve phrase reordering for
statistical machine translation in the frame-
work of maximum-entropy-based modeling.
A smoothed prior probability is introduced to
take into account the distortion effect in the
priors. In addition to that we propose multi-
ple novel distortion features based on syntac-
tic parsing. A new metric is also introduced to
measure the effect of distortion in the transla-
tion hypotheses. We show that both smoothed
priors and syntax-based features help to sig-
nificantly improve the reordering and hence
the translation performance on a large-scale
Chinese-to-English machine translation task.
