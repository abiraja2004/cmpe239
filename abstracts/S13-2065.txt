This paper describes our approach to the
SemEval-2013 task on ?Sentiment Analysis
in Twitter?. We use simple bag-of-words mod-
els, a freely available sentiment dictionary auto-
matically extended with distributionally similar
terms, as well as lists of emoticons and inter-
net slang abbreviations in conjunction with fast
and robust machine learning algorithms. The
resulting system is resource-lean, making it rel-
atively independent of a specific language. De-
spite its simplicity, the system achieves compet-
itive accuracies of 0.70?0.72 in detecting the
sentiment of text messages. We also apply our
approach to the task of detecting the context-
dependent sentiment of individual words and
phrases within a message.
