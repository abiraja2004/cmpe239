We present a hybrid natural language gen-
eration (NLG) system that consolidates
macro and micro planning and surface re-
alization tasks into one statistical learn-
ing process. Our novel approach is based
on deriving a template bank automatically
from a corpus of texts from a target do-
main. First, we identify domain specific
entity tags and Discourse Representation
Structures on a per sentence basis. Each
sentence is then organized into semanti-
cally similar groups (representing a do-
main specific concept) by k-means cluster-
ing. After this semi-automatic processing
(human review of cluster assignments), a
number of corpus?level statistics are com-
piled and used as features by a ranking
SVM to develop model weights from a
training corpus. At generation time, a set
of input data, the collection of semanti-
cally organized templates, and the model
weights are used to select optimal tem-
plates. Our system is evaluated with au-
tomatic, non?expert crowdsourced and ex-
pert evaluation metrics. We also introduce
a novel automatic metric ? syntactic vari-
ability ? that represents linguistic variation
as a measure of unique template sequences
across a collection of automatically gener-
ated documents. The metrics for generated
weather and biography texts fall within ac-
ceptable ranges. In sum, we argue that our
statistical approach to NLG reduces the
need for complicated knowledge-based ar-
chitectures and readily adapts to different
domains with reduced development time.
