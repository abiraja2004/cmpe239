multilingual question answering system on 
multiple relational databases. We apply 
semantic category and pattern-based 
grammars, into natural language interfaces to 
relational databases. Lexico-semantic pattern 
(LSP) and multi-level grammars achieve 
portability of languages, domains, and 
DBMSs. The LSP-based linguistic 
processing does not require deep analysis 
that sacrifices robustness and flexibility, but 
can handle delicate natural language 
questions. To maximize portability, we drive 
various dependent parts into two tight 
corners, i.e., language-dependent part into 
front linguistic analysis, and 
domain-dependent and database-dependent 
parts into backend SQL query generation. 
Experiments with 779 queries generate only 
constraint-missing errors, which can be 
easily corrected by adding new terms, of 
2.25% for English and 5.67% for Korean.
