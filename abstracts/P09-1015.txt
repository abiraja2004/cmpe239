Letter-to-phoneme (L2P) conversion is the
process of producing a correct phoneme
sequence for a word, given its letters. It
is often desirable to reduce the quantity of
training data ? and hence human anno-
tation ? that is needed to train an L2P
classifier for a new language. In this pa-
per, we confront the challenge of building
an accurate L2P classifier with a minimal
amount of training data by combining sev-
eral diverse techniques: context ordering,
letter clustering, active learning, and pho-
netic L2P alignment. Experiments on six
languages show up to 75% reduction in an-
notation effort.
