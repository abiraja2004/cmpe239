In this paper we present a na??ve approach
to tackle the problem of cross-lingual
WSD and cross-lingual lexical substitu-
tion which correspond to the Task #2 and
#3 of the SemEval-2 competition. We used
a bilingual statistical dictionary, which is
calculated with Giza++ by using the EU-
ROPARL parallel corpus, in order to cal-
culate the probability of a source word to
be translated to a target word (which is as-
sumed to be the correct sense of the source
word but in a different language). Two ver-
sions of the probabilistic model are tested:
unweighted and weighted. The obtained
values show that the unweighted version
performs better thant the weighted one.
