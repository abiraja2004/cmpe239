We present a system for automatically iden-
tifying the native language of a writer. We
experiment with a large set of features and
train them on a corpus of 9,900 essays writ-
ten in English by speakers of 11 different lan-
guages. our system achieved an accuracy of
43% on the test data, improved to 63% with
improved feature normalization. In this paper,
we present the features used in our system, de-
scribe our experiments and provide an analysis
of our results.
