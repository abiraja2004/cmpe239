Unknown words are a hindrance to the perfor-
mance of hand-crafted computational gram-
mars of natural language. However, words
with incomplete and incorrect lexical entries
pose an even bigger problem because they can
be the cause of a parsing failure despite being
listed in the lexicon of the grammar. Such lex-
ical entries are hard to detect and even harder
to correct.
We employ an error miner to pinpoint words
with problematic lexical entries. An auto-
mated lexical acquisition technique is then
used to learn new entries for those words
which allows the grammar to parse previously
uncovered sentences successfully.
We test our method on a large-scale grammar
of Dutch and a set of sentences for which this
grammar fails to produce a parse. The appli-
cation of the method enables the grammar to
cover 83.76% of those sentences with an ac-
curacy of 86.15%.
