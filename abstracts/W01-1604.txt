  
Since van der Sandt and Geurts have put 
forward and extensively applied the notion 
of a fundamental identity of presupposition 
and anaphora, something like a universal 
consensus seems to have developed that this 
view is basically correct. Supposing that it 
is, and further supposing that it entails an 
empirical hypothesis, there are a number of 
facts that have so far remained unaccounted 
for. This paper presents some of these facts 
and argues that more differentiated notions 
of anaphora and presupposition may well be 
more fruitful for further research in the 
semantics-pragmatics interface.
