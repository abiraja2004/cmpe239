In this paper, we explore the utility of
intra- and inter-sentential causal relations
between terms or clauses as evidence for
answering why-questions. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first work that
uses both intra- and inter-sentential causal
relations for why-QA. We also propose
a method for assessing the appropriate-
ness of causal relations as answers to a
given question using the semantic orienta-
tion of excitation proposed by Hashimoto
et al (2012). By applying these ideas
to Japanese why-QA, we improved preci-
sion by 4.4% against all the questions in
our test set over the current state-of-the-
art system for Japanese why-QA. In addi-
tion, unlike the state-of-the-art system, our
system could achieve very high precision
(83.2%) for 25% of all the questions in the
test set by restricting its output to the con-
fident answers only.
