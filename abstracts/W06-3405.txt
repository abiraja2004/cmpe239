We investigated automatic action item
detection from transcripts of multi-party
meetings. Unlike previous work (Gruen-
stein et al, 2005), we use a new hierarchi-
cal annotation scheme based on the roles
utterances play in the action item assign-
ment process, and propose an approach
to automatic detection that promises im-
proved classification accuracy while en-
abling the extraction of useful information
for summarization and reporting.
