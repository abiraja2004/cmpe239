To date, there are no fully automated systems
addressing the community?s need for funda-
mental language processing tools for Arabic
text. In this paper, we present a Support Vector
Machine (SVM) based approach to automati-
cally tokenize (segmenting off clitics), part-of-
speech (POS) tag and annotate base phrases
(BPs) in Arabic text. We adapt highly accu-
rate tools that have been developed for En-
glish text and apply them to Arabic text. Using
standard evaluation metrics, we report that the
SVM-TOK tokenizer achieves an

score
of 99.12, the SVM-POS tagger achieves an ac-
curacy of 95.49%, and the SVM-BP chunker
yields an


score of 92.08.
