A ? large ? number ? of ? computational ? language?
learners?have?been?proposed?for?modelling?the?
process ?of?child?language?acquisition. ? ?Com?
paring?them,?however,?can?be?difficult?due?to?
the?different ?assumptions?that? they?make,? the?
diverse?test?results?presented,?and?the?different?
linguistic?behaviours?investigated.? ?This?paper?
introduces ?a? toolkit ? that ?allows?different ? lan?
guage? learners ? to ?be? trained, ? tested?and ?ana?

and ?with? typical ?child ? language?development?
to?highlight?the?relative?advantages?and?disad?
