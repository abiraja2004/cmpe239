 
Grammar-based approaches to spoken lan-
guage understanding are utilized to a great ex-
tent in industry, particularly when developers 
are confronted with data sparsity. In order to 
ensure wide grammar coverage, developers 
typically modify their grammars in an itera-
tive process of deploying the application, col-
lecting and transcribing user utterances, and 
adjusting the grammar. In this paper, we ex-
plore enhancing this iterative process by leve-
raging active learning with back-off 
grammars. Because the back-off grammars 
expand coverage of user utterances, develop-
ers have a safety net for deploying applica-
tions earlier. Furthermore, the statistics related 
to the back-off can be used for active learning, 
thus reducing the effort and cost of data tran-
scription. In experiments conducted on a 
commercially deployed application, the ap-
proach achieved levels of semantic accuracy 
comparable to transcribing all failed utter-
ances with 87% less transcriptions.
