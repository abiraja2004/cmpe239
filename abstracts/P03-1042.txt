 
This paper proposes the use of uncertainty 
reduction in machine learning methods 
such as co-training and bilingual boot-
strapping, which are referred to, in a gen-
eral term, as ?collaborative bootstrapping?. 
The paper indicates that uncertainty re-
duction is an important factor for enhanc-
ing the performance of collaborative 
bootstrapping. It proposes a new measure 
for representing the degree of uncertainty 
correlation of the two classifiers in col-
laborative bootstrapping and uses the 
measure in analysis of collaborative boot-
strapping. Furthermore, it proposes a new 
algorithm of collaborative bootstrapping 
on the basis of uncertainty reduction. Ex-
perimental results have verified the cor-
rectness of the analysis and have 
demonstrated the significance of the new 
algorithm.
