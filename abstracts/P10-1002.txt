In this paper we describe an intuitionistic
method for dependency parsing, where a
classifier is used to determine whether a
pair of words forms a dependency edge.
And we also propose an effective strategy
for dependency projection, where the de-
pendency relationships of the word pairs
in the source language are projected to the
word pairs of the target language, leading
to a set of classification instances rather
than a complete tree. Experiments show
that, the classifier trained on the projected
classification instances significantly out-
performs previous projected dependency
parsers. More importantly, when this clas-
sifier is integrated into a maximum span-
ning tree (MST) dependency parser, ob-
vious improvement is obtained over the
MST baseline.
