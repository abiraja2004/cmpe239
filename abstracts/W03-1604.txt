We present a Question Answering system
for technical domains which makes an in-
telligent use of paraphrases to increase the
likelihood of finding the answer to the user?s
question. The system implements a simple
and efficient logic representation of ques-
tions and answers that maps paraphrases
to the same underlying semantic represen-
tation. Further, paraphrases of technical
terminology are dealt with by a separate
process that detects surface variants.
