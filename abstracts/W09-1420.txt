Our paper presents the comparison of a
machine-learnt and a manually constructed
expert-rule-based biological event extraction
system and some preliminary experiments to
apply a negation and speculation detection
system to further classify the extracted events.
We report results on the BioNLP?09 Shared
Task on Event Extraction evaluation datasets,
and also on an external dataset for negation
and speculation detection.
