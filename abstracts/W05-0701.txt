We explore the application of memory-
based learning to morphological analy-
sis and part-of-speech tagging of written
Arabic, based on data from the Arabic
Treebank. Morphological analysis ? the
construction of all possible analyses of
isolated unvoweled wordforms ? is per-
formed as a letter-by-letter operation pre-
diction task, where the operation encodes
segmentation, part-of-speech, character
changes, and vocalization. Part-of-speech
tagging is carried out by a bi-modular tag-
ger that has a subtagger for known words
and one for unknown words. We report on
the performance of the morphological an-
alyzer and part-of-speech tagger. We ob-
serve that the tagger, which has an accu-
racy of 91.9% on new data, can be used to
select the appropriate morphological anal-
ysis of words in context at a precision of
64.0 and a recall of 89.7.
