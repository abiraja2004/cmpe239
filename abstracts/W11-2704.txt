Currently there is little agreement about, or
even discussion of, methodologies for task-
based evaluation of NLG systems. I discuss
one specific issue in this area, namely the im-
portance of control vs the importance of eco-
logical validity (real-world context), and sug-
gest that perhaps we need to put more empha-
sis on ecological validity in NLG evaluations.
