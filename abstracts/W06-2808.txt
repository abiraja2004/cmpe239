 
The problem in processing Chinese chat 
text originates from the anomalous char-
acteristics and dynamic nature of such a 
text genre. That is, it uses ill-edited terms 
and anomalous writing styles in chat text, 
and the anomaly is created and discarded 
very quickly. To handle this problem, 
one solution is to re-train the recognizer 
periodically. This costs a lot of man-
power in producing the timely chat text 
corpus. The new approaches are pro-
posed in this paper to detect the anomaly 
within dynamic Chinese chat text by in-
corporating standard Chinese corpora and 
chat corpus. We first model standard lan-
guage text using standard Chinese cor-
pora and apply these models to detect 
anomalous chat text. To improve detec-
tion quality, we construct anomalous chat 
language model using one static chat text 
corpus and incorporate this model into 
the standard language models. Our ap-
proaches calculate confidence and en-
tropy for the input text and apply thresh-
old values to help make the decisions. 
The experiments prove that performance 
equivalent to the best ones produced by 
the approaches in existence can be 
achieved stably with our approaches.
