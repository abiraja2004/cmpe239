 
Unlike many well established approaches for 
E-Learning on science fields, there isn?t a 
commonly accepted approach of E-Learning 
on humanities fields, especially language and 
literature. Because the knowledge on language 
and literature depends too much on texts, 
advanced text processing has become a 
bottleneck for E-Learning on these domains. 
In traditional learning frameworks learners 
would easily get boring with mass pure texts. 
This article introduces a new approach for E-
Learning on language and literature, by 
intelligently extracting real or virtual objects 
from texts and integrating them as exhibitions 
in a digital museum system. This article also 
discussed how to generate exhibitions from 
texts with computational linguistics methods 
as well as how this E-Learning framework 
pushes the research of computational 
linguistics. The discussion of E-Learning by 
Digital Museum is based on the design of 
Digital Museum of Chinese Ancient Poetry, 
by Peking University.
