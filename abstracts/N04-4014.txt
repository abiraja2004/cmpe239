 
In this paper we describe the analytic question 
answering system HITIQA (High-Quality In-
teractive Question Answering) which has been 
developed over the last 2 years as an advanced 
research tool for information analysts. 
HITIQA is an interactive open-domain ques-
tion answering technology designed to allow 
analysts to pose complex exploratory ques-
tions in natural language and obtain relevant 
information units to prepare their briefing re-
ports. The system uses novel data-driven se-
mantics to conduct a clarification dialogue 
with the user that explores the scope and the 
context of the desired answer space. The sys-
tem has undergone extensive hands-on evalua-
tions by a group of intelligence analysts repre-
senting various foreign intelligence services.  
This evaluation validated the overall approach 
in HITIQA but also exposed limitations of the 
current prototype.
