 
In this paper we propose a new approach 
based on Sequence Segmentation Models 
(SSM) to the extractive document summa-
rization, in which summarizing is regarded 
as a segment labeling problem. Comparing 
with the previous work, the difference of 
our approach is that the employed features 
are obtained not only from the sentence 
level, but also from the segment level. In 
our approach, the semi-Markov CRF model 
is employed for segment labeling. The pre-
liminary experiments have shown that the 
approach does outperform all other tradi-
tional supervised and unsupervised ap-
proaches to document summarization.
