We improve the quality of paraphrases ex-
tracted from parallel corpora by requiring that
phrases and their paraphrases be the same syn-
tactic type. This is achieved by parsing the En-
glish side of a parallel corpus and altering the
phrase extraction algorithm to extract phrase
labels alongside bilingual phrase pairs. In or-
der to retain broad coverage of non-constituent
phrases, complex syntactic labels are intro-
duced. A manual evaluation indicates a 19%
absolute improvement in paraphrase quality
over the baseline method.
