In this paper, we investigate the problem of en-
tity identification and relation extraction from en-
cyclopedia articles, and we propose a joint discrim-
inative probabilistic model with arbitrary graphical
structure to optimize all relevant subtasks simulta-
neously. This modeling offers a natural formalism
for exploiting rich dependencies and interactions
between relevant subtasks to capture mutual ben-
efits, as well as a great flexibility to incorporate a
large collection of arbitrary, overlapping and non-
independent features. We show the parameter es-
timation algorithm of this model. Moreover, we
propose a new inference method, namely collec-
tive iterative classification (CIC), to find the most
likely assignments for both entities and relations.
We evaluate our model on real-world data from
Wikipedia for this task, and compare with current
state-of-the-art pipeline and joint models, demon-
strating the effectiveness and feasibility of our ap-
proach.
