This paper presents pilot work integrating ma-
chine labeling and active learning with human
annotation of data for the language documen-
tation task of creating interlinearized gloss
text (IGT) for the Mayan language Uspanteko.
The practical goal is to produce a totally an-
notated corpus that is as accurate as possible
given limited time for manual annotation. We
describe ongoing pilot studies which examine
the influence of three main factors on reduc-
ing the time spent to annotate IGT: sugges-
tions from a machine labeler, sample selection
methods, and annotator expertise.
