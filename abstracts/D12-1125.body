We present an automatic method for mapping
language-specific part-of-speech tags to a set
of universal tags. This unified representation
plays a crucial role in cross-lingual syntactic
transfer of multilingual dependency parsers.
Until now, however, such conversion schemes
have been created manually. Our central hy-
pothesis is that a valid mapping yields POS
annotations with coherent linguistic proper-
ties which are consistent across source and
target languages. We encode this intuition
in an objective function that captures a range
of distributional and typological characteris-
tics of the derived mapping. Given the ex-
ponential size of the mapping space, we pro-
pose a novel method for optimizing over soft
mappings, and use entropy regularization to
drive those towards hard mappings. Our re-
sults demonstrate that automatically induced
mappings rival the quality of their manually
designed counterparts when evaluated in the
context of multilingual parsing.1
