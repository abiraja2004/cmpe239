In this paper, we report on a set of ini-
tial results for English-to-Arabic Statistical
Machine Translation (SMT). We show that
morphological decomposition of the Arabic
source is beneficial, especially for smaller-size
corpora, and investigate different recombina-
tion techniques. We also report on the use
of Factored Translation Models for English-
to-Arabic translation.
