 
We present an evaluation framework in 
which the effectiveness of evaluative 
arguments can be measured with real users. 
The framework is based on the task-efficacy 
evaluation method. An evaluative argument 
is presented in the context of a decision task 
and measures related to its effectiveness are 
assessed. Within this framework, we are 
currently running a formal experiment o 
verify whether argument effectiveness can 
be increased by tailoring the argument to the 
user and by varying the degree of argument 
conciseness.
