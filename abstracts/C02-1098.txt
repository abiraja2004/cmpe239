This paper presents techniques for multimedia
annotation and their application to video sum-
marization and translation. Our tool for anno-
tation allows users to easily create annotation
including voice transcripts, video scene descrip-
tions, and visual/auditory object descriptions.
The module for voice transcription is capable
of multilingual spoken language identification
and recognition. A video scene description con-
sists of semi-automatically detected keyframes
of each scene in a video clip and time codes of
scenes. A visual object description is created
by tracking and interactive naming of people
and objects in video scenes. The text data in
the multimedia annotation are syntactically and
semantically structured using linguistic annota-
tion. The proposed multimedia summarization
works upon a multimodal document that con-
sists of a video, keyframes of scenes, and tran-
scripts of the scenes. The multimedia transla-
tion automatically generates several versions of
multimedia content in different languages.
