Despite its substantial coverage, Nom-
Bank does not account for all within-
sentence arguments and ignores extra-
sentential arguments altogether. These ar-
guments, which we call implicit, are im-
portant to semantic processing, and their
recovery could potentially benefit many
NLP applications. We present a study of
implicit arguments for a select group of
frequent nominal predicates. We show that
implicit arguments are pervasive for these
predicates, adding 65% to the coverage of
NomBank. We demonstrate the feasibil-
ity of recovering implicit arguments with
a supervised classification model. Our re-
sults and analyses provide a baseline for
future work on this emerging task.
