We describe the implementation of
reranking models for fine-grained opinion
analysis ? marking up opinion expres-
sions and extracting opinion holders. The
reranking approach makes it possible
to model complex relations between
multiple opinions in a sentence, allowing
us to represent how opinions interact
through the syntactic and semantic
structure. We carried out evaluations on
the MPQA corpus, and the experiments
showed significant improvements over a
conventional system that only uses local
information: for both tasks, our system
saw recall boosts of over 10 points.
