LangLog, a system performing Search Log
Analysis. LangLog illustrates how NLP
technologies can be a powerful support
tool for market research even when the
source of information is a collection of
queries each one consisting of few words.
We push the standard Search Log Analysis
forward taking into account the semantics
of the queries. The main innovation of
LangLog is the implementation of two
highly customizable components that
cluster and classify the queries in the log.
