We present an approach for semantic rela-
tion extraction between nominals that com-
bines shallow and deep syntactic processing
and semantic information using kernel meth-
ods. Two information sources are consid-
ered: (i) the whole sentence where the re-
lation appears, and (ii) WordNet synsets and
hypernymy relations of the candidate nom-
inals. Each source of information is rep-
resented by kernel functions. In particu-
lar, five basic kernel functions are linearly
combined and weighted under different con-
ditions. The experiments were carried out
using support vector machines as classifier.
The system achieves an overall F1 of 71.8%
on the Classification of Semantic Relations
between Nominals task at SemEval-2007.
