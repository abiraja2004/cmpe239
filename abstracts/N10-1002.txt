In this paper, we present an innovative chart
mining technique for improving parse cover-
age based on partial parse outputs from preci-
sion grammars. The general approach of min-
ing features from partial analyses is applica-
ble to a range of lexical acquisition tasks, and
is particularly suited to domain-specific lexi-
cal tuning and lexical acquisition using low-
coverage grammars. As an illustration of the
functionality of our proposed technique, we
develop a lexical acquisition model for En-
glish verb particle constructions which oper-
ates over unlexicalised features mined from
a partial parsing chart. The proposed tech-
nique is shown to outperform a state-of-the-art
parser over the target task, despite being based
on relatively simplistic features.
