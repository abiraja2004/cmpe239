The BABYTALK BT-45 system generates tex-
tual summaries of clinical data about babies in
a neonatal intensive care unit. A recent task-
based evaluation of the system suggested that
these summaries are useful, but not as effec-
tive as they could be. In this paper we present
a qualitative analysis of problems that the
evaluation highlighted in BT-45 texts. Many
of these problems are due to the fact that BT-
45 does not generate good narrative texts; this
is a topic which has not previously received
much attention from the NLG research com-
munity, but seems to be quite important for
creating good data-to-text systems.
