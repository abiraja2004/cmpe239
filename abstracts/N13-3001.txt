Automatic interpretation of documents is
hampered by the fact that language contains
terms which have multiple meanings. These
ambiguities can still be found when language
is restricted to a particular domain, such as
biomedicine. Word Sense Disambiguation
(WSD) systems attempt to resolve these am-
biguities but are often only able to identify the
meanings for a small set of ambiguous terms.
DALE (Disambiguation using Automatically
Labeled Examples) is a supervised WSD sys-
tem that can disambiguate a wide range of
ambiguities found in biomedical documents.
DALE uses the UMLS Metathesaurus as both
a sense inventory and as a source of infor-
mation for automatically generating labeled
training examples. DALE is able to disam-
biguate biomedical documents with the cover-
age of unsupervised approaches and accuracy
of supervised methods.
