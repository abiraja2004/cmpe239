Existing studies show that a weighted
context-free transduction of reasonable
quality can be effectively learned from
examples. This paper investigates the
approximation of such transduction by
means of weighted rational transduc-
tion. The advantage is increased pro-
cessing speed, which benefits real-
time applications involving spoken lan-
guage.
