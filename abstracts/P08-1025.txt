We take a multi-pass approach to ma-
chine translation decoding when using syn-
chronous context-free grammars as the trans-
lation model and n-gram language models:
the first pass uses a bigram language model,
and the resulting parse forest is used in the
second pass to guide search with a trigram lan-
guage model. The trigram pass closes most
of the performance gap between a bigram de-
coder and a much slower trigram decoder, but
takes time that is insignificant in comparison
to the bigram pass. An additional fast de-
coding pass maximizing the expected count
of correct translation hypotheses increases the
BLEU score significantly.
