This paper investigates bootstrapping for statis-
tical parsers to reduce their reliance on manu-
ally annotated training data. We consider both
a mostly-unsupervised approach, co-training,
in which two parsers are iteratively re-trained
on each other?s output; and a semi-supervised
approach, corrected co-training, in which a
human corrects each parser?s output before
adding it to the training data. The selection of
labeled training examples is an integral part of
both frameworks. We propose several selection
methods based on the criteria of minimizing er-
rors in the data and maximizing training util-
ity. We show that incorporating the utility cri-
terion into the selection method results in better
parsers for both frameworks.
