 
Systems now exist which are able to con:pile 
unification gralmnars into language models that 
can be included in a speech recognizer, but it 
is so far unclear whether non-trivial linguisti- 
cally principled gralnlnars can be used for this 
purpose. We describe a series of experiments 
which investigate the question empirica.lly, by 
incrementally constructing a grammar and dis- 
covering what prot)lems emerge when succes- 
sively larger versions are compiled into finite 
state graph representations and used as lan- 
guage models for a medium-vocabulary recog- 
nition task.
