We present the results of several machine learning tasks that exploit explicit spatial language
to classify rhetorical relations and the spatial information of narrative events. Three corpora are
annotated with figure and ground (granularity) relationships, mereotopologically classified verbs
and prepositions, and frames of reference. For rhetorical relations, Na??ve Bayesian models achieve
84.90% and 57.87% accuracy in classifying NARRATION and BACKGROUND / ELABORATION re-
lations respectively (16% and 23% above baseline). For the spatial information of narrative events,
K* models achieve 55.68% average accuracy (12% above baseline) for all spatial information types.
This result is boosted to 71.85% (28% above baseline) when inertial spatial reference and text se-
quence information are considered. Overall, spatial information is shown to be central to narrative
discourse structure and prediction tasks.
