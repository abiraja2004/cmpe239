This paper proposes a new method for ap-
proximate string search, specifically candidate
generation in spelling error correction, which
is a task as follows. Given a misspelled word,
the system finds words in a dictionary, which
are most ?similar? to the misspelled word.
The paper proposes a probabilistic approach to
the task, which is both accurate and efficient.
The approach includes the use of a log linear
model, a method for training the model, and
an algorithm for finding the top k candidates.
The log linear model is defined as a condi-
tional probability distribution of a corrected
word and a rule set for the correction con-
ditioned on the misspelled word. The learn-
ing method employs the criterion in candidate
generation as loss function. The retrieval al-
gorithm is efficient and is guaranteed to find
the optimal k candidates. Experimental re-
sults on large scale data show that the pro-
posed approach improves upon existing meth-
ods in terms of accuracy in different settings.
