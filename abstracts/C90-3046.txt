 
This paper proposes that sentence analysis should 
be treated as de feasible reasoning, and presents uch 
a treatment lbr Japanese sentence analyses using an 
argumentation system by Konolige, which is a for- 
malizat'ion of defeasible reasoning, that includes ar- 
guments and defeat rules that capture defeasibility.
