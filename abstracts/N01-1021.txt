In human sentence processing, cognitive load can be
dened many ways. This report considers a deni-
tion of cognitive load in terms of the total probability
of structural options that have been disconrmed at
some point in a sentence: the surprisal of word w
i
given its prex w
0...i?1
on a phrase-structural lan-
guage model. These loads can be eciently calcu-
lated using a probabilistic Earley parser (Stolcke,
1995) which is interpreted as generating predictions
about reading time on a word-by-word basis. Un-
der grammatical assumptions supported by corpus-
frequency data, the operation of Stolcke?s probabilis-
tic Earley parser correctly predicts processing phe-
nomena associated with garden path structural am-
biguity and with the subject/object relative asym-
metry.
