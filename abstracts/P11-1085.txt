We propose a novel technique of learning how to
transform the source parse trees to improve the trans-
lation qualities of syntax-based translation mod-
els using synchronous context-free grammars. We
transform the source tree phrasal structure into a
set of simpler structures, expose such decisions to
the decoding process, and find the least expensive
transformation operation to better model word re-
ordering. In particular, we integrate synchronous bi-
narizations, verb regrouping, removal of redundant
parse nodes, and incorporate a few important fea-
tures such as translation boundaries. We learn the
structural preferences from the data in a generative
framework. The syntax-based translation system in-
tegrating the proposed techniques outperforms the
best Arabic-English unconstrained system in NIST-
08 evaluations by 1.3 absolute BLEU, which is sta-
tistically significant.
