In this paper, we explore statistical lan-
guage modelling for a speech-enabled
MP3 player application by generating a
corpus from the interpretation grammar
written for the application with the Gram-
matical Framework (GF) (Ranta, 2004).
We create a statistical language model
(SLM) directly from our interpretation
grammar and compare recognition per-
formance of this model against a speech
recognition grammar compiled from the
same GF interpretation grammar. The
results show a relative Word Error Rate
(WER) reduction of 37% for the SLM
derived from the interpretation grammar
while maintaining a low in-grammarWER
comparable to that associated with the
speech recognition grammar. From this
starting point we try to improve our arti-
ficially generated model by interpolating
it with different corpora achieving great
reduction in perplexity and 8% relative
recognition improvement.
