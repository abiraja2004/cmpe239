This paper proposes a novel method
for long distance, clause-level reordering
in statistical machine translation (SMT).
The proposed method separately translates
clauses in the source sentence and recon-
structs the target sentence using the clause
translations with non-terminals. The non-
terminals are placeholders of embedded
clauses, by which we reduce complicated
clause-level reordering into simple word-
level reordering. Its translation model
is trained using a bilingual corpus with
clause-level alignment, which can be au-
tomatically annotated by our alignment
algorithm with a syntactic parser in the
source language. We achieved signifi-
cant improvements of 1.4% in BLEU and
1.3% in TER by using Moses, and 2.2%
in BLEU and 3.5% in TER by using
our hierarchical phrase-based SMT, for
the English-to-Japanese translation of re-
search paper abstracts in the medical do-
main.
