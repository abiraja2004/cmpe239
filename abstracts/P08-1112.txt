Automatic word alignment is a key step in
training statistical machine translation sys-
tems. Despite much recent work on word
alignment methods, alignment accuracy in-
creases often produce little or no improve-
ments in machine translation quality. In
this work we analyze a recently proposed
agreement-constrained EM algorithm for un-
supervised alignment models. We attempt to
tease apart the effects that this simple but ef-
fective modification has on alignment preci-
sion and recall trade-offs, and how rare and
common words are affected across several lan-
guage pairs. We propose and extensively eval-
uate a simple method for using alignment
models to produce alignments better-suited
for phrase-based MT systems, and show sig-
nificant gains (as measured by BLEU score)
in end-to-end translation systems for six lan-
guages pairs used in recent MT competitions.
