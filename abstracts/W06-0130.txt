 
This paper describes the work on Chinese 
named entity recognition performed by 
Yahoo team at the third International 
Chinese Language Processing Bakeoff. 
We used two conditional probabilistic 
models for this task, including condi-
tional random fields (CRFs) and maxi-
mum entropy models. In particular, we 
trained two conditional random field rec-
ognizers and one maximum entropy rec-
ognizer for identifying names of people, 
places, and organizations in un-
segmented Chinese texts. Our best per-
formance is 86.2% F-score on MSRA 
dataset, and 88.53% on CITYU dataset.
