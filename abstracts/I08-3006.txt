 
This paper presents a prototype Text-To-
Indian Sign Language (ISL) translation 
system. The system will help dissemination 
of information to the deaf people in India. 
The current system takes English sentence 
as input, performs syntactic analysis, and 
generates the corresponding ISL structure. 
Since ISL does not have any written form, 
the output is represented in terms of pre-
recorded video streams. The system uses 
Lexical Functional Grammar (LFG) for-
malism for representing ISL syntax.
