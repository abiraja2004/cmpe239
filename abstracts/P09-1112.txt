This paper investigates the class of Tree-
Tuple MCTAG with Shared Nodes, TT-
MCTAG for short, an extension of Tree
Adjoining Grammars that has been pro-
posed for natural language processing, in
particular for dealing with discontinuities
and word order variation in languages such
as German. It has been shown that the uni-
versal recognition problem for this formal-
ism is NP-hard, but so far it was not known
whether the class of languages generated
by TT-MCTAG is included in PTIME. We
provide a positive answer to this ques-
tion, using a new characterization of TT-
MCTAG.
