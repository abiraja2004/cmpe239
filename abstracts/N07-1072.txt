 
This paper explores the problem of com-
puting text similarity between verb 
phrases describing skilled human behav-
ior for the purpose of finding approximate 
matches. Four parsers are evaluated on a 
large corpus of skill statements extracted 
from an enterprise-wide expertise taxon-
omy. A similarity measure utilizing com-
mon semantic role features extracted from 
parse trees was found superior to an in-
formation-theoretic measure of similarity 
and comparable to the level of human 
agreement.
