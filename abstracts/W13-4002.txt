Several discourse annotated corpora now ex-
ist for NLP. But they use different, not eas-
ily comparable annotation schemes: are the
structures these schemes describe incompati-
ble, incomparable, or do they share interpre-
tations? In this paper, we relate three types
of discourse annotation used in corpora or dis-
course parsing: (i) RST, (ii) SDRT, and (iii)
dependency tree structures. We offer a com-
mon language in which their structures can be
defined and furnished a range of interpreta-
tions. We define translations between RST and
DT preserving these interpretations, and intro-
duce a similarity measure for discourse repre-
sentations in these frameworks. This will en-
able researchers to exploit different types of
discourse annotated data for automated tasks.
