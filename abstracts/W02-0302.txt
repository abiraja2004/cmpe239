 
Current information extraction efforts 
in the biomedical domain tend to 
focus on finding entities and facts in 
structured databases or MEDLINE? 
abstracts.  We apply a gene and 
protein name tagger trained on 
Medline abstracts (ABGene) to a 
randomly selected set of full text 
journal articles in the biomedical 
domain.  We show the effect of 
adaptations made in response to the 
greater heterogeneity of full text.
