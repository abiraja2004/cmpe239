Reading and writing Japanese isn?t easy for
Japanese and foreigners alike. While Japa-
nese learn these skills at school, foreigners
should be helped by good teaching material
and dictionaries.
Kanji lexica have to be very different from
other dictionaries. Unfortunately existing
lexica normally expect that the users already
have a lot of information on a character to
look it up?the character?s stroke count, its
radical or its pronunciation. Beginners nor-
mally don?t have such information. 
This project creates data to allow for eas-
ier and more flexible look up of Japanese
characters and to build better teaching mate-
rial. It develops different approaches to make
use of this data.
