We use the Margin Infused Relaxed Algo-
rithm of Crammer et al to add a large num-
ber of new features to two machine transla-
tion systems: the Hiero hierarchical phrase-
based translation system and our syntax-based
translation system. On a large-scale Chinese-
English translation task, we obtain statistically
significant improvements of +1.5 B??? and
+1.1 B???, respectively. We analyze the im-
pact of the new features and the performance
of the learning algorithm.
