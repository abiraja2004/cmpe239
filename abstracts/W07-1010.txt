This paper presents the results of a pilot us-
ability study of a novel approach to search
user interfaces for bioscience journal arti-
cles. The main idea is to support search over
figure captions explicitly, and show the cor-
responding figures directly within the search
results. Participants in a pilot study ex-
pressed surprise at the idea, noting that they
had never thought of search in this way.
They also reported strong positive reactions
to the idea: 7 out of 8 said they would use a
search system with this kind of feature, sug-
gesting that this is a promising idea for jour-
nal article search.
