Automatic classification of short textual an-
swers by students to questions about topics in
physics, computing, etc., is an attractive ap-
proach to diagnostic assessment of learning.
We present a language for expressing rules that
can classify text based on the presence and rel-
ative positions of words, lists of synonyms and
other abstractions of a single word. We also
describe a system, based on Mitchell?s version
spaces algorithm, that learns rules in this lan-
guage. These rules can be used to catego-
rize student responses to short-answer ques-
tions. The system is trained on written re-
sponses captured by an online assessment sys-
tem that poses multiple choice questions and
asks the student to justify their answers with
textual explanations of their reasoning. Several
experiments are described that examine the ef-
fects of the use of negative data and tagging
students explanations with their answer to the
original multiple choice question.
