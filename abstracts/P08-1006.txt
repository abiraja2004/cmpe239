This paper presents a comparative evalua-
tion of several state-of-the-art English parsers
based on different frameworks. Our approach
is to measure the impact of each parser when it
is used as a component of an information ex-
traction system that performs protein-protein
interaction (PPI) identification in biomedical
papers. We evaluate eight parsers (based on
dependency parsing, phrase structure parsing,
or deep parsing) using five different parse rep-
resentations. We run a PPI system with several
combinations of parser and parse representa-
tion, and examine their impact on PPI identi-
fication accuracy. Our experiments show that
the levels of accuracy obtained with these dif-
ferent parsers are similar, but that accuracy
improvements vary when the parsers are re-
trained with domain-specific data.
