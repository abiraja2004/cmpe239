 
Machine Transliteration is to transcribe a 
word written in a script with approximate 
phonetic equivalence in another lan-
guage. It is useful for machine transla-
tion, cross-lingual information retrieval, 
multilingual text and speech processing. 
Punjabi Machine Transliteration (PMT) 
is a special case of machine translitera-
tion and is a process of converting a word 
from Shahmukhi (based on Arabic script) 
to Gurmukhi (derivation of Landa, 
Shardha and Takri, old scripts of Indian 
subcontinent), two scripts of Punjabi, ir-
respective of the type of word. 
The Punjabi Machine Transliteration 
System uses transliteration rules (charac-
ter mappings and dependency rules) for 
transliteration of Shahmukhi words into 
Gurmukhi. The PMT system can translit-
erate every word written in Shahmukhi.
