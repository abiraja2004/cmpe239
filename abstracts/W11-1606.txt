We examine the task of strict sentence inter-
section: a variant of sentence fusion in which
the output must only contain the informa-
tion present in all input sentences and nothing
more. Our proposed approach involves align-
ment and generalization over the input sen-
tences to produce a generation lattice; we then
compare a standard search-based approach for
decoding an intersection from this lattice to an
integer linear program that preserves aligned
content while minimizing the disfluency in
interleaving text segments. In addition, we
introduce novel evaluation strategies for in-
tersection problems that employ entailment-
style judgments for determining the validity
of system-generated intersections. Our experi-
ments show that the proposed models produce
valid intersections a majority of the time and
that the segmented decoder yields advantages
over the search-based approach.
