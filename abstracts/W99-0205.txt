 
A noun phrase can indirectly refer to an entity that 
has already been mentioned. For example, " I  went 
into an old house last night. The roof was leaking 
badly and ..." indicates that "the roof' is asso- 
ciated with "an old house", which was mentioned 
in the previous sentence. This kind of reference 
(indirect anaphora) has not been studied well in 
natural language processing, but is important for 
coherence resolution, language understanding, and 
machine translation. In order to analyze indirect 
anaphora, we need a case frame dictionary for nouns 
that contains knowledge of the relationships between 
two nouns but no such dictionary presently exists. 
Therefore, we are forced to use examples of "X no 
Y" (Y of X) and a verb case frame dictionary in- 
stead. We tried estimating indirect anaphora using 
this information and obtained a recall rate of 63% 
and a precision rate of 68% on test sentences. This 
indicates that the information of "X no Y" is use- 
ful to a certain extent when we cannot make use 
of a noun case frame dictionary. We estimated the 
results that would be given by a noun case frame 
dictionary, and obtained recall and precision rates 
of 71% and 82% respectively. Finally, we proposed 
a way to construct a noun case frame dictionary by 
using examples of "X no Y."
