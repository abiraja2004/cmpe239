Large numbers of cultural heritage items
are now archived digitally along with ac-
companying metadata and are available to
anyone with internet access. This informa-
tion could be enriched by adding links to
resources that provide background informa-
tion about the items. Techniques have been
developed for automatically adding links
to Wikipedia to text but the methods are
general and not designed for use with cul-
tural heritage data. This paper explores a
range of methods for adapting a system for
adding links to Wikipedia to cultural her-
itage items. The approaches make use of
the structure of Wikipedia, including the
category hierarchy. It is found that an ap-
proach that makes use of Wikipedia?s link
structure can be used to improve the quality
of the Wikipedia links that are added.
