This paper explores a very basic linguis-
tic phenomenon in multilingualism: the
lexicalizations of entities are very often
identical within different languages while
concepts are usually lexicalized differ-
ently. Since entities are commonly re-
ferred to by proper names in natural lan-
guage, we measured their distribution in
the lexical overlap of the terminologies ex-
tracted from comparable corpora. Results
show that the lexical overlap is mostly
composed by unambiguous words, which
can be regarded as anchors to bridge lan-
guages: most of terms having the same
spelling refer exactly to the same entities.
Thanks to this important feature of Named
Entities, we developed a multilingual su-
per sense tagging system capable to distin-
guish between concepts and individuals.
Individuals adopted for training have been
extracted both by YAGO and by a heuristic
procedure. The general F1 of the English
tagger is over 76%, which is in line with
the state of the art on super sense tagging
while augmenting the number of classes.
Performances for Italian are slightly lower,
while ensuring a reasonable accuracy level
which is capable to show effective results
for knowledge acquisition.
