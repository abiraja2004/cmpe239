We present DIRECTL: an online discrimi-
native sequence prediction model that em-
ploys a many-to-many alignment between
target and source. Our system incorpo-
rates input segmentation, target charac-
ter prediction, and sequence modeling in
a unified dynamic programming frame-
work. Experimental results suggest that
DIRECTL is able to independently dis-
cover many of the language-specific reg-
ularities in the training data.
