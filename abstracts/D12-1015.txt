This paper focuses on the task of colloca-
tion polarity disambiguation. The collocation
refers to a binary tuple of a polarity word and
a target (such as ?long, battery life? or ?long,
startup?), in which the sentiment orientation of
the polarity word (?long?) changes along with
different targets (?battery life? or ?startup?).
To disambiguate a collocation?s polarity, pre-
vious work always turned to investigate the
polarities of its surrounding contexts, and then
assigned the majority polarity to the collo-
cation. However, these contexts are limited,
thus the resulting polarity is insufficient to be
reliable. We therefore propose an unsuper-
vised three-component framework to expand
some pseudo contexts from web, to help dis-
ambiguate a collocation?s polarity.Without us-
ing any additional labeled data, experiments
show that our method is effective.
