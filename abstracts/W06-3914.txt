 
This short paper is focused on the formal semantic model: Universal Semantic Code 
(USC), which acquires a semantic lexicon from thesauruses and pairs it with formal 
meaning representation.  The USC model postulates: Knowledge Inference (KI) is effec-
tive only on the basis of Semantic Knowledge Representation (SKR). The USC model 
represents formalized meanings of verbs and phrasal verbs as a main component of its 
semantic classification. USC algebra defines a formula for the verb, limited set of ele-
ments, relations between them, and a natural language interpretation of the formula.
