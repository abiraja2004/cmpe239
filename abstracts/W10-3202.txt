on developing Indonesian WordNet in 
the AsianWordNet (AWN). We will de-
scribe the method to develop for colla-
borative editing to review and complete 
the translation of synset. This paper aims 
to create linkage among Asian languages 
by adopting the concept of semantic re-
lations and synset expressed in Word-
Net.
