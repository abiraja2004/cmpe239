This paper reports our ongoing project for
constructing an English multiword expression
(MWE) dictionary and NLP tools based on
the developed dictionary. We extracted func-
tional MWEs from the English part of Wik-
tionary, annotated the Penn Treebank (PTB)
with MWE information, and conducted POS
tagging experiments. We report how the
MWE annotation is done on PTB and the re-
sults of POS and MWE tagging experiments.
