In the past decade, several researchers
have started reinvestigating the use of
sub-phonetic models for lexical represen-
tations within automatic speech recogni-
tion systems. Lest history repeat itself,
it may be instructive to mine the further
past for models of lexical representations
in the lexical access literature. In this
work, we re-evaluate the model of Briscoe
(1989), in which a hybrid strategy of lex-
ical representation between phones and
manner classes is promoted. While many
of Briscoe?s assumptions do not match up
with current ASR processing models, we
show that his conclusions are essentially
correct, and that reconsidering this struc-
ture for ASR lexica is an appropriate av-
enue for future ASR research.
