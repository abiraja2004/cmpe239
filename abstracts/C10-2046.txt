This paper proposes a novel extractive
summarization method for contact cen-
ter dialogues. We use a particular
type of hidden Markov model (HMM)
called Class Speaker HMM (CSHMM),
which processes operator/caller utterance
sequences of multiple domains simulta-
neously to model domain-specific utter-
ance sequences and common (domain-
wide) sequences at the same time. We
applied the CSHMM to call summariza-
tion of transcripts in six different con-
tact center domains and found that our
method significantly outperforms compet-
itive baselines based on the maximum
coverage of important words using integer
linear programming.
