We present a distributional vector space model
that incorporates Latent Dirichlet Allocation
in order to capture the semantic relation hold-
ing between adjectives and nouns along inter-
pretable dimensions of meaning: The meaning
of adjective-noun phrases is characterized in
terms of ontological attributes that are promi-
nent in their compositional semantics. The
model is evaluated in a similarity prediction
task based on paired adjective-noun phrases
from the Mitchell and Lapata (2010) bench-
mark data. Comparing our model against a
high-dimensional latent word space, we ob-
serve qualitative differences that shed light
on different aspects of similarity conveyed
by both models and suggest integrating their
complementary strengths.
