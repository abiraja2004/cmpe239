According to standard pragmat-
ics, we should account for conver-
sational implicatures in terms of
Grice's (1975) maxims of conversa-
tion. Neo-Griceans like Atlas &
Levinson (1981) and Horn (1984)
seek to reduce those maxims to the
so-called Q and I-principles. In
this paper I want to argue that (i)
there are major problems for reduc-
ing Gricean pragmatics to these two
principles, and (ii) that, in fact, we'd
better account for implicatures in
terms of the principles of (a) opti-
mal relevance and (b) optimal cod-
ing. To formulate both, I will make
use of Shannon's (1948) mathemat-
ical theory of communication.
