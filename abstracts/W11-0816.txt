 
Multi-word expressions (MWEs) play an 
important role in all tasks that involve natu-
ral language processing. MWEs in Hindi 
are quite varied and many of these are of 
the types that are not encountered in Eng-
lish. In this paper, we examine different 
types of MWEs encountered in Hindi. 
Many of these have not received adequate 
attention of investigators. For example, 
?vaalaa? constructs, doublets (word-pairs), 
replication, and a variety of verb group 
forms have not been explored as MWEs. 
We examine these MWEs from machine 
translation viewpoint. Many of these are 
frequently used in day-to-day conversa-
tions and informal communication but are 
not that frequently encountered in a formal 
textual corpus. Most of the conventional 
statistical methods for MWE identification 
use corpus with limited linguistic cues. 
These are found to be inadequate for de-
tecting all types of MWEs that exist in real 
life. In this paper, we present a stepwise 
methodology for mining Hindi MWEs us-
ing linguistic knowledge. Interpretation and 
representation for some of these from ma-
chine translation perspective have also 
been explored.
