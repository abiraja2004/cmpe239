 
To score well in RTE3, and even more so 
to create good justifications for entailments, 
substantial lexical and world knowledge is 
needed. With this in mind, we present an 
analysis of a sample of the RTE3 positive 
entailment pairs, to identify where and 
what kinds of world knowledge are needed 
to fully identify and justify the entailment, 
and discuss several existing resources and 
their capacity for supplying that knowledge. 
We also briefly sketch the path we are fol-
lowing to build an RTE system (Our im-
plementation is very preliminary, scoring 
50.9% at the time of RTE). The contribu-
tion of this paper is thus a framework for 
discussing the knowledge requirements 
posed by RTE and some exploration of 
how these requirements can be met.
