During the past few years, several novel
text mining algorithms have been de-
veloped in the context of the BioNLP
Shared Tasks on Event Extraction. These
algorithms typically aim at extracting
biomolecular interactions from text by in-
specting only the context of one sen-
tence. However, when humans inter-
pret biomolecular research articles, they
usually build upon extensive background
knowledge of their favorite genes and
pathways. To make such world knowl-
edge available to a text mining algorithm,
it could first be applied to all available lit-
erature to subsequently make a more in-
formed decision on which predictions are
consistent with the current known data. In
this paper, we introduce our participation
in the latest Shared Task using the large-
scale text mining resource EVEX which
we previously implemented using state-of-
the-art algorithms, and which was applied
to the whole of PubMed and PubMed Cen-
tral. We participated in the Genia Event
Extraction (GE) and Gene Regulation Net-
work (GRN) tasks, ranking first in the for-
mer and fifth in the latter.
