We target the problem of linking source
mentions that belong to the same entity
(source coreference resolution), which is
needed for creating opinion summaries. In
this paper we describe how source coref-
erence resolution can be transformed into
standard noun phrase coreference resolu-
tion, apply a state-of-the-art coreference
resolution approach to the transformed
data, and evaluate on an available corpus
of manually annotated opinions.
