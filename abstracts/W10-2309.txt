This paper examines the influence of fea-
tures based on clusters of co-occurrences
for supervised Word Sense Disambigua-
tion and Lexical Substitution. Co-
occurrence cluster features are derived
from clustering the local neighborhood of
a target word in a co-occurrence graph
based on a corpus in a completely un-
supervised fashion. Clusters can be as-
signed in context and are used as features
in a supervised WSD system. Experi-
ments fitting a strong baseline system with
these additional features are conducted on
two datasets, showing improvements. Co-
occurrence features are a simple way to
mimic Topic Signatures (Mart??nez et al,
2008) without needing to construct re-
sources manually. Further, a system is de-
scribed that produces lexical substitutions
in context with very high precision.
