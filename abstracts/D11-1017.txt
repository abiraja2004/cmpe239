We propose a simple training regime that can
improve the extrinsic performance of a parser,
given only a corpus of sentences and a way
to automatically evaluate the extrinsic quality
of a candidate parse. We apply our method
to train parsers that excel when used as part
of a reordering component in a statistical ma-
chine translation system. We use a corpus of
weakly-labeled reference reorderings to guide
parser training. Our best parsers contribute
significant improvements in subjective trans-
lation quality while their intrinsic attachment
scores typically regress.
