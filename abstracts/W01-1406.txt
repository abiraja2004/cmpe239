Translation systems that automatically
extract transfer mappings (rules or
examples) from bilingual corpora have
been hampered by the difficulty of
achieving accurate alignment and
acquiring high quality mappings. We
describe an algorithm that uses a best-
first strategy and a small alignment
grammar to significantly improve the
quality of the transfer mappings
extracted. For each mapping,
frequencies are computed and sufficient
context is retained to distinguish
competing mappings during translation.
Variants of the algorithm are run
against a corpus containing 200K
sentence pairs and evaluated based on
the quality of resulting translations.
