In the current project, we aim at
developing an approach for automatically
answering why-questions. We created a
data collection for research, development
and evaluation of a method for
automatically answering why-questions
(why-QA) The resulting collection
comprises 395 why-questions. For each
question, the source document and one or
two user-formulated answers are
available in the data set. The resulting
data set is of importance for our research
and it will contribute to and stimulate
other research in the field of why-QA.
We developed a question analysis
method for why-questions, based on
syntactic categorization and answer type
determination. The quality of the output
of this module is promising for future
development of our method for why-QA.
