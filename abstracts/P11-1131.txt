We propose a principled and efficient phrase-
to-phrase alignment model, useful in machine
translation as well as other related natural lan-
guage processing problems. In a hidden semi-
Markov model, word-to-phrase and phrase-
to-word translations are modeled directly by
the system. Agreement between two direc-
tional models encourages the selection of par-
simonious phrasal alignments, avoiding the
overfitting commonly encountered in unsu-
pervised training with multi-word units. Ex-
panding the state space to include ?gappy
phrases? (such as French ne ? pas) makes the
alignment space more symmetric; thus, it al-
lows agreement between discontinuous align-
ments. The resulting system shows substantial
improvements in both alignment quality and
translation quality over word-based Hidden
Markov Models, while maintaining asymptot-
ically equivalent runtime.
