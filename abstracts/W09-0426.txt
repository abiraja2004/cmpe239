This paper describes the techniques we
explored to improve the translation of
news text in the German-English and
Hungarian-English tracks of the WMT09
shared translation task. Beginning with a
convention hierarchical phrase-based sys-
tem, we found benefits for using word seg-
mentation lattices as input, explicit gen-
eration of beginning and end of sentence
markers, minimum Bayes risk decoding,
and incorporation of a feature scoring the
alignment of function words in the hy-
pothesized translation. We also explored
the use of monolingual paraphrases to im-
prove coverage, as well as co-training to
improve the quality of the segmentation
lattices used, but these did not lead to im-
provements.
