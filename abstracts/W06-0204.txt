This paper presents a novel approach to
the semi-supervised learning of Informa-
tion Extraction patterns. The method
makes use of more complex patterns than
previous approaches and determines their
similarity using a measure inspired by re-
cent work using kernel methods (Culotta
and Sorensen, 2004). Experiments show
that the proposed similarity measure out-
performs a previously reported measure
based on cosine similarity when used to
perform binary relation extraction.
