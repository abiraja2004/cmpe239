This paper presents an update semantic for dialogue acts, defined in terms of combinations of
very simple ?elementary update functions?. This approach allows fine-grained distinctions to be
made between related types of dialogue acts, and relations like entailment and exclusion between
dialogue acts to be established. The approach is applied to dialogue act representations as defined in
the Dialogue Act Markup Language (DiAML), part of the recently proposed ISO standard 24617-2
for dialogue act annotation.
