Identifying whether a multi-word expres-
sion (MWE) is compositional or not is im-
portant for numerous NLP applications.
Sense induction can partition the context
of MWEs into semantic uses and there-
fore aid in deciding compositionality. We
propose an unsupervised system to ex-
plore this hypothesis on compound nom-
inals, proper names and adjective-noun
constructions, and evaluate the contribu-
tion of sense induction. The evaluation
set is derived from WordNet in a semi-
supervised way. Graph connectivity mea-
sures are employed for unsupervised pa-
rameter tuning.
