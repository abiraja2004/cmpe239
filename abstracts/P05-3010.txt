 
This paper introduces a method for learn-
ing to find translation of a given source 
term on the Web. In the approach, the 
source term is used as a query and part of 
patterns to retrieve and extract transla-
tions in Web pages. The method involves 
using a bilingual term list to learn source-
target surface patterns. At runtime, the 
given term is submitted to a search engine 
then the candidate translations are ex-
tracted from the returned summaries and 
subsequently ranked based on the surface 
patterns, occurrence counts, and translit-
eration knowledge. We present a proto-
type called TermMine that applies the 
method to translate terms. Evaluation on a 
set of encyclopedia terms shows that the 
method significantly outperforms the 
state-of-the-art online machine translation 
systems.
