Although vast amounts of information
are available electronically today, no ef-
fective information access mechanism ex-
ists to provide humans with convenient
information access. A general, open-
domain question answering system is a
solution to this problem. We propose an
architecture for a collaborative question
answering system that contains four pri-
mary components: an annotations sys-
tem for storing knowledge, a ternary ex-
pression representation of language, a
transformational rule system for han-
dling some complexities of language, and
a collaborative mechanism by which or-
dinary users can contribute new knowl-
edge by teaching the system new infor-
mation. We have developed a initial pro-
totype, called Webnotator, with which to
test these ideas.
