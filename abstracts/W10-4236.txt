In this paper, we propose a new shared task
called HOO: Helping Our Own. The aim is
to use tools and techniques developed in com-
putational linguistics to help people writing
about computational linguistics. We describe
a text-to-text generation scenario that poses
challenging research questions, and delivers
practical outcomes that are useful in the first
case to our own community and potentially
much more widely. Two specific factors make
us optimistic that this task will generate useful
outcomes: one is the availability of the ACL
Anthology, a large corpus of the target text
type; the other is that CL researchers who are
non-native speakers of English will be moti-
vated to use prototype systems, providing in-
formed and precise feedback in large quantity.
We lay out our plans in detail and invite com-
ment and critique with the aim of improving
the nature of the planned exercise.
