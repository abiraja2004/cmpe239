This paper presents a method for sentiment
analysis specifically designed to work with
Twitter data (tweets), taking into account their
structure, length and specific language. The
approach employed makes it easily extendible
to other languages and makes it able to pro-
cess tweets in near real time. The main contri-
butions of this work are: a) the pre-processing
of tweets to normalize the language and gener-
alize the vocabulary employed to express sen-
timent; b) the use minimal linguistic process-
ing, which makes the approach easily portable
to other languages; c) the inclusion of higher
order n-grams to spot modifications in the po-
larity of the sentiment expressed; d) the use of
simple heuristics to select features to be em-
ployed; e) the application of supervised learn-
ing using a simple Support Vector Machines
linear classifier on a set of realistic data. We
show that using the training models generated
with the method described we can improve
the sentiment classification performance, irre-
spective of the domain and distribution of the
test sets.
