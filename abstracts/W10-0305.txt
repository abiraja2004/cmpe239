 
This paper presents our on-going work to 
improve the lyric generation component of 
the Automatic Lyric Generation system for 
the Tamil Language. An earlier version of 
the system used an n-gram based model to 
generate lyrics that match the given melody. 
This paper identifies some of the deficien-
cies in the melody analysis and text genera-
tion components of the earlier system and 
explains the new approach used to tackle 
those drawbacks. The two central approach-
es discussed in this paper are: (1) An im-
proved mapping scheme for matching melo-
dy with words and (2) Knowledge-based 
Text Generation algorithm based on an ex-
isting Ontology and Tamil Morphology Ge-
nerator.
