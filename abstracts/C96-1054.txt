  
This article presents a new semantic- 
based transfer approach developed and 
applied within the Verbmobil Machine 
Translation project. We give an overview 
of the declarative transfer formalism to- 
gether with its procedural realization. 
Our approach is discussed and compared 
with several other approaches from the 
MT literature. The results presented in 
this article have been implemented and 
integrated into the Verbmobil system.
