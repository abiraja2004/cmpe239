Morph length is one of the indicative feature
that helps learning the morphology of lan-
guages, in particular agglutinative languages.
In this paper, we introduce a simple unsu-
pervised model for morphological segmenta-
tion and study how the knowledge of morph
length affect the performance of the seg-
mentation task under the Bayesian frame-
work. The model is based on (Goldwater et
al., 2006) unigram word segmentation model
and assumes a simple prior distribution over
morph length. We experiment this model
on two highly related and agglutinative lan-
guages namely Tamil and Telugu, and com-
pare our results with the state of the art Mor-
fessor system. We show that, knowledge of
morph length has a positive impact and pro-
vides competitive results in terms of overall
performance.
