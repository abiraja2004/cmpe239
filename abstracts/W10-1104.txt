We present an approach to analysing auto-
matic speech recognition (ASR) hypotheses
for dictated medical reports based on back-
ground knowledge. Our application area is
prescriptions of medications, which are a fre-
quent source of misrecognitions: In a sam-
ple report corpus, we found that about 40%
of the active substances or trade names and
dosages were recognized incorrectly. In about
25% of these errors, the correct string of words
was contained in the word graph. We have
built a knowledge base of medications based
on information contained in the Unified Med-
ical Language System (UMLS), consisting
of trade names, active substances, strengths
and dosages. From this, we generate a va-
riety of linguistic realizations for prescrip-
tions. Whenever an inconsistency in a pre-
scription is encountered on the best path of
the word graph, the system searches for alter-
native paths which contain valid linguistic re-
alizations of prescriptions consistent with the
knowledge base. If such a path exists, a new
concept edge with a better score is added to
the word graph, resulting in a higher plausi-
bility for this reading. The concept edge can
be used for rescoring the word graph to obtain
a new best path. A preliminary evaluation led
to encouraging results: in nearly half of the
cases where the word graph contained the cor-
rect variant, the correction was successful.
