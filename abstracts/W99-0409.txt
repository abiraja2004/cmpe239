 
One of the typical problems of Natural 
Language Processing (NLP) is the explosive 
property of the parser and this is aggravated in
an Intelligent Language Tutoring System (ILTS) 
because the grammar is unconstrained and 
admits even more analyses. NLP applications 
frequently incorporate chniques for selecting a
preferred parse. Computational criteria, 
however, are insufficient for a pedagogic system 
because the parse chosen will possibly result in 
misleading feedback for the learner. Preferably, 
the analysis emphasizes language teaching 
pedagogy by selecting the sentence 
interpretation a student most likely intended. In 
the system described in this paper, several 
modules are responsible for selecting the 
appropriate analysis and these are informed by 
the Student Model. Aspects in the Student 
Model play an important pedagogic role in 
determining the desired sentence interpretation, 
handling multiple errors, and deciding on the 
level of interaction with the student.
