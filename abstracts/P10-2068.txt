We present a novel system that helps non-
experts find sets of similar words. The
user begins by specifying one or more seed
words. The system then iteratively sug-
gests a series of candidate words, which
the user can either accept or reject. Cur-
rent techniques for this task typically boot-
strap a classifier based on a fixed seed
set. In contrast, our system involves
the user throughout the labeling process,
using active learning to intelligently ex-
plore the space of similar words. In
particular, our system can take advan-
tage of negative examples provided by the
user. Our system combines multiple pre-
existing sources of similarity data (a stan-
dard thesaurus, WordNet, contextual sim-
ilarity), enabling it to capture many types
of similarity groups (?synonyms of crash,?
?types of car,? etc.). We evaluate on a
hand-labeled evaluation set; our system
improves over a strong baseline by 36%.
