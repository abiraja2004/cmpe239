The literature investigating the notion
of presupposition in Discourse Represen-
tation Theory (DRT) has mainly been
dubbed as being semantic (Simons 2003).
This paper investigates the linguistic ap-
plication of pragmatic-based constraints to
the ?semantic? notion of presupposition in
DRT. By applying pragmatic-based con-
straints to presuppositional phenomenon,
we aim to defend DRT against the accu-
sation that DRT?s interpretation of presup-
positional phenomenon is essentially ?se-
mantic? and push this interpretation fur-
ther towards the pragmatic side of the se-
mantic/pragmatic interface.1
