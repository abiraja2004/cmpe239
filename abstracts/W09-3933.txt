 
We present computational models that allow 
spoken dialog systems to handle multi-
participant engagement in open, dynamic envi-
ronments, where multiple people may enter and 
leave conversations, and interact with the sys-
tem and with others in a natural manner. The 
models for managing the engagement process 
include components for (1) sensing the en-
gagement state, actions and intentions of mul-
tiple agents in the scene, (2) making engage-
ment decisions (i.e. whom to engage with, and 
when) and (3) rendering these decisions in a set 
of coordinated low-level behaviors in an embo-
died conversational agent. We review results 
from a study of interactions "in the wild" with a 
system that implements such a model.
