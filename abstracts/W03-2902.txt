 
In this paper we describe the mapping of 
Zaliznjak?s (1977) morphological classes 
into the lexical representation language 
DATR (Evans and Gazdar 1996).  On the 
basis of the resulting DATR theory a set of 
fully inflected forms together with their as-
sociated morphosyntax can automatically 
be generated from the electronic version of 
Zaliznjak?s dictionary (Ilola and Mustajoki  
1989). From this data we plan to develop a 
wide-coverage morphosyntactic lemma-
tizer and tagger for Russian.
