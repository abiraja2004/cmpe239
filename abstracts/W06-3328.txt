We demonstrate that bootstrapping a gene
name recognizer for FlyBase curation
from automatically annotated noisy text is
more effective than fully supervised train-
ing of the recognizer on more general
manually annotated biomedical text. We
present a new test set for this task based on
an annotation scheme which distinguishes
gene names from gene mentions, enabling
a more consistent annotation. Evaluating
our recognizer using this test set indicates
that performance on unseen genes is its
main weakness. We evaluate extensions
to the technique used to generate training
data designed to ameliorate this problem.
