We introduce here a participating system
of the CoNLL-2013 Shared Task ?Gram-
matical Error Correction?. We focused on
the noun number and article error cate-
gories and constructed a supervised learn-
ing system for solving these tasks. We car-
ried out feature engineering and we found
that (among others) the f-structure of an
LFG parser can provide very informative
features for the machine learning system.
