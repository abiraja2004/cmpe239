This paper demonstrates the need and im-
pact of subcategorization information for
SMT. We combine (i) features on source-
side syntactic subcategorization and (ii)
an external knowledge base with quantita-
tive, dependency-based information about
target-side subcategorization frames. A
manual evaluation of an English-to-
German translation task shows that the
subcategorization information has a posi-
tive impact on translation quality through
better prediction of case.
