This paper introduces an indexing method based on
static analysis of grammar rules and type signatures
for typed feature structure grammars (TFSGs). The
static analysis tries to predict at compile-time which
feature paths will cause unification failure during
parsing at run-time. To support the static analysis,
we introduce a new classification of the instances
of variables used in TFSGs, based on what type of
structure sharing they create. The indexing actions
that can be performed during parsing are also enu-
merated. Non-statistical indexing has the advan-
tage of not requiring training, and, as the evalua-
tion using large-scale HPSGs demonstrates, the im-
provements are comparable with those of statistical
optimizations. Such statistical optimizations rely
on data collected during training, and their perfor-
mance does not always compensate for the training
costs.
