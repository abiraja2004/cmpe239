Identifying collocations in a sentence, in
order to ensure their proper processing in
subsequent applications, and performing
the syntactic analysis of the sentence are
interrelated processes. Syntactic informa-
tion is crucial for detecting collocations,
and vice versa, collocational information
is useful for parsing. This article describes
an original approach in which collocations
are identified in a sentence as soon as pos-
sible during the analysis of that sentence,
rather than at the end of the analysis, as in
our previous work. In this way, priority is
given to parsing alternatives involving col-
locations, and collocational information
guide the parser through the maze of alter-
natives. This solution was shown to lead
to substantial improvements in the perfor-
mance of both tasks (collocation identifi-
cation and parsing), and in that of a sub-
sequent task (machine translation).
