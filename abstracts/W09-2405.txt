This research examines a word sense dis-
ambiguation method using selectors acquired
from the Web. Selectors describe words which
may take the place of another given word
within its local context. Work in using Web se-
lectors for noun sense disambiguation is gen-
eralized into the disambiguation of verbs, ad-
verbs, and adjectives as well. Additionally,
this work incorporates previously ignored ad-
verb context selectors and explores the effec-
tiveness of each type of context selector ac-
cording to its part of speech. Overall results
for verb, adjective, and adverb disambigua-
tion are well above a random baseline and
slightly below the most frequent sense base-
line, a point which noun sense disambigua-
tion overcomes. Our experiments find that,
for noun and verb sense disambiguation tasks,
each type of context selector may assist target
selectors in disambiguation. Finally, these ex-
periments also help to draw insights about the
future direction of similar research.
