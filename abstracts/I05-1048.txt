. This paper proposes a lexicon-constrained character model that com-
bines both word and character features to solve complicated issues in Chinese 
morphological analysis. A Chinese character-based model constrained by a 
lexicon is built to acquire word building rules. Each character in a Chinese sen-
tence is assigned a tag by the proposed model. The word segmentation and part-
of-speech tagging results are then generated based on the character tags. The 
proposed method solves such problems as unknown word identification, data 
sparseness, and estimation bias in an integrated, unified framework. Preliminary 
experiments indicate that the proposed method outperforms the best SIGHAN 
word segmentation systems in the open track on 3 out of the 4 test corpora. Ad-
ditionally, our method can be conveniently integrated with any other Chinese 
morphological systems as a post-processing module leading to significant im-
provement in performance.
