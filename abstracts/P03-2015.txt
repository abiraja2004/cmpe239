 
The development of multi-channel digital 
broadcasting has generated a demand not 
only for new services but also for smart 
and highly functional capabilities in all 
broadcast-related devices. This is espe-
cially true of the television receivers on 
the viewer's side. With the aim of achiev-
ing a friendly interface that anybody can 
use with ease, we built a prototype inter-
face system that operates a television 
through voice interactions using natural 
language. At the current stage of our re-
search, we are using this system to inves-
tigate the usefulness and problem areas of 
the spoken dialogue interface for televi-
sion operations.
