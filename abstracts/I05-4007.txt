Parallel wordnets built upon 
correspondences between different 
languages can play a crucial role in 
multilingual knowledge processing. Since 
there is no homomorphism between pairs of 
monolingual wordnets, we must rely on 
lexical semantic relation (LSR) mappings to 
ensure conceptual cohesion. In this paper, 
we propose and implement a model for 
bootstrapping parallel wordnets based on 
one monolingual wordnet and a set of 
cross-lingual lexical semantic relations. In 
particular, we propose a set of inference 
rules to predict Chinese wordnet structure 
based on English wordnet and 
English-Chinese translation relations. We 
show that this model of parallel wordnet 
building is effective and achieves higher 
precision in LSR prediction.
