This paper presents an LTAG account
for binding of reflexives and recipro-
cals in English. For these anaphors,
a multi-component lexical entry is pro-
posed, whose first component is a degener-
ate NP-tree that adjoins into the anaphor?s
binder. This establishes the local structural
relationship needed to ensure coreference
and agreement. The analysis also allows
a parallel treatment of reflexives and re-
ciprocals, which is desirable because their
behavior is very similar.
In order to account for non-local bind-
ing phenomena, as in raising and ECM
cases, we employ flexible composition,
constrained by a subject intervention con-
straint between the two components of the
anaphor?s lexical entry. Finally, the paper
discusses further data such as extraction
and picture-NP examples.
