We consider the problem of modeling the con-
tent structure of texts within a specific do-
main, in terms of the topics the texts address
and the order in which these topics appear.
We first present an effective knowledge-lean
method for learning content models from un-
annotated documents, utilizing a novel adap-
tation of algorithms for Hidden Markov Mod-
els. We then apply our method to two com-
plementary tasks: information ordering and ex-
tractive summarization. Our experiments show
that incorporating content models in these ap-
plications yields substantial improvement over
previously-proposed methods.
