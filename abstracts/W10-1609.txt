 
This paper presents a system that uses ma-
chine learning algorithms for the task of re-
cognizing textual entailment in Spanish 
language. The datasets used include SPARTE 
Corpus and a translated version to Spanish of 
RTE3, RTE4 and RTE5 datasets. The features 
chosen quantify lexical, syntactic and seman-
tic level matching between text and hypothe-
sis sentences. We analyze how the different 
sizes of datasets and classifiers could impact 
on the final overall performance of the RTE 
classification of two-way task in Spanish. The 
RTE system yields 60.83% of accuracy and a 
competitive result of 66.50% of accuracy is 
reported by train and test set taken from 
SPARTE Corpus with 70% split.
