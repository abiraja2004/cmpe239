In this paper we present several extensions of
MARIE1, a freely available N -gram-based sta-
tistical machine translation (SMT) decoder. The
extensions mainly consist of the ability to ac-
cept and generate word graphs and the intro-
duction of two new N -gram models in the log-
linear combination of feature functions the de-
coder implements. Additionally, the decoder is
enhanced with a caching strategy that reduces
the number of N -gram calls improving the over-
all search efficiency. Experiments are carried out
over the Eurpoean Parliament Spanish-English
translation task.
