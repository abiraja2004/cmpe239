 
This study explores the efficacy of an ap-proach to native language identification that utilizes grammatical, rhetorical, semantic, syntactic, and cohesive function categories comprised of key n-grams. The study found that a model based on these categories of key n-grams was able to successfully predict the L1 of essays written in English by L2 learners from 11 different L1 backgrounds with an ac-curacy of 59%. Preliminary findings concern-ing instances of crosslinguistic influence are discussed, along with evidence of language similarities based on patterns of language misclassification.
