 
WordSmith Tools (Scott, 1998) offers a 
program for comparing corpora, known as 
KeyWords. KeyWords compares a word list 
extracted from what has been called 'the 
study corpus' (the corpus which the 
researcher is interested in describing) with a 
word list made from a reference corpus. The 
only requirement for a word list to be 
accepted as reference corpus by the software 
is that must be larger than the study corpus. 
one of the most pressing questions with 
respect to using KeyWords eems to be what 
would be the ideal size of a reference 
corpus. The aim of this paper is thus to 
propose answers to this question. Five 
English corpora were compared to reference 
corpora of various sizes (varying from two 
to 100 times larger than the study corpus). 
The results indicate that a reference corpus 
that is five times as large as the study corpus 
yielded a larger number of keywords than a 
smaller reference corpus. Corpora larger 
than five times the size of the study corpus 
yielded similar amounts of keywords. The 
implication is that a larger eference corpus 
is not always better than a smaller one, for 
WordSmith Tools Keywords analysis, while 
a reference corpus that is less than five times 
the size of the study corpus may not be 
reliable. There seems to be no need for using 
extremely arge reference corpora, given that 
the number of keywords yielded do not 
seem to change by using corpora larger than 
five times the size of the study corpus.
