In this paper, we propose a new statistical Japanese
dependency parser using a cascaded chunking
model. Conventional Japanese statistical depen-
dency parsers are mainly based on a probabilistic
model, which is not always efficient or scalable. We
propose a new method that is simple and efficient,
since it parses a sentence deterministically only de-
ciding whether the current segment modifies the
segment on its immediate right hand side. Experi-
ments using the Kyoto University Corpus show that
the method outperforms previous systems as well as
improves the parsing and training efficiency.
