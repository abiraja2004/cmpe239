User satisfaction is a common evaluation met-
ric in task-oriented dialogue systems, whereas
tutorial dialogue systems are often evaluated
in terms of student learning gain. However,
user satisfaction is also important for such
systems, since it may predict technology ac-
ceptance. We present a detailed satisfaction
questionnaire used in evaluating the BEETLE
II system (REVU-NL), and explore the un-
derlying components of user satisfaction us-
ing factor analysis. We demonstrate interest-
ing patterns of interaction between interpreta-
tion quality, satisfaction and the dialogue pol-
icy, highlighting the importance of more fine-
grained evaluation of user satisfaction.
