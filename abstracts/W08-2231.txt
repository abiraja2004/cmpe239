The applicability of ontologies for natural language processing depends
on the ability to link ontological concepts and relations to their realisa-
tions in texts. We present a general, resource-poor account to create such
a linking automatically by extracting Wikipedia articles corresponding to
ontology classes. We evaluate our approach in an experiment with the
Music Ontology. We consider linking as a promising starting point for
subsequent steps of information extraction.
