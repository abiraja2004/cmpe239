Hand gesture-based input systems have
been in active research, yet most of them
focus only on single character recognition.
We propose KooSHO: an environment for
Japanese input based on aerial hand ges-
tures. The system provides an integrated
experience of character input, Kana-Kanji
conversion, and search result visualization.
To achieve faster input, users only have to
input consonant, which is then converted
directly to Kanji sequences by direct conso-
nant decoding. The system also shows sug-
gestions to complete the user input. The
comparison with voice recognition and a
screen keyboard showed that KooSHO can
be a more practical solution compared to
the existing system.
