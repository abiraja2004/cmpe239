We investigate the problem of ordering med-
ical events in unstructured clinical narratives
by learning to rank them based on their time
of occurrence. We represent each medical
event as a time duration, with a correspond-
ing start and stop, and learn to rank the
starts/stops based on their proximity to the ad-
mission date. Such a representation allows us
to learn all of Allen?s temporal relations be-
tween medical events. Interestingly, we ob-
serve that this methodology performs better
than a classification-based approach for this
domain, but worse on the relationships found
in the Timebank corpus. This finding has im-
portant implications for styles of data repre-
sentation and resources used for temporal re-
lation learning: clinical narratives may have
different language attributes corresponding to
temporal ordering relative to Timebank, im-
plying that the field may need to look at a
wider range of domains to fully understand the
nature of temporal ordering.
