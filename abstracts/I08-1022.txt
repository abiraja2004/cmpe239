With the popularity of the Internet at a phe-
nomenal rate, an ever-increasing number of
documents in languages other than English
are available in the Internet. Cross lan-
guage text categorization has attracted more
and more attention for the organization of
these heterogeneous document collections.
In this paper, we focus on how to con-
duct effective cross language text catego-
rization. To this end, we propose a cross
language naive Bayes algorithm. The pre-
liminary experiments on collected document
collections show the effectiveness of the pro-
posed method and verify the feasibility of
achieving performance close to monolingual
text categorization, using a bilingual lexicon
alone. Also, our algorithm is more efficient
than our baselines.
