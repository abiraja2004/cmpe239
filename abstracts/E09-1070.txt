Named entity recognition (NER) for En-
glish typically involves one of three gold
standards: MUC, CoNLL, or BBN, all created
by costly manual annotation. Recent work
has used Wikipedia to automatically cre-
ate a massive corpus of named entity an-
notated text.
We present the first comprehensive cross-
corpus evaluation of NER. We identify
the causes of poor cross-corpus perfor-
mance and demonstrate ways of making
them more compatible. Using our process,
we develop a Wikipedia corpus which out-
performs gold standard corpora on cross-
corpus evaluation by up to 11%.
