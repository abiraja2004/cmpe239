Topic segmentation and identification are of-
ten tackled as separate problems whereas
they are both part of topic analysis. In this
article, we study how topic identification can
help to improve a topic segmenter based on
word reiteration. We first present an unsu-
pervised method for discovering the topics
of a text. Then, we detail how these topics
are used by segmentation for finding topical
similarities between text segments. Finally,
we show through the results of an evaluation
done both for French and English the inter-
est of the method we propose.
