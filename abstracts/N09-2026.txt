Voice Search applications provide a very con-
venient and direct access to a broad variety
of services and information. However, due to
the vast amount of information available and
the open nature of the spoken queries, these
applications still suffer from recognition er-
rors. This paper explores the utilization of per-
sonalization features for the post-processing
of recognition results in the form of n-best
lists. Personalization is carried out from three
different angles: short-term, long-term and
Web-based, and a large variety of features are
proposed for use in a log-linear classification
framework.
Experimental results on data obtained from a
commercially deployed Voice Search system
show that the combination of the proposed
features leads to a substantial sentence error
rate reduction. In addition, it is shown that
personalization features which are very dif-
ferent in nature can successfully complement
each other.
