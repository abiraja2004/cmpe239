 
The comma is the most common form of 
punctuation. As such, it may have the 
greatest effect on the syntactic analysis of a 
sentence. As an isolate language, Chinese 
sentences have fewer cues for parsing. The 
clues for segmentation of a long Chinese 
sentence are even fewer. However, the av-
erage frequency of comma usage in Chi-
nese is higher than other languages. The 
comma plays an important role in long 
Chinese sentence segmentation. This paper 
proposes a method for classifying commas 
in Chinese sentences by their context, then 
segments a long sentence according to the 
classification results. Experimental results 
show that accuracy for the comma classifi-
cation reaches 87.1 percent, and with our 
segmentation model, our parser?s depend-
ency parsing accuracy improves by 9.6 per-
cent.
