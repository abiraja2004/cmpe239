This paper discusses the behaviour of Ger-
man particle verbs formed by two-way
prepositions in combination with pleonas-
tic PPs including the verb particle as a
preposition. These particle verbs have a
characteristic feature: some of them li-
cense directional prepositional phrases in
the accusative, some only allow for loca-
tive PPs in the dative, and some parti-
cle verbs can occur with PPs in the ac-
cusative and in the dative. Directional par-
ticle verbs together with directional PPs
present an additional problem: the par-
ticle and the preposition in the PP seem
to provide redundant information. The
paper gives an overview of the semantic
verb classes influencing this phenomenon,
based on corpus data, and explains the un-
derlying reasons for the behaviour of the
particle verbs. We also show how the re-
strictions on particle verbs and pleonastic
PPs can be expressed in a grammar theory
like Lexical Functional Grammar (LFG).
