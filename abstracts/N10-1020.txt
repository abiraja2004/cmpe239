We propose the first unsupervised approach
to the problem of modeling dialogue acts in
an open domain. Trained on a corpus of
noisy Twitter conversations, our method dis-
covers dialogue acts by clustering raw utter-
ances. Because it accounts for the sequential
behaviour of these acts, the learned model can
provide insight into the shape of communica-
tion in a new medium. We address the chal-
lenge of evaluating the emergent model with a
qualitative visualization and an intrinsic con-
versation ordering task. This work is inspired
by a corpus of 1.3 million Twitter conversa-
tions, which will be made publicly available.
This huge amount of data, available only be-
cause Twitter blurs the line between chatting
and publishing, highlights the need to be able
to adapt quickly to a new medium.
