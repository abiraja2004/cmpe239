Documents often have inherently parallel
structure: they may consist of a text and
commentaries, or an abstract and a body,
or parts presenting alternative views on
the same problem. Revealing relations be-
tween the parts by jointly segmenting and
predicting links between the segments,
would help to visualize such documents
and construct friendlier user interfaces. To
address this problem, we propose an un-
supervised Bayesian model for joint dis-
course segmentation and alignment. We
apply our method to the ?English as a sec-
ond language? podcast dataset where each
episode is composed of two parallel parts:
a story and an explanatory lecture. The
predicted topical links uncover hidden re-
lations between the stories and the lec-
tures. In this domain, our method achieves
competitive results, rivaling those of a pre-
viously proposed supervised technique.
