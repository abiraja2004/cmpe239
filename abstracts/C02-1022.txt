Meaning shifting phenomena such as metonymy 
have recently attracted increasing interest of 
researchers. Though these phenomena have been 
addressed by plenty of computational methods, 
the impacts of cardinalities of metonymically 
related items have been widely ignored in all of 
them. Motivated by this lack of analysis, we have 
developed a method for representing expect-
ations and knowledge about the cardinalities of 
metonymically related entities and for exploiting 
this information to build logical forms express-
ing metonymic relations, the entities related, and 
their cardinalities. The representation of lexically 
motivated knowledge is realized as an enhan-
cement to Pustejovsky's Generative Lexicon, and 
the process of building logical forms takes into 
account overwriting of default information and 
mismatch of cardinality requirements. Our 
method enables a precise attachment of sentence 
complements, and it supports reference reso-
lution in the context of metonymic expressions.
