This paper proposes a named entity recog-
nition (NER) method for speech recogni-
tion results that uses confidence on auto-
matic speech recognition (ASR) as a fea-
ture. The ASR confidence feature indi-
cates whether each word has been cor-
rectly recognized. The NER model is
trained using ASR results with named en-
tity (NE) labels as well as the correspond-
ing transcriptions with NE labels. In ex-
periments using support vector machines
(SVMs) and speech data from Japanese
newspaper articles, the proposed method
outperformed a simple application of text-
based NER to ASR results in NER F-
measure by improving precision. These
results show that the proposed method is
effective in NER for noisy inputs.
