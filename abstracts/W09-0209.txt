In this paper, we propose a novel way
to include unsupervised feature selection
methods in probabilistic taxonomy learn-
ing models. We leverage on the computa-
tion of logistic regression to exploit unsu-
pervised feature selection of singular value
decomposition (SVD). Experiments show
that this way of using SVD for feature se-
lection positively affects performances.
