This paper demonstrates one efficient tech-
nique in extracting bilingual word pairs from
non-parallel but comparable corpora. Instead
of using the common approach of taking high
frequency words to build up the initial bilin-
gual lexicon, we show contextually relevant
terms that co-occur with cognate pairs can be
efficiently utilized to build a bilingual dictio-
nary. The result shows that our models using
this technique have significant improvement
over baseline models especially when highest-
ranked translation candidate per word is con-
sidered.
