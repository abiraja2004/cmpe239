 We present a quantitative model of word 
order and movement constraints that enables a 
simple and uniform treatment of a seemingly het-
erogeneous collection of linear order phenomena 
in English, Dutch and German complement con-
structions (Wh-extraction, clause union, extraposi-
tion, verb clustering, particle movement, etc.). Un-
derlying the scheme are central assumptions of the 
psycholinguistically motivated Performance Gram-
mar (PG). Here we describe this formalism in de-
clarative terms based on typed feature unification. 
PG allows a homogenous treatment of both the 
within- and between-language variations of the or-
dering phenomena under discussion, which reduce 
to different settings of a small number of quantita-
tive parameters.
