In this paper, we explore the phenomenon
of Similar Place Avoidance (SPA), ac-
cording to which successive consonants
within stems sharing the same place of
articulation are avoided. This principle
has recently been hypothesized as a uni-
versal tendency although evidence from
only a few languages scattered across the
world has been considered. Using meth-
ods taken from the field of Visual Analyt-
ics, which have demonstrably been shown
to help with understanding complex in-
teractions across large data sets, we in-
vestigated a large crosslinguistic lexical
database (comprising data on more than
4,500 languages) and found that a univer-
sal tendency can indeed be maintained.
