We investigate an important and challeng-
ing problem in summary generation, i.e.,
Evolutionary Trans-Temporal Summarization
(ETTS), which generates news timelines from
massive data on the Internet. ETTS greatly
facilitates fast news browsing and knowl-
edge comprehension, and hence is a neces-
sity. Given the collection of time-stamped web
documents related to the evolving news, ETTS
aims to return news evolution along the time-
line, consisting of individual but correlated
summaries on each date. Existing summariza-
tion algorithms fail to utilize trans-temporal
characteristics among these component sum-
maries. We propose to model trans-temporal
correlations among component summaries for
timelines, using inter-date and intra-date sen-
tence dependencies, and present a novel com-
bination. We develop experimental systems to
compare 5 rival algorithms on 6 instinctively
different datasets which amount to 10251 doc-
uments. Evaluation results in ROUGE metrics
indicate the effectiveness of the proposed ap-
proach based on trans-temporal information.
