This paper explores the use of the homo-
topy method for training a semi-supervised
Hidden Markov Model (HMM) used for
sequence labeling. We provide a novel
polynomial-time algorithm to trace the lo-
cal maximum of the likelihood function
for HMMs from full weight on the la-
beled data to full weight on the unla-
beled data. We present an experimental
analysis of different techniques for choos-
ing the best balance between labeled and
unlabeled data based on the characteris-
tics observed along this path. Further-
more, experimental results on the field seg-
mentation task in information extraction
show that the Homotopy-based method
significantly outperforms EM-based semi-
supervised learning, and provides a more
accurate alternative to the use of held-out
data to pick the best balance for combin-
ing labeled and unlabeled data.
