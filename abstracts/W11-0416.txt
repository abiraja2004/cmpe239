MAE and MAI are lightweight annotation and
adjudication tools for corpus creation. DTDs
are used to define the annotation tags and at-
tributes, including extent tags, link tags, and
non-consuming tags. Both programs are writ-
ten in Java and use a stand-alone SQLite
database for storage and retrieval of annota-
tion data. Output is in stand-off XML.
