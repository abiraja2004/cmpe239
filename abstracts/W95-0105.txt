 
Word groupings useful for language processing tasks are increasingly available, as thesauri appear 
on-line, and as distributional word clustering techniques improve. However, for many tasks, one is 
interested inrelationships among word senses, not words. This paper presents amethod for automatic 
sense disambiguafion fnouns appearing within sets of related nouns -- the kind of data one finds in 
on-line thesauri, or as the output of distributional clustering algorithms. Disambiguation is performed 
with respect o WordNet senses, which are fairly fine-gained; however, the method also permits the 
assignment of higher-level WordNet categories rather than sense labels. The method is illustrated 
primarily by example, though results of a more rigorous evaluation are also presented.
