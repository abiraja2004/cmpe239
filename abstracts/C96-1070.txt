 
We have proposed an incremental trans- 
lation method in Transfer-Driven Ma- 
chine Translation (TDMT). In this 
method, constituent boundary patterns 
are applied to an input in a bottom-up 
fashion. Also, by dealing with best-only 
substructures, the explosion of structural 
ambiguity is constrained and an efficient 
translation of a lengthy input can be 
achieved. Through preliminary exper- 
imentation our new TDMT has been 
shown to be more efficient while main- 
tMning translation quality.
