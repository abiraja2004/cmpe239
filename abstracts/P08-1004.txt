Traditional Information Extraction (IE) takes
a relation name and hand-tagged examples of
that relation as input. Open IE is a relation-
independent extraction paradigm that is tai-
lored to massive and heterogeneous corpora
such as theWeb. An Open IE system extracts a
diverse set of relational tuples from text with-
out any relation-specific input. How is Open
IE possible? We analyze a sample of English
sentences to demonstrate that numerous rela-
tionships are expressed using a compact set
of relation-independent lexico-syntactic pat-
terns, which can be learned by an Open IE sys-
tem.
What are the tradeoffs between Open IE and
traditional IE? We consider this question in
the context of two tasks. First, when the
number of relations is massive, and the rela-
tions themselves are not pre-specified, we ar-
gue that Open IE is necessary. We then present
a new model for Open IE called O-CRF and
show that it achieves increased precision and
nearly double the recall than the model em-
ployed by TEXTRUNNER, the previous state-
of-the-art Open IE system. Second, when the
number of target relations is small, and their
names are known in advance, we show that
O-CRF is able to match the precision of a tra-
ditional extraction system, though at substan-
tially lower recall. Finally, we show how to
combine the two types of systems into a hy-
brid that achieves higher precision than a tra-
ditional extractor, with comparable recall.
