 
Objectives: To explore the phenomenon 
of adjectival modification in biomedical 
discourse across two genres: the biomedi-
cal literature and patient records. Meth-
ods: Adjectival modifiers are removed 
from phrases extracted from two corpora 
(three million noun phrases extracted 
from MEDLINE, on the one hand, and 
clinical notes from the Mayo Clinic, on 
the other). The original phrases, the adjec-
tives extracted, and the resulting demodi-
fied phrases are compared across the two 
corpora after normalization. Quantitative 
comparisons (frequency of occurrence) 
are performed on the whole domain. 
Qualitative comparisons are performed on 
the two subdomains (disorders and proce-
dures). Results: Although the average 
number of adjectives per phrase is equiva-
lent in the two corpora (1.4), there are 
more adjective types in MAYO than in 
MEDLINE for disorders and procedures. 
For disorder phrases, the 38% of adjective 
types common to the two corpora account 
for 85% of the occurrences. The predomi-
nance of adjectives in one corpus is ana-
lyzed. Discussion: Potential applications 
of this approach are discussed, namely 
terminology acquisition, information re-
trieval, and genre characterization.
