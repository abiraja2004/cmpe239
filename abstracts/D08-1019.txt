We present a novel unsupervised sentence fu-
sion method which we apply to a corpus of bi-
ographies in German. Given a group of related
sentences, we align their dependency trees and
build a dependency graph. Using integer lin-
ear programming we compress this graph to
a new tree, which we then linearize. We use
GermaNet and Wikipedia for checking seman-
tic compatibility of co-arguments. In an eval-
uation with human judges our method out-
performs the fusion approach of Barzilay &
McKeown (2005) with respect to readability.
