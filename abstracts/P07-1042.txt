Surface realisers divide into those used in
generation (NLG geared realisers) and those
mirroring the parsing process (Reversible re-
alisers). While the first rely on grammars not
easily usable for parsing, it is unclear how
the second type of realisers could be param-
eterised to yield from among the set of pos-
sible paraphrases, the paraphrase appropri-
ate to a given generation context. In this pa-
per, we present a surface realiser which com-
bines a reversible grammar (used for pars-
ing and doing semantic construction) with a
symbolic means of selecting paraphrases.
