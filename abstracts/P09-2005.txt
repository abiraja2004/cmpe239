 
This paper proposes a novel user intention si-
mulation method which is a data-driven ap-
proach but able to integrate diverse user dis-
course knowledge together to simulate various 
type of users. In Markov logic framework, lo-
gistic regression based data-driven user inten-
tion modeling is introduced, and human dialog 
knowledge are designed into two layers such 
as domain and discourse knowledge, then it is 
integrated with the data-driven model in gen-
eration time. Cooperative, corrective and self-
directing discourse knowledge are designed 
and integrated to mimic such type of users. 
Experiments were carried out to investigate 
the patterns of simulated users, and it turned 
out that our approach was successful to gener-
ate user intention patterns which are not only 
unseen in the training corpus and but also per-
sonalized in the designed direction.
