We have developed an effective prob-
abilistic classifier for document classi-
fication by introducing the concept of
the differential document vectors and
DLSI (differential latent semantics index)
spaces. A simple posteriori calculation
using the intra- and extra-document statis-
tics demonstrates the advantage of the
DLSI space-based probabilistic classifier
over the popularly used LSI space-based
classifier in classification performance.
