We present a method for detecting and
correcting multiple real-word spelling er-
rors using the Google Web 1T 3-gram data
set and a normalized and modified ver-
sion of the Longest Common Subsequence
(LCS) string matching algorithm. Our
method is focused mainly on how to im-
prove the detection recall (the fraction of
errors correctly detected) and the correc-
tion recall (the fraction of errors correctly
amended), while keeping the respective
precisions (the fraction of detections or
amendments that are correct) as high as
possible. Evaluation results on a standard
data set show that our method outperforms
two other methods on the same task.
