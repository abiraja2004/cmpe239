The need for associating, or ground-
ing, protein names in the literature with
the entries of proteome databases such
as Swiss-Prot is well-recognized. The
protein names in the biomedical litera-
ture show a high degree of morpholog-
ical and syntactic variations, and vari-
ous anaphoric expressions including null
anaphors. We present a biomedical
anaphora resolution system, BioAR, in or-
der to address the variations of protein
names and to further associate them with
Swiss-Prot entries as the actual entities in
the world. The system shows the per-
formance of 59.5%  75.0% precision and
40.7%  56.3% recall, depending on the
specific types of anaphoric expressions.
We apply BioAR to the protein names
in the biological interactions as extracted
by our biomedical information extraction
system, or BioIE, in order to construct
protein pathways automatically.
