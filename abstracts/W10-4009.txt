OMNIA is an on-going project that aims
to retrieve images accompanied with
multilingual texts. In this paper, we pro-
pose a generic method (language and do-
main independent) to extract conceptual
information from such texts and sponta-
neous user requests. First, texts are la-
belled with interlingual annotation, then
a generic extractor taking a domain on-
tology as a parameter extract relevant
conceptual information. Implementation
is also presented with a first experiment
and preliminary results.
