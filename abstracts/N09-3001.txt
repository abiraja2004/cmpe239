This paper examines the applicability of clas-
sifier combination approaches such as bagging
and boosting for coreference resolution. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first ef-
fort that utilizes such techniques for corefer-
ence resolution. In this paper, we provide ex-
perimental evidence which indicates that the
accuracy of the coreference engine can po-
tentially be increased by use of bagging and
boosting methods, without any additional fea-
tures or training data. We implement and eval-
uate combination techniques at the mention,
entity and document level, and also address is-
sues like entity alignment, that are specific to
coreference resolution.
