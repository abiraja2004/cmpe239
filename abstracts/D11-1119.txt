We propose a novel way of incorporating de-
pendency parse and word co-occurrence in-
formation into a state-of-the-art web-scale n-
gram model for spelling correction. The syn-
tactic and distributional information provides
extra evidence in addition to that provided by a
web-scale n-gram corpus and especially helps
with data sparsity problems. Experimental
results show that introducing syntactic fea-
tures into n-gram based models significantly
reduces errors by up to 12.4% over the current
state-of-the-art. The word co-occurrence in-
formation shows potential but only improves
overall accuracy slightly.
