This paper describes to what extent deep pro
cessing may benet from shallow processing
techniques and it presents a NLP system which
integrates a linguistic PoS tagger and chunker
as a preprocessing module of a broadcoverage
unicationbased grammar of Spanish Exper
iments show that the eciency of the overall
analysis improves signicantly and that our sys
tem also provides robustness to the linguistic
processing while maintaining both the accuracy
and the precision of the grammar
