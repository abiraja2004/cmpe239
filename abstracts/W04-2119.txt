 
The paper presents an electronic dictionary 
that can be adapted to the needs of different 
NLP applications. It suggests some ways to 
save on software customisation and 
acquisition effort through an intelligent 
developer interface. The emphasis is made on 
the flexibility of data representation, handling 
and access speed.
