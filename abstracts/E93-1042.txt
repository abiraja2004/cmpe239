 
A new class of formal languages will be defined 
the Distributed Index Languages (DI-lan- 
guages). The grammar-formalism generating the 
new class - the DI-grammars - cover unbound 
dependencies in a rather natural way. The place 
of DI-languages in the Chomsky-hierarchy will 
be determined: Like Aho's indexed Languages, 
DI-languages represent a proper subclass of 
Type 1 (contextsensitive languages) and prop- 
erly include Type 2 (context-free languages), but 
the DI-class is neither a subclass nor a super- 
class of Aho's indexed class. It will be shown 
that, apart from DI-grammars, DI-languages can 
equivalently be characterized by a special type of 
automata - DI-automata. Finally, the time com- 
plexity of the recognition-problem for an inter- 
esting subclass of DI-Grammars will approxi- 
mately be determined.
