This paper briefly reports our submissions to
the Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) task
in the SemEval 2012 (Task 6). We first use
knowledge-based methods to compute word
semantic similarity as well as Word Sense Dis-
ambiguation (WSD). We also consider word
order similarity from the structure of the sen-
tence. Finally we sum up several aspects of
similarity with different coefficients and get
the sentence similarity score.
