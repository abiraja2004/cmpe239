Recently proposed deterministic classifier-
based parsers (Nivre and Scholz, 2004;
Sagae and Lavie, 2005; Yamada and Mat-
sumoto, 2003) offer attractive alternatives
to generative statistical parsers. Determin-
istic parsers are fast, efficient, and sim-
ple to implement, but generally less ac-
curate than optimal (or nearly optimal)
statistical parsers. We present a statis-
tical shift-reduce parser that bridges the
gap between deterministic and probabilis-
tic parsers. The parsing model is essen-
tially the same as one previously used
for deterministic parsing, but the parser
performs a best-first search instead of a
greedy search. Using the standard sec-
tions of the WSJ corpus of the Penn Tree-
bank for training and testing, our parser
has 88.1% precision and 87.8% recall (us-
ing automatically assigned part-of-speech
tags). Perhaps more interestingly, the pars-
ing model is significantly different from
the generative models used by other well-
known accurate parsers, allowing for a
simple combination that produces preci-
sion and recall of 90.9% and 90.7%, re-
spectively.
