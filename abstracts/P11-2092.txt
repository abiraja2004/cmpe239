We present a class-based language model that
clusters rare words of similar morphology
together. The model improves the predic-
tion of words after histories containing out-
of-vocabulary words. The morphological fea-
tures used are obtained without the use of la-
beled data. The perplexity improvement com-
pared to a state of the art Kneser-Ney model is
4% overall and 81% on unknown histories.
