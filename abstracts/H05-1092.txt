We address the problem of multi-way re-
lation classification, applied to identifica-
tion of the interactions between proteins
in bioscience text. A major impediment
to such work is the acquisition of appro-
priately labeled training data; for our ex-
periments we have identified a database
that serves as a proxy for training data.
We use two graphical models and a neu-
ral net for the classification of the inter-
actions, achieving an accuracy of 64%
for a 10-way distinction between relation
types. We also provide evidence that the
exploitation of the sentences surrounding
a citation to a paper can yield higher accu-
racy than other sentences.
