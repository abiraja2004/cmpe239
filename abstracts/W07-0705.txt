Current statistical machine translation sys-
tems handle the translation process as the
transformation of a string of symbols into
another string of symbols. Normally the
symbols dealt with are the words in differ-
ent languages, sometimes with some addi-
tional information included, like morpho-
logical data. In this work we try to push
the approach to the limit, working not on the
level of words, but treating both the source
and target sentences as a string of letters.
We try to find out if a nearly unmodified
state-of-the-art translation system is able to
cope with the problem and whether it is ca-
pable to further generalize translation rules,
for example at the level of word suffixes and
translation of unseen words. Experiments
are carried out for the translation of Catalan
to Spanish.
