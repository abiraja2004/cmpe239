 
In this paper we present Morphy, an inte- 
grated tool for German morphology, part-of- 
speech tagging and context-sensitive lem- 
matization. Its large lexicon of more than 
320,000 word forms plus its ability to pro- 
cess German compound nouns guarantee a 
wide morphological coverage. Syntactic 
ambiguities can be resolved with a standard 
statistical part-of-speech tagger. By using 
the output of the tagger, the lemmatizer can 
determine the correct root even for ambi- 
guous word forms. The complete package is 
freely available and can be downloaded 
from the World Wide Web.
