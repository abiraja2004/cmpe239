We developed caitra, a novel tool that aids
human translators by (a) making sugges-
tions for sentence completion in an inter-
active machine translation setting, (b) pro-
viding alternative word and phrase trans-
lations, and (c) allowing them to post-
edit machine translation output. The tool
uses the Moses decoder, is implemented in
Ruby on Rails and C++ and delivered over
the web.
