We report on an empirical study of sense
relations in the Senseval-2 test suite. We
apply and extend the method described
in (Resnik and Yarowsky, 1999), estimat-
ing proximity of sense pairs from the evi-
dence collected from native-speaker trans-
lations of 508 contexts across 4 Indoeu-
ropean languages representing 3 language
families. A control set composed of 65
contexts has also been annotated in 12
languages (including 2 non-Indoeuropean
languages) in order to estimate the corre-
lation between parallel polysemy and lan-
guage family distance. A new parame-
ter, sense stability, is introduced to assess
the homogeneity of each individual sense
definition. Finally, we combine the sense
proximity estimation with a classification
of semantic relations between senses.
