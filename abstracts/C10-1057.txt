Fact collections are mostly built using
semi-supervised relation extraction tech-
niques and wisdom of the crowds meth-
ods, rendering them inherently noisy. In
this paper, we propose to validate the re-
sulting facts by leveraging global con-
straints inherent in large fact collections,
observing that correct facts will tend to
match their arguments with other facts
more often than with incorrect ones. We
model this intuition as a graph-ranking
problem over a fact graph and explore
novel random walk algorithms. We
present an empirical study, over a large set
of facts extracted from a 500 million doc-
ument webcrawl, validating the model and
showing that it improves fact quality over
state-of-the-art methods.
