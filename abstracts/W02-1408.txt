Term recognition and clustering are key topics in automatic knowledge acquisition and text mining. In
this paper we present a novel approach to the automatic discovery of term similarities, which serves as
a basis for both classification and clustering of domain-specific concepts represented by terms. The
method is based on automatic extraction of significant patterns in which terms tend to appear. The
approach is domain independent: it needs no manual description of domain-specific features and it is
based on knowledge-poor processing of specific term features. However, automatically collected
patterns are domain specific and identify significant contexts in which terms are used. Beside features
that represent contextual patterns, we use lexical and functional similarities between terms to define a
combined similarity measure. The approach has been tested and evaluated in the domain of molecular
biology, and preliminary results are presented.
