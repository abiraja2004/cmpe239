We report on a series of experiments
with probabilistic context-free grammars
predicting English and German syllable
structure. The treebank-trained grammars
are evaluated on a syllabification task. The
grammar used by Mu?ller (2002) serves
as point of comparison. As she evalu-
ates the grammar only for German, we re-
implement the grammar and experiment
with additional phonotactic features. Us-
ing bi-grams within the syllable, we can
model the dependency from the previous
consonant in the onset and coda. A 10-
fold cross validation procedure shows that
syllabification can be improved by incor-
porating this type of phonotactic knowl-
edge. Compared to the grammar of Mu?ller
(2002), syllable boundary accuracy in-
creases from 95.8% to 97.2% for En-
glish, and from 95.9% to 97.2% for Ger-
man. Moreover, our experiments with
different syllable structures point out that
there are dependencies between the on-
set on the nucleus for German but not
for English. The analysis of one of our
phonotactic grammars shows that inter-
esting phonotactic constraints are learned.
For instance, unvoiced consonants are the
most likely first consonants and liquids
and glides are preferred as second conso-
nants in two-consonantal onsets.
