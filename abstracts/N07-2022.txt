In present Statistical Machine Translation
(SMT) systems, alignment is trained in a
previous stage as the translation model.
Consequently, alignment model parame-
ters are not tuned in function of the trans-
lation task, but only indirectly. In this
paper, we propose a novel framework for
discriminative training of alignment mod-
els with automated translation metrics as
maximization criterion. In this approach,
alignments are optimized for the transla-
tion task. In addition, no link labels at the
word level are needed. This framework
is evaluated in terms of automatic trans-
lation evaluation metrics, and an improve-
ment of translation quality is observed.
