mance of the Sphinx system for speaker-independent co tin- 
uous speech recognition. The recognition error ate is signifi- 
cantly reduced with incorporation ofadditional dynamic fea- 
tures, semi-continuous hidden Markov models, and speaker 
clustering. For the June 1990 (RM2) evaluation test set, the 
error rates of our current system are 4.3% and 19.9% for 
word-pair grammar and no grammar respectively.
