 
The lack of readily-available large cor-
pora of aligned monolingual sentence 
pairs is a major obstacle to the devel-
opment of Statistical Machine Transla-
tion-based paraphrase models. In this 
paper, we describe the use of annotated 
datasets and Support Vector Machines 
to induce larger monolingual para-
phrase corpora from a comparable cor-
pus of news clusters found on the 
World Wide Web.  Features include: 
morphological variants; WordNet 
synonyms and hypernyms; log-
likelihood-based word pairings dy-
namically obtained from baseline sen-
tence alignments; and formal string 
features such as word-based edit dis-
tance. Use of this technique dramati-
cally reduces the Alignment Error Rate 
of the extracted corpora over heuristic 
methods based on position of the sen-
tences in the text.
