 
In this paper we present the development of a 
corpus of French newswire texts annotated 
with enunciative and modal commitment in-
formation. The annotation scheme we propose 
is based on the detection of predicative cues - 
referring to an enunciative and/or modal varia-
tion - and their scope at a sentence level. We 
describe how we have improved our annota-
tion guideline by using the evaluation (in 
terms of precision, recall and F-Measure) of a 
first round of annotation produced by two ex-
pert annotators and by our automatic annota-
tion system.
