We present a graph-based semi-supervised la-
bel propagation algorithm for acquiring open-
domain labeled classes and their instances
from a combination of unstructured and struc-
tured text sources. This acquisition method
significantly improves coverage compared to
a previous set of labeled classes and instances
derived from free text, while achieving com-
parable precision.
