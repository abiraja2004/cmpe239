We address the task of automatic discovery of
information extraction template from a given
text collection. Our approach clusters candi-
date slot fillers to identify meaningful tem-
plate slots. We propose a generative model
that incorporates distributional prior knowl-
edge to help distribute candidates in a docu-
ment into appropriate slots. Empirical results
suggest that the proposed prior can bring sub-
stantial improvements to our task as compared
to a K-means baseline and a Gaussian mixture
model baseline. Specifically, the proposed
prior has shown to be effective when coupled
with discriminative features of the candidates.
