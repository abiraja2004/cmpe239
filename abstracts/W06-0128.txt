 
Most of the Chinese word segmentation 
systems utilizes monolingual dictionary 
and are used for monolingual processing.  
For the tasks of machine translation (MT) 
and cross-language information retrieval 
(CLIR), another translation dictionary 
may be used to transfer the words of 
documents from the source languages to 
target languages.  The inconsistencies re-
sulting from the two types of dictionaries 
(segmentation dictionary and transfer 
dictionary) may produce some problems 
for MT and CLIR.  This paper shows the 
effectiveness of the external resources 
(bilingual dictionary and word list) for 
Chinese word segmentations.
