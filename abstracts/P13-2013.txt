We present a reformulation of the word
pair features typically used for the task
of disambiguating implicit relations in the
Penn Discourse Treebank. Our word pair
features achieve significantly higher per-
formance than the previous formulation
when evaluated without additional fea-
tures. In addition, we present results
for a full system using additional features
which achieves close to state of the art per-
formance without resorting to gold syntac-
tic parses or to context outside the relation.
