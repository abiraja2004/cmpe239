We describe a learning-based system that
creates draft reports based on observation
of people preparing such reports in a tar-
get domain (conference replanning). The
reports (or briefings) are based on a mix
of text and event data. The latter consist
of task creation and completion actions,
collected from a wide variety of sources
within the target environment. The report
drafting system is part of a larger learning-
based cognitive assistant system that im-
proves the quality of its assistance based
on an opportunity to learn from observa-
tion. The system can learn to accurately
predict the briefing assembly behavior and
shows significant performance improve-
ments relative to a non-learning system,
demonstrating that it?s possible to create
meaningful verbal descriptions of activity
from event streams.
