 
The present study explores the vocal intensity 
of turn-initial cue phrases in a corpus of dia-
logues in Swedish. Cue phrases convey rela-
tively little propositional content, but have 
several important pragmatic functions. The 
majority of these entities are frequently occur-
ring monosyllabic words such as ?eh?, ?mm?, 
?ja?. Prosodic analysis shows that these words 
are produced with higher intensity than other 
turn-initial words are. In light of these results, 
it is suggested that speakers produce these ex-
pressions with high intensity in order to claim 
the floor. It is further shown that the difference 
in intensity can be measured as a dynamic in-
ter-speaker relation over the course of a dia-
logue using the end of the interlocutor?s previ-
ous turn as a reference point.
