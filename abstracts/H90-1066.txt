 
A model-based spectral estimation algorithm is derived 
that improves the robustness of speech recognition 
systems to additive noise. The algorithm is tailored for 
filter-bank-based systems, where the estimation should 
seek to minimize the distortion as measured by the 
recognizer's distance metric. This estimation criterion is 
approximated by minimizing the Euclidean distance 
between spectral log-energy vectors, which is equivalent 
to minimizing the nonweighted, nontruncated cepstral 
distance. Correlations between frequency channels are 
incorporated in the estimation by modeling the spectral 
distribution of speech as a mixture of components, each 
representing a different speech class, and assuming that 
spectral energies at different frequency channels are 
uncorrelated within each class. The algorithm was tested 
with SRI's continuous-speech, speaker-independent, 
hidden Markov model recognition system using the large- 
vocabulary NIST "Resource Management Task." When 
trained on a clean-speech database and tested with 
additive white Gaussian noise, the new algorithm has an 
error rate half of that with MMSE estimation of log 
spectral energies at individual frequency channels, and it 
achieves a level similar to that with the ideal condition of 
training and testing at constant SNR. The algorithm is 
also very efficient with additive environmental noise, 
recorded with a desktop microphone.
