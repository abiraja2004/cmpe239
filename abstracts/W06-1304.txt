We explore the relationship between ques-
tion answering and constraint relaxation in
spoken dialog systems. We develop dia-
logue strategies for selecting and present-
ing information succinctly. In particular,
we describe methods for dealing with the
results of database queries in information-
seeking dialogs. Our goal is to structure
the dialogue in such a way that the user is
neither overwhelmed with information nor
left uncertain as to how to refine the query
further. We present evaluation results ob-
tained from a user study involving 20 sub-
jects in a restaurant selection task.
