 
This paper offers a provisional mathemat- 
ical typology of metrical representations. 
First, a family of algebras corresponding 
to different versions of grid and bracketed 
grid theory is introduced. It is subsequently 
shown in what way bracketed grid theory 
differs from metrical theories using trees. 
Finally, we show that there are no sig- 
nificant differences between the formalism 
of bracketed grids (for metrical structure) 
and the representation used in the work of 
\[Kaye, et al, 1985\], \[1990\] for subsyllabic 
structure.
