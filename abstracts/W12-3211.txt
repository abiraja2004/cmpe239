Extracting textual content and document
structure from PDF presents a surprisingly
(depressingly, to some, in fact) difficult chal-
lenge, owing to the purely display-oriented de-
sign of the PDF document standard. While a
variety of lower-level PDF extraction toolk-
its exist, none fully support the recovery of
original text (in reading order) and relevant
structural elements, even for so-called born-
digital PDFs, i.e. those prepared electronically
using typesetting systems like LATEX, OpenOf-
fice, and the like. This short paper summarizes
a new tool for high-quality extraction of text
and structure from PDFs, combining state-of-
the-art PDF parsing, font interpretation, layout
analysis, and TEI-compliant output of text and
logical document markup.?
