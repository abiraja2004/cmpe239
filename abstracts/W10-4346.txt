Little research has been done to explore
differences in the interactional aspects of
dialogue between children with Autis-
tic Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and those
with typical development (TD). Quantify-
ing the differences could aid in diagnosing
ASD, understanding its nature, and better
understanding the mechanisms of dialogue
processing. In this paper, we report on a
study of dialogues with children with ASD
and TD. We find that the two groups differ
substantially in how long they pause be-
fore speaking, and their use of fillers, ac-
knowledgments, and discourse markers.
