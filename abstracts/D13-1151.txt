 
The identification of pseudepigraphic texts ? 
texts not written by the authors to which they 
are attributed ? has important historical, fo-
rensic and commercial applications. We in-
troduce an unsupervised technique for identi-
fying pseudepigrapha. The idea is to identify 
textual outliers in a corpus based on the pair-
wise similarities of all documents in the cor-
pus. The crucial point is that document simi-
larity not be measured in any of the standard 
ways but rather be based on the output of a re-
cently introduced algorithm for authorship ve-
rification. The proposed method strongly 
outperforms existing techniques in systematic 
experiments on a blog corpus.
