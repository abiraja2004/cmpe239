Selecting important information while account-
ing for repetitions is a hard task for both sum-
marization and question answering. We pro-
pose a formal model that represents a collec-
tion of documents in a two-dimensional space
of textual and conceptual units with an asso-
ciated mapping between these two dimensions.
This representation is then used to describe the
task of selecting textual units for a summary or
answer as a formal optimization task. We pro-
vide approximation algorithms and empirically
validate the performance of the proposed model
when used with two very different sets of fea-
tures, words and atomic events.
