We present a grand challenge to build a
corpus that will include all of the world?s
languages, in a consistent structure that
permits large-scale cross-linguistic pro-
cessing, enabling the study of universal
linguistics. The focal data types, bilin-
gual texts and lexicons, relate each lan-
guage to one of a set of reference lan-
guages. We propose that the ability to train
systems to translate into and out of a given
language be the yardstick for determin-
ing when we have successfully captured a
language. We call on the computational
linguistics community to begin work on
this Universal Corpus, pursuing the many
strands of activity described here, as their
contribution to the global effort to docu-
ment the world?s linguistic heritage before
more languages fall silent.
