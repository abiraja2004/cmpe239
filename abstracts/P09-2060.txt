We investigate the use of Fisher?s exact
significance test for pruning the transla-
tion table of a hierarchical phrase-based
statistical machine translation system. In
addition to the significance values com-
puted by Fisher?s exact test, we introduce
compositional properties to classify phrase
pairs of same significance values. We also
examine the impact of using significance
values as a feature in translation mod-
els. Experimental results show that 1% to
2% BLEU improvements can be achieved
along with substantial model size reduc-
tion in an Iraqi/English two-way transla-
tion task.
