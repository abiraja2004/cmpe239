We investigate the effectiveness of self-
training PCFG grammars with latent anno-
tations (PCFG-LA) for parsing languages
with different amounts of labeled training
data. Compared to Charniak?s lexicalized
parser, the PCFG-LA parser was more ef-
fectively adapted to a language for which
parsing has been less well developed (i.e.,
Chinese) and benefited more from self-
training. We show for the first time that
self-training is able to significantly im-
prove the performance of the PCFG-LA
parser, a single generative parser, on both
small and large amounts of labeled train-
ing data. Our approach achieves state-
of-the-art parsing accuracies for a single
parser on both English (91.5%) and Chi-
nese (85.2%).
