This paper presents preliminary work to ex-
tract script-like structures, called events and
event sets, from collections of web docu-
ments. Our approach, contrary to existing
methods, is topic-driven in the sense that event
sets are extracted for a specified topic. We
introduce an iterative system architecture and
present methods to reduce noise problems
with web corpora. Preliminary results show
that LSA-based event relatedness yields bet-
ter event sets from web corpora than previous
methods.
