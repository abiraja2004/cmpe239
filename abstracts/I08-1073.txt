In recent years there have been various ap-
proaches aimed at automatic acquisition of
predominant senses of words. This infor-
mation can be exploited as a powerful back-
off strategy for word sense disambiguation
given the zipfian distribution of word senses.
Approaches which do not require manually
sense-tagged data have been proposed for
English exploiting lexical resources avail-
able, notably WordNet. In these approaches
distributional similarity is coupled with a se-
mantic similarity measure which ties the dis-
tributionally related words to the sense in-
ventory. The semantic similarity measures
that have been used have all taken advantage
of the hierarchical information in WordNet.
We investigate the applicability to Japanese
and demonstrate the feasibility of a mea-
sure which uses only information in the dic-
tionary definitions, in contrast with previ-
ous work on English which uses hierarchi-
cal information in addition to dictionary def-
initions. We extend the definition based
semantic similarity measure with distribu-
tional similarity applied to the words in dif-
ferent definitions. This increases the recall
of our method and in some cases, precision
as well.
