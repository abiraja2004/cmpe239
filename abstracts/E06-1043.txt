We investigate the lexical and syntactic
flexibility of a class of idiomatic expres-
sions. We develop measures that draw
on such linguistic properties, and demon-
strate that these statistical, corpus-based
measures can be successfully used for dis-
tinguishing idiomatic combinations from
non-idiomatic ones. We also propose
a means for automatically determining
which syntactic forms a particular idiom
can appear in, and hence should be in-
cluded in its lexical representation.
