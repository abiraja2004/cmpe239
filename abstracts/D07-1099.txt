We use a generative history-based model to
predict the most likely derivation of a de-
pendency parse. Our probabilistic model is
based on Incremental Sigmoid Belief Net-
works, a recently proposed class of la-
tent variable models for structure predic-
tion. Their ability to automatically in-
duce features results in multilingual pars-
ing which is robust enough to achieve accu-
racy well above the average for each indi-
vidual language in the multilingual track of
the CoNLL-2007 shared task. This robust-
ness led to the third best overall average la-
beled attachment score in the task, despite
using no discriminative methods. We also
demonstrate that the parser is quite fast, and
can provide even faster parsing times with-
out much loss of accuracy.
