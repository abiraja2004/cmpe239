 
We describe an approach to surface generation designed for 
a "pragmatics-based" dialogue system. The implementation 
has been extended to deal with certain well-known 
difficulties with the underlying linguistic formalism 
(Categorial Grammar) at the same time yielding a system 
capable of supporting incremental generation as well as 
interpretation. Aspects of the formalism used for the initial 
description that constitutes the interface with the planning 
component are also discussed.
