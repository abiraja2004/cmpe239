. Linguistic information can help improve evaluation of simi-
larity between documents; however, the kind of linguistic information to
be used depends on the task. In this paper, we show that distributions
of syntactic structures capture the way works are written and accurately
identify individual books more than 76% of the time. In comparison,
baseline features, e.g., tfidf-weighted keywords, function words, etc., give
an accuracy of at most 66%. However, testing the same features on au-
thorship attribution shows that distributions of syntactic structures are
less successful than function words on this task; syntactic structures vary
even among the works of the same author whereas features such as func-
tion words are distributed more similarly among the works of an author
and can more effectively capture authorship.
