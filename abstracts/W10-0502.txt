 
Article terms can move stock prices.  By ana-
lyzing verbs in financial news articles and 
coupling their usage with a discrete machine 
learning algorithm tied to stock price move-
ment, we can build a model of price move-
ment based upon the verbs used, to not only 
identify those terms that can move a stock 
price the most, but also whether they move the 
predicted price up or down.
