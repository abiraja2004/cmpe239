Natural language processing (NLP) is
critical for improvement of the healthcare
process because it has the potential to en-
code the vast amount of clinical data in
textual patient reports. Many clinical ap-
plications require coded data to function
appropriately, such as decision support
and quality assurance applications. How-
ever, in order to be applicable in the clini-
cal domain, performance of the NLP
systems must be adequate. A valuable
clinical application is the detection of in-
fectious diseases, such as surveillance of
healthcare-associated pneumonia in new-
borns (e.g. neonates) because it produces
significant rates of morbidity and mortal-
ity, and manual surveillance of respiratory
infection in these patients is a challenge.
Studies have already demonstrated that
automated surveillance using NLP tools is
a useful adjunct to manual clinical man-
agement, and is an effective tool for in-
fection control practitioners. This paper
presents a study aimed at evaluating the
feasibility of an NLP-based electronic
clinical monitoring system to identify
healthcare-associated pneumonia in neo-
nates. We estimated sensitivity, specific-
ity, and positive predictive value by
comparing the detection with clinicians?
judgments and our results demonstrated
that the automated method was indeed
feasible. Sensitivity (recall) was 87.5%,
and specificity (true negative rates) was
94.1%.
