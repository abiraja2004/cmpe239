We generalize Uno and Yagiura?s algo-
rithm for finding all common intervals of
two permutations to the setting of two
sequences with many-to-many alignment
links across the two sides. We show how
to maximally decompose a word-aligned
sentence pair in linear time, which can be
used to generate all possible phrase pairs
or a Synchronous Context-Free Grammar
(SCFG) with the simplest rules possible.
We also use the algorithm to precisely
analyze the maximum SCFG rule length
needed to cover hand-aligned data from
various language pairs.
