A person may have multiple name aliases
on the Web. Identifying aliases of a name
is important for various tasks such as in-
formation retrieval, sentiment analysis and
name disambiguation. We introduce the no-
tion of a word co-occurrence graph to rep-
resent the mutual relations between words
that appear in anchor texts. Words in an-
chor texts are represented as nodes in the
co-occurrence graph and an edge is formed
between nodes which link to the same url.
For a given personal name, its neighboring
nodes in the graph are considered as can-
didates of its aliases. We formalize alias
identification as a problem of ranking nodes
in this graph with respect to a given name.
We integrate various ranking scores through
support vector machines to leverage a robust
ranking function and use it to extract aliases
for a given name. Experimental results on a
dataset of Japanese celebrities show that the
proposed method outperforms all baselines,
displaying a MRR score of 0.562.
