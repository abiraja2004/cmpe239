 
In this article, we propose a novel classifier 
based on quantum computation theory. Differ-
ent from existing methods, we consider the 
classification as an evolutionary process of a 
physical system and build the classifier by us-
ing the basic quantum mechanics equation. 
The performance of the experiments on two 
datasets indicates feasibility and potentiality of 
the quantum classifier.
