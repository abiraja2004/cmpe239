 
We present a method for learning to find 
English to Chinese transliterations on the 
Web. In our approach, proper nouns are 
expanded into new queries aimed at maxi-
mizing the probability of retrieving trans-
literations from existing search engines. 
The method involves learning the sublexi-
cal relationships between names and their 
transliterations. At run-time, a given name 
is automatically extended into queries with 
relevant morphemes, and transliterations in 
the returned search snippets are extracted 
and ranked. We present a new system, 
TermMine, that applies the method to find 
transliterations of a given name. Evaluation 
on a list of 500 proper names shows that 
the method achieves high precision and re-
call, and outperforms commercial machine 
translation systems.
