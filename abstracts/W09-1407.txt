We approached the problems of event detec-
tion, argument identification, and negation and
speculation detection as one of concept recog-
nition and analysis. Our methodology in-
volved using the OpenDMAP semantic parser
with manually-written rules. We achieved
state-of-the-art precision for two of the three
tasks, scoring the highest of 24 teams at pre-
cision of 71.81 on Task 1 and the highest of 6
teams at precision of 70.97 on Task 2.
The OpenDMAP system and the rule set are
available at bionlp.sourceforge.net.
