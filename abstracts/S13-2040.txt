This paper presents the SemEval-2013 task on
multilingual Word Sense Disambiguation. We
describe our experience in producing a mul-
tilingual sense-annotated corpus for the task.
The corpus is tagged with BabelNet 1.1.1,
a freely-available multilingual encyclopedic
dictionary and, as a byproduct, WordNet 3.0
and the Wikipedia sense inventory. We present
and analyze the results of participating sys-
tems, and discuss future directions.
