In this paper, we present a PropBank of
clinical Finnish, an annotated corpus of
verbal propositions and arguments. The
clinical PropBank is created on top of a
previously existing dependency treebank
annotated in the Stanford Dependency
(SD) scheme and covers 90% of all verb
occurrences in the treebank.
We establish that the PropBank scheme
is applicable to clinical Finnish as well
as compatible with the SD scheme, with
an overwhelming proportion of arguments
being governed by the verb. This allows
argument candidates to be restricted to di-
rect verb dependents, substantially simpli-
fying the PropBank construction.
The clinical Finnish PropBank
is freely available at the address
