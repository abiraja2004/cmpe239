While there have been many attempts to
estimate the emotion of an addresser from
her/his utterance, few studies have ex-
plored how her/his utterance affects the
emotion of the addressee. This has mo-
tivated us to investigate two novel tasks:
predicting the emotion of the addressee
and generating a response that elicits a
specific emotion in the addressee?s mind.
We target Japanese Twitter posts as a
source of dialogue data and automatically
build training data for learning the pre-
dictors and generators. The feasibility of
our approaches is assessed by using 1099
utterance-response pairs that are built by
five human workers.
