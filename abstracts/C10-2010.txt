We address the problem of unsupervised
and language-pair independent alignment
of symmetrical and asymmetrical parallel
corpora. Asymmetrical parallel corpora
contain a large proportion of 1-to-0/0-to-1
and 1-to-many/many-to-1 sentence corre-
spondences. We have developed a novel
approach which is fast and allows us to
achieve high accuracy in terms of F1 for
the alignment of both asymmetrical and
symmetrical parallel corpora. The source
code of our aligner and the test sets are
freely available.
