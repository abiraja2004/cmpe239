We investigate different feature sets for
performing automatic sentence-level dis-
course segmentation within a general ma-
chine learning approach, including features
derived from either finite-state or context-
free annotations. We achieve the best re-
ported performance on this task, and demon-
strate that our SPADE-inspired context-free
features are critical to achieving this level of
accuracy. This counters recent results sug-
gesting that purely finite-state approaches
can perform competitively.
