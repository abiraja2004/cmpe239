A hybrid convolution tree kernel is pro-
posed in this paper to effectively model
syntactic structures for semantic role la-
beling (SRL). The hybrid kernel consists
of two individual convolution kernels: a
Path kernel, which captures predicate-
argument link features, and a Constituent
Structure kernel, which captures the syn-
tactic structure features of arguments.
Evaluation on the datasets of CoNLL-
2005 SRL shared task shows that the
novel hybrid convolution tree kernel out-
performs the previous tree kernels. We
also combine our new hybrid tree ker-
nel based method with the standard rich
flat feature based method. The experi-
mental results show that the combinational
method can get better performance than
each of them individually.
