Most of the work on treebank-based sta-
tistical parsing exclusively uses the Wall-
Street-Journal part of the Penn treebank
for evaluation purposes. Due to the pres-
ence of this quasi-standard, the question of
to which degree parsing results depend on
the properties of treebanks was often ig-
nored. In this paper, we use two similar
German treebanks, Tu?Ba-D/Z and NeGra,
and investigate the role that different an-
notation decisions play for parsing. For
these purposes, we approximate the two
treebanks by gradually taking out or in-
serting the corresponding annotation com-
ponents and test the performance of a stan-
dard PCFG parser on all treebank versions.
Our results give an indication of which
structures are favorable for parsing and
which ones are not.
