  
Communication among agents collaborating on a task 
often involves complex utterances about multiple ac- 
tions. In this paper, we analyze two particular multi- 
action constructions, utterances with means clauses 
and utterances with rationale clauses. We present 
the distinctive features of these constructions, de- 
scribe their logical form, and define interpretation 
rules for deriving their meaning in terms of the gener- 
ation, enablement and Contributes relations between 
actions which have been motivated independently by 
research in plan recognition. We also demonstrate hat 
these rules yield the appropriate properties of ratio- 
nale clauses and means clauses and show how these 
constructions can be distinguished algorithmically.
