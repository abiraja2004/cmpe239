 
Event Anaphora Resolution is an important 
task for cascaded event template extraction 
and other NLP study. In this paper, we provide 
a first systematic study of resolving pronouns 
to their event verb antecedents for general 
purpose. First, we explore various positional, 
lexical and syntactic features useful for the 
event pronoun resolution. We further explore 
tree kernel to model structural information 
embedded in syntactic parses. A composite 
kernel is then used to combine the above di-
verse information. In addition, we employed a 
twin-candidate based preferences learning 
model to capture the pair wise candidates? pre-
ference knowledge. Besides we also look into 
the incorporation of the negative training in-
stances with anaphoric pronouns whose ante-
cedents are not verbs. Although these negative 
training instances are not used in previous 
study on anaphora resolution, our study shows 
that they are very useful for the final resolu-
tion through random sampling strategy. Our 
experiments demonstrate that it?s meaningful 
to keep certain training data as development 
data to help SVM select a more accurate hyper 
plane which provides significant improvement 
over the default setting with all training data.
