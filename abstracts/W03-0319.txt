the Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) 
methodology to a small collection of 
parallel texts in French and English.   The 
goal of the analysis was to determine  what  
the methodology might  reveal regarding 
the difficulty level of either the machine-
translation (MT) task or the text-alignment 
(TA) task. 
 
In a perfectly parallel corpus where the 
texts are exactly aligned, it is expected that 
the word distributions between the two 
languages be perfectly symmetrical.  
Where they are symmetrical, the difficulty 
level of the machine-translation or the text-
alignment task should be low.  The results 
of this analysis show that even in a 
perfectly aligned corpus, the word 
distributions between the two languages 
deviate and because they do, LSA may 
contribute much to our understanding of 
the difficulty of the MT and TA tasks.

This paper discusses an implementation of the 
Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) methodology against 
a small collection of perfectly parallel texts in French 
and English1.  The texts were made available by the 
HLT-NAACL and are taken from daily House journals 
of the Canadian Parliament.  They were edited by 
Ulrich Germann.   The LSA procedures were 
implemented in R, a system for statistical computation 
and graphics, and were written by John C. Paolillo at 
Indiana University, Bloomington.
