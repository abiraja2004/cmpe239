A composition procedure for linear and
nondeleting extended top-down tree trans-
ducers is presented. It is demonstrated that
the new procedure is more widely applica-
ble than the existing methods. In general,
the result of the composition is an extended
top-down tree transducer that is no longer
linear or nondeleting, but in a number of
cases these properties can easily be recov-
ered by a post-processing step.
