We describe a new version of the Dutch
word sense disambiguation system trained
and tested on a corrected version of the
SENSEVAL-2 data. The system is an en-
semble of word experts; each word expert
is a memory-based classifier of which the
parameters are automatically determined
through cross-validation on training ma-
terial. The original best-performing sys-
tem, which used only local context fea-
tures for disambiguation, is further refined
by performing additional parallel cross-
validation experiments for optimizing al-
gorithmic parameters and the amount of
local context available to each of the word
experts? memory-based kernels. This pro-
cedure produces an accuracy of 84.8%
on test material, improving on a base-
line score of 77.2% and the previous
SENSEVAL-2 score of 84.2%. We show
that cross-validation overfits; had the lo-
cal context been held constant at two left
and right neighbouring words, the system
would have scored 85.0%.
