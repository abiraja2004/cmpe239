In this paper we present our approach for
assigning degrees of relational similarity to
pairs of words in the SemEval-2012 Task 2.
To measure relational similarity we employed
lexical patterns that can match against word
pairs within a large corpus of 12 million docu-
ments. Patterns are weighted by obtaining sta-
tistically estimated lower bounds on their pre-
cision for extracting word pairs from a given
relation. Finally, word pairs are ranked based
on a model predicting the probability that they
belong to the relation of interest. This ap-
proach achieved the best results on the Se-
mEval 2012 Task 2, obtaining a Spearman cor-
relation of 0.229 and an accuracy on reproduc-
ing human answers to MaxDiff questions of
39.4%.
