This paper addresses the difficulties in rec-
ognizing Japanese abbreviations through the
use of previous approaches, examining ac-
tual usages of parenthetical expressions in
newspaper articles. In order to bridge the
gap between Japanese abbreviations and
their full forms, we present a discrimina-
tive approach to abbreviation recognition.
More specifically, we formalize the abbrevi-
ation recognition task as a binary classifica-
tion problem in which a classifier determines
a positive (abbreviation) or negative (non-
abbreviation) class, given a candidate of ab-
breviation definition. The proposed method
achieved 95.7% accuracy, 90.0% precision,
and 87.6% recall on the evaluation corpus
containing 7,887 (1,430 abbreviations and
6,457 non-abbreviation) instances of paren-
thetical expressions.
