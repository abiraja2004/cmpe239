There is significant evidence in the literature
that integrating knowledge about multiword
expressions can improve shallow parsing ac-
curacy. We present an experimental study to
quantify this improvement, focusing on com-
pound nominals, proper names and adjective-
noun constructions. The evaluation set of
multiword expressions is derived from Word-
Net and the textual data are downloaded from
the web. We use a classification method to
aid human annotation of output parses. This
method allows us to conduct experiments on
a large dataset of unannotated data. Experi-
ments show that knowledge about multiword
expressions leads to an increase of between
7.5% and 9.5% in accuracy of shallow pars-
ing in sentences containing these multiword
expressions.
