Language can describe our visual world at
many levels, including not only what is lit-
erally there but also the sentiment that it in-
vokes. In this paper, we study visual language,
both literal and sentimental, that describes the
overall appearance and style of virtual char-
acters. Sentimental properties, including la-
bels such as ?youthful? or ?country western,?
must be inferred from descriptions of the more
literal properties, such as facial features and
clothing selection. We present a new dataset,
collected to describe Xbox avatars, as well as
models for learning the relationships between
these avatars and their literal and sentimen-
tal descriptions. In a series of experiments,
we demonstrate that such learned models can
be used for a range of tasks, including pre-
dicting sentimental words and using them to
rank and build avatars. Together, these re-
sults demonstrate that sentimental language
provides a concise (though noisy) means of
specifying low-level visual properties.
