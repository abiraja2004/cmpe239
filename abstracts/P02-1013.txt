The incremental algorithm introduced in
(Dale and Reiter, 1995) for producing dis-
tinguishing descriptions does not always
generate a minimal description. In this
paper, I show that when generalised to
sets of individuals and disjunctive proper-
ties, this approach might generate unnec-
essarily long and ambiguous and/or epis-
temically redundant descriptions. I then
present an alternative, constraint-based al-
gorithm and show that it builds on existing
related algorithms in that (i) it produces
minimal descriptions for sets of individu-
als using positive, negative and disjunctive
properties, (ii) it straightforwardly gener-
alises to n-ary relations and (iii) it is inte-
grated with surface realisation.
