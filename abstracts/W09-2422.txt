The task to classify a temporal relation be-
tween temporal entities has proven to be dif-
ficult with unsatisfactory results of previous
research. In TempEval07 that was a first at-
tempt to standardize the task, six teams com-
peted with each other for three simple relation-
identification tasks and their results were com-
parably poor. In this paper we provide an anal-
ysis of the TempEval07 competition results,
identifying aspects of the tasks which pre-
sented the systems with particular challenges
and those that were accomplished with relative
ease.
