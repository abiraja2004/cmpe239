Great writing is rare and highly admired.
Readers seek out articles that are beautifully
written, informative and entertaining. Yet
information-access technologies lack capabil-
ities for predicting article quality at this level.
In this paper we present first experiments on
article quality prediction in the science jour-
nalism domain. We introduce a corpus of
great pieces of science journalism, along with
typical articles from the genre. We imple-
ment features to capture aspects of great writ-
ing, including surprising, visual and emotional
content, as well as general features related to
discourse organization and sentence structure.
We show that the distinction between great
and typical articles can be detected fairly ac-
curately, and that the entire spectrum of our
features contribute to the distinction.
