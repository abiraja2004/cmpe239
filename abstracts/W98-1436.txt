. The ROMVOX Text-toaSpeech synthesis ystem developed by our team is the first one that 
allowed the synthesis of any unrestricted Romanian text with intonation facilities on 1BM-PC compatible 
computers. During the last years of research several version of text-to-speech systems were achieved, 
trying to enhance their facilities. Our paper describes the present stage of our experiments performed in
order to improve the naturalness of the generated voice.
