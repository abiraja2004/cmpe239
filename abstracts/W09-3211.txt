We present a graph-based model for rep-
resenting the lexical cohesion of a dis-
course. In the graph structure, vertices cor-
respond to the content words of a text and
edges connecting pairs of words encode
how closely the words are related semanti-
cally. We show that such a structure can be
used to distinguish literal and non-literal
usages of multi-word expressions.
