Recently, discriminative word alignment methods
have achieved state-of-the-art accuracies by extend-
ing the range of information sources that can be
easily incorporated into aligners. The chief advan-
tage of a discriminative framework is the ability
to score alignments based on arbitrary features of
the matching word tokens, including orthographic
form, predictions of other models, lexical context
and so on. However, the proposed bipartite match-
ing model of Taskar et al (2005), despite being
tractable and effective, has two important limita-
tions. First, it is limited by the restriction that
words have fertility of at most one. More impor-
tantly, first order correlations between consecutive
words cannot be directly captured by the model. In
this work, we address these limitations by enrich-
ing the model form. We give estimation and infer-
ence algorithms for these enhancements. Our best
model achieves a relative AER reduction of 25%
over the basic matching formulation, outperform-
ing intersected IBM Model 4 without using any
overly compute-intensive features. By including
predictions of other models as features, we achieve
AER of 3.8 on the standard Hansards dataset.
