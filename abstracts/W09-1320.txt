This paper introduces the task of automatical-
ly  answering  clinical  comparison  questions 
using MEDLINE? abstracts. In the beginning, 
clinical  comparison  questions  and  the  main 
challenges in recognising and extracting their 
components  are  described.  Then,  different 
strategies for retrieving  MEDLINE?  abstracts 
are shown. Finally, the results of an initial ex-
periment judging the relevance of MEDLINE? 
abstracts  retrieved by searching for the com-
ponents  of  twelve comparison  questions  will 
be shown and discussed.
