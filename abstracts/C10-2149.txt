The overwhelming amounts of multi-
media contents have triggered the need 
for automatically detecting the semantic 
concepts within the media contents. 
With the development of photo sharing 
websites such as Flickr, we are able to
obtain millions of images with user-
supplied tags. However, user tags tend 
to be noisy, ambiguous and incomplete.
In order to improve the quality of tags
to annotate web images, we propose an 
approach to build Semantic Fields for
annotating the web images. The main 
idea is that the images are more likely to 
be relevant to a given concept, if several 
tags to the image belong to the same 
Semantic Field as the target concept. 
Semantic Fields are determined by a set 
of highly semantically associated terms 
with high tag co-occurrences in the im-
age corpus and in different corpora and 
lexica such as WordNet and Wikipedia.
We conduct experiments on the NUS-
WIDE web image corpus and demon-
strate superior performance on image 
annotation as compared to the state-of-
the-art approaches.
