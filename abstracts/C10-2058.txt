Information Extraction (IE) technology is fac-
ing new challenges of dealing with large-scale 
heterogeneous data sources from different 
documents, languages and modalities. Infor-
mation fusion, a new emerging area derived 
from IE, aims to address these challenges. We 
specify the requirements and possible solu-
tions to perform information fusion. The is-
sues include redundancy removal, contradic-
tion resolution and uncertainty reduction. We 
believe this is a critical step to advance IE to a 
higher level of performance and portability.
