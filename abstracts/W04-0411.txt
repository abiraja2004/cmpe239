Multiword Expressions present a challenge for lan-
guage technology, given their flexible nature. Each
type of multiword expression has its own charac-
teristics, and providing a uniform lexical encoding
for them is a difficult task to undertake. Nonethe-
less, in this paper we present an architecture for the
lexical encoding of these expressions in a database,
that takes into account their flexibility. This encod-
ing extends in a straightforward manner the one re-
quired for simplex (single) words, and maximises
the information contained for them in the descrip-
tion of multiwords.
