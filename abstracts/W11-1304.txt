This paper gives an overview of the shared
task at the ACL-HLT 2011 DiSCo (Distribu-
tional Semantics and Compositionality) work-
shop. We describe in detail the motivation
for the shared task, the acquisition of datasets,
the evaluation methodology and the results
of participating systems. The task of assign-
ing a numerical score for a phrase accord-
ing to its compositionality showed to be hard.
Many groups reported features that intuitively
should work, yet showed no correlation with
the training data. The evaluation reveals that
most systems outperform simple baselines, yet
have difficulties in reliably assigning a compo-
sitionality score that closely matches the gold
standard. Overall, approaches based on word
space models performed slightly better than
methods relying solely on statistical associa-
tion measures.
