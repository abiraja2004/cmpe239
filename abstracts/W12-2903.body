This paper presents a method for an AAC sys-
tem to predict a whole response given features
of the previous utterance from the interlocu-
tor. It uses a large corpus of scripted dialogs,
computes a variety of lexical, syntactic and
whole phrase features for the previous utter-
ance, and predicts features that the response
should have, using an entropy-based measure.
We evaluate the system on a held-out portion
of the corpus. We find that for about 3.5% of
cases in the held-out corpus, we are able to
predict a response, and among those, over half
are either exact or at least reasonable substi-
tutes for the actual response. We also present
some results on keystroke savings. Finally
we compare our approach to a state-of-the-art
chatbot, and show (not surprisingly) that a sys-
tem like ours, tuned for a particular style of
conversation, outperforms one that is not.
Predicting possible responses automatically
by mining a corpus of dialogues is a
novel contribution to the literature on whole
utterance-based methods in AAC. Also useful,
we believe, is our estimate that about 3.5-4.0%
of utterances in dialogs are in principle pre-
dictable given previous context.
