In this work, we study the effectiveness of
state-of-the-art, sophisticated supervised
learning algorithms for dialogue act mod-
eling across a comprehensive set of differ-
ent spoken and written conversations in-
cluding: emails, forums, meetings, and
phone conversations. To this aim, we com-
pare the results of SVM-multiclass and
two structured predictors namely SVM-
hmm and CRF algorithms. Extensive em-
pirical results, across different conversa-
tional modalities, demonstrate the effec-
tiveness of our SVM-hmm model for di-
alogue act recognition in conversations.
