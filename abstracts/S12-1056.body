We present a joint approach for recognizing
spatial roles in SemEval-2012 Task 3. Can-
didate spatial relations, in the form of triples,
are heuristically extracted from sentences with
high recall. The joint classification of spatial
roles is then cast as a binary classification over
the candidates. This joint approach allows for
a rich feature set based on the complete rela-
tion instead of individual relation arguments.
Our best official submission achieves an F1-
measure of 0.573 on relation recognition, best
in the task and outperforming the previous
best result on the same data set (0.500).
