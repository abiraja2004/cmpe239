 
This paper presents a strategy to generate ge-
neric summary of documents using Probabilistic 
Latent Semantic Indexing. Generally a docu-
ment contains several topics rather than a single 
one. Summaries created by human beings tend 
to cover several topics to give the readers an 
overall idea about the original document. Hence 
we can expect that a summary containing sen-
tences from better part of the topic spectrum 
should make a better summary. PLSI has 
proven to be an effective method in topic detec-
tion. In this paper we present a method for cre-
ating extractive summary of the document by 
using PLSI to analyze the features of document 
such as term frequency and graph structure. We 
also show our results, which was evaluated us-
ing ROUGE, and compare the results with other 
techniques, proposed in the past.
