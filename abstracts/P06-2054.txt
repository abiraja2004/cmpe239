In this paper, we exploit non-local fea-
tures as an estimate of long-distance de-
pendencies to improve performance on the
statistical spoken language understanding
(SLU) problem. The statistical natural
language parsers trained on text perform
unreliably to encode non-local informa-
tion on spoken language. An alternative
method we propose is to use trigger pairs
that are automatically extracted by a fea-
ture induction algorithm. We describe a
light version of the inducer in which a sim-
ple modification is efficient and success-
ful. We evaluate our method on an SLU
task and show an error reduction of up to
27% over the base local model.
