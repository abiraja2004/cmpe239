Many acoustic approaches to prosodic la-
beling in English have employed only lo-
cal classifiers, although text-based classifi-
cation has employed some sequential mod-
els. In this paper we employ linear chain and
factorial conditional random fields (CRFs)
in conjunction with rich, contextually-based
prosodic features, to exploit sequential de-
pendencies and to facilitate integration with
lexical features. Integration of lexical and
prosodic features improves pitch accent pre-
diction over either feature set alne, and for
lower accuracy feature sets, factorial CRF
models can improve over linear chain based
prediction of pitch accent.
