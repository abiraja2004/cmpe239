 
At least two kinds of relations exist among 
related words: taxonomical relations and 
thematic relations. Both relations identify 
related words useful to language under-
standing and generation, information re-
trieval, and so on. However, although 
words with taxonomical relations are easy 
to identify from linguistic resources such as 
dictionaries and thesauri, words with the-
matic relations are difficult to identify be-
cause they are rarely maintained in linguis-
tic resources. In this paper, we sought to 
extract thematically (non-taxonomically) 
related word sets among words in docu-
ments by employing case-marking particles 
derived from syntactic analysis. We then 
verified the usefulness of word sets with 
non-taxonomical relation that seems to be a 
thematic relation for information retrieval.
