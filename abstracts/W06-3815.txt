Comparing word contexts is a key compo-
nent of many NLP tasks, but rarely is it
used in conjunction with additional onto-
logical knowledge. One problem is that
the amount of overhead required can be
high. In this paper, we provide a graphi-
cal method which easily combines an on-
tology with contextual information. We
take advantage of the intrinsic graphical
structure of an ontology for representing
a context. In addition, we turn the on-
tology into a metric space, such that sub-
graphs within it, which represent contexts,
can be compared. We develop two vari-
ants of our graphical method for compar-
ing contexts. Our analysis indicates that
our method performs the comparison effi-
ciently and offers a competitive alternative
to non-graphical methods.
