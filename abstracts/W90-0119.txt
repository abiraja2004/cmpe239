  
Recognizing the plan underlying a query aids in the 
generation of an appropriate response. In this paper, 
we address the problem of how to generate coopera- 
tive responses when the user's plan is ambiguous. We 
show that it is not always necessary to resolve the 
ambiguity, and provide a procedure that estimates 
whether the ambiguity matters to the task of formu- 
lating a response. If the ambiguity does matter, we 
propose to resolve the ambiguity by entering into a 
clarification dialogue with the user and provide a pro- 
cedure that performs this task. Together, these pro- 
cedures allow a question-answering system to take 
advantage of the interactive and collaborative nature 
of dialogue in recognizing plans and resolving ambi- 
guity.
