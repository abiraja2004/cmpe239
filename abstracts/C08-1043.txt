In this paper, we introduce a new frame-
work for recognizing textual entailment
(RTE) which depends on extraction of the
set of publicly-held beliefs ? known as dis-
course commitments ? that can be ascribed
to the author of a text (t) or a hypothesis
(h). We show that once a set of commit-
ments have been extracted from a t-h pair,
the task of recognizing textual entailment
is reduced to the identification of the com-
mitments from a t which support the infer-
ence of the h. Our system correctly identi-
fied entailment relationships in more than
80% of t-h pairs taken from all three of the
previous PASCAL RTE Challenges, with-
out the need for additional sources of train-
ing data.
