 
We present current work dealing with the in-
tegration of a multilingual thesaurus for so-
cial sciences in a NLP framework for sup-
porting Knowledge-Driven Information Ex-
traction in the field of social sciences.  We 
describe the various steps that lead to a run-
ning IE system: lexicalization of the labels of 
the thesaurus and semi-automatic generation 
of domain specific IE grammars, with their 
subsequent implementation in a finite state 
engine. Finally, we outline the actual field of 
application of the IE system: analysis of so-
cial media for recognition of relevant topics 
in the context of elections.
