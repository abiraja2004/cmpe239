Within the area of general-purpose fine-
grained subjectivity analysis, opinion topic
identification has, to date, received little
attention due to both the difficulty of the
task and the lack of appropriately anno-
tated resources. In this paper, we pro-
vide an operational definition of opinion
topic and present an algorithm for opinion
topic identification that, following our new
definition, treats the task as a problem in
topic coreference resolution. We develop a
methodology for the manual annotation of
opinion topics and use it to annotate topic
information for a portion of an existing
general-purpose opinion corpus. In exper-
iments using the corpus, our topic identi-
fication approach statistically significantly
outperforms several non-trivial baselines
according to three evaluation measures.
