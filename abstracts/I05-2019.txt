Syntactically annotated corpora (tree-
banks) play an important role in re-
cent statistical natural language pro-
cessing. However, building a large tree-
bank is labor intensive and time con-
suming work. To remedy this prob-
lem, there have been many attempts to
develop software tools for annotating
treebanks.
This paper presents an integrated en-
vironment for annotating a treebank,
called eBonsai. eBonsai helps annota-
tors to choose a correct syntactic struc-
ture of a sentence from outputs of a
parser, allowing the annotators to re-
trieve similar sentences in the treebank
for referring to their structures.
