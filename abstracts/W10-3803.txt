Inspired by previous source-side syntactic
reordering methods for SMT, this paper
focuses on using automatically learned
syntactic reordering patterns with func-
tional words which indicate structural re-
orderings between the source and target
language. This approach takes advan-
tage of phrase alignments and source-side
parse trees for pattern extraction, and then
filters out those patterns without func-
tional words. Word lattices transformed
by the generated patterns are fed into PB-
SMT systems to incorporate potential re-
orderings from the inputs. Experiments
are carried out on a medium-sized cor-
pus for a Chinese?English SMT task. The
proposed method outperforms the base-
line system by 1.38% relative on a ran-
domly selected testset and 10.45% rela-
tive on the NIST 2008 testset in terms
of BLEU score. Furthermore, a system
with just 61.88% of the patterns filtered
by functional words obtains a comparable
performance with the unfiltered one on the
randomly selected testset, and achieves
1.74% relative improvements on the NIST
2008 testset.
