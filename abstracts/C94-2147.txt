 
A CYK-table-driven interactive relaxation 
parsing method of spoken Korean, integrated 
with the CYK-based morphological analysis 
is introduced. An extension of the Categorial 
Grammar is introduced to treat the fiee word- 
order in Korean. The table-driven control of 
interactive relaxation gives efficiency in 
constituent searching and expectation 
generation. 'File lexical nature of the 
Categorial Grammar and the distributed 
nature of the interactive relaxation parsing 
together show a smooth integration of both 
bottom-up and toFdown effects during the 
spoken language analysis.
