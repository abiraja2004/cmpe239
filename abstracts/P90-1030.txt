 
We analyse the computational complexity of 
phonological models as they have developed over 
the past twenty years. The major results ate 
that generation and recognition are undecidable 
for segmental models, and that recognition is NP- 
hard for that portion of segmental phonology sub- 
sumed by modern autosegmental models. Formal 
restrictions are evaluated.
