We present three approaches to lexical chain-
ing based on the LDA topic model and eval-
uate them intrinsically on a manually anno-
tated set of German documents. After motivat-
ing the choice of statistical methods for lexi-
cal chaining with their adaptability to different
languages and subject domains, we describe
our new two-level chain annotation scheme,
which rooted in the concept of cohesive har-
mony. Also, we propose a new measure
for direct evaluation of lexical chains. Our
three LDA-based approaches outperform two
knowledge-based state-of-the art methods to
lexical chaining by a large margin, which can
be attributed to lacking coverage of the knowl-
edge resource. Subsequent analysis shows that
the three methods yield a different chaining
behavior, which could be utilized in tasks that
use lexical chaining as a component within
NLP applications.
