In this paper, we report on an empirical study
on initiative conflicts in human-human conver-
sation. We examined these conflicts in two
corpora of task-oriented dialogues. The re-
sults show that conversants try to avoid initia-
tive conflicts, but when these conflicts occur,
they are efficiently resolved by linguistic de-
vices, such as volume.
