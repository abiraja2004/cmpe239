This paper proposes the use of Lexical-
ized Tree-Adjoining Grammar (LTAG) for-
malism as an important additional source
of features for the Semantic Role Labeling
(SRL) task. Using a set of one-vs-all Sup-
port Vector Machines (SVMs), we evalu-
ate these LTAG-based features. Our exper-
iments show that LTAG-based features can
improve SRL accuracy significantly. When
compared with the best known set of fea-
tures that are used in state of the art SRL sys-
tems we obtain an improvement in F-score
from 82.34% to 85.25%.
