The translation of compound nouns is a ma-
jor issue in machine translation due to their
frequency of occurrence and high produc-
tivity. Various shallow methods have been
proposed to translate compound nouns, no-
table amongst which are memory-based
machine translation and word-to-word com-
positional machine translation. This paper
describes the results of a feasibility study
on the ability of these methods to trans-
late Japanese and English noun-noun com-
pounds.
