Product reviews are now widely used by
individuals and organizations for decision
making (Litvin et al, 2008; Jansen, 2010).
And because of the profits at stake, peo-
ple have been known to try to game the
system by writing fake reviews to promote
target products. As a result, the task of de-
ceptive review detection has been gaining
increasing attention. In this paper, we pro-
pose a generative LDA-based topic mod-
eling approach for fake review detection.
Our model can aptly detect the subtle dif-
ferences between deceptive reviews and
truthful ones and achieves about 95% ac-
curacy on review spam datasets, outper-
forming existing baselines by a large mar-
gin.
