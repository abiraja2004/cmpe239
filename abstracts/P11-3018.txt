We consider the problem of predicting which
words a student will click in a vocabulary
learning system. Often a language learner
will find value in the ability to look up the
meaning of an unknown word while reading
an electronic document by clicking the word.
Highlighting words likely to be unknown to a
reader is attractive due to drawing his or her at-
tention to it and indicating that information is
available. However, this option is usually done
manually in vocabulary systems and online
encyclopedias such as Wikipedia. Furthur-
more, it is never on a per-user basis. This pa-
per presents an automated way of highlight-
ing words likely to be unknown to the specific
user. We present related work in search engine
ranking, a description of the study used to col-
lect click data, the experiment we performed
using the random forest machine learning al-
gorithm and finish with a discussion of future
work.
