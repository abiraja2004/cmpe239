We describe the design of an MT system that em-
ploys transfer rules induced from parsed bitexts
and present evaluation results. The system learns
lexico-structural transfer rules using syntactic pat-
tern matching, statistical co-occurrence and error-
driven filtering. In an experiment with domain-
specific Korean to English translation, the approach
yielded substantial improvements over three base-
line systems.
