This paper proposes a novel lexicalized ap-
proach for rule selection for syntax-based
statistical machine translation (SMT). We
build maximum entropy (MaxEnt) mod-
els which combine rich context informa-
tion for selecting translation rules dur-
ing decoding. We successfully integrate
the MaxEnt-based rule selection models
into the state-of-the-art syntax-based SMT
model. Experiments show that our lexical-
ized approach for rule selection achieves
statistically significant improvements over
the state-of-the-art SMT system.
