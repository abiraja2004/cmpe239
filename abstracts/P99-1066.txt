 
Best-first chart parsing utilises a figure of 
merit (FOM) to efficiently guide a parse by 
first attending to those edges judged better. 
In the past it has usually been static; this 
paper will show that with some extra infor- 
mation, a parser can compensate for FOM 
flaws which otherwise slow it down. Our re- 
sults are faster than the prior best by a fac- 
tor of 2.5; and the speedup is won with no 
significant decrease in parser accuracy.
