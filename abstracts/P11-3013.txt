Flat noun phrase structure was, up until re-
cently, the standard in annotation for the Penn
Treebanks. With the recent addition of inter-
nal noun phrase annotation, dependency pars-
ing and applications down the NLP pipeline
are likely affected. Some machine translation
systems, such as TectoMT, use deep syntax
as a language transfer layer. It is proposed
that changes to the noun phrase dependency
parse will have a cascading effect down the
NLP pipeline and in the end, improve ma-
chine translation output, even with a reduc-
tion in parser accuracy that the noun phrase
structure might cause. This paper examines
this noun phrase structure?s effect on depen-
dency parsing, in English, with a maximum
spanning tree parser and shows a 2.43%, 0.23
Bleu score, improvement for English to Czech
machine translation.
