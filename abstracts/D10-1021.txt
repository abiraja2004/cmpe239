 
The problem of automatically classifying the 
gender of a blog author has important appli-
cations in many commercial domains. Exist-
ing systems mainly use features such as 
words, word classes, and POS (part-of-
speech) n-grams, for classification learning. 
In this paper, we propose two new techniques 
to improve the current result. The first tech-
nique introduces a new class of features 
which are variable length POS sequence pat-
terns mined from the training data using a se-
quence pattern mining algorithm. The second 
technique is a new feature selection method 
which is based on an ensemble of several fea-
ture selection criteria and approaches. Empir-
ical evaluation using a real-life blog data set 
shows that these two techniques improve the 
classification accuracy of the current state-of-
the-art methods significantly.
