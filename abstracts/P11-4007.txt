Event related potentials (ERP) corresponding
to stimuli in electroencephalography (EEG)
can be used to detect the intent of a per-
son for brain computer interfaces (BCI). This
paradigm is widely used to build letter-by-
letter text input systems using BCI. Neverthe-
less using a BCI-typewriter depending only on
EEG responses will not be sufficiently accu-
rate for single-trial operation in general, and
existing systems utilize many-trial schemes to
achieve accuracy at the cost of speed. Hence
incorporation of a language model based prior
or additional evidence is vital to improve accu-
racy and speed. In this demonstration we will
present a BCI system for typing that integrates
a stochastic language model with ERP classifi-
cation to achieve speedups, via the rapid serial
visual presentation (RSVP) paradigm.
