Preordering of source side sentences has
proved to be useful in improving statistical
machine translation. Most work has used a
parser in the source language along with rules
to map the source language word order into
the target language word order. The require-
ment to have a source language parser is a ma-
jor drawback, which we seek to overcome in
this paper. Instead of using a parser and then
using rules to order the source side sentence
we learn a model that can directly reorder
source side sentences to match target word or-
der using a small parallel corpus with high-
quality word alignments. Our model learns
pairwise costs of a word immediately preced-
ing another word. We use the Lin-Kernighan
heuristic to find the best source reordering ef-
ficiently during training and testing and show
that it suffices to provide good quality reorder-
ing.
We show gains in translation performance
based on our reordering model for translating
from Hindi to English, Urdu to English (with
a public dataset), and English to Hindi. For
English to Hindi we show that our technique
achieves better performance than a method
that uses rules applied to the source side En-
glish parse.
