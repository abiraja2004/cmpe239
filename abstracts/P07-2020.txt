In this paper, we propose a new ensemble
document clustering method. The novelty
of our method is the use of Non-negative
Matrix Factorization (NMF) in the genera-
tion phase and a weighted hypergraph in the
integration phase. In our experiment, we
compared our method with some clustering
methods. Our method achieved the best re-
sults.
