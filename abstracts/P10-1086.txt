pute the sense similarity between two units 
(words, phrases, rules, etc.) from parallel cor-
pora. The sense similarity scores are computed 
by using the vector space model.  We then ap-
ply the algorithms to statistical machine trans-
lation by computing the sense similarity be-
tween the source and target side of translation 
rule pairs. Similarity scores are used as addi-
tional features of the translation model to im-
prove translation performance. Significant im-
provements are obtained over a state-of-the-art 
hierarchical phrase-based machine translation 
system.
