matically recognizing local cohesion be- 
tween utterances, which is one of the dis- 
course structures in task-oriented spoken 
dialogues. More specifically we can auto- 
matically acquire discourse knowledge 
from an annotated corpus with local co- 
hesion. In this paper we focus on speech 
act type-based local cohesion. The pre- 
sented method consists of two steps 1) 
identifying the speech act expressions in
an utterance and 2) calculating the plausi- 
bility of local cohesion between the 
speech act expressions by using the dia- 
logue corpus annotated with local cohe- 
sion. We present two methods of interpo- 
lating the plausibility of local cohesion 
based on surface information on utter- 
ances. The presented method has ob- 
tained a 93% accuracy for closed data and 
a 78% accuracy for open data in recogniz- 
ing a pair of utterances with local cohe- 
sion.
