In this paper, we propose a framework for
conversational robots that facilitates four-
participant groups. In three-participant con-
versations, the minimum unit for multiparty
conversations, social imbalance, in which a
participant is left behind in the current conver-
sation, sometimes occurs. In such scenarios, a
conversational robot has the potential to facili-
tate situations as the fourth participant. Conse-
quently, we present model procedures for ob-
taining conversational initiatives in incremen-
tal steps to engage such four-participant con-
versations. During the procedures, a facilitator
must be aware of both the presence of dom-
inant participants leading the current conver-
sation and the status of any participant that is
left behind. We model and optimize these situ-
ations and procedures as a partially observable
Markov decision process. The results of ex-
periments conducted to evaluate the proposed
procedures show evidence of their acceptabil-
ity and feeling of groupness.
