This paper focuses on redundancy, over-
lapping information in multi-documents,
and presents a method for detecting
salient, key sentences from documents
that discuss the same event. To elimi-
nate redundancy, we used spectral clus-
tering and classified each sentence into
groups, each of which consists of seman-
tically related sentences. Then, we ap-
plied link analysis, the Markov Random
Walk (MRW) Model to deciding the im-
portance of a sentence within documents.
The method was tested on the NTCIR
evaluation data, and the result shows the
effectiveness of the method.
