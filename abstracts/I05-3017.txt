The second international Chinese word
segmentation bakeoff was held in the
summer of 2005 to evaluate the current
state of the art in word segmentation.
Twenty three groups submitted 130 re-
sult sets over two tracks and four differ-
ent corpora. We found that the technol-
ogy has improved over the intervening
two years, though the out-of-vocabulary
problem is still or paramount impor-
tance.
