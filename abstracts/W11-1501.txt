We present a general and simple method to
adapt an existing NLP tool in order to enable
it to deal with historical varieties of languages.
This approach consists basically in expanding
the dictionary with the old word variants and
in retraining the tagger with a small training
corpus. We implement this approach for Old
Spanish.
The results of a thorough evaluation over the
extended tool show that using this method
an almost state-of-the-art performance is ob-
tained, adequate to carry out quantitative stud-
ies in the humanities: 94.5% accuracy for the
main part of speech and 92.6% for lemma. To
our knowledge, this is the first time that such
a strategy is adopted to annotate historical lan-
guage varieties and we believe that it could be
used as well to deal with other non-standard
varieties of languages.
