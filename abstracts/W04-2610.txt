The discovery of semantic relations in text
plays an important role in many NLP appli-
cations. This paper presents a method for the
automatic classification of semantic relations
in nominalized noun phrases. Nominalizations
represent a subclass of NP constructions in
which either the head or the modifier noun is
derived from a verb while the other noun is an
argument of this verb. Especially designed fea-
tures are extracted automatically and used in a
Support Vector Machine learning model. The
paper presents preliminary results for the se-
mantic classification of the most representative
NP patterns using four distinct learning mod-
els.
