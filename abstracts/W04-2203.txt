In the context of the Papillon project, which
aims at creating a multilingual lexical database
(MLDB), we have developed Jeminie, an adapt-
able system that helps automatically building
interlingual lexical databases from existing lex-
ical resources. In this article, we present a tax-
onomy of criteria for evaluating a MLDB, that
motivates the need for arbitrary compositions
of criteria to evaluate a whole MLDB. A quality
measurement method is proposed, that is adapt-
able to different contexts and available lexical
resources.
