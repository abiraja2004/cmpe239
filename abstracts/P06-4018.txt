The Natural Language Toolkit is a suite of
program modules, data sets and tutorials
supporting research and teaching in com-
putational linguistics and natural language
processing. NLTK is written in Python
and distributed under the GPL open source
license. Over the past year the toolkit has
been rewritten, simplifying many linguis-
tic data structures and taking advantage
of recent enhancements in the Python lan-
guage. This paper reports on the simpli-
fied toolkit and explains how it is used in
teaching NLP.
