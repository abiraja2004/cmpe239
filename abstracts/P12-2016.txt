There has been recent interest in the problem
of decoding letter substitution ciphers using
techniques inspired by natural language pro-
cessing. We consider a different type of classi-
cal encoding scheme known as the running key
cipher, and propose a search solution using
Gibbs sampling with a word language model.
We evaluate our method on synthetic cipher-
texts of different lengths, and find that it out-
performs previous work that employs Viterbi
decoding with character-based models.
