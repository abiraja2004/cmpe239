This paper deals with the way temporal
connectives affect Temporal Structure
as well as Discourse Structure in Nar-
ratives. It presents a contrastive study
of French connectives puis (then, after-
wards) and un peu plus tard (a bit later)
within the framework of Segmented
Discourse Representation Theory. It
shows that puis is a marker of the Narra-
tion discourse relation, whereas un peu
plus tard blocks Narration and licenses
only a weaker discourse relation, that
can be considered as a ?weak Narra-
tion? involving only temporal succes-
sion. In addition, puis blocks Result,
while un peu plus tard does not.
