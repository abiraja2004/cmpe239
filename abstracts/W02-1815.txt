 In this paper we report results of a
supervised machine-learning approach to
Chinese word segmentation. First, a maximum
entropy tagger is trainedonmanually annotated
data to automatically labels the characters with
tagsthatindicatethepositionofcharacterwithin
a word. An error-driven transformation-based
tagger is then trained to clean up the tagging
inconsistencies of the first tagger. The tagged
output is then converted into segmented text.
The preliminary results show that this approach
is competitive compared with other supervised
machine-learning segmenters reported in
previousstudies.
