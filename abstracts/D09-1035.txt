Automatically detecting human social in-
tentions from spoken conversation is an
important task for dialogue understand-
ing. Since the social intentions of the
speaker may differ from what is perceived
by the hearer, systems that analyze human
conversations need to be able to extract
both the perceived and the intended social
meaning. We investigate this difference
between intention and perception by using
a spoken corpus of speed-dates in which
both the speaker and the listener rated the
speaker on flirtatiousness. Our flirtation-
detection system uses prosodic, dialogue,
and lexical features to detect a speaker?s
intent to flirt with up to 71.5% accuracy,
significantly outperforming the baseline,
but also outperforming the human inter-
locuters. Our system addresses lexical fea-
ture sparsity given the small amount of
training data by using an autoencoder net-
work to map sparse lexical feature vectors
into 30 compressed features. Our analy-
sis shows that humans are very poor per-
ceivers of intended flirtatiousness, instead
often projecting their own intended behav-
ior onto their interlocutors.
