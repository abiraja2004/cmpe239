Many researchers have used lexical networks
and ontologies to mitigate synonymy and polysemy
problems in Question Answering (QA), systems
coupled with taggers, query classifiers, and answer
extractors in complex and ad-hoc ways. We seek
to make QA systems reproducible with shared and
modest human effort, carefully separating knowl-
edge from algorithms. To this end, we propose
an aesthetically ?clean? Bayesian inference scheme
for exploiting lexical relations for passage-scoring
for QA . The factors which contribute to the effi-
cacy of Bayesian Inferencing on lexical relations are
soft word sense disambiguation, parameter smooth-
ing which ameliorates the data sparsity problem and
estimation of joint probability over words which
overcomes the deficiency of naive-bayes-like ap-
proaches. Our system is superior to vector-space
ranking techniques from IR, and its accuracy ap-
proaches that of the top contenders at the TREC QA
tasks in recent years.
