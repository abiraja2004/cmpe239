This paper presents techniques to apply
semi-CRFs to Named Entity Recognition
tasks with a tractable computational cost.
Our framework can handle an NER task
that has long named entities and many
labels which increase the computational
cost. To reduce the computational cost,
we propose two techniques: the first is the
use of feature forests, which enables us to
pack feature-equivalent states, and the sec-
ond is the introduction of a filtering pro-
cess which significantly reduces the num-
ber of candidate states. This framework
allows us to use a rich set of features ex-
tracted from the chunk-based representa-
tion that can capture informative charac-
teristics of entities. We also introduce a
simple trick to transfer information about
distant entities by embedding label infor-
mation into non-entity labels. Experimen-
tal results show that our model achieves an
F-score of 71.48% on the JNLPBA 2004
shared task without using any external re-
sources or post-processing techniques.
