This paper presents a semi-supervised ap-
proach to reduce human effort in building an 
annotated Chinese corpus. One of the disad-
vantages of many statistical Chinese named 
entity recognition systems is that training data 
may be in short supply, and manually building 
annotated corpus is expensive. In the proposed 
approach, we construct an 80M hand-
annotated corpus in three steps: (1) 
Automatically annotate training corpus; (2) 
Manually refine small subsets of the automati-
cally annotated corpus; (3) Combine small 
subsets and whole corpus in a bootstrapping 
process. Our approach is tested on a state-of-
the-art Chinese word segmentation system 
(Gao et al, 2003, 2004). Experiments show 
that only a small subset of hand-annotated 
corpus is sufficient to achieve a satisfying per-
formance of the named entity component in 
this system.
