Systems based on synchronous grammars
and tree transducers promise to improve
the quality of statistical machine transla-
tion output, but are often very computa-
tionally intensive. The complexity is ex-
ponential in the size of individual gram-
mar rules due to arbitrary re-orderings be-
tween the two languages, and rules ex-
tracted from parallel corpora can be quite
large. We devise a linear-time algorithm
for factoring syntactic re-orderings by bi-
narizing synchronous rules when possible
and show that the resulting rule set signif-
icantly improves the speed and accuracy
of a state-of-the-art syntax-based machine
translation system.
