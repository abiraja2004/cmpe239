We describe improvements made over the
past year to Joshua, an open-source trans-
lation system for parsing-based machine
translation. The main contributions this
past year are significant improvements in
both speed and usability of the grammar
extraction and decoding steps. We have
also rewritten the decoder to use a sparse
feature representation, enabling training of
large numbers of features with discrimina-
tive training methods.
