 
In this paper a discussion on multimodal 
referent resolution is presented. The 
discussion is centered on the analysis of how 
the referent of an expression i  one modality 
can be found whenever the contextual 
information required for carrying on such an 
inference is expressed in one or more 
different modalities. In particular, a model 
for identifying the referent of a graphical 
expression when the relevant contextual 
information is expressed through natural 
language is presented. The model is also 
applied to the reciprocal problem of 
identifying the referent of a linguistic 
expression whenever a graphical context is 
given. In Section 1 of this paper the notion 
of modality in terms of which the theory is 
developed is presented. The discussion is 
motivated with a case of study in 
multimodal reference resolution. In Section 
2 a theory for multimodal representation 
along the lines of Montague's semiotic 
programme is presented. In Section 3, an 
incremental model for multimodal reference 
resolution is illustrated. In Section 4 a brief 
discussion of how the theory could be 
extended to handle multimodal discourse is 
advanced. Finally, in the conclusion of the 
paper, a reflexion on the relation between 
spacial deixis and anaphora is advanced. 
1 Reference and Multimodality 
Consider Figure 1 (adapted from an example presented 
by Thomas Rist in the past workshop on IMMPS at 
ECAI 96) in which a message is expressed through two 
different modalities, namely text and graphics. 
I o c>-J 
"He washed it" 
Figure 1 
The figure illustrates a kind of reasoning required 
to understand multimodal presentations: in order to 
make sense of the message, the interpreter must realize 
what individuals are referred to by the pronouns he 
and it in the text. For the sake of argument, it is 
assumed that the graphical symbols in the figure are 
understood directly in terms of a graphical lexicon, in 
the same way that the words he, it and washed are 
understood in terms of the textual lexicon. It can easily 
be seen that given the graphical context he should 
resolve to the man, and it should resolve to the car. 
However, this inference is not a valid deduction since 
the information inferred to is not contained in the overt 
graphical context and the meaning of the words 
involved. 
One way to look at this problem is as a case of 
anaphoric inference. Consider that the information 
provided by graphical means can be expressed also 
through the following piece of dicourse: There is a 
man, a car and a bucket. He washed it. With Kamp's 
discourse representation theory (DRT) (Kamp 1981, 
Kamp et. al. 1993) a discourse representation structure 
(DRS) in which the reference to the pronoun he is 
constrained to be the man can be built. However, the 
pronoun it has two possible antecedents, and for 
100 L.A.  P ineda and G. Garza 
selecting the appropriate one, conceptual knowledge is 
required. In particular, the knowledge that a man can 
wash objects with water, and that water is carried on in 
buckets must be employed. If these concepts are 
included in the interpretation context like DRT 
conditions (which should be retrieved from memory 
rather than from the normal flow of discourse), the 
anaphora can be solved. In terms of this analogy, 
situations like the one illustrated in Figure 1 have been 
labeled as problems of anaphor with pictorial 
antecedent in which the interpretation context is built 
not from a preceeding text but from a graphical 
representation which is introduced with the text (Andr6 
et al, 1994). 
Consider now the reciprocal situation shown in 
Figure 2 (adapted from Rist as above) in which a 
drawing is interpreted as a map thanks to the 
preceeding text. The dots and lines of the drawing, and 
their properties, do not have an interpretation and the 
picture in itself is meaningless. However, given the 
context introduced by the text, and also considering the 
common sense knowledge that Paris is a city of France, 
and Frankfurt a city of Germany, and that Germany 
lies to the east of France (to the right), it is possible to 
infer that the denotations of the dots to the left, middle 
and right of the picture are Paris, Saarbriicken and 
Frankfurt, respectively, and that the dashed lines 
denote borders of countries, and in particular, the 
lower segment denotes the border between France and 
Germany. In this example, graphical symbols can be 
thought of as "variables" of the graphical 
representation or "graphical pronouns" that can be 
resolved in terms of the textual antecedent. Here again, 
the inference is not a valid deduction as the graphical 
symbols could be given other interpretations or non at 
all. 
"Saarbriicken lies at the intersection 
between the border between France and 
Germany and a line from Paris to 
Frankfurt." 
./ 
Figure 2 
The situation in Figure 2 has been characterised as
an instance of a pictorial anaphor with linguistic 
antecedent, and further elated examples can be found 
in (Andr6 et al, 1994). This situation, however, 
cannot be modeled that easily in terms of Kamp's DRT 
because the "pronouns" are not linguistic objects, and 
there is not a straight forward way to express in a the 
discourse representation structure that a dot 
representing "a variable" in the graphical domain has 
the same denotation as a natural language name or 
description introduced from text in a DRS. 
Furthermore, consider that the situation in Figure 1 
can be thought of as anaphoric only if we ignore the 
modality of the graphics, as was done above, but if the 
notion of modality is to be considered at all in the 
analysis, then the situation in Figure 1 poses the same 
kind of problems as the one in Figure 2. In general, 
graphical objects, functioning as constant erms or as 
variables, introduced as antecendents or as pronouns, 
cannot be expressed in a DRT, as the rules 
constructing these structures (the so-called DRS- 
construction rules) are triggered by specific syntactic 
configurations of the natural language in which the 
information is expressed. 
An alternative view on this kind of problems 
consists in looking at them in terms of the traditional 
linguistic notion of deixis (Lyons, 1968). This notion 
has to do with the orientational features of language 
which are relative to the spatio-temporal situation of an 
utterance. In this regard, and in connexion with the 
notion of graphical anaphor discussed abovel it is 
possible to mention the deictic category of 
demonstrative pronouns: words like this and that 
which permit us to make reference to extralinguistic 
objects with the help of pointing acts. Ambiguity of 
this kind of words is not unusual, as they function not 
only as deictic or demonstrative pronouns but also as 
anaphoric, if they are preceeded by a linguistic context, 
and even as determiners with a deictic component as in 
expressions like this car. 
Consider, for instance, that the text in Figure 1 
could be substituted by the expression this washed this 
where the first this is supported by pointing to the man 
and the second by pointing to the car. So, in this line of 
discussion, it is possible to think of the pronoun it in 
Figure 1 as a deictic pronuon which refers to the world, 
although in an indirect manner through a symbol of a 
different modality. More generally and according to 
Kamp (Kamp, 1981): 
...deictic and anaphoric pronouns select 
their referents from certain sets of 
antecedently available entities. The two 
pronouns uses differ with regard to the 
A Model for Multimodal Reference Resolution 101 
nature of these sets. In the case of a deictic 
pronoun the set contains entities that belong 
to the real world, whereas the selection set 
for an anaphoric pronoun is made up of 
constituents of the representation that has 
been constructed in response to antecent 
discourse. 
For the purpose of this discussion, it is interesting 
to question what the nature of the sets mentioned above 
can be. In normal deictic situations the use of a 
demonstrative pronoun is accompanied by a pointing 
act to an object that can be perceived irectly through 
the visual modality, and as a result of such a visual 
interpretation process, the object is represented 
internally by the subject, however, not necessarily 
through a linguistic representation, but in a 
representation of a different modality. According to 
this, the notion of modality is a representational 
notion, and not a sensory notion, as it is normally 
considered in psychological discussion. In the former 
sense, a representation is a set of expressions of a 
formal anguage; that is to say, with a lexicon and with 
well-defined syntactic and semantic structures. The 
interpretation conventions of an expression of a given 
modality are determined by the interpreter of the 
language. Reasoning with information expressed in 
both of the modalities is achieved with the help of a 
translation relation that is similar to the relation of 
translation between atural languages. 
This view of multimodal representation and 
reasoning can be formalized in terms of Montague's 
general semiotic programme (Dowty, 1985). Each 
modality in the system can be captured through a 
particular language, and relations between expressions 
of different modalities can be modeled in terms of 
translation functions from basic and composite 
expressions of the source modality into expressions of 
the object modality. In a system of this kind, 
interpreting examples in Figures 1 and 2 in relation to 
the linguistic modality consists in interpreting the 
information expressed through natural language 
directly when enough information is available, and 
completing the interpretation process by means of 
translating expressions of other modalities into the 
linguistic one. Consider Figure 3 --following (Pineda, 
1989, 1996) and (Santana et al, 1997)--- in which a 
multimodal representational system for linguistic and 
graphical modalties i  illustrated. 
The circles labeled G and L in Figure 3 represent 
the sets of expressions of the graphical and natural 
languages respectively; the functions p~ and PG stand 
for the translation mappings between the two 
languages. The circle labeled with P represents he set 
FL 
Figure 3 
of graphical symbols consituting the graphical 
modality proper (i.e the actual symbols on a piece of 
paper or on the screen). Note that two sets of 
expressions are considered for the graphical modality: 
the expressions in G belong to the formal language in 
which graphics are represented and reasoned about, 
and are thought of as the "form" of the overt graphical 
symbols whose "substance" (in the Saussurean sense) 
contained in P cannot be manipulated directly. The set 
W stands for the world and together with the functions 
Fp, FG, FL constitutes a multimodal system of 
interpretation. The order pair <W, Ft.> defines the 
model ML for the natural anguage, and the order pair 
<W, FG o Fp> defines the model MG for the graphical 
language. 
In order to illustrate how this multimodal system of 
interpretation works consider, for instance, that the 
denotations of the picture of a man and the word he in 
Figure 1 is the same individual in the world; in the 
same way, the denotations of the word Saarbriicken 
and the dot on the intersection between the straight 
line and the lower segment of curve representing the 
border between France and Germany in Figure 2 are 
also the same, which is the city of Saarbriicken itself. 
So, if one asks who is he? looking at Figure 1, the 
answer is found by computing pL(he) whose value is 
the picture of the man on the figure. Once this 
computation is performed the picture can be 
highlighted or signaled by other graphical means. If 
one points out the middle dot in Figure 2 at the time 
the question what is this? is asked, on the other hand, 
the answer is found by applying the function Pc to the 
pointed dot, whose value would be the word 
Saarbriicken. 
It should be clear that if all theoretical elements 
illustrated in Figure 3 are given, questions about 
102 L .A .  P ineda  and G. Garza  
multimodal scenarios can be answered through the 
interpretation process; that is to say, evaluating 
expressions of a given modality in terms of the 
interpreters of the languages involved and the 
translation functions. 
However, when one is instructed to interpret a 
multimodal message, like Figures 1 and 2, not all 
information in the scheme of Figure 3 is available. In 
particular, the translation functions PL and PG are not 
known, and the crucial inference of the interpretation 
process has as its goal to induce these functions. Such 
an inference can be thought of as the same process that 
the one involved in solving the so-called linguistic 
anaphor with pictorial antecedent and the pictorial 
anaphor with linguistic antecedent. It would also be 
equivalent o finding out deictic references if "the 
visual world" is thought of as represented through 
expressions of the graphical representation modality. 
These are three different ways of looking at the same 
problem. 
It is important to highlight hat in order to induce 
PL and PG the information overtly provided in the 
multimodal message is usually not enough. As will be 
discussed below in this paper, such a process will also 
require to consider the grammatical structrure of the 
languages involved, the definition of translations rules 
between languages, and conceptual knowledge stored 
in memory about he interpretation domain. 
Another consequence of the scheme in Figure 3 is 
that it provides the basis for generating referring 
expressions of a given modality in terms of information 
provided in other modalities. Consider that basic 
constants or composite xpressions of the languages G
and L can be translated to basic or composite 
expressions of the other language, depending on the 
definition of the translation function. So, if ones needs 
to refer linguistically to a graphical configuration, for 
instance, it would only be required to find an 
expression of G which expresses all graphical 
attributes of the desired object in the most simple 
fashion, and then translate it to its corresponding 
expression in L. The resulting natural language 
expression could be used directly or embbeded in a 
larger natural anguage xpressions containing words 
that refer to abstract objects or properties. To illustrate 
this point consider the natural language text 
Saarbriiken lies at the intersection between the border 
between France and Germany and a line from Paris to 
Frankfurt. This sentence contains the definite 
description the intersection between the border 
between France and Germany and a line from Paris to 
Frankfurt, which in turns contains a number of 
simplier (basic and composite) referring expressions. 
Finding the graphical referent of these expressions 
requires the identification of dots, lines and curves 
(and parts of curves) in the map that have the same 
referent. However, the map in Figure 2 has graphical 
entities that have an interpretation but are not named 
in the text (consider Figure 4 in which the graphical 
entities of Figure 2 have been labeled). For instance, 
Belgium is represented by region r4, and the curve r6 
represents the border between France and Belgium. 
Once the picture has been interpreted one would be 
entitle to ask not only for graphical objects that have 
been named, but also for any meaningful graphical 
object. So, if one points to the curve c6 in Figure 2, one 
answer provided could be The border between France 
and Belgium. As some graphical objects named by 
constants of the graphical language do not have a 
proper natural anguage name, the translation function 
Po must associate a basic constant of G with a 
composite description of L. The process of inducing 
such a translation function produces the corresponding 
referring expressions too.

In the rest of this paper, some preliminar esults of 
how this programme can be carried out are presented. 
In Section 2, a formalization of the languages L and G 
with their corresponding translation functions and 
semantic interpretation, along the lines of Montague's 
general semiotic programme, is presented. In this 
section the process of multimodal interpretation and 
reasoning is explained, and the translation of 
expressions of one modality in terms of the other is 
illustrated. However, such a process can be carried out 
only if the translation functions are known and, as was 
mentioned above, that is not normally the case. In 
Section 3, some initial results on how such functions 
can be induced in terms of the multimodal message, 
constraints on the interpretation conventions of the 
modalities, and constraints on the general knowledge 
about the domain, are presented. In this section the 
process of generating graphical and linguistic referring

expressions, which is associated with the induction of 
the translation functions, is also illustrated. In Section 
4 a preliminar discussion on the feasibility of 
extending Kamp's DRS with multimodal structures i
presented. Finally, in the conclusion a tentative 
reflexion on the relation of anaphora nd spacial deixis 
on the light of such a kind of theory is advanced. 
2 A Multimodal Interpretation System 
In this section the definition of the syntax and 
semantics of the languages L and G to express the 
multimodal message of Figure 2 is presented. The 
language L is designed to produce xpressions useful 
to refer to objects, properties and relations commonly 
found in discourse about maps. In particular, the 
natural language expressions of Figure 2 can be 
constructed in a compositional fashion within L.The 
language G, on the other hand, is expressive enough to 
refer to geometrical objects, properties and relations 
found in drawings. The definitions of L and G follow 
closely the general guidelines of Montague's emiotic 
programme. As a first step of the syntactic definition 
the set of categories or types is stated. For each type of 
a language a corresponding type in the other language 
is defined. Basic constants of the source language can 
be mapped either to basic or composite xpressions of 
the corresponding type in the object language; in a 
similar fashion a composite xpression of the source 
language can be mapped into a basic or composite 
expression of the object language. A number of basic 
constants for each of these types is defined and the 
combination rules for producing composite xpressions 
are stated. Associated to each syntactic rule a 
translation rule mapping the expression formed by the 
rule to its translation to the other language is defined. 
In the same way that the interpretation of the natural 
language xpressions in the PTQ system (Dowry, 1985) 
is given indirectly through the translation to 
intensional logic, which has a model-theoretic 
semantic interpretation, the interpretation of 
expressions of L is given indirectly through its 
translation to expressions of G, as shown in Figure 3. 
The interpretation of expressions of G, in turn, is 
explicitly given through the model Me. The 
interpretation function FL states the normal meaning 
for English words, and Fp is determined by transitivity 
once the translation function between G and L is 
defined, and no further formalization for FL and Fp is 
presented in this paper. Another simplifying 
assumption rests on the consideration that the 
interpretations of all expressions included in these 
languages depend only on the current graphical state 
and no intensional types are included in the definition 
of L and G. However, this analysis can be extended on 
the lines of intensional logic if to deal with a more 
comprehensive fragment of English is required. In 
Section 2.1 the definition of L is presented and in 
Section 2.2 the language G and its interpretation 
function are formally defined. 
2.1 Definition of the Language L
The language L is designed to produce xpressions like 
Saarbriicken lies at the intersection between the 
border between France and Germany and a line from 
Paris to Frankfurt in a compositional fashion.This 
means that all basic constants like France and 
Germany, and also all subexpressions of the former 
sentence, like the border between France and Germany 
or a line from Paris to Frankfurt can also be produced. 
In addition, language L can produce expressions like 
France is a country, Frankfurt is a city of Germany or 
Germany is to the east of France which express 
common sense knowledge required in the 
interpretation of maps. Next, the definition of L is 
presented. 
The set of syntactic ategories of L is as follows: 
1. The basic syntactic ategories of L are t, IV and 
CN, where t is the category of sentences, IV is the 
category of intransitive verbs and CN is the category of 
common ouns. 
2 If A and B are syntactic ategories then A/B is a 
category. 
Traditional syntactic ategories of natural anguage 
like transitive verbs (TV), terms (TL propositional 
phrases (PP) and determiners (T/CN) can be derived 
from the basic categories. 
For each syntactic category of L there is a 
corresponding type in G. The correspondence b tween 
linguistic categories and geometrical types resembles 
the translation from English to Intensional Logic 
(Dowty, 1985) and it is defined in terms of the function 
f as follows: 
1. f(t) = t. 
2. f(CN) = f(IV) = <e, t>. 
3. For any categories A and B, f(A/B) = <f(B),f(A)>. 
The following table illustrates the basic constants of 
L with their category names, category definition and 
the corresponding type in the graphical language:

Figure 5 
As can be seen in Figure 5, simple terms like the 
names of cities and countries translate into 
characteristic functions of sets of individuals. This 
graphical type is interpreted as the set of properties (or 
predicates holding in the interpretation state) that an 
individual named by the term has. So, as a city is 
represented through a dot in the graphical domain, the 
translation of Paris, for instance, is the set of 
properties that the dot representing Paris has in the 
intepretation state. Common nouns are translated into 
graphical predicates: city translates into the set of dots 
representing cities. Transitive verbs are translated into 
functions taking predicates as their arguments and 
producing sets of individuals as their values: the verb 
phrase be a city, for instance, translates into a set of 
dots representing cities. Determiners, prepositional 
phrases and intransitive verbs function in a similar 
fashion, although there are no basic constant of the 
last two categories, as prepositional words are 
introduced syncategorematically nd intransitive verb 
phrases are always composite expressions in this 
grammar. In Figure 6 the translation for all basic 
constants of L into G is presented. The interpretation 
of the expressions in the column for G are clarified 
below in this paper when G is formally defined. 
Next, the syntactic rules of L and the translation 
rules to G are presented. Each rule is presented in a 
box containing the purpose of the rule, the syntactic 
rule itself with examples of expressions that can be 
formed with the rule, and finally the translation 
rule of expressions formed by the rule to their 
corresponding expressions in G. Following 
Montague, syntactic rules and the syntactic 
operations for combining symbols (for instance, Ft) 
associated to each rule are separated. In the 
following, Pc is the set of expressions of catergory

2.2 Definit ion of  the Language G 
In this section, the syntax and semantics or the 
graphical language are formally defined, as well as the 
rules for translating raphical expressions back into 
natural anguage. The types of language G are defined 
as follows: 
(1) e is a type (graphical objects). 
(2) t is a type (truth values). 
(3) If  a and b are any types, then <a, b> is a type. 
(4) Nothing else is a type. 
Let V~ be the set of variables of type s, C~ the set of 
basic constants of type s, and Es the set of well- 
formed expressions of graphical type s. The basic

The symbols of', between* and from_to* are

In the same way that the translation of basic 
constants of L into G where given with the purpose 
to understand the translation rules T1L tO T7L, in 
Figure 8 and 9 the reciprocal translations are given. 
Note that constants of G in Figure 8 translate into 
basic constants of L; however, the translation shown 
in Figure 9 are more complex as composite 
expressions of G can translate into basic or composite 
expressions of L. Consider that expressions 1 to 6 of G 
in Figure 9 represent the graphical objects dl, d2, ds, 
r~, r2 and c~ in Figure 4. The reason to represent these 
objects with a type-rised is that the language G is 
designed to allow quantification over the graphical

representing Paris, the corresponding expression 
denotes the set of geometrical properties that the dot 
representing Paris has. According to this, expression 1
(of G) in Figure 9 denotes the set containing all sets of 
dots of the drawing in which dt is included; thus, if P 
is the set of all dots representing cities, dl is included 
in P (that is to say, P is a property of dl), but if P is the 
set of all dots representing cities in Germany then d~ is 
not included in P.

The semantics for the language is given in a 
model-theoretic fashion as follows. 
Let A be the set of graphical individuals A = 
{dl, d2, d3, rl, r2, r3, r4, cl, c2, c3, c4, c5, c6, 11, right- 
side, right-rb right-r2, right-r3, right-r4}, where dl 
to 11 are the graphical entities shown in Figure 4, 
right-side is "the right" and right-re is the zone at 
the right side of region r~. Let Dx be the set of 
possible denotations for expressions of type x, such 
that De = A, Dt = { 1, 0}, and, for any types a and b, 
D<~.b> =DbD~ (i. e., the set of all functions from D~ 
to Db). Let F be an interpretation function that 
assigns to each constant of type a a member of Da. 
The interpretation (assigned by F) of the constants 
dot, region, curve, line, right, intersection are the 
sets containing the corresponding graphical objects. 
The interpretation of the constants lie_at, in_zone, 
inside, curve_between, intersection_between, 
line_from_to, zone (whose types are shown in 
Figure 6) are geometrical functions. If the 
arguments of these functions have an appropriate 
geometrical type (dot, region, curve, etc.) 
expressions containing these constants can be 
properly interpreted through a geometrical 
algorithm; however, if some of the arguments are 
not of the right kind of geometrical object, then 
expressions containing these constants have no 
denotation in G and, as a consequence, their 
translation into L lack a denotation too. These 
conditions can be computed with the help of the 
type-predicates forgeometrical objects in G. 
Following Montague, the interpretation of 
variables is defined in terms of an assignment 
function g. It is also adopted the notational 
convention by which the semantic value or 
denotation of an expression tx with respect o a 
model M and a value assignment g is expressed as 
\[\[a\]\] M,~. 
The semantic rules for interpreting the language 
L are the following: 
1. I fa~ C~, then \[\[a\]\]M= ~a) .  
2. If I.t e V~, then \[\[~\]\]M,g = g(B). 
3. If aeE<a,b>, and 13eE,~, then \[\[ct(\[3)\]\] M's = 
\[\[a\]l~'ff\[\[p\]\]) M's 
4. If o~eEa and ueVb, then \[\[Xu\[o~\] \]\] M,g is that 
function h from Db into Da such that for all 
objects k in Db, h(k) is equal to \[\[et\]\] M'g.
5. I faeEa,  ueVb, and \[3~Eb, then \[\[Xu\[tx\](\[~)\]\] M'g is 
equal to \[\[tx(u/13)\]\] M'g, where a(ul\[3) is the result 
of replacing all ocurrences of u for 83 in a. 
6. If B~V, y 13~E, then \[\[3B(13)\]\] M'8 =1 ifffor some 
value assignment g' such that g' is exactly like g 
except possibly for the individual assigned to I.t by 
g,, \[\[p\]\]M,g' =1. 
7. Ifl.t~Vs y \[3~Et hen \[\[VI.t(\[3)\]\] u'g =1 iff for every 
value assignment g' such that g' is exactly like g 
except possibly for the individual assigned to ~ by 
g,, \[\[p\]\]M,~' =1. 
With this, the specification of the system of 
multimodal interpretation presented in Figure 3 is 
concluded. In this system it is possible to express 
natural language and graphics and translate 
expresssion between each other as stated in Section 
1. It is also possible to interpret multimodal 
messages in which part of information is expressed 
in one modality but some information is carried out 
in the other modality. One advantage of the system 
is that a natural anguage question can be answered 
by considering the graphics; for instance, if one 
asks (with a suitable extension to the language) 
what is the distance between Paris and Frankfurt? 
the answer could be obtained by translating the 
question into the graphical domain where the 
distance sought could be computed in terms of the 
geometry (assuming that the map is drawn at a 
given scale) and the numerical value could be 
translated back into natural language. In addition, if 
112 L.A. Pineda and G. Garza 
reasoning models acting upon representations of
each of the modalities were stated, problems could 
be solved in the modality requiring the lower 
reasoning effort. 
Another advantage of the system is that it 
permits to rule out natural language expressions 
which are well-formed syntactically but are, 
nevertheless, meaningless. The expression a city of  
France is well-formed and has a well-defined 
reference; however, the expression a city of  Paris, 
with the same syntactic form, is not well-defined 
semantically. This last expression can be rule out as 
ungrammatical s its translation into the graphical 
language does not have an interpretation i  terms of 
the geometry. If a condition to the effect that a 
expression of L is grammatical only if its 
translation into G has a well-defined enotation, 
the graphical domain imposes a kind of selectional 
restriction which simplifies greatly the syntactic 
definition of L. 
At this point, one warning note is in order: the 
graphical anguage is probably too expressive and 
more complex than required. However, having 
explicit quantification i the graphical domain can 
pose some interesting questions. Traditionally 
graphics is considered appropriate for representing 
concrete situations and natural anguage is better to 
express abstractions. However, this is not 
necessarily the case: consider the example of Figure 
1 in which the drawings of a man, a car and a 
bucket were taken to represent concrete individuals. 
This is so because the man and the car were taken 
to be the antecedents of the anaphoric pronouns he 
and it. In a suitable graphical language of the kind 
developed here a definite reference to such 
graphical objects can be made as follows: 
~,PXQ3y\[Vx\[P(x) ~ x=y\] A Q(y)\] (~ ). 
However, some pressupositions are involved in 
this interpretation choice as the graphical symbols 
could also be taken to be representing any 
individual or even the set of all individuals of the 
kind. In the language G all of these readings of the 
drawings can be expressed as shown in Figure 10. 
The multimodal interpretation system developed 
here does not solve the question of which 
interpretation should be preferred to, and this 
question can only be resolved most probably at a 
pragmatic level; however, the distinction can be 
made and it should be taken into consideration i a 
general theory of graphical interpretation. Consider, 
for instance, whether the drawing of a car on a road 
sign preventing cars from parking should be 
interpreted as a particular car, any car or all cars.

Figure 10 
The theory also suggests an intriguing path of 
exploration related to interactive issues. In the same 
way that natural anguage xpressions can be input 
directly through the interface, concrete graphical 
symbols are normally placed on the screen by 
graphical input devices. The question is, however, 
whether it is possible and useful to input 
expressions of G, like the ones in Figure 10, 
directly. At the moment his issue is left for further 
research. 
One last consideration is that the system of 
multimodal interpretation presented here provides a 
sound representational scheme to refer in an 
uniform way to symbols on the screen and to the 
objects in the world that they represent. In 
particular, the ambiguity of natural language 
expressions making interwoven reference to objects 
on the screen and their interpretation can be placed 
in a clear representational setting. 
3 Incremental Interpretation 
In the theory developed in Section 2 it was assumed 
that the translation of the basic constants of all 
categories from L to G and vice versa were known, 
and then multimodal interpretation and reasoning 
were possible; however, in the interpretation of 
multimodal messages, natural language and 
graphics are input from different sources, and 
working out the meaning of a multimodal message 
is by no means trivial. As was discussed in Section 
1, solving the graphical anaphora, finding out the 
reference of deictic pronouns and inducing the 
translation function are related problems that need 
to be solved for the interpretation of multimodal 
messages. Consider, for instance, the situation of 
reading a book with words and pictures: when the 
associations between text and graphical symbols is 
realized by the reader, the message as a whole has 
been properly understood. However, it cannot be 
A Model for Multimodal Reference Resolution 113 
expected that such an association can be known 
beforehand. 
Inducing this translation function is similar to 
the computer vision problem of interpreting 
drawings. A related antecedent is the work on the 
logic of depiction (Reiter et al, 1987) in which a 
logic for the interpretation f maps to be applied in 
computer vision and intelligent graphics is 
developed. It is argued that any adequate 
representation scheme for visual (and computer 
graphics) knowledge must mantain the distinction 
between knowledge of the image (the graphics) and 
knowledge of the scene (its interpretation), and 
about the depiction relation. In Reiter's system two 
sets of first order logical sentences representing the 
scene and the image are employed, and express, 
respectively, the conceptual and geometrical 
knowledge about hand drawn sketch maps of 
geographical regions. The depiction relation 
corresponds to the translation function between 
constants of L and G discussed above. An 
interpretation i Reiter's system is defined as a 
model, in the logical sense, of both sets of sentences 
and the depiction relation, and interpreting a 
drawing consists in finding out all possible models 
of such sets of sentences. 
Although computing the set of models of a set of 
first order sentences i computationally untractable 
problem, the entities constituting a drawing 
conform, normally, a finite set which is often small. 
So, the possibility of computing the set of models of 
a drawings is a matter for empirical research. In 
particular, Reiter's system employs a constraint 
satistaction algorithm to find out all possible 
interpretation fmaps, and the output of his system 
is a set of labels for curves or chains as rivers, roads 
or shores, and for areas as land regions or water 
regions. As was mentioned above, to find the 
translation functions between G and I., is a similar 
problem with the same kind of complexity. 
As a side effect of working out the translation 
between basic graphical and linguistic constants, a 
method for generating natural anguage xpressions 
that refer to graphical objects and configurations i  
at hand. Consider that a natural language 
description can have both simple and composite 
referring expression that translate into basic 
graphical constants, and inducing the linguistic 
translation of a graphical term which has not been 
named is the same as generating a linguistic 
description for such an object. Next, an algorithm 
for constructing the translations i illustrated. 
As a preliminar consideration it is important to 
highlight hat such translations cannot be built with 
the overt information expressed through the 
multimodal message. For working out the 
interpretation of Figure 2, for instance, it is 
required, in addition to the text and graphics, 
knowledge about the geography of Europe and also 
knowledge about interpretation conventions of 
maps. To find out the translation such knowledge 
must be employed. 
The conventions about the interpretation of 
maps are expressed as a correspondence b tween 
graphical and conceptual types, for instance, that 
dots represent cities and regions represent 
countries. General knowledge about maps, either 
geometrical or conceptual, will constraint the 
possible translation. 
The algorithm for computing the translation 
function has two parts; the purpose of the first is to 
assign a graphical constant to all terms in the overt 
textual message according to the grammar of L, and 
the second is to assign a referring expression to the 
remaining raphical constants of the drawing. For 
the example in Figure 2, the output of the first part 
is shown in Figure 11.

For the definition of the algorithm a function 
table for representing the set of possible functions 
from graphical to linguistic constants of the 
corresponding semantic types is defined. The 
interpretation conventions for maps are stated 
through the order pairs in the following set: 1 = 
{<dot, city>, <region, country>, <curve, border>, 
<line, line>}. The function table for the first pair in 
relation to Figure 2 and 4 is shown in Figure 13.

Figure 13 
As can be seen the function table in Figure 13 
relates all dots to all cities in the text. As any dot 
can represent any city, but different cities are 
represented by different dots, each dot must be 
associated to one city by filling the box in which the 
dot intersects the corresponding city in the function 
table. Considering that once a dot has been assigned 
to a city, the row corresponding to that city cannot 
be filled out for the other dots. According to this, if 
there are n cities, the first dot receiving an 
interpretation can be assigned in n different ways (it 
can represents one of the n cities), the second in n-1 
different ways, etc. As a consequence, each function 
map represents n! possible interpretation functions 
(if all cities are represented). 
The first step in the algorithm is to identify all 
graphical and linguistic basic constants from the 
overt message and draw the function tables for the 
interpretation conventions et L In our example 
basic linguisctic constants referring to graphical 
objects (proper names) name cities and countries, 
and only a function table for region representing 
countries (in addition to Figure 13) is considered as 
shown in Figure 14.

The next step is to fill out tables in Figures 13 
and 14 with all possible interpretations that are 
consistent with the overt knowledge and also the 
background knowledge about the interpretation 
task, in this case knowledge about he geography of 
Europe. The general knowledge to be considered for 
this example is shown in Figure 15. Note that 
clauses 1 to 6 are general knowlege of geography, 
but clause 7 is introduced explicitly in the 
multimodal message. Note as well that there might 
be a considerable amount of knowledge about the 
geography of Europe which is not included in 
Figure 15. However, how knowledge is brought 
about to the interpretation process is beyond the 
scope of this paper. The only consideration is that 
the range values of the function tables are the main 
indices that somehow retrieve the information from 
memory.

6. i Germany is to the east of France 
7. :Saarbrticken lies at the intersection

Germany and a line from Paris to Frankfurt 
Figure 15 
For filling out the function tables th set of all 
constraints hould be considered. As shown by 
Reiter (Reiter et al, 1987) all possible models can 
be found for a finite set of graphical symbols-- 
with a constraint satisfaction algorithm. Along this 
line, we are exploring strategies to find out the set 
of models incrementally extending the function 
tables filling out one column of one table at a time 
by considering one constraint at a time. This is 
done in a way that the extended model satisfies all 
constraints considered so far. The process continues 
until all function tables are filled out. 
For the example, propositions 3 to 7 are 
considered to produce the function tables illustrated 
in Figure 16. Note, in particular, that if proposition 
7 is not considered a diagonal model for the 
intepretation f dots would also be admissible.

The next step of the algorithm consists in 
identifying the translations of composite referring 
expressions to complete table in Figure 11. This can 
be done with the help of the grammar, the 
translation functions, the semantic interpretation f
G and the translations already computed in Figure 
16. In fact, once the translation of basic constants i
known the translation of composite terms using 
those constants can be found compositionally in
terms of the translation rules from L to G and the 
interpretation rules of G. Consider, additionally, 
that the translation for basic constants for other 
categories i given beforehand as shown in Figure 
6. For instance, the translation of the composite 
expression the border between France and 
Germany into G is 
~.P~,Q3y\[Vx\[P(x) ~ x=y\] ^ a(y)\] 
(between" (~P\[P(rl)\]) (kP\[P(r2)\]) (curve)) 
which can be reduced into 
kQ3y\[Vx\[between" (EP\[P(rj)\]) (~P\[P(rz)\]) 
(curve) (x) ~ x=y\] ^ Q(y)\] 
to produce the final value which is, due to the type 
rising of terms, the set of properties that c, has, and 
for simplicity we take it to be the constant c~. 
Next, the second part of the algorithm 
producing the translation of the set UNNAMED of 
graphical constants that have no name, as shown in 
Figure 12, is described. In order to carry out this 
process, the first step is to identify the types of all 
constants in UNNAMED with the help of the type 
predicates of G. For each constant it is required to 
identify all geometrical functions producing objects 
of the constant type. So, the same constant may be 
produced by a number of ways depending on the 
geometrical functions available for producing 
objects of the constant type. The next step consists 
in identifying all combinations of expressions that 
can be used as arguments of geometrical functions, 
forming in this way a set of expressions that can 
produce the constant at hand. Each of these 
expressions i  interpreted. From this process two 
kinds of outputs can be expected: either the 
expression has a well-defined value or it does not. 
Expressions having a proper value must be 
combined with a graphical quantifier, and probably 
with other expressions of G (to produce the 
between* term from the geometrical function 
curve_between). The resulting term can be 
translated back into the natural language, producing 
in this way the corresponding description. 
Suppose it is desired to find a referring 
expression of the constant ct of graphical type 
curve. Considering all geometrical functions 
denoted by the basic constants of G, only curve and 
curve_between can produce curves. The constant 
curve denotes the set of curves on the drawing, so 
the expressions ~,P~Q3x\[P(x) ^ Q(x)\](curve) --a 
border-- and 2~P~Q3y\[Vx\[P(x) ~ x=y\] ^  
Q(y)\](curve) --the border-- can be formed; the 
interpretation f the former expression results in the 
set of properties that one curve or another has, 
including the properties of curve ct; however, the 
intepretation of the last expression results in an 
empty set as there is more than one curve in the 
drawing. So, only the former expression generated 
by the constant curve is a possible description of ct. 
If the constant curve_between is considered, the 
expressions hown in Figure 16 can be obtained 
(the expressions denoting empty sets --as 
between*(kP\[P(rl)\]) kP\[P(ri)\]) curve)---- where 
omitted). As can be seen, only the first of these 
expressions refers to the curve denoted by c,.

Thus, the expressions a border, a border 
between France and Germany and the border 
between France and Germany are possible 
descriptions for cl. The pragmatic hoice of which 
expression is the most appropriate in an 
interpretation context goes beyond the scope of this 
paper; here we are only concerned with the 
computation of the set of expressions that can be 
correctly produced in terms of the multimodal 
representation. 
This procedure has one additional complication 
that has to be taken into account. Once a graphical 
object has been produced by the procedure 
mentioned above it can also extend the set of the 
argument combinations of the graphical functions 
referring to other well-formed graphical objects. 
Note that it is possible to produce very large 
expressions and even infinite ones with the 
unconstrained recursive application of the 
procedure. It could be possible to produce, for 
instance, the border between France and Germany 
116 L.A. Pineda and G. Garza 
between France and Germany between France and 
Germany. This expression is well-formed and 
denotes the border between France and Germany. In 
order to prevent these kind of very large expressions 
an algorithm for generating the set of simplest but 
maximally expressive xpressions of a graphical 
language has been proposed (Santana, 1995). 
4 Multimodal Discourse Representation 
Theory  
The ability to interpret individual multimodal 
messages is a prerrequisite for interpreting 
sequences of multimodal messages occuring in the 
normal flow of interactive conversations. In the 
same sense that discourse theories, like DRT, are 
designed to interpret sequences of sentences, it is 
desirable to have a theory in which sequences of 
multimodal messages can be understood. Such a 
kind of theory would have to support anaphoric and 
deictic resolution models in an integrated fashion, 
and would have to be placed in a larger pragmatic 
setting in which intentions and presupositions are 
considered, and in which mechanisms to retrieve 
knowledge from memory are also taken into 
account. To work out such a theory is quite an 
ambitious goal, however, in the same way that DRT 
focuses in internal structural processes that govern 
anaphoric resolution, it is plausible to consider a 
multimodal discourse representation theory 
(MDRT) to cope with referential aspects of 
multimodal communication. In the same way that 
DRT postulates discourse representation structures 
in which referents and conditions are introduced 
incrementally through the interpretation of the 
incoming natural language discourse through the 
application of construction rules, it is plausible to 
conceive similar multimodal discourse 
representation structures (MDRS) whose referents 
and conditions would be introduced by modality 
depending construction rules acting upon the 
expressions of the corresponding modality. The 
definition of such an extention of DRT is a long- 
term goal of this work. 
A consequence of the notion of modality that 
has been developed so far is that expressions 
referring to graphical objects and relations are well- 
defined in a suitable language, and could be 
included as referents and conditions in the proposed 
MDRS. In these structures, DRS-conditions 
extracted from different modalities would be kept in 
separate partitions, but the discourse referents 
would be abstract objects common to the whole 
MDRS. The formalization of modalities in terms of 
representation languages would permit to extend 
DRT, allowing to handle different modalities, as 
long as the conditions and referents were introduced 
by construction rules that triggered by specific 
syntactic configurations of the representation 
language of the modality in question. 
In summary, the definition of this kind of 
structures would be possible if the following three 
questions could be answered: how information of 
different modalities can be incorporated into a 
MDRS, how discourse referents common to 
expressions ofdifferent modalities can be identified, 
and lastly, how simplification of conditions 
involving different modalities can be carried out. 
The suggestion is that these three problems can be 
solved in terms of the scheme shown in Figure 3 
and Section 2, and the interpretation process 
illustrated in Section 3. For the moment these issues 
are left for further work. 
5 Conclusions 
In this paper a theory of representation and 
interpretation for multimodal messages, and a 
model for multimodal reference resolution has been 
presented. First, it was discussed how this problem 
can be stated in terms of so-called linguistic 
anaphor with pictorial antecedents, or pictorial 
anaphor with linguistic antecedents. It was argued 
that in more traditional lines such a problem can be 
thought of, alternativelly, as the resolution of 
spacial indexical referents. It was also argued that 
with a representational theory of modality, one in 
which the notion of modality is captured in terms of 
a formal language and its interpreter, a third 
interpretation of the problem of multimodal 
reference resolution can be given. In this last view, 
solving multimodal references can be thought of as 
inducing a translation function between basic 
constants of the modalities involved. The 
representation and interpretation machinery for 
carrying on this third view was formally developed 
along the lines of Montague's emiotic programme 
and its associated general theory of translation. It 
was also illustrated an algorithm for finding out 
such a translation relation when text and graphics 
are introduced through independent input channels, 
and the translation between constants must be 
induced dynamically. Finally, it was suggested to 
extend Kamp's DRT with multimodal discourse 
structures (MDRS) in order to model the referential 
aspects of the kind of multimodal discourse that is 
likely to occur in interactive multimodal 
A Model for Multimodal Reference Resolution 117 
conversation. This extension would permit to 
capture an aspect of spacial deixis which is 
currently beyond the scope of DRT. If the notion of 
multimodal discourse representation structures is 
developed along the lines suggested in this paper, 
Kamp's demarcation between anaphoric and deictic 
uses of pronouns could be formally captured, as the 
sets of antecedents taken from the world would be 
incorparted as referents and conditions of a MDRS: 
while the antecedents for anaphoric pronouns taken 
from preceeding text are accesible for pronouns, 
deictic antecedents would be accesible via 
translation functions.
