The paper addresses using artificial neu-
ral networks for classification of Amharic
news items. Amharic is the language for
countrywide communication in Ethiopia
and has its own writing system contain-
ing extensive systematic redundancy. It is
quite dialectally diversified and probably
representative of the languages of a conti-
nent that so far has received little attention
within the language processing field.
The experiments investigated document
clustering around user queries using Self-
Organizing Maps, an unsupervised learn-
ing neural network strategy. The best
ANN model showed a precision of 60.0%
when trying to cluster unseen data, and a
69.5% precision when trying to classify it.
