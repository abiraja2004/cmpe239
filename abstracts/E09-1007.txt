We propose a system which builds, in a
semi-supervised manner, a resource that
aims at helping a NER system to anno-
tate corpus-specific named entities. This
system is based on a distributional ap-
proach which uses syntactic dependen-
cies for measuring similarities between
named entities. The specificity of the
presented method however, is to combine
a clique-based approach and a clustering
technique that amounts to a soft clustering
method. Our experiments show that the
resource constructed by using this clique-
based clustering system allows to improve
different NER systems.
