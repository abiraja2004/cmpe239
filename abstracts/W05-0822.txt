 
This paper describes the participation of 
the Portage team at NRC Canada in the 
shared task1 of ACL 2005 Workshop on 
Building and Using Parallel Texts. We dis-
cuss Portage, a statistical phrase-based 
machine translation system, and present 
experimental results on the four language 
pairs of the shared task. First, we focus on 
the French-English task using multiple re-
sources and techniques. Then we describe 
our contribution on the Finnish-English, 
Spanish-English and German-English lan-
guage pairs using the provided data for the 
shared task.
