We propose a normalized-cut model for the
problem of aligning a known hierarchical
browsing structure, e.g., electronic slides of
lecture recordings, with the sequential tran-
scripts of the corresponding spoken docu-
ments, with the aim to help index and access
the latter. This model optimizes a normalized-
cut graph-partitioning criterion and considers
local tree constraints at the same time. The ex-
perimental results show the advantage of this
model over Viterbi-like, sequential alignment,
under typical speech recognition errors.
