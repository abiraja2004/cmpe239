We present a web mining method for discov-
ering and enhancing relationships in which a
specified concept (word class) participates.
We discover a whole range of relationships
focused on the given concept, rather than
generic known relationships as in most pre-
vious work. Our method is based on cluster-
ing patterns that contain concept words and
other words related to them. We evaluate the
method on three different rich concepts and
find that in each case the method generates a
broad variety of relationships with good pre-
cision.
