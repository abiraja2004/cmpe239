The Valency Lexicon of Czech Verbs, Version
1.0 (VALLEX 1.0) is a collection of linguisti-
cally annotated data and documentation, resul-
ting from an attempt at formal description of
valency frames of Czech verbs. VALLEX 1.0
is closely related to Prague Dependency Tre-
ebank. In this paper, the context in which
VALLEX came into existence is briefly outli-
ned, and also three similar projects for English
verbs are mentioned. The core of the paper is
the description of the logical structure of the
VALLEX data. Finally, we suggest a few di-
rections of the future research.
