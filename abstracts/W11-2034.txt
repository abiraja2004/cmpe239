 We describe a novel world model frame-work designed to support situated human-robot communication through improved mutual knowledge about the physical world. This work focuses on enabling a  robot to store and use semantic information from a human located in the same envi-ronment as the robot and respond using human-understandable terminology. This facilitates information sharing between a robot and a human and subsequently pro-motes team-based operations. Herein, we present motivation for our world model, an overview of the world model, a discussion of proof-of-concept simulations, and future work.
