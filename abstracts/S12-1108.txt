 
In this paper, we present our system descrip-
tion in task of Cross-lingual Textual Entail-
ment. The goal of this task is to detect 
entailment relations between two sentences 
written in different languages. To accomplish 
this goal, we first translate sentences written 
in foreign languages into English. Then, we 
use EDITS1, an open source package, to rec-
ognize entailment relations. Since EDITS only 
draws monodirectional relations while the task 
requires bidirectional prediction, thus we ex-
change the hypothesis and test to detect en-
tailment in another direction. Experimental 
results show that our method achieves promis-
ing results but not perfect results compared to 
other participants.
