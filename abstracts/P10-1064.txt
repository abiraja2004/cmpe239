We propose a translation recommendation
framework to integrate Statistical Machine
Translation (SMT) output with Transla-
tion Memory (TM) systems. The frame-
work recommends SMT outputs to a TM
user when it predicts that SMT outputs are
more suitable for post-editing than the hits
provided by the TM. We describe an im-
plementation of this framework using an
SVM binary classifier. We exploit meth-
ods to fine-tune the classifier and inves-
tigate a variety of features of different
types. We rely on automatic MT evalua-
tion metrics to approximate human judge-
ments in our experiments. Experimental
results show that our system can achieve
0.85 precision at 0.89 recall, excluding ex-
act matches. Furthermore, it is possible for
the end-user to achieve a desired balance
between precision and recall by adjusting
confidence levels.
