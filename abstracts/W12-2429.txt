The most accurate approaches to Word Sense
Disambiguation (WSD) for biomedical docu-
ments are based on supervised learning. How-
ever, these require manually labeled training
examples which are expensive to create and
consequently supervised WSD systems are
normally limited to disambiguating a small set
of ambiguous terms. An alternative approach
is to create labeled training examples automat-
ically and use them as a substitute for manu-
ally labeled ones. This paper describes a large
scale WSD system based on automatically la-
beled examples generated using information
from the UMLS Metathesaurus. The labeled
examples are generated without any use of la-
beled training data whatsoever and is therefore
completely unsupervised (unlike some previ-
ous approaches). The system is evaluated on
two widely used data sets and found to outper-
form a state-of-the-art unsupervised approach
which also uses information from the UMLS
Metathesaurus.
