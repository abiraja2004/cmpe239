Our system breaks down the problem of rank-
ing a list of lexical substitutions according to
how simple they are in a given context into a
series of pairwise comparisons between can-
didates. For this we learn a binary classifier.
As only very little training data is provided,
we describe a procedure for generating artifi-
cial unlabeled data from Wordnet and a corpus
and approach the classification task as a semi-
supervised machine learning problem. We use
a co-training procedure that lets each classi-
fier increase the other classifier?s training set
with selected instances from an unlabeled data
set. Our features include n-gram probabilities
of candidate and context in a web corpus, dis-
tributional differences of candidate in a cor-
pus of ?easy? sentences and a corpus of normal
sentences, syntactic complexity of documents
that are similar to the given context, candidate
length, and letter-wise recognizability of can-
didate as measured by a trigram character lan-
guage model.
