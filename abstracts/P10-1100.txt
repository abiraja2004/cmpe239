We describe a novel approach to unsuper-
vised learning of the events that make up
a script, along with constraints on their
temporal ordering. We collect natural-
language descriptions of script-specific
event sequences from volunteers over the
Internet. Then we compute a graph rep-
resentation of the script?s temporal struc-
ture using a multiple sequence alignment
algorithm. The evaluation of our system
shows that we outperform two informed
baselines.
