Recognizing entailment at the lexical level is
an important and commonly-addressed com-
ponent in textual inference. Yet, this task has
been mostly approached by simplified heuris-
tic methods. This paper proposes an initial
probabilistic modeling framework for lexical
entailment, with suitable EM-based parame-
ter estimation. Our model considers promi-
nent entailment factors, including differences
in lexical-resources reliability and the impacts
of transitivity and multiple evidence. Evalu-
ations show that the proposed model outper-
forms most prior systems while pointing at re-
quired future improvements.
