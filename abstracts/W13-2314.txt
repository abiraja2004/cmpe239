Anaphoric shell nouns such as this is-
sue and this fact conceptually encapsulate
complex pieces of information (Schmid,
2000). We examine the feasibility of anno-
tating such anaphoric nouns using crowd-
sourcing. In particular, we present our
methodology for reliably annotating an-
tecedents of such anaphoric nouns and the
challenges we faced in doing so. We also
evaluated the quality of crowd annotation
using experts. The results suggest that
most of the crowd annotations were good
enough to use as training data for resolv-
ing such anaphoric nouns.
