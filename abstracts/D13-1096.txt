Natural language conversation is widely re-
garded as a highly difficult problem, which
is usually attacked with either rule-based or
learning-based models. In this paper we
propose a retrieval-based automatic response
model for short-text conversation, to exploit
the vast amount of short conversation in-
stances available on social media. For this
purpose we introduce a dataset of short-text
conversation based on the real-world instances
from Sina Weibo (a popular Chinese mi-
croblog service), which will be soon released
to public. This dataset provides rich collec-
tion of instances for the research on finding
natural and relevant short responses to a given
short text, and useful for both training and test-
ing of conversation models. This dataset con-
sists of both naturally formed conversation-
s, manually labeled data, and a large repos-
itory of candidate responses. Our prelimi-
nary experiments demonstrate that the simple
retrieval-based conversation model performs
reasonably well when combined with the rich
instances in our dataset.
