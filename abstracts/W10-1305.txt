 
The use of speech production data has been limited by a steep learning curve and the need for laborious hand measurement. We are building a tool set that provides summary sta-tistics for measures designed by clinicians to screen, diagnose or provide training to assis-tive technology users.  This will be achieved by extending an existing shareware software platform with ?plug-ins? that perform specific measures and report results to the user. The common underlying basis for this tool set is a Stevens? paradigm of landmarks, points in an utterance around which information about ar-ticulatory events can be extracted.
