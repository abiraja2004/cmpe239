 
We explore variability involved in speech 
with a non-native accent. We first employ a 
combination of knowledge-based and data-
driven approaches for the analysis of 
pronunciation variants between L1 
(German) and target L2 (Slovak). 
Knowledge gained in this two-step process 
is then used in adapting acoustic models 
and the lexicon. We focus on modifications 
in the pronunciation dictionary and speech 
rate. Our results show that the recognition 
of German-accented Slovak is significantly 
improved with techniques modeling slow 
L2 speech, and that the adaptation of the 
pronunciation dictionary yields only 
insignificant gains.
