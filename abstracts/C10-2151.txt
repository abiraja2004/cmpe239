Search with synonyms is a challenging
problem for Web search, as it can eas-
ily cause intent drifting. In this paper,
we propose a practical solution to this is-
sue, based on co-clicked query analysis,
i.e., analyzing queries leading to clicking
the same documents. Evaluation results
on Web search queries show that syn-
onyms obtained from this approach con-
siderably outperform the thesaurus based
synonyms, such as WordNet, in terms of
keeping search intent.
