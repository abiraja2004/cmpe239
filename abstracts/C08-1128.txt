Words in Chinese text are not naturally
separated by delimiters, which poses a
challenge to standard machine translation
(MT) systems. In MT, the widely used
approach is to apply a Chinese word seg-
menter trained from manually annotated
data, using a fixed lexicon. Such word
segmentation is not necessarily optimal
for translation. We propose a Bayesian
semi-supervised Chinese word segmenta-
tion model which uses both monolingual
and bilingual information to derive a seg-
mentation suitable for MT. Experiments
show that our method improves a state-of-
the-art MT system in a small and a large
data environment.
