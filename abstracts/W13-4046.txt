We explore hedging in web forum con-
versations, which is interestingly different
to hedging in academic articles, the main
focus of recent automatic approaches to
hedge detection. One of our main results
is that forum posts using hedges are more
likely to get high ratings of their useful-
ness. We also make a case for focusing
annotation efforts on hedges that take the
form of first-person epistemic phrases.
