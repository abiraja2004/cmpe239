This paper describes a technique for ex-
tracting idioms from text. The tech-
nique works by finding patterns such as
?thrills and spills?, whose reversals (such
as ?spills and thrills?) are never encoun-
tered.
This method collects not only idioms, but
also many phrases that exhibit a strong
tendency to occur in one particular order,
due apparently to underlying semantic is-
sues. These include hierarchical relation-
ships, gender differences, temporal order-
ing, and prototype-variant effects.
