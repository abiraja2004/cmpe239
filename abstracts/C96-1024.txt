 
The paper discusses how compositional 
semantics is implemented in the Verb- 
mobil speech-to-speech translation sys- 
tem using LUD, a description language 
for underspecified discourse representa- 
tion structures. The description lan- 
guage and its formal interpretation in 
DRT are described as well as its imple- 
mentation together with the architecture 
of the system's entire syntactic-semantic 
processing module. We show that a lin- 
guistically sound theory and formalism 
can be properly implemented in a sys- 
tem with (near) real-time requirements.
