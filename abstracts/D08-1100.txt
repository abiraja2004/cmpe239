 
We describe an approach for acquiring the 
domain-specific dialog knowledge required to 
configure a task-oriented dialog system that 
uses human-human interaction data. The key 
aspects of this problem are the design of a di-
alog information representation and a learning 
approach that supports capture of domain in-
formation from in-domain dialogs. To 
represent a dialog for a learning purpose, we 
based our representation, the form-based di-
alog structure representation, on an observa-
ble structure. We show that this representation 
is sufficient for modeling phenomena that oc-
cur regularly in several dissimilar task-
oriented domains, including information-
access and problem-solving. With the goal of 
ultimately reducing human annotation effort, 
we examine the use of unsupervised learning 
techniques in acquiring the components of the 
form-based representation (i.e. task, subtask, 
and concept). These techniques include statis-
tical word clustering based on mutual infor-
mation and Kullback-Liebler distance, 
TextTiling, HMM-based segmentation, and 
bisecting K-mean document clustering. With 
some modifications to make these algorithms 
more suitable for inferring the structure of a 
spoken dialog, the unsupervised learning algo-
rithms show promise.
