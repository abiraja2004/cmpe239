 
We detail the design, development and evalua-
tion of Augmentative and Alternative Com-
munication (AAC) software which encourages 
rapid conversational interaction. The system 
uses Natural Language Generation (NLG) 
technology to automatically generate conver-
sational utterances from a domain knowledge 
base modelled from content suggested by a 
small AAC user group. Findings from this 
work are presented along with a discussion 
about how NLG might be successfully applied 
to conversational AAC systems in the future.
