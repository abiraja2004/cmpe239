Web search quality can vary widely across
languages, even for the same information
need. We propose to exploit this variation
in quality by learning a ranking function
on bilingual queries: queries that appear in
query logs for two languages but represent
equivalent search interests. For a given
bilingual query, along with correspond-
ing monolingual query log and monolin-
gual ranking, we generate a ranking on
pairs of documents, one from each lan-
guage. Then we learn a linear ranking
function which exploits bilingual features
on pairs of documents, as well as standard
monolingual features. Finally, we show
how to reconstruct monolingual ranking
from a learned bilingual ranking. Us-
ing publicly available Chinese and English
query logs, we demonstrate for both lan-
guages that our ranking technique exploit-
ing bilingual data leads to significant im-
provements over a state-of-the-art mono-
lingual ranking algorithm.
