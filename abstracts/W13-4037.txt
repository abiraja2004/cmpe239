Due to the mobile Internet revolution, peo-
ple tend to browse the Web while driv-
ing their car which puts the driver?s safety
at risk. Therefore, an intuitive and non-
distractive in-car speech interface to the
Web needs to be developed. Before de-
veloping a new speech dialog system in a
new domain developers have to examine
what the user?s preferred interaction style
is in order to use such a system. This pa-
per reports from a very recent driving sim-
ulation study and its preliminary results
which are conducted in order to compare
different speech dialog strategies. The
use of command-based and conversational
SDS prototypes while driving is evaluated
on usability and driving performance. Dif-
ferent GUIs are designed in order to sup-
port the respective dialog strategy the most
and to evaluate the effect of the GUI on us-
ability and driver distraction. The prelim-
inary results show that the conversational
speech dialog performs more efficient than
the command-based dialog. However, the
conversational dialog distracts more from
driving than the command-based. Further-
more, the results indicate that an SDS sup-
ported by a GUI is more efficient and bet-
ter accepted by the user than without GUI.
