In this paper, we discuss how to anno-
tate coreference and predicate-argument re-
lations in Japanese written text. There
have been research activities for building
Japanese text corpora annotated with coref-
erence and predicate-argument relations as
are done in the Kyoto Text Corpus version
4.0 (Kawahara et al, 2002) and the GDA-
Tagged Corpus (Hasida, 2005). However,
there is still much room for refining their
specifications. For this reason, we discuss
issues in annotating these two types of re-
lations, and propose a new specification for
each. In accordance with the specification,
we built a large-scaled annotated corpus, and
examined its reliability. As a result of our
current work, we have released an anno-
tated corpus named the NAIST Text Corpus1,
which is used as the evaluation data set in
the coreference and zero-anaphora resolu-
tion tasks in Iida et al (2005) and Iida et al
(2006).
