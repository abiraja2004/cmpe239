In this paper we extend the maximum
spanning tree (MST) dependency parsing
framework of McDonald et al (2005c)
to incorporate higher-order feature rep-
resentations and allow dependency struc-
tures with multiple parents per word.
We show that those extensions can make
the MST framework computationally in-
tractable, but that the intractability can be
circumvented with new approximate pars-
ing algorithms. We conclude with ex-
periments showing that discriminative on-
line learning using those approximate al-
gorithms achieves the best reported pars-
ing accuracy for Czech and Danish.
