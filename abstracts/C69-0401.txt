 
Experiments conducted over the last few years with the SMART docu- 
ment retrieval system have shown that fully automatic text processing 
methods using relatively simple linguistic tools are as effective for pur- 
poses of document indexing, classification, search, and retrieval as the 
more elaborate manual methods normally used in practice. Up to now, all 
experiments were carried out entirely with English language queries and docu- 
ments. 
The present study describes an extension of the SMAKT procedures to 
German language materials. A multi-lingual thesaurus is used for the ana- 
lysis of documents and search requests, and tools are provided which make 
it possible to process English language documents against German queries, 
and vice versa. The methods are evaluated, and it is shown that the effec- 
tiveness of the mixed language processing is approximately equivalent to 
that of the standard process operating within a single language only.
