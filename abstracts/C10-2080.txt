 
Various strategies have been proposed 
to enhance web search through utiliz-
ing individual user information. How-
ever, considering the well acknowl-
edged recurring queries and repetitive 
clicks among users, it is still an open 
issue whether using individual user in-
formation is a proper direction of ef-
forts in improving the web search. In 
this paper, we first quantitatively dem-
onstrate that individual user informa-
tion is more beneficial than common 
user information. Then we statistically 
compare the benefit of individual and 
common user information through 
Kappa statistic. Finally, we calculate 
potential for personalization to present 
an overview of what queries can bene-
fit more from individual user informa-
tion. All these analyses are conducted 
on both English AOL log and Chinese 
Sogou log, and a bilingual perspective 
statistics consistently confirms our 
findings.
