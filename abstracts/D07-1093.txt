We present a probabilistic model of di-
achronic phonology in which individual
word forms undergo stochastic edits along
the branches of a phylogenetic tree. Our ap-
proach allows us to achieve three goals with
a single unified model: (1) reconstruction
of both ancient and modern word forms, (2)
discovery of general phonological changes,
and (3) selection among different phyloge-
nies. We learn our model using a Monte
Carlo EM algorithm and present quantitative
results validating the model.
