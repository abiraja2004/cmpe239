Simple baselines provide insights into the value
of scoring functions and give starting points
for measuring the performance improvements
of technological advances. This paper presents
baseline unsupervised techniques for perform-
ing word alignment based on geometric and
word edit distances as well as supervised fu-
sion of the results of these techniques using the
nearest neighbor rule.
