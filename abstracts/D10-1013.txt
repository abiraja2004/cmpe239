Targeted paraphrasing is a new approach to the
problem of obtaining cost-effective, reasonable
quality translation that makes use of simple and
inexpensive human computations by monolin-
gual speakers in combination with machine
translation. The key insight behind the process
is that it is possible to spot likely translation
errors with only monolingual knowledge of the
target language, and it is possible to generate al-
ternative ways to say the same thing (i.e. para-
phrases) with only monolingual knowledge
of the source language. Evaluations demon-
strate that this approach can yield substantial
improvements in translation quality.
