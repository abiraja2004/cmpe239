In this paper, we present an automatic question
generation system that can generate gap-fill
questions for content in a document. Gap-fill
questions are fill-in-the-blank questions with
multiple choices (one correct answer and three
distractors) provided. The system finds the in-
formative sentences from the document and
generates gap-fill questions from them by first
blanking keys from the sentences and then de-
termining the distractors for these keys. Syn-
tactic and lexical features are used in this pro-
cess without relying on any external resource
apart from the information in the document.
We evaluated our system on two chapters of
a standard biology textbook and presented the
results.
