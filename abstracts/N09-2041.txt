This paper describes how named entity (NE)
classes can be used to improve broad cover-
age surface realization with the OpenCCG re-
alizer. Our experiments indicate that collaps-
ing certain multi-word NEs and interpolating
a language model where NEs are replaced by
their class labels yields the largest quality in-
crease, with 4-grams adding a small additional
boost. Substantial further benefit is obtained
by including class information in the hyper-
tagging (supertagging for realization) compo-
nent of the system, yielding a state-of-the-
art BLEU score of 0.8173 on Section 23 of
the CCGbank. A targeted manual evaluation
confirms that the BLEU score increase corre-
sponds to a significant rise in fluency.
