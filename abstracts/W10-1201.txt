We present an exploration of generative mod-
eling for the question answering (QA) task to
rank candidate passages. We investigate La-
tent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) models to ob-
tain ranking scores based on a novel similar-
ity measure between a natural language ques-
tion posed by the user and a candidate passage.
We construct two models each one introducing
deeper evaluations on latent characteristics of
passages together with given question. With
the new representation of topical structures on
QA datasets, using a limited amount of world
knowledge, we show improvements on perfor-
mance of a QA ranking system.
