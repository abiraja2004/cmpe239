Spoken Language Understanding aims at
mapping a natural language spoken sen-
tence into a semantic representation. In
the last decade two main approaches have
been pursued: generative and discrimi-
native models. The former is more ro-
bust to overfitting whereas the latter is
more robust to many irrelevant features.
Additionally, the way in which these ap-
proaches encode prior knowledge is very
different and their relative performance
changes based on the task. In this pa-
per we describe a machine learning frame-
work where both models are used: a gen-
erative model produces a list of ranked hy-
potheses whereas a discriminative model
based on structure kernels and Support
Vector Machines, re-ranks such list. We
tested our approach on the MEDIA cor-
pus (human-machine dialogs) and on a
new corpus (human-machine and human-
human dialogs) produced in the Euro-
pean LUNA project. The results show a
large improvement on the state-of-the-art
in concept segmentation and labeling.
