 Extracting medication information from clinical records has many potential appli-cations and was the focus of the i2b2 challenge in 2009. We present a hybrid system, comprised of machine learning and rule-based modules, for medication information extraction. With only a hand-ful of template-filling rules, the system?s core is a cascade of statistical classifiers for field detection. It achieved good per-formance that was comparable to the top systems in the i2b2 challenge, demon-strating that a heavily statistical ap-proach can perform as well or better than systems with many sophisticated rules. The system can easily incorporate addi-tional resources such as medication name lists to further improve performance.
