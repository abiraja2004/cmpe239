This paper describes our submission,
cmu-heafield-combo, to the WMT
2010 machine translation system combi-
nation task. Using constrained resources,
we participated in all nine language pairs,
namely translating English to and from
Czech, French, German, and Spanish as
well as combining English translations
from multiple languages. Combination
proceeds by aligning all pairs of system
outputs then navigating the aligned out-
puts from left to right where each path is
a candidate combination. Candidate com-
binations are scored by their length, agree-
ment with the underlying systems, and a
language model. On tuning data, improve-
ment in BLEU over the best system de-
pends on the language pair and ranges
from 0.89% to 5.57% with mean 2.37%.
