In this paper,an information distance based
approach is proposed to perform answer
validation for question answering system.
To validate an answer candidate, the ap-
proach calculates the conditional informa-
tion distance between the question focus
and the candidate under certain condition
pattern set. Heuristic methods are de-
signed to extract question focus and gen-
erate proper condition patterns from ques-
tion. General search engines are employed
to estimate the Kolmogorov complexity,
hence the information distance. Experi-
mental results show that our approach is
stable and flexible, and outperforms tradi-
tional tfidf methods.
