This paper describes a study on performance
of existing unsupervised algorithms of text
documents topical segmentation when ap-
plied to Polish plain text documents. For
performance measurement five existing top-
ical segmentation algorithms were selected,
three different Polish test collections were
created and seven approaches to text pre-
processing were implemented. Based on
quantitative results (Pk and WindowDiff
metrics) use of specific algorithm was rec-
ommended and impact of pre-processing
strategies was assessed. Thanks to use of
standardized metrics and application of pre-
viously described methodology for test col-
lection development, comparative results for
Polish and English were also obtained.
