Voice search is increasingly popular, espe-
cially for local business directory assistance.
However, speech recognition accuracy on
business listing names is still low, leading to
user frustration. In this paper, we present a
new algorithm for geo-centric language model
generation for local business voice search for
mobile users. Our algorithm has several ad-
vantages: it provides a language model for
any user in any location; the geographic area
covered by the language model is adapted to
the local business density, giving high recog-
nition accuracy; and the language models can
be pre-compiled, giving fast recognition time.
In an experiment using spoken business list-
ing name queries from a business directory
assistance service, we achieve a 16.8% abso-
lute improvement in recognition accuracy and
a 3-fold speedup in recognition time with geo-
centric language models when compared with
a nationwide language model.
