Distributional approaches to grammar in-
duction are typically inefficient, enumer-
ating large numbers of candidate con-
stituents. In this paper, we describe a
simplified model of distributional analy-
sis which uses heuristics to reduce the
number of candidate constituents under
consideration. We apply this model to
a large corpus of over 400000 words of
written English, and evaluate the results
using EVALB. We show that the perfor-
mance of this approach is limited, provid-
ing a detailed analysis of learned structure
and a comparison with actual constituent-
context distributions. This motivates a
more structured approach, using a process
of attachment to form constituents from
their distributional components. Our find-
ings suggest that distributional methods
do not generalize enough to learn syntax
effectively from raw text, but that attach-
ment methods are more successful.
