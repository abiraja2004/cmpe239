This article is devoted to the problem
of quantifying noun groups in German.
After a thorough description of the phe-
nom ena, the results of corpus-based in-
vestigations are described. Moreover,
some examples are given that under-
line the necessity of integrating some
kind of information other than gram-
mar sensu stricto into the treebank.
We argue that a more sophisticated
and fine-grained annotation in the tree-
bank would have very positve effects on
stochastic parsers trained on the tree-
bank and on grammars induced from
the treebank, and it would make the
treebank more valuable as a source of
data for theoretical linguistic investiga-
tions. The information gained from cor-
pus research and the analyses that are
proposed are realized in the framework
of SILVA, a parsing and extraction tool
for German text corpora.
