We propose a hybrid genera-
tive/discriminative framework for se-
mantic parsing which combines the hidden
vector state (HVS) model and the hidden
Markov support vector machines (HM-
SVMs). The HVS model is an extension of
the basic discrete Markov model in which
context is encoded as a stack-oriented
state vector. The HM-SVMs combine the
advantages of the hidden Markov models
and the support vector machines. By
employing a modified K-means clustering
method, a small set of most representative
sentences can be automatically selected
from an un-annotated corpus. These
sentences together with their abstract an-
notations are used to train an HVS model
which could be subsequently applied on
the whole corpus to generate semantic
parsing results. The most confident
semantic parsing results are selected to
generate a fully-annotated corpus which is
used to train the HM-SVMs. The proposed
framework has been tested on the DARPA
Communicator Data. Experimental results
show that an improvement over the base-
line HVS parser has been observed using
the hybrid framework. When compared
with the HM-SVMs trained from the fully-
annotated corpus, the hybrid framework
gave a comparable performance with only
a small set of lightly annotated sentences.
