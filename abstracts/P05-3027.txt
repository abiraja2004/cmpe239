SenseClusters is a freely available system
that identifies similar contexts in text. It
relies on lexical features to build first and
second order representations of contexts,
which are then clustered using unsuper-
vised methods. It was originally devel-
oped to discriminate among contexts cen-
tered around a given target word, but can
now be applied more generally. It also
supports methods that create descriptive
and discriminating labels for the discov-
ered clusters.
