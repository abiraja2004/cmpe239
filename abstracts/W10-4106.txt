 
In this paper, we propose a novel 
similarity measure based on  
co-occurrence probabilities for inducing 
semantic classes. Clustering with the new 
similarity measure outperformed that 
with the widely used distance measure 
based on Kullback-Leibler divergence in 
precision, recall and F1 evaluation. We 
then use the induced semantic classes and 
structures by the new similarity measure 
to generate in-domain data. At last, we 
use the generated data to do language 
model adaptation and improve the result 
of character recognition from 85.2% to 
91%.
