 
The present study deals with conflict resolution process in metaphorical 
interpretation for the noun phrase. In order to make the problem mbre explicit, we 
have reviewed the knowledge representation with conflict both from cognitive 
psychology and artificial intelligence. Then, we propose a semantic model which is 
obtained from the notion of Linguistics as Chemistry. That is, the model called 
"Semistry" is introduced so as to interprete a metaphor semantic bonds between 
nouns. By using production system couped with contex free parser (ELINGOL), the 
working system called META-SIM is constructed to analyze the noun phrase metaphor. 
Finally, there are discussions on a role of metaphor in human cognitive processing.
