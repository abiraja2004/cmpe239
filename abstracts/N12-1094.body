When people describe a scene, they often in-
clude information that is not visually apparent;
sometimes based on background knowledge,
sometimes to tell a story. We aim to sepa-
rate visual text?descriptions of what is being
seen?from non-visual text in natural images
and their descriptions. To do so, we first con-
cretely define what it means to be visual, an-
notate visual text and then develop algorithms
to automatically classify noun phrases as vi-
sual or non-visual. We find that using text
alone, we are able to achieve high accuracies
at this task, and that incorporating features
derived from computer vision algorithms im-
proves performance. Finally, we show that we
can reliably mine visual nouns and adjectives
from large corpora and that we can use these
effectively in the classification task.
