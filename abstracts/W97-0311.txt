 
Automatic segmentation of text into min- 
imal content-bearing units is an unsolved 
problem even for languages like English. 
Spaces between words offer an easy first ap- 
proximation, but this approximation is not 
good enough for machine translation (MT), 
where many word sequences are not trans- 
lated word-for-word. This paper presents 
an efficient automatic method for discover- 
ing sequences of words that are translated 
as a unit. The method proceeds by com- 
paring pairs of statistical translation mod- 
els induced from parallel texts in two lan- 
guages. It can discover hundreds of non- 
compositional compounds on each itera- 
tion, and constructs longer compounds out 
of shorter ones. Objective evaluation on a 
simple machine translation task has shown 
the method's potential to improve the qual- 
ity of MT output. The method makes few 
assumptions about the data, so it can be 
applied to parallel data other than parallel 
texts, such as word spellings and pronunci- 
ations.
