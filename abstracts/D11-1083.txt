State of the art Tree Structures Prediction
techniques rely on bottom-up decoding. These
approaches allow the use of context-free fea-
tures and bottom-up features. We discuss
the limitations of mainstream techniques in
solving common Natural Language Process-
ing tasks. Then we devise a new framework
that goes beyond Bottom-up Decoding, and
that allows a better integration of contextual
features. Furthermore we design a system that
addresses these issues and we test it on Hierar-
chical Machine Translation, a well known tree
structure prediction problem. The structure
of the proposed system allows the incorpora-
tion of non-bottom-up features and relies on
a more sophisticated decoding approach. We
show that the proposed approach can find bet-
ter translations using a smaller portion of the
search space.
