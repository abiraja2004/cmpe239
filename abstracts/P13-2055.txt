As most of the world?s languages are
under-resourced, projection algorithms
offer an enticing way to bootstrap the
resources available for one resource-
poor language from a resource-rich lan-
guage by means of parallel text and
word alignment. These algorithms,
however, make the strong assumption
that the language pairs share common
structures and that the parse trees will
resemble one another. This assump-
tion is useful but often leads to errors
in projection. In this paper, we will
address this weakness by using trees
created from instances of Interlinear
Glossed Text (IGT) to discover pat-
terns of divergence between the lan-
guages. We will show that this method
improves the performance of projection
algorithms significantly in some lan-
guages by accounting for divergence be-
tween languages using only the partial
supervision of a few corrected trees.
