We present an exploration of generative prob-
abilistic models for multi-document summa-
rization. Beginning with a simple word fre-
quency based model (Nenkova and Vander-
wende, 2005), we construct a sequence of
models each injecting more structure into the
representation of document set content and ex-
hibiting ROUGE gains along the way. Our
final model, HIERSUM, utilizes a hierarchi-
cal LDA-style model (Blei et al, 2004) to
represent content specificity as a hierarchy of
topic vocabulary distributions. At the task
of producing generic DUC-style summaries,
HIERSUM yields state-of-the-art ROUGE per-
formance and in pairwise user evaluation
strongly outperforms Toutanova et al (2007)?s
state-of-the-art discriminative system. We
also explore HIERSUM?s capacity to produce
multiple ?topical summaries? in order to facil-
itate content discovery and navigation.
