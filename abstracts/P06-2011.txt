 
Named entity translation is indispensable 
in cross language information retrieval 
nowadays. We propose an approach of 
combining lexical information, web sta-
tistics, and inverse search based on 
Google to backward translate a Chinese 
named entity (NE) into English. Our sys-
tem achieves a high Top-1 accuracy of 
87.6%, which is a relatively good per-
formance reported in this area until pre-
sent.
