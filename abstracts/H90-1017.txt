 
We present a 1000-word continuous speech recognition 
(CSR) system that operates in real time on a personal 
computer (PC). The system, designed for large vocabulary 
natural language tasks, makes use of phonetic Hidden 
Markov models (HMM) and incorporates acoustic, phonetic, 
and linguistic sources of knowledge to achieve high 
recognition performance. We describe the various 
components of this system. We also present our strategy 
for achieving real time recognition on the PC. Using a 486- 
based PC with a 29K-based add-on board, the recognizer has 
been timed at 1.1 times real time.
