 
The interpretation of coercion construc- 
tions (to begin a book) has been recently 
considered as resulting from the operation 
of type changing. For instance, a phrase of 
type o (object) is coerced to a phrase of type 
e (event) under the influence of the predi- 
cate. We show that this procedure ncoun- 
ters empirical difficulties. Focussing on the 
begin/commencer ase, we show that the co- 
ercion interpretation results both from gen- 
eral semantic processes and properties of 
the predicate, and we argue that it is best 
represented at the lexical level. The solu- 
tion is formulated in the HPSG formalism, 
where the lexical description of heads in- 
cludes a specification of the argument and 
articulates yntax and semantics. We pro- 
pose that the properties attached to the 
complement remain the same as they are 
oustside the construction, but that the se- 
mantics of the predicate is enriched to in- 
clude an abstract predicate of which the 
complement is an argument.
