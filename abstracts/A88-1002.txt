 
This paper describes a pilot version of a 
commercial application of natural language 
processing techniques to the problem of categorizing 
news stories into broad topic categories. The system 
does not perform a complete semantic or syntactic 
analyses of the input stories. Its categorizations are 
dependent on fragmentary ecognition using pattern- 
matching techniques. The fragments it looks for are 
determined by a set of knowledge-based rules. The 
accuracy of the system is only slightly lower than that 
of human categorizers.
