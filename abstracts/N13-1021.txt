Automatically assessing the fidelity of a
retelling to the original narrative ? a task of
growing clinical importance ? is challenging,
given extensive paraphrasing during retelling
along with cascading automatic speech recog-
nition (ASR) errors. We present a word tag-
ging approach using conditional random fields
(CRFs) that allows a diversity of features
to be considered during inference, including
some capturing acoustic confusions encoded
in word confusion networks. We evaluate the
approach under several scenarios, including
both supervised and unsupervised training, the
latter achieved by training on the output of
a baseline automatic word-alignment model.
We also adapt the ASR models to the domain,
and evaluate the impact of error rate on per-
formance. We find strong robustness to ASR
errors, even using just the 1-best system out-
put. A hybrid approach making use of both au-
tomatic alignment and CRFs trained tagging
models achieves the best performance, yield-
ing strong improvements over using either ap-
proach alone.
