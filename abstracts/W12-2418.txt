Many genetic epidemiological studies of hu-
man diseases have multiple variables related
to any given phenotype, resulting from dif-
ferent definitions and multiple measurements
or subsets of data. Manually mapping and
harmonizing these phenotypes is a time-
consuming process that may still miss the
most appropriate variables. Previously, a su-
pervised learning algorithm was proposed for
this problem. That algorithm learns to de-
termine whether a pair of phenotypes is in
the same class. Though that algorithm ac-
complished satisfying F-scores, the need to
manually label training examples becomes a
bottleneck to improve its coverage. Herein
we present a novel active learning solution
to solve this challenging phenotype-mapping
problem. Active learning will make pheno-
type mapping more efficient and improve its
accuracy.
