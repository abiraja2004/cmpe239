This paper presents a phrase-based statis-
tical machine translation method, based
on non-contiguous phrases, i.e. phrases
with gaps. A method for producing such
phrases from a word-aligned corpora is
proposed. A statistical translation model
is also presented that deals such phrases,
as well as a training method based on the
maximization of translation accuracy, as
measured with the NIST evaluation met-
ric. Translations are produced by means of
a beam-search decoder. Experimental re-
sults are presented, that demonstrate how
the proposed method allows to better gen-
eralize from the training data.
