This paper describes OmnifluentTM Trans-
late ? a state-of-the-art hybrid MT sys-
tem capable of high-quality, high-speed
translations of text and speech. The sys-
tem participated in the English-to-French
and Russian-to-English WMT evaluation
tasks with competitive results. The
features which contributed the most to
high translation quality were training data
sub-sampling methods, document-specific
models, as well as rule-based morpholog-
ical normalization for Russian. The latter
improved the baseline Russian-to-English
BLEU score from 30.1 to 31.3% on a held-
out test set.
