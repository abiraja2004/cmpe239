 
Newly born infants are able to finely 
discriminate almost all human speech 
contrasts and their phonemic category 
boundaries are initially identical, even for 
phonemes outside their target language. A 
connectionist model is described which ac- 
counts for this ability. The approach taken 
has been to develop a model of innately 
guided learning in which an artificial neu- 
ral network (ANN) is stored in a "genome" 
which encodes its architecture and learn- 
ing rules. The space of possible ANNs is 
searched with a genetic algorithm for net- 
works that can learn to discriminate hu- 
man speech sounds. These networks per- 
form equally well having been trained on 
speech spectra from any human language 
so far tested (English, Cantonese, Swahili, 
Farsi, Czech, Hindi, Hungarian, Korean, 
Polish, Russian, Slovak, Spanish, Ukranian 
and Urdu). Training the feature detec- 
tors requires exposure to just one minute 
of speech in any of these languages. Cate- 
gorisation of speech sounds based on the 
network representations showed the hall- 
marks of categorical perception, as found 
in human infants and adults.
