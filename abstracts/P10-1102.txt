Substantial research effort has been in-
vested in recent decades into the com-
putational study and automatic process-
ing of multi-party conversation. While
most aspects of conversational speech
have benefited from a wide availabil-
ity of analytic, computationally tractable
techniques, only qualitative assessments
are available for characterizing multi-party
turn-taking. The current paper attempts to
address this deficiency by first proposing
a framework for computing turn-taking
model perplexity, and then by evaluat-
ing several multi-participant modeling ap-
proaches. Experiments show that direct
multi-participant models do not general-
ize to held out data, and likely never will,
for practical reasons. In contrast, the
Extended-Degree-of-Overlap model rep-
resents a suitable candidate for future
work in this area, and is shown to success-
fully predict the distribution of speech in
time and across participants in previously
unseen conversations.
