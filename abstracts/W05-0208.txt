 
Our goal is to develop tools for facili-
tating the authoring of conversational 
agents for educational applications, and 
in particular to enable non-
computational linguists to accomplish 
this task efficiently.  Such a tool would 
benefit both learning researchers, al-
lowing them to study dialogue in new 
ways, and educational technology re-
searchers, allowing them to quickly 
build dialogue based help systems for 
tutoring systems. We argue in favor of 
a user-centered design methodology.  
We present our work-in-progress de-
sign for authoring, which is motivated 
by our previous tool development ex-
periences and preliminary contextual 
interviews and then refined through 
user testing and iterative design.
