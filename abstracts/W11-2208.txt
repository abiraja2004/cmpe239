In this paper, we give a treatment to the prob-
lem of bilingual part-of-speech induction with
parallel data. We demonstrate that na??ve op-
timization of log-likelihood with joint MRFs
suffers from a severe problem of local max-
ima, and suggest an alternative ? using con-
trastive estimation for estimation of the pa-
rameters. Our experiments show that estimat-
ing the parameters this way, using overlapping
features with joint MRFs performs better than
previous work on the 1984 dataset.
