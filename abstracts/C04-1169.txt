In the development of machine learning sys-
tems for identification of reference chains,
hand-annotated corpora play a crucial role.
This paper concerns the question of how
predicative NPs should be annotated w.r.t.
coreference in corpora for such systems.
This question highlights the tension that
sometimes appears in the development of
corpora between linguistic considerations
and the aim for perfection on the one
hand and practical applications and the aim
for efficiency on the other. Many current
projects that seek to identify coreferential
links automatically, assume an annotation
strategy which instructs the annotator to
mark a predicative NP as coreferential with
its subject if it is part of a positive sentence.
This paper argues that such a representa-
tion is not linguistically plausible, and that
it will fail to generate an optimal result.
