We employ statistical methods to analyze,
generate, and translate rhythmic poetry. We
first apply unsupervised learning to reveal
word-stress patterns in a corpus of raw poetry.
We then use these word-stress patterns, in ad-
dition to rhyme and discourse models, to gen-
erate English love poetry. Finally, we trans-
late Italian poetry into English, choosing tar-
get realizations that conform to desired rhyth-
mic patterns.
