 The purpose of this study is to get a working definition that matches people?s intuitive notion of gossip and is suffi-ciently precise for computational imple-mentation. We conducted two experi-ments investigating what type of conver-sations people intuitively understand and interpret as gossip, and whether they could identify three proposed constitu-ents of gossip conversations: third per-son focus, pejorative evaluation and sub-stantiating behavior. The results show that (1) conversations are very likely to be considered gossip if all elements are present, no intimate relationships exist between the participants, and the person in focus is unambiguous. (2) Conversa-tions that have at most one gossip ele-ment are not considered gossip. (3) Con-versations that lack one or two elements or have an ambiguous element lead to inconsistent judgments.  1
