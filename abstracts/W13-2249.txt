We describe the two systems submit-
ted by the DCU-Symantec team to Task
1.1. of the WMT 2013 Shared Task on
Quality Estimation for Machine Transla-
tion. Task 1.1 involve estimating post-
editing effort for English-Spanish trans-
lation pairs in the news domain. The
two systems use a wide variety of fea-
tures, of which the most effective are the
word-alignment, n-gram frequency, lan-
guage model, POS-tag-based and pseudo-
references ones. Both systems perform at
a similarly high level in the two tasks of
scoring and ranking translations, although
there is some evidence that the systems are
over-fitting to the training data.
