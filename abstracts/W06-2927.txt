 
In this paper, we present a framework for 
multi-lingual dependency parsing. Our 
bottom-up deterministic parser adopts 
Nivre?s algorithm (Nivre, 2004) with a 
preprocessor. Support Vector Machines 
(SVMs) are utilized to determine the word 
dependency attachments. Then, a maxi-
mum entropy method (MaxEnt) is used 
for determining the label of the depend-
ency relation. To improve the perform-
ance of the parser, we construct a tagger 
based on SVMs to find neighboring at-
tachment as a preprocessor. Experimental 
evaluation shows that the proposed exten-
sion improves the parsing accuracy of our 
base parser in 9 languages. (Haji? et al,
