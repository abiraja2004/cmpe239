In lexicalized grammatical formalisms, it is
possible to separate lexical category assign-
ment from the combinatory processes that
make use of such categories, such as pars-
ing and realization. We adapt techniques
from supertagging ? a relatively recent tech-
nique that performs complex lexical tagging
before full parsing (Bangalore and Joshi,
1999; Clark, 2002) ? for chart realization
in OpenCCG, an open-source NLP toolkit for
CCG. We call this approach hypertagging, as
it operates at a level ?above? the syntax, tag-
ging semantic representations with syntactic
lexical categories. Our results demonstrate
that a hypertagger-informed chart realizer can
achieve substantial improvements in realiza-
tion speed (being approximately twice as fast)
with superior realization quality.
