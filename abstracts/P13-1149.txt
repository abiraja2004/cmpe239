Speakers of a language can construct an
unlimited number of new words through
morphological derivation. This is a major
cause of data sparseness for corpus-based
approaches to lexical semantics, such as
distributional semantic models of word
meaning. We adapt compositional meth-
ods originally developed for phrases to the
task of deriving the distributional meaning
of morphologically complex words from
their parts. Semantic representations con-
structed in this way beat a strong baseline
and can be of higher quality than represen-
tations directly constructed from corpus
data. Our results constitute a novel evalua-
tion of the proposed composition methods,
in which the full additive model achieves
the best performance, and demonstrate the
usefulness of a compositional morphology
component in distributional semantics.
