There are a growing number of popular web
sites where users submit and review instruc-
tions for completing tasks as varied as build-
ing a table and baking a pie. In addition to pro-
viding their subjective evaluation, reviewers
often provide actionable refinements. These
refinements clarify, correct, improve, or pro-
vide alternatives to the original instructions.
However, identifying and reading all relevant
reviews is a daunting task for a user. In this
paper, we propose a generative model that
jointly identifies user-proposed refinements in
instruction reviews at multiple granularities,
and aligns them to the appropriate steps in the
original instructions. Labeled data is not read-
ily available for these tasks, so we focus on
the unsupervised setting. In experiments in the
recipe domain, our model provides 90.1% F1
for predicting refinements at the review level,
and 77.0% F1 for predicting refinement seg-
ments within reviews.
