In this paper we describe our system submit-
ted for evaluation in the CLTE-SemEval-2013
task, which achieved the best results in two
of the four data sets, and finished third in av-
erage. This system consists of a SVM clas-
sifier with features extracted from texts (and
their translations SMT) based on a cardinality
function. Such function was the soft cardinal-
ity. Furthermore, this system was simplified
by providing a single model for the 4 pairs
of languages obtaining better (unofficial) re-
sults than separate models for each language
pair. We also evaluated the use of additional
circular-pivoting translations achieving results
6.14% above the best official results.
