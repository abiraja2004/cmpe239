Although most of previous translitera-
tion methods are based on a generative
model, this paper presents a discrimi-
native transliteration model using condi-
tional random fields. We regard charac-
ter(s) as a kind of label, which enables
us to consider a transliteration process as
a sequential labeling process. This ap-
proach has two advantages: (1) fast decod-
ing and (2) easy implementation. Experi-
mental results yielded competitive perfor-
mance, demonstrating the feasibility of the
proposed approach.
