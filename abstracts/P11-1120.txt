We develop a novel approach to the seman-
tic analysis of short text segments and demon-
strate its utility on a large corpus of Web
search queries. Extracting meaning from short
text segments is difficult as there is little
semantic redundancy between terms; hence
methods based on shallow semantic analy-
sis may fail to accurately estimate meaning.
Furthermore search queries lack explicit syn-
tax often used to determine intent in ques-
tion answering. In this paper we propose a
hybrid model of semantic analysis combin-
ing explicit class-label extraction with a la-
tent class PCFG. This class-label correlation
(CLC) model admits a robust parallel approxi-
mation, allowing it to scale to large amounts of
query data. We demonstrate its performance
in terms of (1) its predicted label accuracy on
polysemous queries and (2) its ability to accu-
rately chunk queries into base constituents.
