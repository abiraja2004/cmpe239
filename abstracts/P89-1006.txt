 I.I Sketch  of  P roposa l  
We propose a semantics for locative expressions 
such as near Jones or west of Denver, an impor- 
tant subsystem for NLP applications. Locative ex- 
pressions denote regions of space, and serve as argu- 
ments to predicates, locating objects and events pa- 
tially. Since simple locatives occupy argument posi- 
tions, they do NOT participate in scope ambiguities m 
pace one common view, which sees locatives as logical 
operators. Our proposal justifies common representa- 
tional practice in computational linguistics, account- 
ing for how locative expressions function anaphori- 
tally, and explaining a wide range of inference in- 
volving locatives. We further demonstrate how the 
argument analysis may accommodate multiple loca- 
tive arguments in a single predicate. The analysis is 
implemented for use in a database query application.
