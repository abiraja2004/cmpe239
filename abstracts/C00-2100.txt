 
We present some novel nmchine learning techniques 
for the identilication of subcategorization infornm- 
tion for verbs in Czech. We compare three different 
statistical techniques applied to this problem. We 
show how the learning algorithm can be used to dis- 
cover previously unknown subcategorization frames 
from the Czech Prague 1)ependency Treebank. The 
algorithm can then be used to label dependents of 
a verb in the Czech treebank as either arguments 
or adjuncts. Using our techniques, we are able to 
achieve 88% precision on unseen parsed text.
