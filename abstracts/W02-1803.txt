This paper describes the CTB Coreference An-
notation Guidelines for annotating pronominal
anaphoric expressions in the Penn Chinese Tree-
bank. The goals of the annotation are: to pro-
vide training data for learning-based pronoun
resolution tools, and to provide a \gold" stan-
dard to be used in the evaluation of pronoun
resolution algorithms. The choices that were
made concerning the coindexing of pronominal
anaphors and their antecedents are discussed, as
are some questions that arose in trying to cat-
egorize those pronominal expressions that did
not refer to specic nominal entities in the text.
