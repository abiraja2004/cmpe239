The 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake
caused a wide range of problems, and as
countermeasures, many aid activities were
carried out. Many of these problems and
aid activities were reported via Twitter.
However, most problem reports and corre-
sponding aid messages were not success-
fully exchanged between victims and lo-
cal governments or humanitarian organi-
zations, overwhelmed by the vast amount
of information. As a result, victims could
not receive necessary aid and humanitar-
ian organizations wasted resources on re-
dundant efforts. In this paper, we propose
a method for discovering matches between
problem reports and aid messages. Our
system contributes to problem-solving in
a large scale disaster situation by facilitat-
ing communication between victims and
humanitarian organizations.
