This paper describes DialogueView, a
tool for annotating dialogues with utter-
ance boundaries, speech repairs, speech
act tags, and discourse segments. The
tool provides several views of the data,
including a word view that is time-
aligned with the audio signal, and an ut-
terance view that shows the dialogue as
if it were a script for a play. The ut-
terance view abstracts away from lower
level details that are coded in the word
view. This allows the annotator to have
a simpler view of the dialogue when cod-
ing speech act tags and discourse struc-
ture, but still have access to the details
when needed.
