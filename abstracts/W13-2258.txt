We introduce a lexicalized reordering
model for hierarchical phrase-based ma-
chine translation. The model scores mono-
tone, swap, and discontinuous phrase ori-
entations in the manner of the one pre-
sented by Tillmann (2004). While this
type of lexicalized reordering model is a
valuable and widely-used component of
standard phrase-based statistical machine
translation systems (Koehn et al, 2007), it
is however commonly not employed in hi-
erarchical decoders.
We describe how phrase orientation prob-
abilities can be extracted from word-
aligned training data for use with hierar-
chical phrase inventories, and show how
orientations can be scored in hierarchi-
cal decoding. The model is empirically
evaluated on the NIST Chinese?English
translation task. We achieve a signifi-
cant improvement of +1.2 %BLEU over
a typical hierarchical baseline setup and
an improvement of +0.7 %BLEU over a
syntax-augmented hierarchical setup. On
a French?German translation task, we
obtain a gain of up to +0.4 %BLEU.
