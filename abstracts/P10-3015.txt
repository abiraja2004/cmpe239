In this paper, we propose a novel method
for automatic segmentation of a Sanskrit
string into different words. The input for
our segmentizer is a Sanskrit string either
encoded as a Unicode string or as a Ro-
man transliterated string and the output is
a set of possible splits with weights associ-
ated with each of them. We followed two
different approaches to segment a Sanskrit
text using sandhi1 rules extracted from a
parallel corpus of manually sandhi split
text. While the first approach augments
the finite state transducer used to analyze
Sanskrit morphology and traverse it to seg-
ment a word, the second approach gener-
ates all possible segmentations and vali-
dates each constituent using a morph an-
alyzer.
