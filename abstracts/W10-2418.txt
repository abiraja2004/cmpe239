In this paper, we present a novel ap-
proach for Hindi Named Entity Identifica-
tion (NEI) in a large corpus. The key idea
is to harness the global distributional char-
acteristics of the words in the corpus. We
show that combining the global distribu-
tional characteristics along with the local
context information improves the NEI per-
formance over statistical baseline systems
that employ only local context. The im-
provement is very significant (about 10%)
in scenarios where the test and train cor-
pus belong to different genres. We also
propose a novel measure for NEI based
on term informativeness and show that it
is competitive with the best measure and
better than other well known information
measures.
