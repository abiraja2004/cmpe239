that functions as part of an intelligent tutor that car- 
ries on a natural anguage dialogue with its users. 
The process that searches the lexicon is adaptive as 
is the system filter, to speed up the process. The 
basis of our approach is the interaction between the 
parser and the spelling corrector. Alternative cor- 
rection targets are fed back to the parser, which 
does a series of syntactic and semantic hecks, 
based on the dialogue context, the sentence con- 
text, and the phrase context.
