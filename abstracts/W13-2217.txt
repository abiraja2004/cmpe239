We describe the Stanford University NLP
Group submission to the 2013 Workshop
on Statistical Machine Translation Shared
Task. We demonstrate the effectiveness of a
new adaptive, online tuning algorithm that
scales to large feature and tuning sets. For
both English-French and English-German,
the algorithm produces feature-rich mod-
els that improve over a dense baseline and
compare favorably to models tuned with
established methods.
