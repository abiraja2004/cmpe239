The problem to replace a word with a syn-
onym that fits well in its sentential context
is known as the lexical substitution task. In
this paper, we tackle this task as a supervised
ranking problem. Given a dataset of target
words, their sentential contexts and the poten-
tial substitutions for the target words, the goal
is to train a model that accurately ranks the
candidate substitutions based on their contex-
tual fitness. As a key contribution, we cus-
tomize and evaluate several learning-to-rank
models to the lexical substitution task, includ-
ing classification-based and regression-based
approaches. On two datasets widely used for
lexical substitution, our best models signifi-
cantly advance the state-of-the-art.
