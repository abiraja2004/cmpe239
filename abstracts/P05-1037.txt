This paper describes a summarization
system for technical chats and emails on
the Linux kernel. To reflect the complex-
ity and sophistication of the discussions,
they are clustered according to subtopic
structure on the sub-message level, and
immediate responding pairs are identified
through machine learning methods. A re-
sulting summary consists of one or more
mini-summaries, each on a subtopic from
the discussion.
