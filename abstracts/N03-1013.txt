We describe our approach to the construction
and evaluation of a large-scale database called
?CatVar? which contains categorial variations
of English lexemes. Due to the prevalence of
cross-language categorial variation in multilin-
gual applications, our categorial-variation re-
source may serve as an integral part of a di-
verse range of natural language applications.
Thus, the research reported herein overlaps
heavily with that of the machine-translation,
lexicon-construction, and information-retrieval
communities.
We apply the information-retrieval metrics of
precision and recall to evaluate the accuracy
and coverage of our database with respect
to a human-produced gold standard. This
evaluation reveals that the categorial database
achieves a high degree of precision and recall.
Additionally, we demonstrate that the database
improves on the linkability of Porter stemmer
by over 30%.
