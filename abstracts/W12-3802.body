In this paper, we propose to study the effects
of negation and modality on opinion expres-
sions. Based on linguistic experiments in-
formed by native speakers, we distill these ef-
fects according to the type of modality and
negation. We show that each type has a spe-
cific effect on the opinion expression in its
scope: both on the polarity and the strength for
negation, and on the strength and/or the degree
of certainty for modality. The empirical re-
sults reported in this paper provide a basis for
future opinion analysis systems that have to
compute the sentiment orientation at the sen-
tence or at the clause level. The methodology
we used for deriving this basis was applied
for French but it can be easily instantiated for
other languages like English.
