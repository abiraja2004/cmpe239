This paper describes an annotated gold stan-
dard sample corpus of Early Modern German
containing over 50,000 tokens of text manu-
ally annotated with POS tags, lemmas, and
normalised spelling variants. The corpus is
the first resource of its kind for this variant of
German, and represents an ideal test bed for
evaluating and adapting existing NLP tools on
historical data. We describe the corpus for-
mat, annotation levels, and challenges, provid-
ing an example of the requirements and needs
of smaller humanities-based corpus projects.
