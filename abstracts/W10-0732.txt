We explore a new way to collect human an-
notated relations in text using Amazon Me-
chanical Turk. Given a knowledge base of
relations and a corpus, we identify sentences
which mention both an entity and an attribute
that have some relation in the knowledge base.
Each noisy sentence/relation pair is presented
to multiple turkers, who are asked whether the
sentence expresses the relation. We describe
a design which encourages user efficiency and
aids discovery of cheating. We also present
results on inter-annotator agreement.
