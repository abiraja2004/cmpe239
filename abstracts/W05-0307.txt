We present a framework for the integrated
analysis of the textual and prosodic char-
acteristics of information structure in the
Switchboard corpus of conversational En-
glish. Information structure describes the
availability, organisation and salience of
entities in a discourse model. We present
standards for the annotation of informa-
tion status (old, mediated and new), and
give guidelines for annotating informa-
tion structure, i.e. theme/rheme and back-
ground/kontrast. We show that informa-
tion structure in English can only be anal-
ysed concurrently with prosodic promi-
nence and phrasing. This annotation, us-
ing stand-off XML in NXT, can help es-
tablish standards for the annotation of in-
formation structure in discourse.
