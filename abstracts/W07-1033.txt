This paper investigates improvement of au-
tomatic biomedical named-entity recogni-
tion by applying a reranking method to the
COLING 2004 JNLPBA shared task of bio-
entity recognition. Our system has a com-
mon reranking architecture that consists of a
pipeline of two statistical classifiers which
are based on log-linear models. The ar-
chitecture enables the reranker to take ad-
vantage of features which are globally de-
pendent on the label sequences, and fea-
tures from the labels of other sentences than
the target sentence. The experimental re-
sults show that our system achieves the la-
beling accuracies that are comparable to the
best performance reported for the same task,
thanks to the 1.55 points of F-score improve-
ment by the reranker.
