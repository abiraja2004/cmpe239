Active Learning (AL) is typically initialized
with a small seed of examples selected ran-
domly. However, when the distribution of
classes in the data is skewed, some classes
may be missed, resulting in a slow learning
progress. Our contribution is twofold: (1) we
show that an unsupervised language modeling
based technique is effective in selecting rare
class examples, and (2) we use this technique
for seeding AL and demonstrate that it leads
to a higher learning rate. The evaluation is
conducted in the context of word sense disam-
biguation.
