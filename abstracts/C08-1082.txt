Distributional measures of lexical similar-
ity and kernel methods for classification
are well-known tools in Natural Language
Processing. We bring these two meth-
ods together by introducing distributional
kernels that compare co-occurrence prob-
ability distributions. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of these kernels by present-
ing state-of-the-art results on datasets for
three semantic classification: compound
noun interpretation, identification of se-
mantic relations between nominals and se-
mantic classification of verbs. Finally, we
consider explanations for the impressive
performance of distributional kernels and
sketch some promising generalisations.
