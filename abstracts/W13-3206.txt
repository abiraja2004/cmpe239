In recent years, there has been widespread
interest in compositional distributional
semantic models (cDSMs), that derive
meaning representations for phrases from
their parts. We present an evaluation of al-
ternative cDSMs under truly comparable
conditions. In particular, we extend the
idea of Baroni and Zamparelli (2010) and
Guevara (2010) to use corpus-extracted
examples of the target phrases for param-
eter estimation to the other models pro-
posed in the literature, so that all models
can be tested under the same training con-
ditions. The linguistically motivated func-
tional model of Baroni and Zamparelli
(2010) and Coecke et al (2010) emerges
as the winner in all our tests.
