 
This paper describes an original hybrid system 
that extracts multiword unit candidates from 
part-of-speech tagged corpora. While classical 
hybrid systems manually define local part-of-
speech patterns that lead to the identification 
of well-known multiword units (mainly com-
pound nouns), our solution automatically 
identifies relevant syntactical patterns from 
the corpus. Word statistics are then combined 
with the endogenously acquired linguistic in-
formation in order to extract the most relevant 
sequences of words. As a result, (1) human in-
tervention is avoided providing total flexibil-
ity of use of the system and (2) different 
multiword units like phrasal verbs, adverbial 
locutions and prepositional locutions may be 
identified. The system has been tested on the 
Brown Corpus leading to encouraging results.
