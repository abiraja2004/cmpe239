This paper presents a new unsupervised algo-
rithm (WordEnds) for inferring word bound-
aries from transcribed adult conversations.
Phone ngrams before and after observed
pauses are used to bootstrap a simple dis-
criminative model of boundary marking. This
fast algorithm delivers high performance even
on morphologically complex words in English
and Arabic, and promising results on accurate
phonetic transcriptions with extensive pronun-
ciation variation. Expanding training data be-
yond the traditional miniature datasets pushes
performance numbers well above those previ-
ously reported. This suggests that WordEnds
is a viable model of child language acquisition
and might be useful in speech understanding.
