 
Since the Tunisian revolution, Tunisian Dialect (TD) 
used in daily life, has became progressively used and 
represented in interviews, news and debate programs 
instead of Modern Standard Arabic (MSA). This situ-
ation has important negative consequences for natural 
language processing (NLP): since the spoken dialects 
are not officially written and do not have standard 
orthography, it is very costly to obtain adequate cor-
pora to use for training NLP tools. Furthermore, there 
are almost no parallel corpora involving TD and 
MSA. In this paper, we describe the creation of Tuni-
sian dialect text corpus as well as a method for build-
ing a bilingual dictionary, in order to create language 
model for speech recognition system for the Tunisian 
Broadcast News. So, we use explicit knowledge about 
the relation between TD and MSA.
