Common tasks involving orthographic
words include spellchecking, stemming,
morphological analysis, and morpho-
logical synthesis. To enable signifi-
cant reuse of the language-specific re-
sources across all such tasks, we have
extended the functionality of the open
source spellchecker MySpell, yield-
ing a generic word analysis library, the
runtime layer of the hunmorph toolkit.
We added an offline resource manage-
ment component, hunlex, which com-
plements the efficiency of our runtime
layer with a high-level description lan-
guage and a configurable precompiler.
