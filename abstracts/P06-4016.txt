TwicPen is a terminology-assistance sys-
tem for readers of printed (ie. off-line)
material in foreign languages. It consists
of a hand-held scanner and sophisticated
parsing and translation software to provide
readers a limited number of translations
selected on the basis of a linguistic analy-
sis of the whole scanned text fragment (a
phrase, part of the sentence, etc.). The use
of a morphological and syntactic parser
makes it possible (i) to disambiguate to
a large extent the word selected by the
user (and hence to drastically reduce the
noise in the response), and (ii) to handle
expressions (compounds, collocations, id-
ioms), often a major source of difficulty
for non-native readers. The system exists
for the following language-pairs: English-
French, French-English, German-French
and Italian-French.
