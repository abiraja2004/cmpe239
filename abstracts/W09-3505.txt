We submitted results for each of the eight
shared tasks. Except for Japanese name
kanji restoration, which uses a noisy channel
model, our Standard Run submissions were
produced by generative long-range pair n-
gram models, which we mostly augmented
with publicly available data (either from
LDC datasets or mined from Wikipedia) for
the Non-Standard Runs.
