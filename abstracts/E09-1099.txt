As the arm of NLP technologies extends
beyond a small core of languages, tech-
niques for working with instances of lan-
guage data across hundreds to thousands
of languages may require revisiting and re-
calibrating the tried and true methods that
are used. Of the NLP techniques that has
been treated as ?solved? is language iden-
tification (language ID) of written text.
However, we argue that language ID is
far from solved when one considers in-
put spanning not dozens of languages, but
rather hundreds to thousands, a number
that one approaches when harvesting lan-
guage data found on the Web. We formu-
late language ID as a coreference resolu-
tion problem and apply it to a Web harvest-
ing task for a specific linguistic data type
and achieve a much higher accuracy than
long accepted language ID approaches.
