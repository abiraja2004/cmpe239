 
The correct interpretation of biomedical texts 
by text mining systems requires the recogni-
tion of a range of types of high-level informa-
tion (or meta-knowledge) about the text. Ex-
amples include expressions of negation and 
speculation, as well as pragmatic/rhetorical in-
tent (e.g. whether the information expressed 
represents a hypothesis, generally accepted 
knowledge, new experimental knowledge, 
etc.) Although such types of information have 
previously been annotated at the text-span 
level (most commonly sentences), annotation 
at the level of the event is currently quite 
sparse. In this paper, we focus on the evalua-
tion of the multi-dimensional annotation 
scheme that we have developed specifically 
for enriching bio-events with meta-knowledge 
information. Our annotation scheme is in-
tended to be general enough to allow integra-
tion with different types of bio-event annota-
tion, whilst being detailed enough to capture 
important subtleties in the nature of the meta-
knowledge expressed in the text. To our 
knowledge, our scheme is unique within the 
field with regards to the diversity of meta-
knowledge aspects annotated for each event, 
whilst the evaluation results have confirmed 
its feasibility and soundness.
