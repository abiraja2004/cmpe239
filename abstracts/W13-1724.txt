This paper reports on our work in the NLI 
shared task 2013 on Native Language Identi-
fication. The task is to automatically detect 
the native language of the TOEFL essays au-
thors in a set of given test documents in Eng-
lish. The task was solved by a system that 
used the PPM compression algorithm based 
on an n-gram statistical model. We submitted 
four runs; word-based PPMC algorithm with 
normalization and without, character-based 
PPMC algorithm with normalization and 
without. The worst result was obtained on 
training and testing data during the evaluation 
procedure using the character-based PPM 
method and normalization: accuracy = 31.9%; 
the best one was macroaverage F-measure =
0.708 with the word-based PPMC algorithm 
without normalization.
