We present Pro3Gres, a deep-syntactic, fast
dependency parser that combines a hand-
written competence grammar with proba-
bilistic performance disambiguation and that
has been used in the biomedical domain. We
discuss its performance in the domain adap-
tation open submission. We achieve aver-
age results, which is partly due to difficulties
in mapping to the dependency representation
used for the shared task.
