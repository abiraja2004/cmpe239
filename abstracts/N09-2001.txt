Cohesive constraints allow the phrase-based decoder
to employ arbitrary, non-syntactic phrases, and en-
courage it to translate those phrases in an order that
respects the source dependency tree structure. We
present extensions of the cohesive constraints, such
as exhaustive interruption count and rich interrup-
tion check. We show that the cohesion-enhanced de-
coder significantly outperforms the standard phrase-
based decoder on English?Spanish. Improvements
between 0.5 and 1.2 BLEU point are obtained on
English?Iraqi system.
