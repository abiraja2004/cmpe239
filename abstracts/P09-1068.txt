We describe an unsupervised system for learn-
ing narrative schemas, coherent sequences or sets
of events (arrested(POLICE,SUSPECT), convicted(
JUDGE, SUSPECT)) whose arguments are filled
with participant semantic roles defined over words
(JUDGE = {judge, jury, court}, POLICE = {police,
agent, authorities}). Unlike most previous work in
event structure or semantic role learning, our sys-
tem does not use supervised techniques, hand-built
knowledge, or predefined classes of events or roles.
Our unsupervised learning algorithm uses corefer-
ring arguments in chains of verbs to learn both rich
narrative event structure and argument roles. By
jointly addressing both tasks, we improve on pre-
vious results in narrative/frame learning and induce
rich frame-specific semantic roles.
