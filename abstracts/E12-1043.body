Kernel based methods dominate the current
trend for various relation extraction tasks
including protein-protein interaction (PPI)
extraction. PPI information is critical in un-
derstanding biological processes. Despite
considerable efforts, previously reported
PPI extraction results show that none of the
approaches already known in the literature
is consistently better than other approaches
when evaluated on different benchmark PPI
corpora. In this paper, we propose a
novel hybrid kernel that combines (auto-
matically collected) dependency patterns,
trigger words, negative cues, walk fea-
tures and regular expression patterns along
with tree kernel and shallow linguistic ker-
nel. The proposed kernel outperforms the
exiting state-of-the-art approaches on the
BioInfer corpus, the largest PPI benchmark
corpus available. On the other four smaller
benchmark corpora, it performs either bet-
ter or almost as good as the existing ap-
proaches. Moreover, empirical results show
that the proposed hybrid kernel attains con-
siderably higher precision than the existing
approaches, which indicates its capability
of learning more accurate models. This also
demonstrates that the different types of in-
formation that we use are able to comple-
ment each other for relation extraction.
