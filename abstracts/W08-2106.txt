Detecting the semantic coherence of a doc-
ument is a challenging task and has sev-
eral applications such as in text segmenta-
tion and categorization. This paper is an
attempt to distinguish between a ?semanti-
cally coherent? true document and a ?ran-
domly generated? false document through
topic detection in the framework of latent
Dirichlet analysis. Based on the premise
that a true document contains only a few
topics and a false document is made up of
many topics, it is asserted that the entropy
of the topic distribution will be lower for
a true document than that for a false docu-
ment. This hypothesis is tested on several
false document sets generated by various
methods and is found to be useful for fake
content detection applications.
