 
Many events in news articles don?t include 
time arguments. This paper describes two 
methods, one based on rules and the other 
based on statistical learning, to predict the un-
known time argument for an event by the 
propagation from its related events. The re-
sults are promising ? the rule based approach 
was able to correctly predict 74% of the un-
known event time arguments with 70% preci-
sion.
