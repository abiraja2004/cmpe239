 
This article is concerned with determining 
the constraints on the selection of appropriate 
intonation in speech generation in human- 
machine information seeking dialogues. The 
two pillars of our system--a state-of-the- 
art computational dialogue model and a 
state-of-the-art NL generator--are presented. 
Based on this, we determine the kinds of 
linguistic and pragmatic knowledge needed 
to sufficiently constrain choice in the intona- 
tional resources of the system. We take into 
consideration factors uch as dialogue history, 
speaker's attitudes, heater's expectations, 
and semantic speech functions. 
1 Introduct ion 
Task independent computational dialogue modelling 
(see e.g., \[5, l0 t 35\]) seldom makes contact with natural 
language generation (exceptions being, e.g., \[7, 9, 22\]), 
and much less so with speech generation/synthesis. 
Conversely, speech synthesis, being predominantly con- 
cerned with rendering text to speech, rarely considers 
actual full scale generation. 
In this article we introduce an approach under de- 
velopment in a joint collaborative project between 
the Technical Universities of Darmstadt and Budapest 
('SPEAK!') that combines the dialogue modelling 
paradigm with NL generation and speech synthesis 
in an information retrieval system. The novelty of 
the approach pursued lies in the move away from 
text-to-speech and concept-to-speech generation towards 
communicative-context-to-speech g neration (see Sec- 
tion 2) and the integration of dialogue representation, 
NL generation, and speech synthesis. Our principal 
concern is selection of appropriate intonation. More 
specifically, from our representation f communicative

context, we derive constraints on interpersonal mean- 
ing, which are then expressed through intonation con- 
tour (or tone contour or simply tone). 
We have taken two existing systems, the COR dialogue 
model (\[31\]) and the K'OMET-PENMAN multilingual text 
generator \[33\] to build the backbone of an integrated 
dialogue-based interface to an information system. The 
linguistic generation resources of German have been en- 
hanced by a systemic functionally \[14, 15, 24\] motivated 
grammar of speech that includes knowledge about in- 
tonational patterns \[12, 34\]. Section 3 presents our 
dialogue model and the intonational resources. 
In Section 4 we first apply an bottom-up approach; we 
will determine the kinds of knowledge the generator 
needs to make intonational choices, and based on this 
we develop a stratified model with three strata: gram- 
mar, semantics, and extra-linguistic context. Second 
we apply a top-down approach; we determine how this 
knowledge can be obtained from tile dialogue model 
and dialogue history, i.e., from the extra-linguistic con- 
text, and thereby verify the applicability of our over- 
all model. Section 5 concludes the paper with a sum- 
mary and a number of questions that have been left 
untouched. 
2 State of the art in speech generat ion 
In this section we give a survey of existing speech gen- 
eration systems for German, arguing that their syntax- 
based approach does not suffice to generate "natural" 
speech in dialogue systems. 
In information-seeking dialogues that use spoken lan- 
guage for interaction, intonation is often the only 
means to distinguish between different dialogue acts, 
thus making the selection of the appropriate intonation 
crucial to the success of the information-seeking pro- 
cess (see e.g., \[26\] for English). To illustrate this point, 
imagine an information-seeking dialogue where the user 
wants to know a specific train connection. At some 
point in the interaction, the system produces a sen- 
tence like Sie fahren um drei Uhr von Darmstadt nach 
Heidelberg ("You travel at three o'clock from Darm- 
stadt to Heidelbei'g."). There are several interpreta- 
tions of this utterance, the most obvious being that 
the system presents ome kind of information to the 
reader. However, the same sentence--employing a dif- 
ferent intonation--could be part of a clarification dia- 
logue, where the system wants to reassure that it got 
the user's request right. In this case, the user would 
be expected to react, i.e., either confirm or rebuke this 
statement. Only by means of intonation can the user 
interpret he system's expectation correctly and react 
accordingly. 
Even though current speech synthesizers can support 
sophisticated variation of intonation, no existing text- 
to-speech or concept-to-speech system for German is 
available that provides the semantic or pragmatic guid- 
ance necessary for selecting intonations appropriately. 
The major shortcoming is that traditional text-to- 
speech systems (e.g., \[16, 18, 23\]) and concept-to- 
speech systems \[6\] alike use purely syntactic informa- 
tion in order to control prosodic features. Moreover, 
with text-to-speech systems, where the syntactic struc- 
ture has to be reconstructed from the written text by 
means of a syntactic analysis, the resulting data is sel- 
dom complete nor unambiguous. Concept-to-speech 
systems avoid the latter problem by generating spoken 
output from a pre-linguistic onceptual structure. Yet, 
most of the current implementations of the concept- 
to-speech approach use the conceptual representation 
only to avoid syntactic ambiguities with the assignment 
of intonational features till based on the written text 
(see \[6\]). 
A common feature of all these systems is that they 
are often too expressive in that too many words are 
stressed, mainly due to the lack of discourse informa- 
tion, for instance on focus domain or the given/new 
distinction. A number of discourse-model based speech 
generation systems have been proposed that address 
exactly this problem, for example NewSpeak \[17, 26\]. 
However, the problem with these systems is that they 
still start from a given text, and are hence restricted 
to those kinds of discourse information that can be re- 
constructed from that text. Moreover, since they as- 
sume a one-to-one mapping between syntactic struc- 
ture and intonational features, they cannot account for 
those phenomena frequent o our domain, where the 
same syntactic structure can be realized with differing 
intonations (see example above). 
Assuming that intonation is more than the mere reflec- 
tion of the surface linguistic form (see \[14, 30, 19, 24\]), 
and further, that intonation is selected to express par- 
ticular communicative goals and intentions, an effective 
control of intonation requires ynthesizing from mean- 
ings rather than word sequences as the discussed sys- 
tems do. 
This fact is acknowledged by \[1\], whose SYNPHONICS 
system ~ is based on the assumption that prosodic fea- 
tThe SYNPHONICS system (\[I\]) covers the incremen- 
172 
tures have a function independent of syntax. \[1\] re- 
place the idea of syntax-dependent prosody--which is
implicit to all the approaches discussed so far--with 
the notion of the linguistic function of prosodic fea- 
tures including intonation. Thus, this approach allows 
prosodic features to be controlled by various factors 
other than syntax, e.g., by the information structure 
such as focus-background or topic-comment s ructure. 
However, the function of intonation is still restricted 
to what is called grammatical function, more specif- 
ically the textual function of intonation, without con- 
sidering aspects like communicative goals and speaker's 
attitude, i.e., the interpersonal function of intonation 
(\[14\]). 2 Yet, in the context of generating speech in 
information-seeking dialogues where intonational fea- 
tures are often the only means to signal a dialogue act, 
these aspects have to be taken into account. 
Furthermore, in a dialogue situation as given in our ap- 
proach, it is not sufficient o look at isolated sentences; 
instead one has to look at the utterance in its context, 
as part of a larger interaction. Intonation is not only 
used to mark sentence-internal information structures, 
but additionally it can be employed in the management 
of the communicative demands of interaction partners. 
Therefore, we also have to consider the function of in- 
tonation with respect o the whole conversational in- 
teraction, taking into account he discourse (dialogue) 
history (see also \[7\]). Intonation as realization of in- 
teractional features thus draws on discourse and user 
model as the source of constraints. 
An approach to speech generation that starts from 
communication context and maps this to intonational 
features is the only approach that provides the intona- 
tional control needed in dialogue systems to produce 
speech that human hearers would find acceptable. 
3 Ava i lab le  resources  
The overall system architecture for SPEAK! is shown 
in Figure 1. The text generation system (KOMET- 
PENMAN) receives input from a dialogue module (colt, 
dialogue history) and perhaps several other informa- 
tion sources (e.g., confidence measure from a speech 
recognition unit), which will be made more precise be- 
low (see Section 4). Together the information from 
these input sources controls the traversal of the gram- 
mar (see Section 3.2). The KOMET-PENMAN grammar 
can generate two types of output: A plain text, which 
can be embedded into, for instance, a dialogue box in 
a graphical user interface and a text that is marked 
up with intonational features (see Section 3.2 for an 
example), which is passed on to the MULTIVOX text- 
to-speech system \[23\] and presented acoustically to the 
user. 
In this article we develop a model of how the dialogue 
module can control the traversal of those regions of the 
tal generation of utterances from pre-linguistic conceptual 
structures to the formation of syntactic and phonological 
structures, with an interface to a speech synthesis module 
for German.

grammar concerned with intonation. As a basis for 
discussion, we introduce our dialogue model and the 
relevant parts of the grammar in detail. 
3.1 The  d ia logue mode l  
A dialogue model guides the interaction between a user 
and an information retrieval system, i.e., it calculates 
a subset of possible dialogue acts that the user action 
(spoken or deictic) could correspond to, and on the 
system side it calculates those dialogue acts that would 
provide appropriate responses to a given user action. In 
the work presented here, we assume that a component 
exists that can choose one of the dialogue acts from 
these subsets (see e.g., \[13, 28\].) 
In the 'SPEAK!' project we have chosen to employ 
a modified version of the Conversational Roles model 
(COR) as our dialogue model (see \[31\]). COR is a task 
independent model based on Searle's peech act theory 
\[29\]. It has been modified within the 'SPEAK!' frame- 
work in order to include naturally occuring data that 
the original model failed to account for, but the overall 
speech act framework remains the same. 
In the model, a dialogue is represented as a sequence 
of dialogue moves (e.g., Request, Inform, Withdraw re- 
quest), which are further decomposed into sequences of 
atomic acts, dialogue moves, and sub-dialogues. This 
recursive representation of a dialogue enables COR to 
account for mixed initiative dialogues, where both in- 
formation seeker and informa\[ion knower can employ, 
for instance, retraction, correction, and clarification 
tactics. 
Below we present a simplified rewrite rule version of the 
dialogue model. In this version we only present he re- 
quest, inform, and assert moves in detail, since the other 
moves are cast in the same format as the request, and 
one only has to insert new move names (e.g., Promise 
---+ promise(K), (Dialogue(S)), etc.). Moves in paren- 
theses are optional. The parameters indicate which 
participant can perform a given move, S=information 
seeker, K=information knower. Moves begin with up- 
per case and acts with lower case. The first two rules 
encode the course that the dialogue is expected to take, 
while the other dialogue rules encode exceptions. (For 
a more detailed account see \[31\]). 
Dialogue(S) --> (Request (S)) , (Promise(K)) , 
Inform(K), (Evaluate (S)), (Dialogue (_)) 
Dialogue(S) --> (Offer(K)), (Accept(S)),

WithdrawAccept (S), (Dialogue (_)) 
Dialogue(S) --> Request (S), (Promise(K)), 
WithdrawRequest (S), (Dialogue (_)) 
Dialogue(S) --> Request (S) , Promise(K), 
WithdrawPromise (K), (Dialogue (_)) 
Dialogue(S) --> 0fret(K), WithdrawOffer(K), 
(Dialogue (_)) 
Dialogue(S) --> 0ffer(K), Reject0ffer(S),

Dialogue(S) --> Request(S), Withdrawftequest(S) , 
(Dialogue (_)) 
Dialogue(S) --> Request (S) , RejectRequest (K) ,

Dialogue(S) --> Withdraw(_) 
Request (S) --> request (S), (Dialogue(K)) 
Request(S) --> request(S), (Assert(S)) 
Request(S) --> Dialogue(K) 
Request (S) --> Assert (S) , (request (S)) 
Request(S) --> Assert(S) , (Dialogue(S)) 
Inform(K) --> inform(K), (Dialogue(S)) 
Assert (_) --> assert (_) , (Dialogue (_)) 
Based on the dialogue model, the system builds up a 
tree-like dialogue history of the ongoing dialogue (see 
Section 4). Two central themes in our current work 
are to identify the relevant partial structures of such 
trees and to determine their semantics uch that, for 
instance, the text generation system can search the 
dialogue history and interpret what it finds in order 
to guide the choice of intonation for the system utter- 
ances. 
3.2 The  in tonat iona l  resources  of  the 
KOMET grammar  
In this section, we describe the syste m networks that 
have been introduced to the German grammar of the 
KOMET-PENMAN text generation component as to in- 
clude specifications of appropriate intonation selections 
in its output (\[12\]). The KOMET grammar of Ger- 
man (\[32, 11\]) is a computational NIGEL-style systemic- 
functional grammar, based on the notion of choice. The 
systemic-functional framework provides us with repre- 
sentational means for describing available choices and 
for mapping (even though indirectly) communicative 
goals to intonational features. 
According to systemic-functional linguistics (SFL) (see 
\[15, 21, 7\]), intonation is just one means among 
others--such as syntax and lexis--to realize choices in 
the grammar. 3 This implies that choices underlying 
the realization of intonation may be organized in ex- 
actly the same way as other choices in the grammar 
(see \[14, 7\]. Hence, the intonational control required 
for speech generation in a dialogue system has been 
built into the existing KOMET grammar. The added 
discriminations are constraints on the specification of 
an appropriate intonation rather than constraints on 
the structural form. 
T reatment  of  in tonat ion in SFL The three dis- 
tinct kinds of phonological categories, i.e., tone group, 
tonic syllable and tone, contribute to the intonation 
a\[2, 30, 4, 8\] consider intonation part of phonology. 
specification of a clause (see for instance \[4, 30, 24\]). 
They signal three different kinds of relation between 
grammar and intonation (and thus, indirectly, con- 
*ext), and hence realize different meanings? A choice 
from the available alternatives has to be made for each 
of the phonological categories in order to realize sen- 
tence intonation. The three sets of choices according 
to \[14\] are: 
would generate a neutral statement choosing tone la  
to accompany the presentation, as in / / la  die ergeb- 
nisse sind unten dargestellt//z ("The results are given 
below"). If, however, the results had so far been pre- 
sented at a different position on the screen, the sys- 
tem would generate tone lb  in order to place special 
emphasis on the statement: / / lb  die ergebmsse sina 
UNTEN dargestellt//. 
? Tonal i ty:  The distribution into tone groups, i.e., 
the number of tone groups allocated by the speaker 
to a given stretch of language. 
? Tonic i ty:  The placing of the tonic syllable, i.e., 
its position within the tone group. 
? Tone:  The choice of a tone for each tone group; 
the tone is associated with the tonic. 
Choices in the systems of tonality and tonic i ty lead 
to an information constituent structure independent of
the grammatical constituency, whereas choices in tone 
result in the assignment of a tone contour for each iden- 
tified tone group in an utterance. From these systems, 
only the choices in the tone systems realize an interper- 
sonal function 4, that of indicating a speech function or 
the speaker's attitude (e.g., \[14\])? This interpersonal 
function is our present concern. Next, we want to in- 
vestigate the tone more closely before turning to the 
actual system networks in the KOMET grammar? 
Following \[24\], we assume five tones, s the primary 
tones, plus a number of so-called secondary tones that 
are necessary for the description of German intonation 
contours. These tones are: ~all (tonel), rise (tone2), 
progredient (tone3),/all-rise (tone4), rise-/all (toneS), 
where the first four can be further differentiated into 
secondary a and b tones. 8 The primary tones are the 
undifferentiated variants, whereas the secondary tones 
are interpreted as realizing additional meaning. They 
are intepreted as follows: 
la = neutral 
lb = emphatic 
2a = neutral 
2b = negative 
3a = weak contrast 
3b = strong contrast 
4a = neutral 
4b = negative 
5 = assertive/clarifying 
Consider the following example taken from one of the 
information seeking dialogues: The computer has re- 
trieved an answer to a query, and this answer is pre- 
sented graphically to the user. As a default, the system 
4Tone moreover realizes the logical metafunction, how- 
ever, we will ignore this fact for the present argument. 
~Other approaches tointonation suggest adifferent num- 
ber of tones, ranging from four to six. \[8\] even goes one step 
further in arguing that it is not sufficient o describe tones 
by a combination of fall and rise, instead, much finer dis- 
tinctions have to be made (see \[8\]). 
8The criteria for the distinction of primary tones is the 
type of the tone movement, for instance rising or falling tone 
contour, whereas the degree of the movement, i.e., whether 
it is strong or weak in expression, is considered to be a 
variation within a given tone contour?

F igure 2: KEY systems in declarative clauses (simpli- 
fied) 
Intonational choices in the KOMET grammar  
Modelling intonation in the KOMET grammar involves 
the introduction of more delicate systems in those ar- 
eas on the lexicogrammatical level, where intonational 
distinctions exist, thus specifying the relation between 
intonation features and competing linguistic resources 
(like lexis and syntax). Here, we will restrict ourselves 
to the description of the system networks reflecting the 
choices in tone. The networks are primarily based on 
the descriptive work by \[24\]. 
The interpersonal part of the grammar provides the 
speaker with resources for interacting with the listener, 
for exchanging information, goods and services, etc. 
(see \[15, 20\]). On the lexicogrammatical stratum, the 
MOOD systems are the central resource for expressing 
these speech functions. More delicate speech functional 
distinctions--specific to spoken German--are realized 
by means of tone. The (primary) tone selection in a 
tone group serves to realize a number of speech func- 
tional distinctions? For instance, depending on the tone 
contour selected, the system output l is le wollen um 
f~nfzehn uhr fahren//("You want to leave at 3 pm.") 
can be either interpreted as a question (tone 2a) or a 
statement (tone la). 
More important is the conditioning of the (secondary) 
tone by attitudinal options such as the speaker's atti- 
Tin this paper, the following notational conventions hold: 
/ /marks tone group boundaries, CAPITAL LETTERS are 
used to mark the tonic element of a tone group. Numbers 
following the / /  at the beginning of a tone group indicate 
the type of tone contour.

reservation ...), what answer is being expected, empha-

If one defines KEY as the part of speech functional dis- 
tinctions expressed' by means of tone rather than mood 
alone, one can integrate the MOOD and KEY systems 
into the grammar by positioning KEY systems as de- 
pendent on the various MOOO systems,

F igure  3: KEY systems, interrog, clauses (simplified) 
Figures 2 and 3 give the system networks of the KOMET 
grammar for the declarative and interrogative sentence 
mood. The networks now include more delicate gram- 
matical distinctions in order to realize the variations 
that have intonational consequences. The networks 
are restricted in that they omit some of the incongru- 
ent mood codings. The added discriminations to the 
KOMET grammar impose constraints on the specifica- 
tion of an appropriate intonation contour. 
3.3 In tegrat ing  COl t  and  KOMET-PENMAN 
As illustrated in Section 3.2 the relation between dia- 
logue moves and tone is many-to-many, hence the ap- 
propriate tone selection must be further constrained. 
The dialogue model provides general information about 
the structure of an information retrieval dialogue, 
hence we consider it a representation of genre. The 
KOMET grammar provides linguistic resources includ- 
ing intonational options. In the following section, we 
determine the kinds of information that are needed in 
addition to what these resources provide and suggest 
a method of integrating the additional resources in the 
overall system, 
4 Const ra in ts  on  cho ice  in in tonat ion  
In information-seeking, human-machine dialogue it is 
crucial to signal to the user as unambiguously as pos- 
sible at which stage in the dialogue she is and what ac- 
tion (verbal or non-verbal) she is supposed to take (see 
s\[14\], \[7\] and \[21\] have described this for English, \[24\] 
adapted Halliday's approach for German. 
175 
Section 2). When spoken mode is envisaged as output, 
the intonation contour is the major means to convey 
this information. The relation between dialogue moves 
and tone types is however not trivial. For instance, a 
dialogue move REQUEST--depending on the context in 
which it occurs--may be realized intonationally by us- 
ing tone 1, tone 2 or tone 4. Hence, the selection of an 
appropriate tone is conditioned by factors other than 
just individual coR dialogue moves. When we think 
about the problem from the perspective of intonation, 
the picture becomes clearer. It is generally acknowl- 
edged in descriptive linguistics that the kind of tone 
attributed to an information unit encodes a basic se- 
mantic speech act or speech function \[27, 25\], such as 
command, question, statement and offer, even though 
this relation is not one-to-one. Also, it is uncontro- 
versial to maintain that intonation potentially reflects 
a speaker's attitude towards the message she verbalizes 
(see e.g., \[24\]). When looking at dialogue--rather than 
monologue--other factors coming into play are the his- 
tory off the dialogue taking place and the expectations 
on the part off the hearer that are evoked at particular 
stages in the course of the dialogue. 
In this section, we will discuss how these factors re- 
late to the selection of tone. Our goal is to deter- 
mine more precisely what is comprised by them and 
to arrive at a refinement of the general architecture we 
have presented in Section 3. More concretely, it will 
be shown that the factors just pointed out are logi- 
cally independent parameters that in different combi- 
nations constrain the selection of a particular tone. We 
will then propose an organization of these different pa- 
rameters in terms of stratification that allows for the 
necessary flexibility and brigdes the gap between the 
dialogue model and the generator. Discussing a sam- 
ple dialogue (Section 4.2), we will then apply the model 
developed. 
We start from the stratum of grammar and move to the 
other linguistic and pragmatic resources relevant o the 
present problem. As the starting point for discussion 
we take the grammatical systems of MOOD and KEY, for 
they grammatically encode semantic speech function 
and speaker's attitudes and lead directly to selections 
in tone. 
4.1 The  mean ings  of  tone  
One of the primary grammatical choices relevant for the 
selection of tone is the choice of mood, such as declar- 
ative, interrogative and imperative. 9 The relation be- 
tween mood and tone is potentially many-to-many with 
one exception:imperative s always realized by tone 1. 
However, the choice of mood is crucial since it leads to 
a whole variety of options that are eventually realized 
in different ones (these are the KEY systems). 
How is choice in the basic mood options constrained? 
9We assume here that the information unit is the clause 
and that tonality is unmarked, i.e., that there is one tone- 
group only. We are aware, however, that generally there 
is no one-to-one correspondence b tween information unit 
and clause. 
Mood is in the first instance tim grammatical real- 
ization of semantic speech function. Speech functions 
comprise command, offer, statement and question. Sys- 
temically, they are derived from the SPEECH FUNC- 
TION network (see e.g., \[20\] and Figure 4). Again, 
the relation between speech function and mood is po- 
tentially many-to-many:All of imperative, declaraLive 
and interrogative may for instance ncode a command. 
For example Schliefl das Fenster! (Close the window!), 
W~rdest Du das Fenster schlieflen, bitte? ( Would you 
close the window, please?), Du sollst das Fenster nicht 
bffnen! (You're not supposed to open the window O. 
How can the mapping between speech function and 
mood be constrained then? A major constraint on 
the mapping between speech function and mood is 
the kind of discourse or genre, and the type of dis- 
course stage the message is produced in. For instance, 
the genre of information-seeking, human-machine dia- 
logues is characterized by certain genre-specific stages 
or dialogue moves (see Section 3.1). A typical move in 
this genre is the REQUEST move. In terms of speech 
function, a REQUEST is typically a question, i.e., \[de- 
manding:information\], m The REQUEST-question corre- 
lation in the kind of dialogue we are dealing with here 
constrains the choice of mood to interrogative or declar- 
ative, e.g., (1) Wohin mSchten Sie fahren? (Where do 
you want to go?) (interrogative)-- (2) Sie wollen um 
drei Uhr fahren? (You want to go at three o'clock?) 
(declarative). So, in information-seeking dialogues, the 
type of move largely constrains the selection of speech 
function, but it only partially constrains the mapping 
of speech time,ion and mood. 
Deciding between declarative and interrogative as real- 
ization of a move REQUEST requires information about 
the immediate context of the utterance, i.e., about the 
dialogue history. It is in the area of combinations of 
dialogue moves that we find reflections of speaker's at- 
titudes and intentions and hearer's expectations as de- 
termined by the context. The area in the grammar 
encoding this is key. 
The KEY systems are subsystems of the basic 
MOOD options (see Section 3.2). In terms of 
key, example (1) would be \[interrogative:wh-type:wh- 
nontonic:neutral-involvement\], thus leading to an into- 
national realization as tone 1, example (2) would be 
\[ declarative:answering:answer-to-question:strong\] lead- 
ing to an intonational realization as tone 2. Con- 
sider the contexts in which (1) or (2) would be ap- 
propriate: (1) would typically be used as an initiat- 
ing move of an exchange, where there is no immedi- 
ately preceding context--the speaker's attitude is es- 
sentially neutral. (2) would typically be used in an 
exchange as the realization of a responding to move; 
in terms of the coa  model, (2) would be a possible 
realization of a REQUEST within an INFORM or within 
a REQUEST- - the speaker wants to make sure she has 
understood correctly. Only in the REQUEST or IN-

F igure  4: Speech functions--the semantic stratum. 
FORM contexts of a REQUEST does it become possi- 
ble to map the dialogue move/speech function corre- 
lation of REQUEST-question to the mood and key fea- 
tures \[ declarative:answering:answer-to-question:strong\] 
(see also Section 4.2). 
For the representation f constraints between dialogue 
moves on the dialogue side and speech function on the 
side of interpersonal semantics and mood and key on 
the part of the grammar, this means that a good can- 
didate for the ultimate constraint on tone selection is 
the type of move in context (or: the dialogue history). 
Given that all of the parameters (dialogue move type, 
dialogue history, speech function, mood and key) are 
logically independent and that different combinations 
of them go together with different selections of tone, an 
organization of these parameters in terms of stratifica- 
tion suggests itself, for it provides the required flexibil- 
ity in mapping the different categories. Such an orga- 
nization is for instance proposed in systemic functional 
work on interaction and dialogue \[3, 20, 36\]. 
1 
In the systemic functional model, the strata assumed 
are context (extra-linguistic), semantics and grammar 
(linguistic). On the semantic stratum, general knowl- 
edge about interactions i located, described in terms of 
the NEGOTIATION network (cf. Figure 4). A pass (or 
passes, since NEGOTIATION is recursive) through the 
network results in a syntagmatic structure of an inter- 
action called exchange structure. An exchange struc- 
ture consists of moves which are the units for which 
the SPEECH FUNCTION network holds. NEGOTIATION 
and SPEECH FUNCTION are the two ranks of the stra- 
tum of interpersonal semantics (see Figure 4). The 
MOOD and KEY systems represent the grammatical re- 
alization of a move (given that a move is realized as 
a clause). The ultimate constraint on the selection 
of features in the interpersonal semantics and gram- 
mar is the information located at the stratum of con- 
text. This is knowledge about the type of discourse or 
genre. In the present scenario, this contextual knowl- 
edge is provided by the dialogue model, reflecting the 
genre of information-seeking, human-machine dialogue. 
Since the stratum of context is extra-linguistic, locat- 
ing the dialogue model--which as originally not been 
designed to be a model of linguistic dialogue, but of 
retrieval dialogue in general--here is a straightforward 
step. For a graphical overview of the stratified archi- 
tecture we just described briefly see Figure 5.

F igure  5: The stratified model. 
4.2 A top-down perspective 
In this section, we discuss our proposal of bridging the 
gap between the dialogue model and the text generator 
KOMET-PENMAN from a top-down perspective. We de- 
velop concrete mappings between the extra-linguistic 
and semantic strata. Further, we show how competent 
choices at the semantic stratum guide the selection of 
features in the MOOD and KEY systems, which finally 
result in the assignment of a tone. We base our deriva- 
tion of mappings between the strata on the following 
sample dialogue and its COR analysis ll from the do- 
main of giving out train information. In the following, 
we will discuss the different system utterances one by 
one. This discussion is summarized in Table 1 .

anything at all, the system must know where the user 
wants to travel. Unless the user volunteers the des- 
tination, it must request his information from her. 12 
The user did not say where she wanted to travel, hence 
the system initiated the exchange, this is represented 
by the following path through the NEGOTIATIONha net- 
work: \[negotiation:negotiating:exchanging/initiating\]. 
In terms of speech function, we realize this request as 
a question (\[demanding/in/ormation\]). Other possible 
realizations of a request would be command, offer and 
statement, hough none of them applies in the given 
context. The scenario itself excludes the command and 
the statement option, since the system is in need for 
information. Finally, since the system is incapable of 
handing over, say, a ticket, this request cannot be re- 
alized as an offer ("Let me give you a ticket to your 
destination" ). 
Knowing that we have to realize a question, we have 
three MOOD options available: \[declarative\], [yes/no- 
question\], and \[wh-question\]. Keeping in mind that we 
want our system to be user friendly, we do not want 
it to realize this request as a yes/no question ("Do you 
want to go to Heidelberg?"), or a statement ("You want 
to travel to Heidelberg?"), since it would then exhaus- 
tively have to search through its knowledge base in or- 
der to find the right destination to include in its ut- 
terance. Hence we conclude that requests that are not 
in response to a user utterance should be realized as a 
wh-question. 
In terms of KEY, we do not want our system to be overly 
\[involved\] in the conversation or \[surprised\] by the fact 
that it has to request some information and there is 
nothing to \[clarify\], hence the only accessible KEY fea- 
ture is \[neutral-involvement\], which implies that utter- 
ance B)--an initiating, neutral, wh-question--should 
be realized as tone 1. 
Respond ing  requests  Utterance D) is a request in 
response to the destination that the user informed. In 
terms of semantic hoices it is \[initiating\] a new embed- 
ded exchange, while it is \[responding to\] a user move 
in the embedding exchange. The speech function is 
question since the system wants to initiate a response. 
We suggest hat the linguistic realization of this ques- 
tion depends on how confident the system is about what 
the user informed, hence in order to choose appropriate 
MOOD and KEY features, we argue that we need access 
to an additional resource--a confidence measure.13 For 
the current example, we suggest he following alterna- 
tives: 
12We assume that the system has an abstract internal 
specification of its information eeds and that it keeps a 
record of the information it has already received. 
laTbis is highly relevant if the input channel is spoken, 
since speech recognizers cannot achieve a 100% recognition 
rate. Technically, the confidence measure would come from 
the speech recognition unit.

If the system is confident hat it has understood what 
the user said, it would ask only to confirm what it 
believes to know, hence it would choose a declarative 
with tone 2 (\[answering:positive/answering-to- 
question:strong\]). If the confidence is somewhat lower, 
there are two ways of realizing a yes/no-question: 
tone 2a (\[interrogative:yes/no-type:information- 
seeking:unmarked:neutral-assessment\]) or tone 2 
(\[interrogative:yes/no:request\]). Finally, if the system 
has not at all understood what the user said, it could 
indicate this by using a clarifying wh-question with 
tone 4 (\[interrogative:wh-type:wh-tonic:clarifying\]). 
Utterance F) is also in response to a user inform, but 
what makes this situation different from the response 
above is that here, there is a mismatch between what 
the user wanted and what the system can offer (User 
wanted 3 o'clock, while system can only offer 14.52). 
Hence the system must offer the user an alternative 
and the linguistic form of this utterance might differ 
with the "closeness" of the alternative to the original 
demand. 
If the alternative is reasonably close (In our exam- 
ple, there is a time difference of 8 minutes, which, for 
this scenario, might be considered a good alternative), 
we find it appropriate to generate a yes/no-question 
with tone 2b (\[interrogative:yes/no-type:information- 
seeking:unmarked:strong-assessment\]). The lack of 
good alternatives, however, might condition a wh- 
question ("What is your next preferred departure 
time?") with tone 1 (\[interrogative:wh-type:wh- 
nontonic :neutral- involvement \] ). 
I n fo rm The system answers the user's question, 
i.e., it is \[giving/information\], and hence the speech 
function is statement. Statements of this type do 
not need any particular intonational marking, since 
at this point they are expected, hence we choose the 
features \[ declarative:stating:neutral:n?nemphatic:n?n- 
contrastive\], i.e., tone la. E.g., ("Eine einfache Fahrt 
kostet 6DM" (="The ticket costs 6DM."). 
P romise  The information knower can utter a pro- 
mise when she wants to signal the information seeker 
that she is considering the request. For instance, "Ich 
DURCHSUCHE die datenbank." (= "I am search- 
ing"). A promise move is always in response to a request 
move and the relevant partial structure is: 
D(s) 
R(u) P(s) 
! / 
r P As(s) 
The speech function is statement since the system 
tures we choose \[declaratwe:stating:neutral:nonempha- 
tic:non-contrastive\], hence tone la. 
As indicated in the partial structure above, an assert 
move can follow a promise act. This is additional infor- 
mation that the system volunteers the user, which often 
take the form of a polite command, e.g., "Bitte warren 
Sie."(= "Please wait."). Linguistically~ commands are 
realized as imperatives and hence tone 1. 
Request  in Wi thdraw A request in the context of 
any of the unexpected ialogue moves (e.g., withdraw- 
request) mostly serves as confirmation question similar 
to the responding requests in inform that we discussed 
above. This is, however, an unexpected move on the 
part of the user, hence we suggest hat these requests, 
again mapping to question on the speech functional 
level, are realized as yes/no-question (as opposed to 
declarative with tone 2, see above) i.e., "Do you want 
to quit?" vs. "You want to quit?". Which tone one 
chooses for this type of question depends on how in- 
volved one wants the system to appear. Tone 4a indi- 
cates neutral involvement, while tone 4b signals strong 
involvement. The partial structure of this type of re- 
quests is as follows: 
D(s) 
a(u)  Vn(u) 
' D()  r wr s 
R(u) 
Offer In an information retrieval system, the system 
often offers the user a list of alternatives from which 
she has to choose one. If we consider the appearance 
of a list on the screen a metaphor for actually hand- 
ing over an object, this situation corresponds to \[de- 
manding/goods ~4 services\], i.e., the speech function is 
command, hence we suggest hat offers are realized as 
imperatives with tone 1. E.g., "Bitte wS~hlen Sie eins." 
(="Please choose one.") 
Summary  The above discussion is summarized in 
Table 1. Further, from the data that we have collected 
so far we observe: 
? The dialogue move guides the selection of speech 
function, e.g., request corresponds to speech func- 
tion question, whereas offer maps to command. 
? The dialogue history, or context, guides the se- 
lection of semantic choices, i.e., pure initiat- 
ing moves (e.g., request) correspond to \[exchang- 
ing/initiating\], while responding initiating moves 
(e.g., inform(request)) correspond to \[exchang- 
ing/responding\] in a first grammar traversal and 
\[exchanging/initiating\] in a second. 
? Choices in MOOD and KEY systems can often not 
be made unless we have access to additional knowl- 
edge sources as, for instance, a confidence measure.

5 Conclusions 
In this article we have developed a model for guid- 
ing the selection of intonation in a system supporting 
human-machine interaction in retrieval dialogues with 
spoken output. We have concentrated on the choice \[1\] 
of tone as a major signal of interpersonal semantic 
features, such as speech acts and speaker's attitudes. 
To express these appropriately is crucial especially in 
human-machine dialogue, since they contribute to the \[2\] 
success of the interaction in a major way. 
As a starting point we have taken two existing \[3\] 
systems--the COR dialogue model and the KOMET- 
PENMAN generation system. On this basis, we have 
determined a number of factors that contribute to the 
selection of appropriate tones, such as speech func- \[4\] 
tion, speaker's attitudes and hearer's expectations, and 
types of dialogue moves in context. Finally, we have 
proposed a stratified model that includes all of the rele- 
vant kinds of information to guide the selection of tone. \[5\] 
Even though our dialogue model was originally not de- 
signed for language, we have shown that this relatively \[6\] 
simple model provides useful information for intonation 
selection. A linguistically based discourse model would 
be able to provide more information, but in the context 
of an interactive conversational system in which there \[7\] 
are practical imits on how tong it can take to produce 
a response, we believe that a full fledged discourse anal- 
ysis system would be too slow. 
We are aware that we have left untouched a number of \[8\] 
problems that are involved in the generation of appro- 
priate intonations. These include: \[9\] 
? accounting for the textual meaning of intonation 
encoded in information structure and thematic 
179 
development/progression (realized in tonicity; see 
Section 2); 
We handle only situations in which there is a one- 
to-one corresponds between tone group and clause. 
We can only make predictions about complete 
clauses, hence the grammar prevents the genera- 
tion of utterances with ellipses. This is relevant for 
geographical clarification question, e.g., "Wollen 
Sie nach Frankfurt am Main oder Frankfurt an 
der Oder?". In many contexts it is more natu- 
ral to use just a phrase "Frankfurt am Main oder 
an der Oder?" 
Similarly it is unnatural to generate the evaluate 
moves as complete clauses. It suffices to generate 
simple phrases like "Thanks" or "OK". 
Also, the method we have applied here to develop our 
model has been solely qualitative. For a proper vali- 
dation we need to analyse larger quantities of dialogue 
in order to have an empirically sound foundation. The 
same is true for the classification of intonation which 
was developed by Pheby in the late sixties. Here, the 
collaborative work with speech synthesis will provide 
us with empirical data that can then be used to refine 
the classification.
