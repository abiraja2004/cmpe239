Text representation is a central task for any ap-
proach to automatic learning from texts. It re-
quires a format which allows to interrelate texts
even if they do not share content words, but
deal with similar topics. Furthermore, measur-
ing text similarities raises the question of how
to organize the resulting clusters. This paper
presents cohesion trees (CT) as a data structure
for the perspective, hierarchical organization of
text corpora. CTs operate on alternative text
representation models taking lexical organiza-
tion, quantitative text characteristics, and text
structure into account. It is shown that CTs
realize text linkages which are lexically more
homogeneous than those produced by minimal
spanning trees.
