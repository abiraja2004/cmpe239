The growing availability of multilingual resources,
like EuroWordnet, has recently inspired the develop-
ment of large scale linguistic technologies, e.g. mul-
tilingual IE and Q&A, that were considered infeasi-
ble until a few years ago. In this paper a system
for categorisation and automatic authoring of news
streams in different languages is presented. In our
system, a knowledge-based approach to Information
Extraction is adopted as a support for hyperlinking.
Authoring across documents in different languages
is triggered by Named Entities and event recogni-
tion. The matching of events in texts is carried out
by discourse processing driven by a large scale world
model. This kind of multilingual analysis relies on a
lexical knowledge base of nouns(i.e. the EuroWord-
net Base Concepts) shared among English, Spanish
and Italian lexicons. The impact of the design choices
on the language independence and the possibilities it
opens for automatic learning of the event hierarchy
will be discussed.
