 
We present an efficient and robust reference reso- 
lution algorithm in an end-to-end state-of-the-art 
information extraction system, which must work 
with a considerably impoverished syntactic analy- 
sis of the input sentences. Considering this disad- 
vantage, the basic setup to collect, filter, then order 
by salience does remarkably well with third-person 
pronouns, but needs more semantic and discourse 
information to improve the treatments ofother ex- 
pression types.
