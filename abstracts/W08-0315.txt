This paper reports on the participation of the TALP
Research Center of the UPC (Universitat Polit?cnica
de Catalunya) to the ACL WMT 2008 evaluation
campaign.
This year?s system is the evolution of the one we em-
ployed for the 2007 campaign. Main updates and
extensions involve linguistically motivated word re-
ordering based on the reordering patterns technique.
In addition, this system introduces a target language
model, based on linguistic classes (Part-of-Speech),
morphology reduction for an inflectional language
(Spanish) and an improved optimization procedure.
Results obtained over the development and test sets
on Spanish to English (and the other way round)
translations for both the traditional Europarl and
a challenging News stories tasks are analyzed and
commented.
