In this paper, we present a semi-supervised
method for automatic speech act recogni-
tion in email and forums. The major chal-
lenge of this task is due to lack of labeled
data in these two genres. Our method
leverages labeled data in the Switchboard-
DAMSL and the Meeting Recorder Dia-
log Act database and applies simple do-
main adaptation techniques over a large
amount of unlabeled email and forum data
to address this problem. Our method uses
automatically extracted features such as
phrases and dependency trees, called sub-
tree features, for semi-supervised learn-
ing. Empirical results demonstrate that
our model is effective in email and forum
speech act recognition.
