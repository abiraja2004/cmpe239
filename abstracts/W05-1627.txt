We discuss work-in-progress on a hybrid ap-
proach to the generation of spatial descriptions,
using the maps of the Map Task dialogue cor-
pus as domain models. We treat spatial de-
scriptions as referring expressions that distin-
guish particular points on the maps from all
other points (potential ?distractors?). Our ap-
proach is based on rule-based overgeneration
of spatial descriptions combined with ranking
which currently is based on explicit goodness
criteria but will ultimately be corpus-based.
Ranking for content determination tasks such
as referring expression generation raises a num-
ber of deep and vexing questions about the role
of corpora in NLG, the kind of knowledge they
can provide and how it is used.
