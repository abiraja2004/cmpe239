The paper proposes a methodology for deal-
ing with multiword expressions in natu-
ral language processing applications. It
provides a practically justified taxonomy
of such units, and suggests the ways in
which the individual classes can be pro-
cessed computationally. While the study is
currently limited to Polish and English, we
believe our findings can be successfully em-
ployed in the processing of other languages,
with emphasis on inflectional ones.
