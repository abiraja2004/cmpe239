 
In this paper we show how to use the so- 
called aggregation technique to remove 
redundancies in the fact base of the Visual 
and Natural language Specification Tool 
(VINST). The current aggregation modules 
of the natural language generator f VINST 
is described and an improvement is prop- 
osed with one new aggregation rule and a 
bidirectional grammar.
