This paper describes our approaches for the
preparation of gazetteers for named entity
recognition (NER) in Indian languages. We
have described two methodologies for the
preparation of gazetteers1. Since the rel-
evant gazetteer lists are more easily avail-
able in English we have used a translitera-
tion based approach to convert available En-
glish name lists to Indian languages. The
second approach is a context pattern induc-
tion based domain specific gazetteer prepa-
ration. This approach uses a domain specific
raw corpus and a few seed entities to learn
context patterns and then the corresponding
name lists are generated by using bootstrap-
ping.
