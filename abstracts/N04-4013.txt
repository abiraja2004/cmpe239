We present a computationally efficient method
for automatic grouping of web search results
based on reformulating the original query to al-
ternative queries the user may have intended.
The method requires no data other than query
logs and the standard inverted indices used by
most search engines. Our method outperforms
standard web search in the task of enabling
users to quickly find relevant documents for in-
formational queries.
