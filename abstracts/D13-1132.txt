Hot trends are likely to bring new business
opportunities. For example, ?Air Pollution?
might lead to a significant increase of the sales
of related products, e.g., mouth mask. For e-
commerce companies, it is very important to
make rapid and correct response to these hot
trends in order to improve product sales. In
this paper, we take the initiative to study the
task of how to identify trend related products.
The major novelty of our work is that we au-
tomatically learn commercial intents revealed
from microblogs. We carefully construct a da-
ta collection for this task and present quite a
few insightful findings. In order to solve this
problem, we further propose a graph based
method, which jointly models relevance and
associativity. We perform extensive experi-
ments and the results showed that our methods
are very effective.
