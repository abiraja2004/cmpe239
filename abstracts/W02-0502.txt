We apply default inheritance hierarchies
to generating the morphology of Hebrew
verbs. Instead of lexically listing each
of a word form?s various parts, this strat-
egy represents inflectional exponents as
markings associated with the application
of rules by which complex word forms
are deduced from simpler roots or stems.
The high degree of similarity among verbs
of different binyanim allows us to for-
mulate general rules; these general rules
are, however, sometimes overridden by
binyan-specific rules. Similarly, a verb?s
form within a particular binyan is deter-
mined both by default rules and by over-
riding rules specific to individual verbs.
Our result is a concise set of rules defin-
ing the morphology of all strong verbs in
all binyanim. We express these rules in
KATR, both a formalism for default in-
heritance hierarchies and associated soft-
ware for computing the forms specified by
those rules. As we describe the rules, we
point out general strategies for express-
ing morphology in KATR and we discuss
KATR?s advantages over ordinary DATR
for the representation of morphological
systems.
