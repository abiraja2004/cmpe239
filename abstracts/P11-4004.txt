We present a mobile touchable application for
online topic graph extraction and exploration
of web content. The system has been imple-
mented for operation on an iPad. The topic
graph is constructed from N web snippets
which are determined by a standard search en-
gine. We consider the extraction of a topic
graph as a specific empirical collocation ex-
traction task where collocations are extracted
between chunks. Our measure of association
strength is based on the pointwise mutual in-
formation between chunk pairs which explic-
itly takes their distance into account. An ini-
tial user evaluation shows that this system is
especially helpful for finding new interesting
information on topics about which the user has
only a vague idea or even no idea at all.
