We introduce a novel semantic represen-
tation formalism, Almost Flat Functional
semantics (AFF), which is designed as an
intelligent compromise between linguis-
tically motivated predicate/argument se-
mantics and ad hoc engineering solutions
based on flat feature/value lists; the cen-
tral idea is to tag each semantic element
with the functional marking which most
closely surrounds it. We argue that AFF is
well-suited for medium-vocabulary speech
translation applications, and describe sim-
ple and general algorithms for parsing,
generating and performing transfer using
AFF representations. The formalism has
been fully implemented within a medium-
vocabulary interlingua-based Open Source
speech translation system which translates
between English, French, Japanese and
Arabic.
