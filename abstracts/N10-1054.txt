We explore the relation between word sense
subjectivity and cross-lingual lexical substitu-
tion, following the intuition that good substi-
tutions will transfer a word?s (contextual) sen-
timent from the source language into the target
language. Experiments on English-Chinese
lexical substitution show that taking a word?s
subjectivity into account can indeed improve
performance. We also show that just using
word sense subjectivity can perform as well
as integrating fully-fledged fine-grained word
sense disambiguation for words which have
both subjective and objective senses.
