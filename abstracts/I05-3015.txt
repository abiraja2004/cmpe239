In this paper, we study some issues on 
Chinese domain knowledge dictionary 
and its application to text classification 
task. First a domain knowledge hierar-
chy description framework and our 
Chinese domain knowledge dictionary 
named NEUKD are introduced. Second, 
to alleviate the cost of construction of 
domain knowledge dictionary by hand, 
we use a boostrapping-based algorithm 
to learn new domain associated terms 
from a large amount of unlabeled data. 
Third, we propose two models (BOTW 
and BOF) which use domain knowl-
edge as textual features for text catego-
rization. But due to limitation of size of 
domain knowledge dictionary, we fur-
ther study machine learning technique 
to solve the problem, and propose a 
BOL model which could be considered 
as the extended version of BOF model. 
Na?ve Bayes classifier based on BOW 
model is used as baseline system in the 
comparison experiments. Experimental 
results show that domain knowledge is 
very useful for text categorization, and 
BOL model performs better than other 
three models, including BOW, BOTW 
and BOF models.
