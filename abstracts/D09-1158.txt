Bootstrapping is the process of improving
the performance of a trained classifier by
iteratively adding data that is labeled by
the classifier itself to the training set, and
retraining the classifier. It is often used
in situations where labeled training data is
scarce but unlabeled data is abundant. In
this paper, we consider the problem of do-
main adaptation: the situation where train-
ing data may not be scarce, but belongs to
a different domain from the target appli-
cation domain. As the distribution of un-
labeled data is different from the training
data, standard bootstrapping often has dif-
ficulty selecting informative data to add to
the training set. We propose an effective
domain adaptive bootstrapping algorithm
that selects unlabeled target domain data
that are informative about the target do-
main and easy to automatically label cor-
rectly. We call these instances bridges, as
they are used to bridge the source domain
to the target domain. We show that the
method outperforms supervised, transduc-
tive and bootstrapping algorithms on the
named entity recognition task.
