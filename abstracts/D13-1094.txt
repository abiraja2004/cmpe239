We present a classification model that predicts
the presence or omission of a lexical connec-
tive between two clauses, based upon linguis-
tic features of the clauses and the type of dis-
course relation holding between them. The
model is trained on a set of high frequency
relations extracted from the Penn Discourse
Treebank and achieves an accuracy of 86.6%.
Analysis of the results reveals that the most in-
formative features relate to the discourse de-
pendencies between sequences of coherence
relations in the text. We also present results
of an experiment that provides insight into the
nature and difficulty of the task.
