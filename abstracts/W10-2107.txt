As a consequence of the established prac-
tice to prefer training data obtained from
written sources, NLP tools encounter
problems in handling data from the spo-
ken domain. However, accurate models
of spoken data are increasingly in demand
for naturalistic speech generation and ma-
chine translations in speech-like contexts
(such as chat windows and SMS). There
is a widely held assumption in the lin-
guistic field that spoken language is an
impoverished form of written language.
However, we show that spoken data is
not unpredictably irregular and that lan-
guage models can benefit from detailed
consideration of spoken language features.
This paper considers one specific con-
struction which is largely restricted to the
spoken domain - the ZERO AUXILIARY -
and makes a predictive model of that con-
struction for native speakers of British En-
glish. The model can predict zero auxil-
iary occurrence in the BNC with 96.9%
accuracy. We will demonstrate how this
model can be integrated into existing pars-
ing tools, increasing the number of suc-
cessful parses for this zero auxiliary con-
struction by around 30%, and thus improv-
ing the performance of NLP applications
which rely on parsing.
