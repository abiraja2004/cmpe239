The evaluation of whole-sentence seman-
tic structures plays an important role in
semantic parsing and large-scale seman-
tic structure annotation. However, there is
no widely-used metric to evaluate whole-
sentence semantic structures. In this pa-
per, we present smatch, a metric that cal-
culates the degree of overlap between two
semantic feature structures. We give an
efficient algorithm to compute the metric
and show the results of an inter-annotator
agreement study.
