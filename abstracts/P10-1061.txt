Subjectivity analysis is a rapidly grow-
ing field of study. Along with its ap-
plications to various NLP tasks, much
work have put efforts into multilingual
subjectivity learning from existing re-
sources. Multilingual subjectivity analy-
sis requires language-independent crite-
ria for comparable outcomes across lan-
guages. This paper proposes to mea-
sure the multilanguage-comparability of
subjectivity analysis tools, and provides
meaningful comparisons of multilingual
subjectivity analysis from various points
of view.
