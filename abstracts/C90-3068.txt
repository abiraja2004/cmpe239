 
Arabic has some special syntax features 
which lead to complex syntax structures. 
We have developed a formal description 
of Arabic syntax in Definite Clause Gram- 
mar. This grarnrnar is characterized by its 
high descriptive power due to its dual for- 
mulation in terms of functions and in 
terms of grammatical categories. The de- 
veloped grammar has a high coverage of 
Arabic language and has context sensitive 
capabilities. It is suitable for the advanced 
applications of natural language process- 
ing.
