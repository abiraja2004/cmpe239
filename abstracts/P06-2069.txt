We investigate the connection between
part of speech (POS) distribution and con-
tent in language. We define POS blocks
to be groups of parts of speech. We hypo-
thesise that there exists a directly propor-
tional relation between the frequency of
POS blocks and their content salience. We
also hypothesise that the class membership
of the parts of speech within such blocks
reflects the content load of the blocks, on
the basis that open class parts of speech
are more content-bearing than closed class
parts of speech. We test these hypothe-
ses in the context of Information Retrieval,
by syntactically representing queries, and
removing from them content-poor blocks,
in line with the aforementioned hypothe-
ses. For our first hypothesis, we induce
POS distribution information from a cor-
pus, and approximate the probability of
occurrence of POS blocks as per two sta-
tistical estimators separately. For our se-
cond hypothesis, we use simple heuristics
to estimate the content load within POS
blocks. We use the Text REtrieval Con-
ference (TREC) queries of 1999 and 2000
to retrieve documents from the WT2G and
WT10G test collections, with five differ-
ent retrieval strategies. Experimental out-
comes confirm that our hypotheses hold in
the context of Information Retrieval.
