paragraph for multi-document summarization based 
on distinction between a topic and a~ event. A topic 
emd an event are identified using a simple criterion 
called domain dependency of words. The method 
was tested on the TDT1 corpus which has been de- 
veloped by the TDT Pilot Study and the result can 
be regarded as promising the idea of domain depen- 
dency of words effectively employed.
