We propose a method for extracting se-
mantic orientations of words: desirable
or undesirable. Regarding semantic ori-
entations as spins of electrons, we use
the mean field approximation to compute
the approximate probability function of
the system instead of the intractable ac-
tual probability function. We also pro-
pose a criterion for parameter selection on
the basis of magnetization. Given only
a small number of seed words, the pro-
posed method extracts semantic orienta-
tions with high accuracy in the exper-
iments on English lexicon. The result
is comparable to the best value ever re-
ported.
