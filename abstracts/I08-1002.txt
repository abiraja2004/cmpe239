This paper reports our empirical evaluation
and comparison of several popular good-
ness measures for unsupervised segmenta-
tion of Chinese texts using Bakeoff-3 data
sets with a unified framework. Assuming no
prior knowledge about Chinese, this frame-
work relies on a goodness measure to iden-
tify word candidates from unlabeled texts
and then applies a generalized decoding al-
gorithm to find the optimal segmentation
of a sentence into such candidates with the
greatest sum of goodness scores. Exper-
iments show that description length gain
outperforms other measures because of its
strength for identifying short words. Further
performance improvement is also reported,
achieved by proper candidate pruning and
by assemble segmentation to integrate the
strengths of individual measures.
