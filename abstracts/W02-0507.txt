 
 
We describe the design and 
implementation of a question answering 
(QA) system called QARAB. It is a 
system that takes natural language 
questions expressed in the Arabic 
language and attempts to provide short 
answers. The system?s primary source 
of knowledge is a collection of Arabic 
newspaper text extracted from Al-Raya, 
a newspaper published in Qatar. During 
the last few years the information 
retrieval community has attacked this 
problem for English using standard IR 
techniques with only mediocre success. 
We are tackling this problem for Arabic 
using traditional Information Retrieval 
(IR) techniques coupled with a 
sophisticated Natural Language 
Processing (NLP) approach. To identify 
the answer, we adopt a keyword 
matching strategy along with matching 
simple structures extracted from both 
the question and the candidate 
documents selected by the IR system. 
To achieve this goal, we use an existing 
tagger to identify proper names and 
other crucial lexical items and build 
lexical entries for them on the fly.  We 
also carry out an analysis of Arabic 
question forms and attempt a better 
understanding of what kinds of answers 
users find satisfactory.  The paucity of 
studies of real users has limited results 
in earlier research.
