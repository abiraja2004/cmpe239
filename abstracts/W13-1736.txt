We show that it is possible to learn to identify, with
high accuracy, the native language of English test
takers from the content of the essays they write.
Our method uses standard text classification tech-
niques based on multiclass logistic regression, com-
bining individually weak indicators to predict the
most probable native language from a set of 11 pos-
sibilities. We describe the various features used for
classification, as well as the settings of the classifier
that yielded the highest accuracy.
