This work describes an answer ranking engine
for non-factoid questions built using a large
online community-generated question-answer
collection (Yahoo! Answers). We show how
such collections may be used to effectively
set up large supervised learning experiments.
Furthermore we investigate a wide range of
feature types, some exploiting NLP proces-
sors, and demonstrate that using them in com-
bination leads to considerable improvements
in accuracy.
