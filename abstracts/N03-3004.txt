This paper presents an unsupervised method
for discriminating among the senses of a given
target word based on the context in which it oc-
curs. Instances of a word that occur in similar
contexts are grouped together via McQuitty?s
Similarity Analysis, an agglomerative cluster-
ing algorithm. The context in which a target
word occurs is represented by surface lexical
features such as unigrams, bigrams, and sec-
ond order co-occurrences. This paper summa-
rizes our approach, and describes the results of
a preliminary evaluation we have carried out
using data from the SENSEVAL-2 English lexi-
cal sample and the line corpus.
