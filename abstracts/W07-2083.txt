We describe a supervised learning approach to 
categorizing  inter-noun  relations,  based  on 
Support Vector Machines, that builds a differ-
ent classifier for each of seven semantic rela-
tions.  Each  model  uses  the  same  learning 
strategy,  while  a  simple  voting  procedure 
based on five trained discriminators with vari-
ous  blends  of  features  determines  the  final 
categorization.  The features that  characterize 
each of the noun pairs are a blend of lexical-
semantic  categories extracted  from WordNet 
and  several  flavors  of  syntactic  patterns  ex-
tracted  from  various  corpora,  including 
Wikipedia and the WMTS corpus.
