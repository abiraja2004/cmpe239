This paper addresses the problem of automatic
text simplification. Automatic text simplifica-
tions aims at reducing the reading difficulty
for people with cognitive disability, among
other target groups. We describe an automatic
text simplification system for Spanish which
combines a rule based core module with a sta-
tistical support module that controls the ap-
plication of rules in the wrong contexts. Our
system is integrated in a service architecture
which includes a web service and mobile ap-
plications.
