 
This paper presents a unified solution, which 
is based on the idea of ?roles tagging?, to the 
complicated problems of Chinese unknown words 
recognition. In our approach, an unknown word is 
identified according to its component tokens and 
context tokens. In order to capture the functions of 
tokens, we use the concept of roles. Roles are 
tagged through applying the Viterbi algorithm in 
the fashion of a POS tagger. In the resulted most 
probable roles sequence, all the eligible unknown 
words are recognized through a maximum patterns 
matching. We have got excellent precision and 
recalling rates, especially for person names and 
transliterations. The result and experiments in our 
system ICTCLAS shows that our approach based 
on roles tagging is simple yet effective. 
Keywords: Chinese unknown words recognition, 
roles tagging, word segmentation, Viterbi 
algorithm.
