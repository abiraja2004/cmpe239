In this paper we present the dialogue-
understanding components of an architec-
ture for assisting multi-human conversa-
tions in artifact-producing meetings: meet-
ings in which tangible products such as
project planning charts are created. Novel
aspects of our system include multimodal
ambiguity resolution, modular ontology-
driven artifact manipulation, and a meeting
browser for use during and after meetings.
We describe the software architecture and
demonstrate the system using an example
multimodal dialogue.
