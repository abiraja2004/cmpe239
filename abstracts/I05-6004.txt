We have constructed a large scale
and detailed database of lexical types
in Japanese from a treebank that in-
cludes detailed linguistic information.
The database helps treebank annota-
tors and grammar developers to share
precise knowledge about the grammat-
ical status of words that constitute the
treebank, allowing for consistent large
scale treebanking and grammar devel-
opment. In this paper, we report on
the motivation and methodology of the
database construction.
