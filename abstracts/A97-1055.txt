 
It is widely accepted that tagging text with se- 
mantic information would improve the quality of 
lexical learning in corpus-based NLP methods. 
However available on-line taxonomies are 
rather entangled and introduce an unnecessary 
level of ambiguity. The noise produced by the re- 
dundant number of tags often overrides the ad- 
vantage of semantic tagging. In this paper we 
propose an automatic method to select from 
WordNet a subset of domain-appropriate cate- 
gories that effectively reduce the overambiguity 
of WordNet, and help at identifying and cate- 
gorise relevant language patterns in a more com- 
pact way. The method is evaluated against a 
manually tagged corpus, SEMCOR.
