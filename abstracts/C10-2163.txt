This paper is a case study on cross-lingual
induction of lexical resources for deep,
broad-coverage syntactic analysis of Ger-
man. We use a parallel corpus to in-
duce a classifier for German participles
which can predict their syntactic category.
By means of this classifier, we induce a
resource of adverbial participles from a
huge monolingual corpus of German. We
integrate the resource into a German LFG
grammar and show that it improves pars-
ing coverage while maintaining accuracy.
