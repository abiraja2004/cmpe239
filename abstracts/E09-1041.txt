Named entity recognition for morpholog-
ically rich, case-insensitive languages, in-
cluding the majority of semitic languages,
Iranian languages, and Indian languages,
is inherently more difficult than its English
counterpart. Worse still, progress on ma-
chine learning approaches to named entity
recognition for many of these languages
is currently hampered by the scarcity of
annotated data and the lack of an accu-
rate part-of-speech tagger. While it is
possible to rely on manually-constructed
gazetteers to combat data scarcity, this
gazetteer-centric approach has the poten-
tial weakness of creating irreproducible
results, since these name lists are not
publicly available in general. Motivated
in part by this concern, we present a
learning-based named entity recognizer
that does not rely on manually-constructed
gazetteers, using Bengali as our represen-
tative resource-scarce, morphologically-
rich language. Our recognizer achieves
a relative improvement of 7.5% in F-
measure over a baseline recognizer. Im-
provements arise from (1) using in-
duced affixes, (2) extracting information
from online lexical databases, and (3)
jointly modeling part-of-speech tagging
and named entity recognition.
