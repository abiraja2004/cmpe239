 
This paper reports the development of Jap-
anese WordNet Affect from the English 
WordNet Affect lists with the help of Eng-
lish SentiWordNet and Japanese WordNet. 
Expanding the available synsets of the 
English WordNet Affect using SentiWord-
Net, we have performed the translation of 
the expanded lists into Japanese based on 
the synsetIDs in the Japanese WordNet. A 
baseline system for emotion analysis of 
Japanese sentences has been developed 
based on the Japanese WordNet Affect. The 
incorporation of morphology improves the 
performance of the system. Overall, the 
system achieves average precision, recall 
and F-scores of 32.76%, 53% and 40.49% 
respectively on 89 sentences of the Japa-
nese judgment corpus and 83.52%, 49.58% 
and 62.22% on 1000 translated Japanese 
sentences of the SemEval 2007 affect sens-
ing test corpus. Different experimental out-
comes and morphological analysis suggest 
that irrespective of the google translation 
error, the performance of the system could 
be improved by enhancing the Japanese 
WordNet Affect in terms of coverage.
