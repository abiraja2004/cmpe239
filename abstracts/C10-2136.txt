In this paper, we propose a novel
dependency-based bracketing transduc-
tion grammar for statistical machine
translation, which converts a source sen-
tence into a target dependency tree. Dif-
ferent from conventional bracketing trans-
duction grammar models, we encode tar-
get dependency information into our lex-
ical rules directly, and then we employ
two different maximum entropy models
to determine the reordering and combi-
nation of partial dependency structures,
when we merge two neighboring blocks.
By incorporating dependency language
model further, large-scale experiments on
Chinese-English task show that our sys-
tem achieves significant improvements
over the baseline system on various test
sets even with fewer phrases.
