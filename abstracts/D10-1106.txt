Even the entire Web corpus does not explic-
itly answer all questions, yet inference can un-
cover many implicit answers. But where do
inference rules come from?
This paper investigates the problem of learn-
ing inference rules from Web text in an un-
supervised, domain-independent manner. The
SHERLOCK system, described herein, is a
first-order learner that acquires over 30,000
Horn clauses from Web text. SHERLOCK em-
bodies several innovations, including a novel
rule scoring function based on Statistical Rel-
evance (Salmon et al, 1971) which is effec-
tive on ambiguous, noisy and incomplete Web
extractions. Our experiments show that in-
ference over the learned rules discovers three
times as many facts (at precision 0.8) as the
TEXTRUNNER system which merely extracts
facts explicitly stated in Web text.
