 
Extractive summaries produced from multiple 
source documents suffer from an array of prob-
lems with respect to text cohesion.  In this pre-
liminary study, we seek to understand what 
problems occur in such summaries and how of-
ten.  We present an analysis of a small corpus 
of manually revised summaries and discuss the 
feasibility of making such repairs automati-
cally.  Additionally, we present a taxonomy of 
the problems that occur in the corpus, as well 
as the operators which, when applied to the 
summaries, can address these concerns.  This 
study represents a first step toward identifying 
and automating revision operators that could 
work with current summarization systems in 
order to repair cohesion problems in multi-
document summaries.
