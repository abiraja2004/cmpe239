We investigate the effectiveness of differ-
ent linguistic cues for distinguishing lit-
eral and non-literal usages of potentially
idiomatic expressions. We focus specif-
ically on features that generalize across
different target expressions. While id-
ioms on the whole are frequent, instances
of each particular expression can be rela-
tively infrequent and it will often not be
feasible to extract and annotate a suffi-
cient number of examples for each expres-
sion one might want to disambiguate. We
experimented with a number of different
features and found that features encoding
lexical cohesion as well as some syntac-
tic features can generalize well across id-
ioms.
