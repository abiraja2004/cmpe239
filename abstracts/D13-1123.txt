This paper presents a novel approach to deter-
mine textual similarity. A layered methodol-
ogy to transform text into logic forms is pro-
posed, and semantic features are derived from
a logic prover. Experimental results show that
incorporating the semantic structure of sen-
tences is beneficial. When training data is
unavailable, scores obtained from the logic
prover in an unsupervised manner outperform
supervised methods.
