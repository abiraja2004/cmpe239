This paper presents the design of a textentry device
that requires only four buttons Such a device is ap
plicable as the text interface of portable machines and
as an interface for disabled people The textentry
system is predictive the basis for this is an adaptive
language model Our evaluation showed that the sys
tem is at least as ecient for the entry of free text as
the textentry systems of currentgeneration mobile
phones The system requires fewer keystrokes than a
full keyboard After adaptation one user reached a
maximum speed of  wpm
