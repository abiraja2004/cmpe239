In predicate-argument structure analysis,
it is important to capture non-local de-
pendencies among arguments and inter-
dependencies between the sense of a pred-
icate and the semantic roles of its argu-
ments. However, no existing approach ex-
plicitly handles both non-local dependen-
cies and semantic dependencies between
predicates and arguments. In this pa-
per we propose a structured model that
overcomes the limitation of existing ap-
proaches; the model captures both types of
dependencies simultaneously by introduc-
ing four types of factors including a global
factor type capturing non-local dependen-
cies among arguments and a pairwise fac-
tor type capturing local dependencies be-
tween a predicate and an argument. In
experiments the proposed model achieved
competitive results compared to the state-
of-the-art systems without applying any
feature selection procedure.
