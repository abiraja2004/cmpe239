When a machine learning-based named
entity recognition system is employed in
a new domain, its performance usually de-
grades. In this paper, we provide an em-
pirical study on the impact of training data
size and domain information on the per-
formance stability of named entity recog-
nition models. We present an informative
sample selection method for building high
quality and stable named entity recogni-
tion models across domains. Experimen-
tal results show that the performance of
the named entity recognition model is en-
hanced significantly after being trained
with these informative samples.
