 
Reasoning about how much to generate 
when space is limited is a challenge for 
generation systems. This paper presents 
two algorithms that exploit the discourse 
structure to decide which content to drop 
when there are space restrictions, in the 
context of producing documents from 
pre-authored text fragments. We analyse 
the effectiveness of both algorithms and 
show that the second is near optimal.
