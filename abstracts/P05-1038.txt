This paper presents the first probabilistic
parsing results for French, using the re-
cently released French Treebank. We start
with an unlexicalized PCFG as a base-
line model, which is enriched to the level
of Collins? Model 2 by adding lexical-
ization and subcategorization. The lexi-
calized sister-head model and a bigram
model are also tested, to deal with the flat-
ness of the French Treebank. The bigram
model achieves the best performance:
81% constituency F-score and 84% de-
pendency accuracy. All lexicalized mod-
els outperform the unlexicalized baseline,
consistent with probabilistic parsing re-
sults for English, but contrary to results
for German, where lexicalization has only
a limited effect on parsing performance.
