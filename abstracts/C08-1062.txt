 
Query-oriented update summarization is 
an emerging summarization task very 
recently. It brings new challenges to the 
sentence ranking algorithms that require 
not only to locate the important and 
query-relevant information, but also to 
capture the new information when 
document collections evolve. In this 
paper, we propose a novel graph based 
sentence ranking algorithm, namely PNR2, 
for update summarization. Inspired by the 
intuition that ?a sentence receives a 
positive influence from the sentences that 
correlate to it in the same collection, 
whereas a sentence receives a negative 
influence from the sentences that 
correlates to it in the different (perhaps 
previously read) collection?, PNR2 
models both the positive and the negative 
mutual reinforcement in the ranking 
process. Automatic evaluation on the 
DUC 2007 data set pilot task 
demonstrates the effectiveness of the 
algorithm.
