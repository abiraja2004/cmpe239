Mistranslation of an ambiguous word can have
a large impact on the understandability of a
given sentence. In this article, we describe
a thorough evaluation of the translation qual-
ity of ambiguous nouns in three different se-
tups. We compared two statistical Machine
Translation systems and one dedicated Word
Sense Disambiguation (WSD) system. Our
WSD system incorporates multilingual infor-
mation and is independent from external lex-
ical resources. Word senses are derived auto-
matically from word alignments on a parallel
corpus. We show that the two WSD classifiers
that were built for these experiments (English?
French and English?Dutch) outperform the
SMT system that was trained on the same cor-
pus. This opens perspectives for the integra-
tion of our multilingual WSD module in a sta-
tistical Machine Translation framework, in or-
der to improve the automated translation of
ambiguous words, and by consequence make
the translation output more understandable.
