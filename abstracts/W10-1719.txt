This paper describes our phrase-based Sta-
tistical Machine Translation (SMT) sys-
tem for the WMT10 Translation Task. We
submitted translations for the German to
English and English to German transla-
tion tasks. Compared to state-of-the-art
phrase-based systems we preformed addi-
tional preprocessing and used a discrim-
inative word alignment approach. The
word reordering was modeled using POS
information and we extended the transla-
tion model with additional features.
