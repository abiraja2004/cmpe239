 
This paper describes experiments in Machine 
Learning for text classification using a new 
representation of text based on WordNet 
hypernyms. Six binary classification tasks of 
varying difficulty are defined, and the Ripper 
system is used to produce discrimination rules 
for each task using the new hypernym density 
representation. Rules are also produced with the 
commonly used bag-of-words representation, 
incorporating no knowledge from WordNet. 
Experiments how that for some of the more 
difficult tasks the hypernym density 
representation leads to significantly more 
accurate and more comprehensible rules.
