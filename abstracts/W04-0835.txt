In SENSEVAL-3, CL Research participated in
four tasks: English all-words, English lexical
sample, disambiguation of WordNet glosses, and
automatic labeling of semantic roles. This
participation was performed within the
development of CL Research?s Knowledge
Management System, which massively tags texts
with syntactic, semantic, and discourse
characterizations and attributes. This System is
fully integrated with CL Research?s DIMAP
dictionary maintenance software, which provides
access to one or more dictionaries for
disambiguation and representation. Our core
disambiguation functionality, unchanged since
SENSEVAL-2, performed at a level comparable
to our previous performance. Our participation
in the SENSEVAL-3 tasks was concerned
primarily with text processing and representation
issues and did not advance our disambiguation
capabilities.
