 
In this paper, we show that we can ob-
tain a good baseline performance for 
Question Answering (QA) by using 
only 4 simple features. Using these fea-
tures, we contrast two approaches used 
for a Maximum Entropy based QA sys-
tem. We view the QA problem as a 
classification problem and as a re-
ranking problem. Our results indicate 
that the QA system viewed as a re-
ranker clearly outperforms the QA sys-
tem used as a classifier. Both systems 
are trained using the same data.
