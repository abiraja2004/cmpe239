This paper investigates an isolated setting
of the lexical substitution task of replac-
ing words with their synonyms. In par-
ticular, we examine this problem in the
setting of subtitle generation and evaluate
state of the art scoring methods that pre-
dict the validity of a given substitution.
The paper evaluates two context indepen-
dent models and two contextual models.
The major findings suggest that distribu-
tional similarity provides a useful comple-
mentary estimate for the likelihood that
two Wordnet synonyms are indeed substi-
tutable, while proper modeling of contex-
tual constraints is still a challenging task
for future research.
