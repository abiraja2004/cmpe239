 
ESL Assistant is a prototype web-based writ-
ing-assistance tool that is being developed for 
English Language Learners. The system fo-
cuses on types of errors that are typically 
made by non-native writers of American Eng-
lish. A freely-available prototype was dep-
loyed in June 2008. User data from this 
system are manually evaluated to identify 
writing domain and measure system accuracy. 
Combining the user log data with the eva-
luated rewrite suggestions enables us to de-
termine how effectively English language 
learners are using the system, across rule 
types and across writing domains. We find 
that repeat users typically make informed 
choices and can distinguish correct sugges-
tions from incorrect.
