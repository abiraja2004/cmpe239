Emotion words have been well used as the
most obvious choice as feature in the task
of textual emotion recognition and auto-
matic emotion lexicon construction. In
this work, we explore features for rec-
ognizing word emotion. Based on Ren-
CECps (an annotated emotion corpus) and
MaxEnt (Maximum entropy) model, sev-
eral contextual features and their com-
bination have been experimented. Then
PLSA (probabilistic latent semantic anal-
ysis) is used to get semantic feature by
clustering words and sentences. The ex-
perimental results demonstrate the effec-
tiveness of using semantic feature for
word emotion recognition. After that,
?word emotion components? is proposed
to describe the combined basic emotions
in a word. A significant performance
improvement over contextual and seman-
tic features was observed after adding
word emotion components as feature.
