 
Interactive spoken dialog provides many new challenges for 
spoken language systems. One of the most critical is the 
prevalence of speech repairs. This paper presents an al- 
gorithm that detects and corrects peech repairs based on 
finding the repair pattern. The repair pattern is built by find- 
ing word matches and word replacements, and identifying 
fragments and editing terms. Rather than using a set of pre- 
built templates, we build the pattern on the fly. In a fair test, 
our method, when combined with a statistical model to filter 
possible repairs, was successful at detecting and correcting 
80% of the repairs, without using prosodic information or a 
parser.
