We present an experimental study of how dif-
ferent features help measuring the idiomatic-
ity of noun+verb (NV) expressions in Basque.
After testing several techniques for quantify-
ing the four basic properties of multiword ex-
pressions or MWEs (institutionalization, se-
mantic non-compositionality, morphosyntac-
tic fixedness and lexical fixedness), we test
different combinations of them for classifica-
tion into idioms and collocations, using Ma-
chine Learning (ML) and feature selection.
The results show the major role of distribu-
tional similarity, which measures composi-
tionality, in the extraction and classification
of MWEs, especially, as expected, in the case
of idioms. Even though cooccurrence and
some aspects of morphosyntactic flexibility
contribute to this task in a more limited mea-
sure, ML experiments make benefit of these
sources of knowledge, allowing to improve
the results obtained using exclusively distribu-
tional similarity features.
