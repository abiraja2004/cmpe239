This paper deals with user correc-
tions and aware sites of system er-
rors in the TOOT spoken dialogue
system. We rst describe our cor-
pus, and give details on our proced-
ure to label corrections and aware
sites. Then, we show that correc-
tions and aware sites exhibit some
prosodic and other properties which
set them apart from `normal' utter-
ances. It appears that some correc-
tion types, such as simple repeats,
are more likely to be correctly recog-
nized than other types, such as para-
phrases. We also present evidence
that system dialogue strategy aects
users' choice of correction type, sug-
gesting that strategy-specic meth-
ods of detecting or coaching users on
corrections may be useful. Aware
sites tend to be shorter than other
utterances, and are also more dif-
cult to recognize correctly for the
ASR system.
