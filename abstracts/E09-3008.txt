In this article, compound processing for
translation into German in a factored sta-
tistical MT system is investigated. Com-
pounds are handled by splitting them prior
to training, and merging the parts after
translation. I have explored eight merging
strategies using different combinations of
external knowledge sources, such as word
lists, and internal sources that are carried
through the translation process, such as
symbols or parts-of-speech. I show that
for merging to be successful, some internal
knowledge source is needed. I also show
that an extra sequence model for part-of-
speech is useful in order to improve the
order of compound parts in the output.
The best merging results are achieved by a
matching scheme for part-of-speech tags.
