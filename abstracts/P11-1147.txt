Learning by Reading (LbR) aims at enabling
machines to acquire knowledge from and rea-
son about textual input. This requires knowl-
edge about the domain structure (such as en-
tities, classes, and actions) in order to do in-
ference. We present a method to infer this im-
plicit knowledge from unlabeled text. Unlike
previous approaches, we use automatically ex-
tracted classes with a probability distribution
over entities to allow for context-sensitive la-
beling. From a corpus of 1.4m sentences, we
learn about 250k simple propositions about
American football in the form of predicate-
argument structures like ?quarterbacks throw
passes to receivers?. Using several statisti-
cal measures, we show that our model is able
to generalize and explain the data statistically
significantly better than various baseline ap-
proaches. Human subjects judged up to 96.6%
of the resulting propositions to be sensible.
The classes and probabilistic model can be
used in textual enrichment to improve the per-
formance of LbR end-to-end systems.
