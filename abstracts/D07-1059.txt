A lexical analogy is a pair of word-pairs
that share a similar semantic relation. Lex-
ical analogies occur frequently in text and
are useful in various natural language pro-
cessing tasks. In this study, we present a
system that generates lexical analogies au-
tomatically from text data. Our system dis-
covers semantically related pairs of words
by using dependency relations, and applies
novel machine learning algorithms to match
these word-pairs to form lexical analogies.
Empirical evaluation shows that our system
generates valid lexical analogies with a pre-
cision of 70%, and produces quality output
although not at the level of the best human-
generated lexical analogies.
