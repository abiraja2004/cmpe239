We compare two approaches to the problem
of Textual Entailment: SLIM, a composi-
tional approach modeling the task based on
identifying relations in the entailment pair,
and BoLI, a lexical matching algorithm.
SLIM?s framework incorporates a range of
resources that solve local entailment prob-
lems. A search-based inference procedure
unifies these resources, permitting them to
interact flexibly. BoLI uses WordNet and
other lexical similarity resources to detect
correspondence between related words in
the Hypothesis and the Text. In this pa-
per we describe both systems in some detail
and evaluate their performance on the 3rd
PASCAL RTE Challenge. While the lex-
ical method outperforms the relation-based
approach, we argue that the relation-based
model offers better long-term prospects for
entailment recognition.
