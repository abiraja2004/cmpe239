The variety of engaging interactions
among users in social medial distinguishes
it from traditional Web media. Such a fea-
ture should be utilized while attempting to
provide intelligent services to social me-
dia participants. In this article, we present
a framework to recommend relevant infor-
mation in Internet forums and blogs using
user comments, one of the most represen-
tative of user behaviors in online discus-
sion. When incorporating user comments,
we consider structural, semantic, and au-
thority information carried by them. One
of the most important observation from
this work is that semantic contents of user
comments can play a fairly different role
in a different form of social media. When
designing a recommendation system for
this purpose, such a difference must be
considered with caution.
