A reading difficulty measure can be described
as a function or model that maps a text to a
numerical value corresponding to a difficulty
or grade level. We describe a measure of read-
ability that uses a combination of lexical fea-
tures and grammatical features that are derived
from subtrees of syntactic parses. We also
tested statistical models for nominal, ordinal,
and interval scales of measurement. The re-
sults indicate that a model for ordinal regres-
sion, such as the proportional odds model, us-
ing a combination of grammatical and lexical
features is most effective at predicting reading
difficulty.
