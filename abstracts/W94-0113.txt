 
W~ describe an implementation of a hybrid statisti- 
cal/symbolic approach to repairing parser failures in a 
speech-to-speech translation system. I We describe a 
rnodale which takes as input a fragmented parse and ree- 
turas a repaired meaning representation. It negotiates 
with the speaker about what the complete meaning of 
the utterance is by generating hypotheses about how 
to fit. the fragments of the partial parse together into 
a colwrcnt meaning representation. By drawing upon 
both statistical and symbolic information, it constrains 
its rcpair hypotheses to those which are both likely and 
meaningful. Because it updates its statistical model 
during use, it improves its performance over time.
