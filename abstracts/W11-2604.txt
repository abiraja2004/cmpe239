While most dialectological research so far fo-
cuses on phonetic and lexical phenomena, we
use recent fieldwork in the domain of dia-
lect syntax to guide the development of mul-
tidialectal natural language processing tools.
In particular, we develop a set of rules that
transform Standard German sentence struc-
tures into syntactically valid Swiss German
sentence structures. These rules are sensitive
to the dialect area, so that the dialects of more
than 300 towns are covered. We evaluate the
transformation rules on a Standard German
treebank and obtain accuracy figures of 85%
and above for most rules. We analyze the most
frequent errors and discuss the benefit of these
transformations for various natural language
processing tasks.
