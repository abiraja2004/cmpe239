 
This paper introduces a preliminary 
work on Hindi causative verbs: their 
classification, a linguistic model for 
their classification and their verb 
frames. The main objective of this work 
is to come up with a classification of the 
Hindi causative verbs. In the classifica-
tion we show how different types of 
Hindi verbs have different types of 
causative forms. It will be a linguistic 
resource for Hindi causative verbs 
which can be used in various NLP ap-
plications. This resource enriches the al-
ready available linguistic resource on 
Hindi verb frames (Begum et al, 
2008b). This resource will be helpful in 
getting proper insight into Hindi verbs. 
In this paper, we present the morpholo-
gy, semantics and syntax of the causa-
tive verbs. The morphology is captured 
by the word generation process; seman-
tics is captured by the linguistic model 
followed for classifying the verbs and 
the syntax has been captured by the verb 
frames using relations given by Panini.
