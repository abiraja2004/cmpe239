 
I'rel)ositional 'hrase is the key issue 
in structuraJ ambiguity, l{ecently, re- 
searches in corpora provide the lexical 
cue of pre\[)ositions with other words 
and the information could be used to 
l)artly resolve ambiguity resulted from 
prepositionM phrases. Two possible a~- 
t.achments are considered in the lit, era- 
ture: either I\]OUll attaehluelll\[, or verb 
attachment. In this paper, we con- 
sider the problem fl'om viewpoint of m~> 
chine translation. Four different attach- 
ments arc told out according to their 
\['unctiona.lity: llOU\[l attatchmellt, verb 
at.ta.clllllellt, sentence-level at t&ch lneut ,  
~md predicate-level attachtllelll,. \[~oth 
lcxi(:al k.owledge and semantic knowl- 
edge are involved resolving atta.chment 
in tl~e proposed me(:hanism, t';xperimen- 
tal results show that considering more 
types of prepositional phrases is useful 
in machine translation.
