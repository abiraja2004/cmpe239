In this paper we present a maximum en-
tropy Word Sense Disambiguation system
we developed which performs competi-
tively on SENSEVAL-2 test data for En-
glish verbs. We demonstrate that using
richer linguistic contextual features sig-
nificantly improves tagging accuracy, and
compare the system?s performance with
human annotator performance in light
of both fine-grained and coarse-grained
sense distinctions made by the sense in-
ventory.
