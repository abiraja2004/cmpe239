Over the last few years, two of the main
research directions in machine learning of
natural language processing have been the
study of semi-supervised learning algo-
rithms as a way to train classifiers when the
labeled data is scarce, and the study of ways
to exploit knowledge and global information
in structured learning tasks. In this paper,
we suggest a method for incorporating do-
main knowledge in semi-supervised learn-
ing algorithms. Our novel framework unifies
and can exploit several kinds of task specic
constraints. The experimental results pre-
sented in the information extraction domain
demonstrate that applying constraints helps
the model to generate better feedback during
learning, and hence the framework allows
for high performance learning with signif-
icantly less training data than was possible
before on these tasks.
