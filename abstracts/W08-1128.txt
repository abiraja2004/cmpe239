The GREC task of the Referring Expression
Generation Challenge 2008 is to select appro-
priate references to the main subject in given
texts. This means to select the correct type of
the referring expressions such as name, pro-
noun, common, or elision (empty). We employ
for the selection different learning techniques
with the aim to find the most appropriate one
for the task and the used attributes. As train-
ing data, we use the syntactic category of the
searched referring expressions and addition-
ally gathered data from the text itself.
