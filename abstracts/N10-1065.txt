Most state of the art approaches for machine
transliteration are data driven and require sig-
nificant parallel names corpora between lan-
guages. As a result, developing translitera-
tion functionality among n languages could
be a resource intensive task requiring paral-
lel names corpora in the order of nC2. In this
paper, we explore ways of reducing this high
resource requirement by leveraging the avail-
able parallel data between subsets of the n lan-
guages, transitively. We propose, and show
empirically, that reasonable quality transliter-
ation engines may be developed between two
languages, X and Y , even when no direct par-
allel names data exists between them, but only
transitively through language Z . Such sys-
tems alleviate the need for O(nC2) corpora,
significantly. In addition we show that the per-
formance of such transitive transliteration sys-
tems is in par with direct transliteration sys-
tems, in practical applications, such as CLIR
systems.
