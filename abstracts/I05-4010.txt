In this paper we present our recent work
on harvesting English-Chinese bitexts
of the laws of Hong Kong from the
Web and aligning them to the subpara-
graph level via utilizing the number-
ing system in the legal text hierarchy.
Basic methodology and practical tech-
niques are reported in detail. The re-
sultant bilingual corpus, 10.4M English
words and 18.3M Chinese characters,
is an authoritative and comprehensive
text collection covering the specific and
special domain of HK laws. It is par-
ticularly valuable to empirical MT re-
search. This piece of work has also laid
a foundation for exploring and harvest-
ing English-Chinese bitexts in a larger
volume from the Web.
