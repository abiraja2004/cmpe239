A key problem in document classification and
clustering is learning the similarity between
documents. Traditional approaches include
estimating similarity between feature vectors
of documents where the vectors are computed
using TF-IDF in the bag-of-words model.
However, these approaches do not work well
when either similar documents do not use the
same vocabulary or the feature vectors are not
estimated correctly.
In this paper, we represent documents and
keywords using multiple layers of connected
graphs. We pose the problem of simultane-
ously learning similarity between documents
and keyword weights as an edge-weight regu-
larization problem over the different layers of
graphs. Unlike most feature weight learning
algorithms, we propose an unsupervised algo-
rithm in the proposed framework to simulta-
neously optimize similarity and the keyword
weights. We extrinsically evaluate the perfor-
mance of the proposed similarity measure on
two different tasks, clustering and classifica-
tion. The proposed similarity measure out-
performs the similarity measure proposed by
(Muthukrishnan et al, 2010), a state-of-the-
art classification algorithm (Zhou and Burges,
2007) and three different baselines on a vari-
ety of standard, large data sets.
