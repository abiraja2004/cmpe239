We report a high-performance Chinese NER
system that incorporates Conditional Random
Fields (CRFs) and first-order logic for the fourth
SIGHAN Chinese language processing bake-
off (SIGHAN-6). Using current state-of-the-
art CRFs along with a set of well-engineered
features for Chinese NER as the base model,
we consider distinct linguistic characteristics in
Chinese named entities by introducing various
types of domain knowledge into Markov Logic
Networks (MLNs), an effective combination of
first-order logic and probabilistic graphical mod-
els for validation and error correction of enti-
ties. Our submitted results achieved consistently
high performance, including the first place on the
CityU open track and fourth place on the MSRA
open track respectively, which show both the at-
tractiveness and effectiveness of our proposed
model.
