Performing root-based searching, concordancing,
and grammar checking in Arabic requires an
efficient method for matching stems with roots and
vice versa. Such mapping is complicated by the
hundreds of manifestations of the same root. An
algorithm based on the generation method used by
native speakers is proposed here to provide a map-
ping from roots to stems. Verb roots are classified
by the types of their radicals and the stems they
generate. Roots are moulded with morphosemantic
and morphosyntactic patterns to generate stems
modified for tense, voice, and mode, and affixed
for different subject number, gender, and person.
The surface forms of applicable morphophonemic
transformations are then derived using finite state
machines. This paper defines what is meant by
?stem?, describes a stem generation engine that the
authors developed, and outlines how a generated
stem database is compiled for all Arabic verbs.
