This paper introduces a novel evaluation
framework for question series and em-
ploys it to explore the effectiveness of QA
and IR systems at addressing users? infor-
mation needs. The framework is based on
the notion of recall curves, which char-
acterize the amount of relevant informa-
tion contained within a fixed-length text
segment. Although it is widely assumed
that QA technology provides more effi-
cient access to information than IR sys-
tems, our experiments show that a simple
IR baseline is quite competitive. These re-
sults help us better understand the role of
NLP technology in QA systems and sug-
gest directions for future research.
