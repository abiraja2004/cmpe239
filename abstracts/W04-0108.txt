This paper compares two systems for computa-
tional morphological analysis of Dutch. Both
systems have been independently designed as
separate modules in the context of the FLa-
VoR project, which aims to develop a modular
architecture for automatic speech recognition.
The systems are trained and tested on the same
Dutch morphological database (CELEX), and
can thus be objectively compared as morpho-
logical analyzers in their own right.
