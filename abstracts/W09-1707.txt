 
A standard and widespread approach to 
part-of-speech tagging is based on Hidden 
Markov Models (HMMs). An alternative 
approach, pioneered by Sch?tze (1993), 
induces parts of speech from scratch using 
singular value decomposition (SVD). We 
introduce DEDICOM as an alternative to 
SVD for part-of-speech induction. 
DEDICOM retains the advantages of 
SVD in that it is completely unsupervised: 
no prior knowledge is required to induce 
either the tagset or the associations of 
types with tags. However, unlike SVD, it 
is also fully compatible with the HMM 
framework, in that it can be used to esti-
mate emission- and transition-probability 
matrices which can then be used as the 
input for an HMM. We apply the 
DEDICOM method to the CONLL corpus 
(CONLL 2000) and compare the output of 
DEDICOM to the part-of-speech tags 
given in the corpus, and find that the cor-
relation (almost 0.5) is quite high. Using 
DEDICOM, we also estimate part-of-
speech ambiguity for each type, and find 
that these estimates correlate highly with 
part-of-speech ambiguity as measured in 
the original corpus (around 0.88). Finally, 
we show how the output of DEDICOM 
can be evaluated and compared against 
the more familiar output of supervised 
HMM-based tagging.
