A number of studies have presented
machine-learning approaches to semantic
role labeling with availability of corpora
such as FrameNet and PropBank. These
corpora define the semantic roles of predi-
cates for each frame independently. Thus,
it is crucial for the machine-learning ap-
proach to generalize semantic roles across
different frames, and to increase the size
of training instances. This paper ex-
plores several criteria for generalizing se-
mantic roles in FrameNet: role hierar-
chy, human-understandable descriptors of
roles, semantic types of filler phrases, and
mappings from FrameNet roles to the-
matic roles of VerbNet. We also pro-
pose feature functions that naturally com-
bine and weight these criteria, based on
the training data. The experimental result
of the role classification shows 19.16%
and 7.42% improvements in error reduc-
tion rate and macro-averaged F1 score, re-
spectively. We also provide in-depth anal-
yses of the proposed criteria.
