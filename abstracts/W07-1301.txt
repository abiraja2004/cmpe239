We introduce the proceedings from the
workshop ?Computing and Historical Pho-
nology: 9th Meeting of the ACL Special In-
terest Group for Computational Morphology
and Phonology?.
1 Background
Historical phonology is the study of how the sounds
and sound systems of a language evolve, and in-
cludes research issues concerning the triggering of
sound changes; their temporal and geographic prop-
agation (including lexical diffusion); the regular-
ity/irregularity of sound change, and its interaction
with morphological change; the role of borrowing
and analogy in sound change; the interaction of
sound change with the phonemic system (poten-
tially promoting certain changes, but also neutral-
izing phonemic distinctions); and the detection of
these phenomena in historical documents.
There is a substantial and growing body of work
applying computational techniques of various sorts
to problems in historical phonology. We mention a
few here to give the flavor of the sort of work we
hoped to attract for presentation in a coherent SIG-
MORPHON workshop. Kessler (2001) estimates
the likelihood of chance phonemic correspondences
using permutation statistics; Kondrak (2002) devel-
ops algorithms to detect cognates and sound corre-
spondences; McMahon and McMahon (2005) and
also Nakhleh, Ringe and Warnow (2005) apply phy-
logenetic techniques to comparative reconstruction;
and Ellison and Kirby (2006) suggest means of de-
tecting relationships which do not depend on word
by word comparisons. But we likewise wished to
draw on the creativity of the computational linguis-
tics (CL) community to see which other important
problems in historical phonology might also be ad-
dressed computationally (see below).
There has recently been a good deal of computa-
tional work in historical linguistics involving phylo-
genetic inference, i.e., the inference to the genealog-
ical tree which best explains the historical develop-
ments (Gray and Atkinson, 2003; Dunn et al, 2005).
While the application of phylogenetic analysis has
not universally been welcomed with open philolog-
ical arms (Holm, 2007), it has attracted a good deal
of attention, some of which we hoped to engage. We
take no stand on these controversies here, but note
that computing may be employed in historical lin-
guistics, and in particular in historical phonology in
a more versatile way, its uses extending well beyond
phylogenetic inference.
