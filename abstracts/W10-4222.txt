Ontologies and datasets for the Semantic
Web are encoded in OWL formalisms that
are not easily comprehended by people.
To make ontologies accessible to human
domain experts, several research groups
have developed ontology verbalisers using
Natural Language Generation. In practice
ontologies are usually composed of simple
axioms, so that realising them separately
is relatively easy; there remains however
the problem of producing texts that are co-
herent and efficient. We describe in this
paper some methods for producing sen-
tences that aggregate over sets of axioms
that share the same logical structure. Be-
cause these methods are based on logical
structure rather than domain-specific con-
cepts or language-specific syntax, they are
generic both as regards domain and lan-
guage.
