We explore the idea of creating a subjectiv-
ity classifier that uses lists of subjective nouns
learned by bootstrapping algorithms. The goal
of our research is to develop a system that
can distinguish subjective sentences from ob-
jective sentences. First, we use two bootstrap-
ping algorithms that exploit extraction patterns
to learn sets of subjective nouns. Then we
train a Naive Bayes classifier using the subjec-
tive nouns, discourse features, and subjectivity
clues identified in prior research. The boot-
strapping algorithms learned over 1000 subjec-
tive nouns, and the subjectivity classifier per-
formed well, achieving 77% recall with 81%
precision.
