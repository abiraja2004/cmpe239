I present an automatic post-editing ap-
proach that combines translation systems
which produce syntactic trees as output.
The nodes in the generation tree and target-
side SCFG tree are aligned and form
the basis for computing structural similar-
ity. Structural similarity computation aligns
subtrees and based on this alignment, sub-
trees are substituted to create more accu-
rate translations. Two different techniques
have been implemented to compute struc-
tural similarity: leaves and tree-edit dis-
tance. I report on the translation quality of
a machine translation (MT) system where
both techniques are implemented. The ap-
proach shows significant improvement over
the baseline for MT systems with limited
training data and structural improvement
for MT systems trained on Europarl.
