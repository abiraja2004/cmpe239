 
Hashtags are used in Twitter to classify 
messages, propagate ideas and also to promote 
specific topics and people. In this paper, we 
present a linguistic-inspired study of how these 
tags are created, used and disseminated by the 
members of information networks. We study 
the propagation of hashtags in Twitter grounded 
on models for the analysis of the spread of 
linguistic innovations in speech communities, 
that is, in groups of people whose members 
linguistically influence each other. Differently 
from traditional linguistic studies, though, we 
consider the evolution of terms in a live and 
rapidly evolving stream of content, which can 
be analyzed in its entirety. In our experimental 
results, using a large collection crawled from 
Twitter, we were able to identify some 
interesting aspects ? similar to those found in 
studies of (offline) speech ? that led us to 
believe that hashtags may effectively serve as 
models for characterizing the propagation of 
linguistic forms, including: (1) the existence of 
a ?preferential attachment process?, that makes 
the few most common terms ever more popular, 
and (2) the relationship between the length of a 
tag and its frequency of use. The understanding 
of formation patterns of successful hashtags in 
Twitter can be useful to increase the 
effectiveness of real-time streaming search 
algorithms.
