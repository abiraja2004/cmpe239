This paper proposes a method to auto-
matically construct Japanese nominal case
frames. The point of our method is the in-
tegrated use of a dictionary and example
phrases from large corpora. To examine the
practical usefulness of the constructed nom-
inal case frames, we also built a system of
indirect anaphora resolution based on the
case frames. The constructed case frames
were evaluated by hand, and were confirmed
to be good quality. Experimental results of
indirect anaphora resolution also indicated
the effectiveness of our approach.
