We demonstrate DUDE1 (Dialogue
and Understanding Development En-
vironment), a prototype development
environment that automatically generates
dialogue systems from business-user
resources and databases. These generated
spoken dialogue systems (SDS) are then
deployed on an industry standard Voice
XML platform. Specifically, the deployed
system works by dynamically generating
context-sensitive Voice XML pages. The
dialogue move of each page is determined
in real time by the dialogue manager,
which is an Information State Update
engine. Firstly, we will demonstrate the
development environment which includes
automatic generation of speech recogni-
tion grammars for robust interpretation of
spontaneous speech, and uses the appli-
cation database to generate lexical entries
and grammar rules. A simple graphical
interface allows users (i.e. developers) to
easily and quickly create and the modify
SDS without the need for expensive
service providers. Secondly, we will
demonstrate the deployed system which
enables participants to call up and speak
to the SDS recently created. We will also
show a pre-built application running on
the iPhone and Google Android phone for
searching for places such as restaurants,
hotels and museums.
