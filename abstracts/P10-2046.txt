Researchers in textual entailment have
begun to consider inferences involving
downward-entailing operators, an inter-
esting and important class of lexical items
that change the way inferences are made.
Recent work proposed a method for learn-
ing English downward-entailing operators
that requires access to a high-quality col-
lection of negative polarity items (NPIs).
However, English is one of the very few
languages for which such a list exists. We
propose the first approach that can be ap-
plied to the many languages for which
there is no pre-existing high-precision
database of NPIs. As a case study, we
apply our method to Romanian and show
that our method yields good results. Also,
we perform a cross-linguistic analysis that
suggests interesting connections to some
findings in linguistic typology.
