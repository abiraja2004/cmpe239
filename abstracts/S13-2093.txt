The widespread use of Twitter makes it very
interesting to determine the opinions and the
sentiments expressed by its users. The short-
ness of the length and the highly informal na-
ture of tweets render it very difficult to auto-
matically detect such information. This paper
reports the results to a challenge, set forth by
SemEval-2013 Task 2, to determine the posi-
tive, neutral, or negative sentiments of tweets.
Two systems are explained: System A for de-
termining the sentiment of a phrase within a
tweet and System B for determining the senti-
ment of a tweet. Both approaches rely on rich
feature sets, which are explained in detail.
