This paper presents an improved formally
syntax-based SMT model, which is enriched
by linguistically syntactic knowledge obtained
from statistical constituent parsers. We pro-
pose a linguistically-motivated prior deriva-
tion model to score hypothesis derivations on
top of the baseline model during the trans-
lation decoding. Moreover, we devise a
fast training algorithm to achieve such im-
proved models based on tree kernel meth-
ods. Experiments on an English-to-Chinese
task demonstrate that our proposed models
outperformed the baseline formally syntax-
based models, while both of them achieved
significant improvements over a state-of-the-
art phrase-based SMT system.
