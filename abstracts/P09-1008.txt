Freer-word-order languages such as Ger-
man exhibit linguistic phenomena that
present unique challenges to traditional
CFG parsing. Such phenomena produce
discontinuous constituents, which are not
naturally modelled by projective phrase
structure trees. In this paper, we exam-
ine topological field parsing, a shallow
form of parsing which identifies the ma-
jor sections of a sentence in relation to
the clausal main verb and the subordinat-
ing heads. We report the results of topo-
logical field parsing of German using the
unlexicalized, latent variable-based Berke-
ley parser (Petrov et al, 2006) Without
any language- or model-dependent adapta-
tion, we achieve state-of-the-art results on
the Tu?Ba-D/Z corpus, and a modified NE-
GRA corpus that has been automatically
annotated with topological fields (Becker
and Frank, 2002). We also perform a qual-
itative error analysis of the parser output,
and discuss strategies to further improve
the parsing results.
