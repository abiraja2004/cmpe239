In this paper we describe a conversion of
the Buckwalter Morphological Analyzer for
Arabic, originally written as a Perl-script,
into a pure finite-state morphological ana-
lyzer. Representing a morphological ana-
lyzer as a finite-state transducer (FST) con-
fers many advantages over running a procedu-
ral affix-matching algorithm. Apart from ap-
plication speed, an FST representation imme-
diately offers various possibilities to flexibly
modify a grammar. In the case of Arabic, this
is illustrated through the addition of the abil-
ity to correctly parse partially vocalized forms
without overgeneration, something not possi-
ble in the original analyzer, as well as to serve
both as an analyzer and a generator.
