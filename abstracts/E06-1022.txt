We present results on addressee identifica-
tion in four-participants face-to-face meet-
ings using Bayesian Network and Naive
Bayes classifiers. First, we investigate
how well the addressee of a dialogue
act can be predicted based on gaze, ut-
terance and conversational context fea-
tures. Then, we explore whether informa-
tion about meeting context can aid classi-
fiers? performances. Both classifiers per-
form the best when conversational context
and utterance features are combined with
speaker?s gaze information. The classifiers
show little gain from information about
meeting context.
