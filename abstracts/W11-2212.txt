Recent years? most efficient approaches for
language understanding are statistical. These
approaches benefit from a segmental semantic
annotation of corpora. To reduce the produc-
tion cost of such corpora, this paper proposes
a method that is able to match first identified
concepts with word sequences in an unsuper-
vised way. This method based on automatic
alignment is used by an understanding sys-
tem based on conditional random fields and
is evaluated on a spoken dialogue task using
either manual or automatic transcripts.
