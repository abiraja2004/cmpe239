 
The latest discoveries on diseases and their di-
agnosis/treatment are mostly disseminated in 
the form of scientific publications. However, 
with the rapid growth of the biomedical litera-
ture and a high level of variation and ambigui-
ty in disease names, the task of retrieving 
disease-related articles becomes increasingly 
challenging using the traditional keyword-
based approach. An important first step for 
any disease-related information extraction 
task in the biomedical literature is the disease 
mention recognition task. However, despite 
the strong interest, there has not been enough 
work done on disease name identification, 
perhaps because of the difficulty in obtaining 
adequate corpora. Towards this aim, we creat-
ed a large-scale disease corpus consisting of 
6900 disease mentions in 793 PubMed cita-
tions, derived from an earlier corpus. Our cor-
pus contains rich annotations, was developed 
by a team of 12 annotators (two people per 
annotation) and covers all sentences in a 
PubMed abstract. Disease mentions are cate-
gorized into Specific Disease, Disease Class, 
Composite Mention and Modifier categories. 
When used as the gold standard data for a 
state-of-the-art machine-learning approach, 
significantly higher performance can be found 
on our corpus than the previous one. Such 
characteristics make this disease name corpus 
a valuable resource for mining disease-related 
information from biomedical text. The NCBI 
corpus is available for download at
