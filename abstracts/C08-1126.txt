This paper presents an approach for sub-
stantially reducing the time needed to cal-
culate the shortest paths between all con-
cepts in a wordnet. The algorithm exploits
the unique ?star-like? topology of word-
nets to cut down on time-expensive calcu-
lations performed by algorithms to solve
the all-pairs shortest path problem in gen-
eral graphs. The algorithm was applied to
two wordnets of two different languages:
Princeton WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) for
English, and GermaNet (Kunze and Lem-
nitzer, 2002), the German language word-
net. For both wordnets, the time needed
for finding all shortest paths was brought
down from several days to a matter of
minutes.
