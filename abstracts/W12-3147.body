This paper describes the development of
French?English and English?French statisti-
cal machine translation systems for the 2012
WMT shared task evaluation. We developed
phrase-based systems based on the Moses de-
coder, trained on the provided data only. Ad-
ditionally, new features this year included im-
proved language and translation model adap-
tation using the cross-entropy score for the
corpus selection.
