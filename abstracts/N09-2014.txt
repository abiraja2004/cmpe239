We investigate natural language understand-
ing of partial speech recognition results to
equip a dialogue system with incremental lan-
guage processing capabilities for more realis-
tic human-computer conversations. We show
that relatively high accuracy can be achieved
in understanding of spontaneous utterances
before utterances are completed.
