Mining parallel data from comparable corpora
is a promising approach for overcoming the
data sparseness in statistical machine trans-
lation and other NLP applications. Even if
two comparable documents have few or no
parallel sentence pairs, there is still poten-
tial for parallelism in the sub-sentential level.
The ability to detect these phrases creates a
valuable resource, especially for low-resource
languages. In this paper we explore three
phrase alignment approaches to detect paral-
lel phrase pairs embedded in comparable sen-
tences: the standard phrase extraction algo-
rithm, which relies on the Viterbi path; a
phrase extraction approach that does not rely
on the Viterbi path, but uses only lexical fea-
tures; and a binary classifier that detects par-
allel phrase pairs when presented with a large
collection of phrase pair candidates. We eval-
uate the effectiveness of these approaches in
detecting alignments for phrase pairs that have
a known alignment in comparable sentence
pairs. The results show that the Non-Viterbi
alignment approach outperforms the other two
approaches on F1 measure.
