It is well known that pragmatic knowl-
edge is useful and necessary in many dif-
ficult language processing tasks, but be-
cause this knowledge is difficult to acquire
and process automatically, it is rarely used.
We present an open information extrac-
tion technique for automatically extracting
a particular kind of pragmatic knowledge
from text, and we show how to integrate
the knowledge into a Markov Logic Net-
work model for quantifier scope disam-
biguation. Our model improves quantifier
scope judgments in experiments.
