 
The increasing use of large open-domain 
document sources is exacerbating the 
problem of ambiguity in named entities.  
This paper explores the use of a range of 
syntactic and semantic features in unsu-
pervised clustering of documents that re-
sult from ad hoc queries containing names. 
From these experiments, we find that the 
use of robust syntactic and semantic fea-
tures can significantly improve the state of 
the art for disambiguation performance for 
personal names for both Chinese and Eng-
lish.
