 
This paper is to describe our machine transla-
tion evaluation systems used for participation 
in the WMT13 shared Metrics Task. In the 
Metrics task, we submitted two automatic MT 
evaluation systems nLEPOR_baseline and 
LEPOR_v3.1. nLEPOR_baseline is an n-gram 
based language independent MT evaluation 
metric employing the factors of modified sen-
tence length penalty, position difference penal-
ty, n-gram precision and n-gram recall. 
nLEPOR_baseline measures the similarity of 
the system output translations and the refer-
ence translations only on word sequences. 
LEPOR_v3.1 is a new version of LEPOR met-
ric using the mathematical harmonic mean to 
group the factors and employing some linguis-
tic features, such as the part-of-speech infor-
mation. The evaluation results of WMT13 
show LEPOR_v3.1 yields the highest average-
score 0.86 with human judgments at system-
level using Pearson correlation criterion on 
English-to-other (FR, DE, ES, CS, RU) lan-
guage pairs.
