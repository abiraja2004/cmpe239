Multi-source statistical machine transla-
tion is the process of generating a single
translation from multiple inputs. Previous
work has focused primarily on selecting
from potential outputs of separate transla-
tion systems, and solely on multi-parallel
corpora and test sets. We demonstrate how
multi-source translation can be adapted for
multiple monolingual inputs. We also ex-
amine different approaches to dealing with
multiple sources, including consensus de-
coding, and we present a novel method
of input combination to generate lattices
for multi-source translation within a single
translation model.
