In this paper, we present a phrase ex-
traction algorithm using a translation lex-
icon, a fertility model, and a simple dis-
tortion model. Except these models, we
do not need explicit word alignments for
phrase extraction. For each phrase pair (a
block), a bilingual lexicon based score is
computed to estimate the translation qual-
ity between the source and target phrase
pairs; a fertility score is computed to es-
timate how good the lengths are matched
between phrase pairs; a center distortion
score is computed to estimate the relative
position divergence between the phrase
pairs. We presented the results and our
experience in the shared tasks on French-
English.
