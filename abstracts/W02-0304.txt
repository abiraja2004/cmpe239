We propose two internal methods for ac-
centing unknown words, which both learn
on a reference set of accented words the
contexts of occurrence of the various ac-
cented forms of a given letter. One method
is adapted from POS tagging, the other is
based on finite state transducers.
We show experimental results for letter
e on the French version of the Medical
Subject Headings thesaurus. With the
best training set, the tagging method ob-
tains a precision-recall breakeven point
of 84.24.4% and the transducer method
83.84.5% (with a baseline at 64%) for
the unknown words that contain this let-
ter. A consensus combination of both in-
creases precision to 92.03.7% with a re-
call of 75%. We perform an error analysis
and discuss further steps that might help
improve over the current performance.
