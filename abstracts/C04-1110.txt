We present a novel approach to spoken dialogue
summarization. Our system employs a set of
semantic similarity metrics using the noun por-
tion of WordNet as a knowledge source. So far,
the noun senses have been disambiguated man-
ually. The algorithm aims to extract utterances
carrying the essential content of dialogues. We
evaluate the system on 20 Switchboard dia-
logues. The results show that our system out-
performs LEAD, RANDOM and TF*IDF base-
lines.
