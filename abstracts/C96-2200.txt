 
This paper is about the modification of KMP 
(Knuth, Morris and Pratt) algorithm for string 
searching of Chinese text. The difficulty is searching 
through a text string of single- and multi-byte 
characters. We showed that proper decoding of the 
input as sequences of characters instead of bytes is 
necessary. The standard KMP algorithm can easily be 
modified for Chinese string searching but at the 
worst-case time-complexity of O(3n) in terms of the 
number of comparisons. The finite-automaton 
implementation can achieve worst-case time 
complexity of O(2n) but constructing the transition 
table depends on the size of the alphabet, Z, which is 
large for Chinese (for Big-5, Z > 13,000). A mapping 
technique reduces the size the alphabet to at most IPI 
where P is the pattern string.
