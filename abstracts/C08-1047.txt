This paper describes a system for process-
ing economic documents written in the an-
cient Sumerian language. The system is
application-oriented and takes advantage
of the simplicity of ancient economy. We
have developed an ontology for a selected
branch of economic activities. We trans-
late the documents into a meaning repre-
sentation language by means of a semantic
grammar. The meaning representation lan-
guage is constructed in a way that allows
us to handle massive ambiguity caused by:
the specifics of the Sumerian writing sys-
tem (signs? polyvalence, lack of mid-word
signs), our incomplete knowledge of the
Sumerian language and frequent damages
of documents. The system is augmented
with the capability of processing docu-
ments whose parts describe concepts not
included in the ontology and grammar. As
an effect we obtain a structural description
of the documents contents in the mean-
ing representation language, ready to use
in historical research.
