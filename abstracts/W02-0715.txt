 
We propose a test set selection method to 
sensitively evaluate the performance of a 
speech translation system. The proposed 
method chooses the most sensitive test 
sentences by removing insensitive 
sentences iteratively. Experiments are 
conducted on the ATR-MATRIX speech 
translation system, developed at ATR 
Interpreting Telecommunications 
Research Laboratories. The results show 
the effectiveness of the proposed method. 
According to the results, the proposed 
method can reduce the test set size to less 
than 40% of the original size while 
improving evaluation reliability.
