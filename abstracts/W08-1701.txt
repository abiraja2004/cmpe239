In this paper, we present an open-source
parsing environment (Tu?bingen Linguistic
Parsing Architecture, TuLiPA) which uses
Range Concatenation Grammar (RCG)
as a pivot formalism, thus opening the
way to the parsing of several mildly
context-sensitive formalisms. This en-
vironment currently supports tree-based
grammars (namely Tree-Adjoining Gram-
mars (TAG) and Multi-Component Tree-
Adjoining Grammars with Tree Tuples
(TT-MCTAG)) and allows computation not
only of syntactic structures, but also of the
corresponding semantic representations. It
is used for the development of a tree-based
grammar for German.
