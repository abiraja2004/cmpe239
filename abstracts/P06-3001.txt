 
Natural Language Generation (NLG) is a 
way to automatically realize a correct ex-
pression in response to a communicative 
goal. This technology is mainly explored 
in the fields of machine translation, re-
port generation, dialog system etc. In this 
paper we have explored the NLG tech-
nique for another novel application-
assisting disabled children to take part in 
conversation. The limited physical ability 
and mental maturity of our intended users 
made the NLG approach different from 
others. We have taken a flexible ap-
proach where main emphasis is given on 
flexibility and usability of the system. 
The evaluation results show this tech-
nique can increase the communication 
rate of users during a conversation.
