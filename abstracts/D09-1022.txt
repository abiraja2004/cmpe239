In this work, we propose two extensions of
standard word lexicons in statistical ma-
chine translation: A discriminative word
lexicon that uses sentence-level source in-
formation to predict the target words and
a trigger-based lexicon model that extends
IBM model 1 with a second trigger, allow-
ing for a more fine-grained lexical choice
of target words. The models capture de-
pendencies that go beyond the scope of
conventional SMT models such as phrase-
and language models. We show that the
models improve translation quality by 1%
in BLEU over a competitive baseline on a
large-scale task.
