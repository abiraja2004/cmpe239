We explore training an automatic modality
tagger. Modality is the attitude that a speaker
might have toward an event or state. One of
the main hurdles for training a linguistic tag-
ger is gathering training data. This is par-
ticularly problematic for training a tagger for
modality because modality triggers are sparse
for the overwhelming majority of sentences.
We investigate an approach to automatically
training a modality tagger where we first gath-
ered sentences based on a high-recall simple
rule-based modality tagger and then provided
these sentences to Mechanical Turk annotators
for further annotation. We used the resulting
set of training data to train a precise modality
tagger using a multi-class SVM that delivers
good performance.
