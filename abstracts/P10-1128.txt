This paper proposes an approach to ref-
erence resolution in situated dialogues
by exploiting extra-linguistic information.
Recently, investigations of referential be-
haviours involved in situations in the real
world have received increasing attention
by researchers (Di Eugenio et al, 2000;
Byron, 2005; van Deemter, 2007; Spanger
et al, 2009). In order to create an accurate
reference resolution model, we need to
handle extra-linguistic information as well
as textual information examined by exist-
ing approaches (Soon et al, 2001; Ng and
Cardie, 2002, etc.). In this paper, we incor-
porate extra-linguistic information into an
existing corpus-based reference resolution
model, and investigate its effects on refer-
ence resolution problems within a corpus
of Japanese dialogues. The results demon-
strate that our proposed model achieves an
accuracy of 79.0% for this task.
