In this paper we describe the three approaches
we submitted to the Semantic Textual Similar-
ity task of SemEval 2012. The first approach
considers to calculate the semantic similar-
ity by using the Jaccard coefficient with term
expansion using synonyms. The second ap-
proach uses the semantic similarity reported
by Mihalcea in (Mihalcea et al, 2006). The
third approach employs Random Indexing and
Bag of Concepts based on context vectors. We
consider that the first and third approaches ob-
tained a comparable performance, meanwhile
the second approach got a very poor behav-
ior. The best ALL result was obtained with
the third approach, with a Pearson correlation
equal to 0.663.
