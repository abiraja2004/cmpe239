The Japanese WordNet currently has
51,000 synsets with Japanese entries. In
this paper, we discuss three methods of
extending it: increasing the cover, linking
it to examples in corpora and linking it
to other resources (SUMO and GoiTaikei).
In addition, we outline our plans to make
it more useful by adding Japanese defini-
tion sentences to each synset. Finally, we
discuss how releasing the corpus under an
open license has led to the construction
of interfaces in a variety of programming
languages.
