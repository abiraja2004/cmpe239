This paper describes the implementa-
tion of our system at CLP 2010 bake-
off of Chinese word sense induction.
We first extract the triplets for the tar-
get word in each sentence, then use
the intersection of all related words of
these triplets from the Internet. We
use the related word to construct fea-
ture vectors for the sentence. At last
we discriminate the word senses by
clustering the sentences. Our system
achieved 77.88% F-score under the of-
ficial evaluation.
