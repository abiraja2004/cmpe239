The idea of the Whiteboard project is to integrate
deep and shallow natural language processing
components in order to benefit from their synergy.
The project came up with the first fully integrated
hybrid system consisting of a fast HPSG parser that
utilizes tokenization, PoS, morphology, lexical,
named entity, phrase chunk and (for German)
topological sentence field analyses from shallow
components. This integration increases robustness,
directs the search space and hence reduces
processing time of the deep parser. In this paper, we
focus on one of the central integration facilities, the
XSLT-based Whiteboard Annotation Transformer
(WHAT), report on the benefits of XSLT-based
NLP component integration, and present examples
of XSL transformation of shallow and deep
annotations used in the integrated architecture. The
infrastructure is open, portable and well suited for,
but not restricted to the development of hybrid NLP
architectures as well as NLP applications.
