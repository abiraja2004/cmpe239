We propose a method for automatically la-
belling topics learned via LDA topic models.
We generate our label candidate set from the
top-ranking topic terms, titles of Wikipedia ar-
ticles containing the top-ranking topic terms,
and sub-phrases extracted from the Wikipedia
article titles. We rank the label candidates us-
ing a combination of association measures and
lexical features, optionally fed into a super-
vised ranking model. Our method is shown to
perform strongly over four independent sets of
topics, significantly better than a benchmark
method.
