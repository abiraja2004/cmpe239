This work represents an initial attempt to
move beyond ?single-shot? summarization to
interactive summarization. We present an ex-
tension to the classic Maximal Marginal Rel-
evance (MMR) algorithm that places a user
?in the loop? to assist in candidate selec-
tion. Experiments in the complex interac-
tive Question Answering (ciQA) task at TREC
2007 show that interactively-constructed re-
sponses are significantly higher in quality than
automatically-generated ones. This novel al-
gorithm provides a starting point for future
work on interactive summarization.
