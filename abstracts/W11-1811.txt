This paper summarizes the Protein Coref-
erence Resolution task of BioNLP Shared
Task 2011. After 7 weeks of system devel-
opment period, the task received final sub-
missions from 6 teams. Evaluation results
show that state-of-the-art performance on the
task can find 22.18% of protein coreferences
with the precision of 73.26%. Analysis of
the submissions shows that several types of
anaphoric expressions including definite ex-
pressions, which occupies a significant part of
the problem, have not yet been solved.
