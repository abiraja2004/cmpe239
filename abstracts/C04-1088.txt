 
The identification of authorship falls into the 
category of style classification, an interesting 
sub-field of text categorization that deals with 
properties of the form of linguistic expression 
as opposed to the content of a text. Various fea-
ture sets and classification methods have been 
proposed in the literature, geared towards ab-
stracting away from the content of a text, and 
focusing on its stylistic properties. We demon-
strate that in a realistically difficult authorship 
attribution scenario, deep linguistic analysis 
features such as context free production fre-
quencies and semantic relationship frequencies 
achieve significant error reduction over more 
commonly used ?shallow? features such as 
function word frequencies and part of speech 
trigrams. Modern machine learning techniques 
like support vector machines allow us to ex-
plore large feature vectors, combining these dif-
ferent feature sets to achieve high classification 
accuracy in style-based tasks.
