Linking constructions involving { (DE) are ubiq-
uitous in Chinese, and can be translated into En-
glish in many different ways. This is a major source
of machine translation error, even when syntax-
sensitive translation models are used. This paper
explores how getting more information about the
syntactic, semantic, and discourse context of uses
of { (DE) can facilitate producing an appropriate
English translation strategy. We describe a finer-
grained classification of { (DE) constructions in
Chinese NPs, construct a corpus of annotated ex-
amples, and then train a log-linear classifier, which
contains linguistically inspired features. We use the
DE classifier to preprocess MT data by explicitly
labeling { (DE) constructions, as well as reorder-
ing phrases, and show that our approach provides
significant BLEU point gains on MT02 (+1.24),
MT03 (+0.88) and MT05 (+1.49) on a phrased-
based system. The improvement persists when a hi-
erarchical reordering model is applied.
