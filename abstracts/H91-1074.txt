 
Relating the intonational characteristics of an utter- 
ance to other features inferable from its text is impor-  
tant both for speech recognition and for speech syn- 
thesis. This work investigates techniques for predicting 
the location of intonational phrase boundaries in natural  
speech, through analyzing a utterances from the DARPA 
Air Travel Information Service database. For statistical 
modeling, we employ Classification and Regression Tree 
(CART)  techniques. We achieve success rates of  just  
over 90%.
