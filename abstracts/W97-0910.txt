 
We describe two methods relevant to multi- 
lingual machine translation systems, which 
can be used to port linguistic data (gram- 
mars, lexicons and transfer rules) be- 
tween systems used for processing related 
languages. The methods are fully im- 
plemented within the Spoken Language 
Translator system, and were used to create 
versions of the system for two new language 
pairs using only a month of expert effort.
