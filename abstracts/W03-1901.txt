This paper describes the outline of a lin-
guistic annotation framework under de-
velopment by ISO TC37 SC WG1-1. This
international standard provides an archi-
tecture for the creation, annotation, and
manipulation of linguistic resources and
processing software. The goal is to pro-
vide maximum flexibility for encoders
and annotators, while at the same time
enabling interchange and re-use of anno-
tated linguistic resources. We describe
here the outline of the standard for the
purposes of enabling annotators to begin
to explore how their schemes may map
into the framework.
