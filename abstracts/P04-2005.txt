We present a novel approach for auto-
matically acquiring English topic sig-
natures. Given a particular concept,
or word sense, a topic signature is a
set of words that tend to co-occur with
it. Topic signatures can be useful in a
number of Natural Language Process-
ing (NLP) applications, such as Word
Sense Disambiguation (WSD) and Text
Summarisation. Our method takes ad-
vantage of the different way in which
word senses are lexicalised in English
and Chinese, and also exploits the large
amount of Chinese text available in cor-
pora and on the Web. We evaluated the
topic signatures on a WSD task, where
we trained a second-order vector co-
occurrence algorithm on standard WSD
datasets, with promising results.
