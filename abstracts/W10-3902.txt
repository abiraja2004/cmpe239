In this paper, we propose a method that
clearly separates terms (words and de-
pendency relations) in a natural language
query into important and other terms, and
differently handles the terms according to
their importance. The proposed method
uses three types of term importance: nec-
essary, optional, and unnecessary. The
importance are detected using linguistic
clues. We evaluated the proposed method
using a test collection for Japanese infor-
mation retrieval. Performance was resul-
tantly improved by differently handling
terms according to their importance.
