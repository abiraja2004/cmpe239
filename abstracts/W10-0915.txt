One of the main bottlenecks in natural lan-
guage processing is the lack of a comprehen-
sive lexicalized relation resource that contains
fine grained knowledge on predicates. In this
paper, we present PRISMATIC, a large scale
lexicalized relation resource that is automati-
cally created over 30 gb of text. Specifically,
we describe what kind of information is col-
lected in PRISMATIC and how it compares
with existing lexical resources. Our main fo-
cus has been on building the infrastructure and
gathering the data. Although we are still in
the early stages of applying PRISMATIC to
a wide variety of applications, we believe the
resource will be of tremendous value for AI
researchers, and we discuss some of potential
applications in this paper.
