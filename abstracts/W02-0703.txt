 
In this paper, we describe a novel 
approach to spoken language analysis 
for translation, which uses a combination 
of grammar-based phrase-level parsing 
and automatic classification. The job of 
the analyzer is to produce a shallow 
semantic interlingua representation for 
spoken task-oriented utterances. The 
goal of our hybrid approach is to provide 
accurate real-time analyses while 
improving robustness and portability to 
new domains and languages.
