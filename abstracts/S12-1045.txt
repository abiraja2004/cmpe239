Automatic detection of negation cues along
with their scope and corresponding negated
events is an important task that could bene-
fit other natural language processing (NLP)
tasks such as extraction of factual information
from text, sentiment analysis, etc. This paper
presents a system for this task that exploits
phrasal and contextual clues apart from vari-
ous token specific features. The system was
developed for the participation in the Task 1
(closed track) of the *SEM 2012 Shared Task
(Resolving the Scope and Focus of Negation),
where it is ranked 3rd among the participating
teams while attaining the highest F1 score for
negation cue detection.
