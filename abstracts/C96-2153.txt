 
The paper describes a system which uses 
packed parser output directly to build 
semantic representations. More specifi- 
cally, the system takes as input Packed 
Shared Forests in the sense of Tomita 
(l_bmita, 1985) and produces packed 
Underspeeified Discourse Representation 
Structures. The algorithm visits every 
node in the Parse Forest only a bounded 
number of times, so that a significant in- 
crease in efficiency is registered for am- 
biguous sentences.
