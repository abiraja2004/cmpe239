 
Motivated by Google Sets, we study the prob-
lem of growing related words from a single 
seed word by leveraging user behaviors hiding 
in user records of Chinese input method. Our 
proposed method is motivated by the observa-
tion that the more frequently two words co-
occur in user records, the more related they are. 
First, we utilize user behaviors to generate 
candidate words. Then, we utilize search en-
gine to enrich candidate words with adequate 
semantic features. Finally, we reorder candi-
date words according to their semantic rela-
tedness to the seed word. Experimental results 
on a Chinese input method dataset show that 
our method gains better performance.
