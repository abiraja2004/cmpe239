Current statistical speech translation ap-
proaches predominantly rely on just text tran-
scripts and do not adequately utilize the
rich contextual information such as conveyed
through prosody and discourse function. In
this paper, we explore the role of context char-
acterized through dialog acts (DAs) in statis-
tical translation. We demonstrate the integra-
tion of the dialog acts in a phrase-based statis-
tical translation framework, employing 3 lim-
ited domain parallel corpora (Farsi-English,
Japanese-English and Chinese-English). For
all three language pairs, in addition to produc-
ing interpretable DA enriched target language
translations, we also obtain improvements in
terms of objective evaluation metrics such as
lexical selection accuracy and BLEU score.
