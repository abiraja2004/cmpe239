This paper makes two contributions to the
area of single-word based word alignment for
bilingual sentence pairs. Firstly, it integrates
the ? seemingly rather different ? works of
(Bodrumlu et al, 2009) and the standard prob-
abilistic ones into a single framework.
Secondly, we present two algorithms to opti-
mize the arising task. The first is an iterative
scheme similar to Viterbi training, able to han-
dle large tasks. The second is based on the in-
exact solution of an integer program. While it
can handle only small corpora, it allows more
insight into the quality of the model and the
performance of the iterative scheme.
Finally, we present an alternative way to
handle prior dictionary knowledge and dis-
cuss connections to computing IBM-3 Viterbi
alignments.
