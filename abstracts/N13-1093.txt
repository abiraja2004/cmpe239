This paper presents an approach that exploits
the scope of negation cues for relation extrac-
tion (RE) without the need of using any specif-
ically annotated dataset for building a separate
negation scope detection classifier. New fea-
tures are proposed which are used in two dif-
ferent stages. These also include non-target
entity specific features. The proposed RE ap-
proach outperforms the previous state of the
art for drug-drug interaction (DDI) extraction.
