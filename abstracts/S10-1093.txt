This document describes the prelimi-
nary release of the integrated Kyoto sys-
tem for specific domain WSD. The sys-
tem uses concept miners (Tybots) to ex-
tract domain-related terms and produces
a domain-related thesaurus, followed by
knowledge-based WSD based on word-
net graphs (UKB). The resulting system
can be applied to any language with a
lexical knowledge base, and is based on
publicly available software and resources.
Our participation in Semeval task #17 fo-
cused on producing running systems for
all languages in the task, and we attained
good results in all except Chinese. Due
to the pressure of the time-constraints in
the competition, the system is still under
development, and we expect results to im-
prove in the near future.
