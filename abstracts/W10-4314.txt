 Temporal analysis of events is a central problem in computational models of dis-course. However, correctly recognizing temporal aspects of events poses serious challenges. This paper introduces a joint modeling framework and feature set for temporal analysis of events that utilizes Markov Logic. The feature set includes novel features derived from lexical on-tologies. An evaluation suggests that in-troducing lexical relation features im-proves the overall accuracy of temporal relation models. 1
