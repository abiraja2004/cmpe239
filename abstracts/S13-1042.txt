Social scientists are increasingly using the
vast amount of text available on social me-
dia to measure variation in happiness and
other psychological states. Such studies count
words deemed to be indicators of happiness
and track how the word frequencies change
across locations or time. This word count ap-
proach is simple and scalable, yet often picks
up false signals, as words can appear in differ-
ent contexts and take on different meanings.
We characterize the types of errors that occur
using the word count approach, and find lex-
ical ambiguity to be the most prevalent. We
then show that one can reduce error with a
simple refinement to such lexica by automat-
ically eliminating highly ambiguous words.
The resulting refined lexica improve precision
as measured by human judgments of word oc-
currences in Facebook posts.
