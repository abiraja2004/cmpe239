Entropy Guided Transformation Learning
(ETL) is a new machine learning strategy
that combines the advantages of decision
trees (DT) and Transformation Based Learn-
ing (TBL). In this work, we apply the ETL
framework to four phrase chunking tasks: Por-
tuguese noun phrase chunking, English base
noun phrase chunking, English text chunking
and Hindi text chunking. In all four tasks,
ETL shows better results than Decision Trees
and also than TBL with hand-crafted tem-
plates. ETL provides a new training strat-
egy that accelerates transformation learning.
For the English text chunking task this corre-
sponds to a factor of five speedup. For Por-
tuguese noun phrase chunking, ETL shows the
best reported results for the task. For the other
three linguistic tasks, ETL shows state-of-the-
art competitive results and maintains the ad-
vantages of using a rule based system.
