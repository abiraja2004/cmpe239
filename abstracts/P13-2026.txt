The pyramid method for content evaluation of auto-
mated summarizers produces scores that are shown
to correlate well with manual scores used in edu-

motivates the development of a more accurate auto-
mated method to compute pyramid scores. Of three
methods tested here, the one that performs best re-
lies on latent semantics.
