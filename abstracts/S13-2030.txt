 
This paper describes the XLING system partici-
pation in SemEval-2013 Crosslingual Word 
Sense Disambiguation task. The XLING system 
introduces a novel approach to skip the sense 
disambiguation step by matching query sentenc-
es to sentences in a parallel corpus using topic 
models; it returns the word alignments as the 
translation for the target polysemous words. 
Although, the topic-model base matching under-
performed, the matching approach showed po-
tential in the simple cosine-based surface simi-
larity matching.
