We describe a simple unsupervised technique
for learning morphology by identifying hubs
in an automaton.  For our purposes, a hub is a
node in a graph with in-degree greater than
one and out-degree greater than one.   We cre-
ate a word-trie, transform it into a minimal
DFA, then identify hubs.  Those hubs mark
the boundary between root and suffix,
achieving similar performance to more com-
plex mixtures of techniques.
