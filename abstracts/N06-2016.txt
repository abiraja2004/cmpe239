 
Cross-language retrieval of spontaneous 
speech combines the challenges of working 
with noisy automated transcription and lan-
guage translation. The CLEF 2005 Cross-
Language Speech Retrieval (CL-SR) task 
provides a standard test collection to inves-
tigate these challenges. We show that we 
can improve retrieval performance: by care-
ful selection of the term weighting scheme; 
by decomposing automated transcripts into 
phonetic substrings to help ameliorate tran-
scription errors; and by combining auto-
matic transcriptions with manually-assigned 
metadata. We further show that topic trans-
lation with online machine translation re-
sources yields effective CL-SR.
