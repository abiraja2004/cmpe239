 
This paper describes measures for evaluating the 
three determinants of how well a probabilistic elas- 
sifter performs on a given test set. These determi- 
nants are the appropriateness, for the test set, of 
the results of (1)feature selection, (2) formulation 
of the parametric form of the model, and (3) pa- 
rameter estimation. These are part of any model 
formulation procedure, even if not broken out as 
separate steps, so the tradeoffs explored in this 
paper are relevant o a wide variety of methods. 
The measures are demonstrated in a large experi- 
ment, in which they are used to analyze the results 
of roughly 300 classifiers that perform word-sense 
disambiguation.
