We describe iNeATS ? an interactive
multi-document summarization system
that integrates a state-of-the-art summa-
rization engine with an advanced user in-
terface. Three main goals of the sys-
tem are: (1) provide a user with control
over the summarization process, (2) sup-
port exploration of the document set with
the summary as the staring point, and (3)
combine text summaries with alternative
presentations such as a map-based visual-
ization of documents.
