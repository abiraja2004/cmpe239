Cross-lingual parallelism and small-scale
language variation have recently become
subject of research in both computational
and theoretical linguistics. In this arti-
cle, we use a parallel corpus and an auto-
matic aligner to study English light verb
constructions and their German transla-
tions. We show that parallel corpus data
can provide new empirical evidence for
better understanding the properties of light
verbs. We also study the influence that the
identified properties of light verb construc-
tions have on the quality of their automatic
alignment in a parallel corpus. We show
that, even though characterised by limited
compositionality, these constructions can
be aligned better than fully compositional
phrases, due to an interaction between the
type of light verb construction and its fre-
quency.
