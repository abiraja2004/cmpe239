In many languages the use of compound
words is very productive. A common practice
to reduce sparsity consists in splitting com-
pounds in the training data. When this is done,
the system incurs the risk of translating com-
ponents in non-consecutive positions, or in the
wrong order. Furthermore, a post-processing
step of compound merging is required to re-
construct compound words in the output. We
present a method for increasing the chances
that components that should be merged are
translated into contiguous positions and in the
right order. We also propose new heuristic
methods for merging components that outper-
form all known methods, and a learning-based
method that has similar accuracy as the heuris-
tic method, is better at producing novel com-
pounds, and can operate with no background
linguistic resources.
