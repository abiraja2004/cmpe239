We present a novel, data-driven method
for integrated shallow and deep parsing.
Mediated by an XML-based multi-layer
annotation architecture, we interleave a
robust, but accurate stochastic topological
field parser of German with a constraint-
based HPSG parser. Our annotation-based
method for dovetailing shallow and deep
phrasal constraints is highly flexible, al-
lowing targeted and fine-grained guidance
of constraint-based parsing. We conduct
systematic experiments that demonstrate
substantial performance gains.1
