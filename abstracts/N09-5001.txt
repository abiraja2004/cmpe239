 
Traditional Information Extraction (IE) sys-
tems identify many unconnected facts. The 
objective of this paper is to define a new 
cross-document information extraction task 
and demonstrate a system which can extract, 
rank and track events in two dimensions: tem-
poral and spatial. The system can automati-
cally label the person entities involved in 
significant events as 'centroid arguments', and 
then present the events involving the same 
centroid on a time line and on a geographical 
map.
