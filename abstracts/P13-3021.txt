We present experiments using a new unsu-
pervised approach to automatic text sim-
plification, which builds on sampling and
ranking via a loss function informed by
readability research. The main idea is
that a loss function can distinguish good
simplification candidates among randomly
sampled sub-sentences of the input sen-
tence. Our approach is rated as equally
grammatical and beginner reader appro-
priate as a supervised SMT-based baseline
system by native speakers, but our setup
performs more radical changes that better
resembles the variation observed in human
generated simplifications.
