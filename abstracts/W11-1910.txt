In this paper we present SUCRE (Kobdani
and Schu?tze, 2010) that is a modular coref-
erence resolution system participating in the
CoNLL-2011 Shared Task: Modeling Unre-
stricted Coreference in OntoNote (Pradhan et
al., 2011). The SUCRE?s modular architecture
provides a clean separation between data stor-
age, feature engineering and machine learning
algorithms.
