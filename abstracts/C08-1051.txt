Word clustering is a conventional and im-
portant NLP task, and the literature has
suggested two kinds of approaches to this
problem. One is based on the distribu-
tional similarity and the other relies on
the co-occurrence of two words in lexico-
syntactic patterns. Although the two meth-
ods have been discussed separately, it is
promising to combine them since they are
complementary with each other. This pa-
per proposes to integrate them using hid-
den Markov random fields and demon-
strates its effectiveness through experi-
ments.
