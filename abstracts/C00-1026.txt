 
Tim paper describes a similarity-based model to 
present he morphological rules for Chinese com- 
pound nouns. This representation model serves 
functions of 1) as the morphological rules of the 
compounds, 2) as a mean to evaluate the proper- 
ness of a compound construction, and 3) as a mean 
to disambiguate the semantic ambiguity of the 
nlorphological head of a compound noun. An 
automatic semantic lassil'ication system for Chine- 
se unknown compounds i thus implemented based 
on the model. Experiments and on'or analyses arc 
also presented.
