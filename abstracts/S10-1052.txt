We describe a system which ranks human-
provided paraphrases of noun compounds,
where the frequency with which a given
paraphrase was provided by human volun-
teers is the gold standard for ranking. Our
system assigns a score to a paraphrase of
a given compound according to the num-
ber of times it has co-occurred with other
paraphrases in the rest of the dataset. We
use these co-occurrence statistics to com-
pute conditional probabilities to estimate a
sub-typing or Is-A relation between para-
phrases. This method clusters together
paraphrases which have similar meanings
and also favours frequent, general para-
phrases rather than infrequent paraphrases
with more specific meanings.
