 
In this paper we address the problem of 
choosing the best solution(s) from a set 
of interpretations of the same object (in 
our case a segment of text). A notion of 
preference is stated, based on pairwise 
comparisons of complete interpretations in 
order to obtain a partial order among the 
competing interpretations. An experimental 
implementation is described, which uses 
Prolog-l ike preference statements.
