 
This paper presents a rule-based approach 
for finding out the stems from text in Ben-
gali, a resource-poor language. It starts by 
introducing the concept of orthographic 
syllable, the basic orthographic unit of 
Bengali. Then it discusses the morphologi-
cal structure of the tokens for different 
parts of speech, formalizes the inflection 
rule constructs and formulates a quantita-
tive ranking measure for potential candi-
date stems of a token. These concepts are 
applied in the design and implementation 
of an extensible architecture of a stemmer 
system for Bengali text. The accuracy of 
the system is calculated to be ~89% and 
above.
