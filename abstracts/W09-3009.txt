In this paper, we report our work on
automatic image annotation by combining
several textual features drawn from the
text surrounding the image. Evaluation of
our system is performed on a dataset of
images and texts collected from the web.
We report our findings through compar-
ative evaluation with two gold standard
collections of manual annotations on the
same dataset.
