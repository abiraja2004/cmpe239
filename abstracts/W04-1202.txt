 
The aim of this study is to investigate the 
relationships between citations and the 
scientific argumentation found in the abstract. 
We extracted citation lists from a set of 3200 
full-text papers originating from a narrow 
domain.  In parallel, we recovered the 
corresponding MEDLINE records for analysis 
of the argumentative moves. Our 
argumentative model is founded on four 
classes: PURPOSE, METHODS, RESULTS, 
and CONCLUSION. A Bayesian classifier 
trained on explicitly structured MEDLINE 
abstracts generates these argumentative 
categories. The categories are used to generate 
four different argumentative indexes. A fifth 
index contains the complete abstract, together 
with the title and the list of Medical Subject 
Headings (MeSH) terms. To appraise the 
relationship of the moves to the citations, the 
citation lists were used as the criteria for 
determining relatedness of articles, 
establishing a benchmark. Our results show 
that the average precision of queries with the 
PURPOSE and CONCLUSION features is the 
highest, while the precision of the RESULTS 
and METHODS features was relatively low. A 
linear weighting combination of the moves is 
proposed, which significantly improves 
retrieval of related articles.
