Reading is known to be an essential task
in language learning, but finding the ap-
propriate text for every learner is far from
easy. In this context, automatic procedures
can support the teacher?s work. Some
tools exist for English, but at present there
are none for French as a foreign language
(FFL). In this paper, we present an origi-
nal approach to assessing the readability
of FFL texts using NLP techniques and
extracts from FFL textbooks as our cor-
pus. Two logistic regression models based
on lexical and grammatical features are
explored and give quite good predictions
on new texts. The results shows a slight
superiority for multinomial logistic re-
gression over the proportional odds model.
