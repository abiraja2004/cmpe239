Standard algorithms for template-based in-
formation extraction (IE) require predefined
template schemas, and often labeled data,
to learn to extract their slot fillers (e.g., an
embassy is the Target of a Bombing tem-
plate). This paper describes an approach to
template-based IE that removes this require-
ment and performs extraction without know-
ing the template structure in advance. Our al-
gorithm instead learns the template structure
automatically from raw text, inducing tem-
plate schemas as sets of linked events (e.g.,
bombings include detonate, set off, and de-
stroy events) associated with semantic roles.
We also solve the standard IE task, using the
induced syntactic patterns to extract role fillers
from specific documents. We evaluate on the
MUC-4 terrorism dataset and show that we in-
duce template structure very similar to hand-
created gold structure, and we extract role
fillers with an F1 score of .40, approaching
the performance of algorithms that require full
knowledge of the templates.
