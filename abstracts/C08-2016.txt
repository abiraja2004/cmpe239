This paper describes a parameter estima-
tion method for multi-label classification
that does not rely on approximate infer-
ence. It is known that multi-label clas-
sification involving label correlation fea-
tures is intractable, because the graphi-
cal model for this problem is a complete
graph. Our solution is to exploit the spar-
sity of features, and express a model struc-
ture for each object by using a sparse
graph. We can thereby apply the junc-
tion tree algorithm, allowing for efficient
exact inference on sparse graphs. Exper-
iments on three data sets for text catego-
rization demonstrated that our method in-
creases the accuracy for text categorization
with a reasonable cost.
