We design and test a sentence com-
parison method using the framework
of Robust Minimal Recursion Seman-
tics which allows us to utilise the deep
parse information produced by Jacy, a
Japanese HPSG based parser and the
lexical information available in our on-
tology. Our method was used for both
paraphrase detection and also for an-
swer sentence selection for question an-
swering. In both tasks, results showed
an improvement over Bag-of-Words, as
well as providing extra information use-
ful to the applications.
