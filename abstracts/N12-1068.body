We describe and evaluate several methods for
estimating the confidence in the per-edge cor-
rectness of a predicted dependency parse. We
show empirically that the confidence is asso-
ciated with the probability that an edge is se-
lected correctly and that it can be used to de-
tect incorrect edges very efficiently. We eval-
uate our methods on parsing text in 14 lan-
guages.
