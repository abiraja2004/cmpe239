 
This paper describes ongoing work on the choice 
of modal expressions in the generation of recom-
mendations about courses of study within the B.A.-
program of the Ruhr-Universit?t Bochum. We fo-
cus our work on the German modal verbs m?ssen 
(must), k?nnen (can), the subjunctive form sollte 
(should), and d?rfen (may). The idea is to combine 
insights from formal semantics into the meaning of 
modal verbs with requirements for their choice in 
NLG-systems in order to achieve a linguistically 
satisfying model of their choice. The overall model 
is implemented in the CAN-system that plans 
courses of study and generates recommendations 
about them.
