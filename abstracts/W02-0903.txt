In this paper we investigate the impact of
morphological features on the task of au-
tomatically extending a dictionary. We
approach the problem as a pattern clas-
sification task and compare the perfor-
mance of several models in classifying
nouns that are unknown to a broad cov-
erage dictionary. We used a boosting clas-
sifier to compare the performance of mod-
els that use different sets of features. We
show how adding simple morphological
features to a model greatly improves the
classification performance.
