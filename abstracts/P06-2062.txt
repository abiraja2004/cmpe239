A resource grammar is a standard library
for the GF grammar formalism. It raises
the abstraction level of writing domain-
specific grammars by taking care of the
general grammatical rules of a language.
GF resource grammars have been built in
parallel for eleven languages and share a
common interface, which simplifies multi-
lingual applications. We reflect on our ex-
perience with the Russian resource gram-
mar trying to answer the questions: how
well Russian fits into the common inter-
face and where the line between language-
independent and language-specific should
be drawn.
