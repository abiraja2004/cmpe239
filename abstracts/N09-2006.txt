We propose a variation of simplex-downhill algo-
rithm specifically customized for optimizing param-
eters in statistical machine translation (SMT) de-
coder for better end-user automatic evaluation met-
ric scores for translations, such as versions of BLEU,
TER and mixtures of them. Traditional simplex-
downhill has the advantage of derivative-free com-
putations of objective functions, yet still gives satis-
factory searching directions in most scenarios. This
is suitable for optimizing translation metrics as they
are not differentiable in nature. On the other hand,
Armijo algorithm usually performs line search ef-
ficiently given a searching direction. It is a deep
hidden fact that an efficient line search method
will change the iterations of simplex, and hence
the searching trajectories. We propose to embed
the Armijo inexact line search within the simplex-
downhill algorithm. We show, in our experiments,
the proposed algorithm improves over the widely-
applied Minimum Error Rate training algorithm for
optimizing machine translation parameters.
