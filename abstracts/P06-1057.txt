This paper investigates conceptually and
empirically the novel sense matching task,
which requires to recognize whether the
senses of two synonymous words match in
context. We suggest direct approaches to
the problem, which avoid the intermediate
step of explicit word sense disambigua-
tion, and demonstrate their appealing ad-
vantages and stimulating potential for fu-
ture research.
