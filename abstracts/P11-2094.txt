Machine transliteration is defined as auto-
matic phonetic translation of names across
languages. In this paper, we propose syn-
chronous adaptor grammar, a novel nonpara-
metric Bayesian learning approach, for ma-
chine transliteration. This model provides
a general framework without heuristic or re-
striction to automatically learn syllable equiv-
alents between languages. The proposed
model outperforms the state-of-the-art EM-
based model in the English to Chinese translit-
eration task.
