We present a quantitative investigation of
the cross-linguistic usage of some (rel-
atively) newly minted derivational mor-
phemes. In particular, we examine the lexi-
cal semantic content expressed by three suf-
fixes originating in English: -gate, -geddon
and -athon. Using data from newspa-
pers, we look at the distribution and lex-
ical semantic usage of these morphemes
not only within English, but across sev-
eral languages and also across time, with
a time-depth of 20 years. The occurrence
of these suffixes in available corpora are
comparatively rare, however, by investigat-
ing huge amounts of data, we are able to
arrive at interesting insights into the dis-
tribution, meaning and spread of the suf-
fixes. Processing and understanding the
huge amounts of data is accomplished via
visualization methods that allow the pre-
sentation of an overall distributional pic-
ture, with further details and different types
of perspectives available on demand.
