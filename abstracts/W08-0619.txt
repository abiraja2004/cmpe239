 Clinicians write the reports in natural lan-guage which contains a large amount of in-formal medical term. Automating conver-sion of text into clinical terminologies al-lows reliable retrieval and analysis of the clinical notes. We have created an algor-ithm that maps medical expressions in clinical notes into a medical terminology. This algorithm indexes medical terms into an augmented lexicon. It performs lexical searches in text and finds the longest pos-sible matches in the target terminology, SNOMED CT. The mapping system was run on a collection of 470,000 clinical notes from an Intensive Care Service (ICS). The evaluation on a small part of the cor-pus shows the precision is 70.4%. 1
