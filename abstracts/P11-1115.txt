 
In this paper we give an overview of the 
Knowledge Base Population (KBP) track at 
the 2010 Text Analysis Conference. The main 
goal of KBP is to promote research in discov-
ering facts about entities and augmenting a 
knowledge base (KB) with these facts. This is 
done through two tasks, Entity Linking ? link-
ing names in context to entities in the KB ? 
and Slot Filling ? adding information about an 
entity to the KB.  A large source collection of 
newswire and web documents is provided 
from which systems are to discover informa-
tion. Attributes (?slots?) derived from 
Wikipedia infoboxes are used to create the 
reference KB. In this paper we provide an 
overview of the techniques which can serve as 
a basis for a good KBP system, lay out the 
remaining challenges by comparison with tra-
ditional Information Extraction (IE) and Ques-
tion Answering (QA) tasks, and provide some 
suggestions to address these challenges.
