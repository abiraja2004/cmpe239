This paper gives an overview of
the stochastic modelling approach to
machine translation. Starting with
the Bayes decision rule as in pattern
classification and speech recognition,
we show how the resulting system
architecture can be structured into three
parts: the language model probability,
the string translation model probability
and the search procedure that gener-
ates the word sequence in the target
language. We discuss the properties
of the system components and report
results on the translation of spoken
dialogues in the VERBMOBIL project.
The experience obtained in the VERB-
MOBIL project, in particular a large-
scale end-to-end evaluation, showed
that the stochastic modelling approach
resulted in significantly lower error
rates than three competing translation
approaches: the sentence error rate was
29% in comparison with 52% to 62%
for the other translation approaches.
