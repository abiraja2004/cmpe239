Dependency analysis of natural language
has gained importance for its applicability
to NLP tasks. Non-projective structures
are common in dependency analysis, there-
fore we need fine-grained means of describ-
ing them, especially for the purposes of
machine-learning oriented approaches like
parsing. We present an evaluation on
twelve languages which explores several
constraints and measures on non-projective
structures. We pursue an edge-based ap-
proach concentrating on properties of in-
dividual edges as opposed to properties of
whole trees. In our evaluation, we include
previously unreported measures taking into
account levels of nodes in dependency trees.
Our empirical results corroborate theoreti-
cal results and show that an edge-based ap-
proach using levels of nodes provides an
accurate and at the same time expressive
means for capturing non-projective struc-
tures in natural language.
