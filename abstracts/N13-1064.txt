In the field of Intelligent User Interfaces, Spo-
ken Dialogue Systems (SDSs) play a key role
as speech represents a true intuitive means
of human communication. Deriving informa-
tion about its quality can help rendering SDSs
more user-adaptive. Work on automatic esti-
mation of subjective quality usually relies on
statistical models. To create those, manual
data annotation is required, which may be per-
formed by actual users or by experts. Here,
both variants have their advantages and draw-
backs. In this paper, we analyze the relation-
ship between user and expert ratings by in-
vestigating models which combine the advan-
tages of both types of ratings. We explore two
novel approaches using statistical classifica-
tion methods and evaluate those with a pre-
existing corpus providing user and expert rat-
ings. After analyzing the results, we eventu-
ally recommend to use expert ratings instead
of user ratings in general.
