 
We propose a novel unsupervised method 
for separating out distinct authorial compo-
nents of a document. In particular, we show 
that, given a book artificially ?munged? 
from two thematically similar biblical 
books, we can separate out the two consti-
tuent books almost perfectly. This allows 
us to automatically recapitulate many con-
clusions reached by Bible scholars over 
centuries of research. One of the key ele-
ments of our method is exploitation of dif-
ferences in synonym choice by different 
authors.
