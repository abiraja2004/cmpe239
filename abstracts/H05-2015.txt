Abstract 
We will demonstrate the MIT Spoken Lecture 
Processing Server and an accompanying lecture 
browser that students can use to quickly locate and 
browse lecture segments that apply to their query. 
We will show how lecturers can upload recorded 
lectures and companion text material to our server 
for automatic processing. The server automatically 
generates a time-aligned word transcript of the lec-
ture which can be downloaded for use within a 
browser. We will also demonstrate a browser we 
have created which allows students to quickly lo-
cate and browse audio segments that are relevant to 
their query. These tools can provide students with 
easier access to audio (or audio/visual) lectures, 
hopefully improving their educational experience.
