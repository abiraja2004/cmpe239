 
In linguistic studies, reduplication gener-
ally means the repetition of any linguis-
tic unit such as a phoneme, morpheme, 
word, phrase, clause or the utterance as a 
whole. The identification of reduplica-
tion is a part of general task of identifica-
tion of multiword expressions (MWE). 
In the present work, reduplications have 
been identified from the Bengali corpus 
of the articles of Rabindranath Tagore. 
The present rule-based approach is di-
vided into two phases. In the first phase, 
identification of reduplications has been 
done mainly at general expression level 
and in the second phase, their structural 
and semantics classifications are ana-
lyzed. The system has been evaluated 
with average Precision, Recall and F-
Score values of 92.82%, 91.50% and 
92.15% respectively.
