We present a novel approach to auto-
matic metaphor identification in unre-
stricted text. Starting from a small seed set
of manually annotated metaphorical ex-
pressions, the system is capable of har-
vesting a large number of metaphors of
similar syntactic structure from a corpus.
Our method is distinguished from previ-
ous work in that it does not employ any
hand-crafted knowledge, other than the
initial seed set, but, in contrast, captures
metaphoricity by means of verb and noun
clustering. Being the first to employ un-
supervised methods for metaphor identifi-
cation, our system operates with the pre-
cision of 0.79.
