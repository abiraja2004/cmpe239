Theories of discourse structure hypothesize a
hierarchical structure of discourse segments,
typically tree-structured. While substantial
work has been done on identifying and auto-
matically recognizing the textual and prosodic
correlates of discourse structure in mono-
logue, comparable cues for dialogue or multi-
party conversation, and in particular human-
computer dialogue remain relatively less stud-
ied. In this paper, we explore prosodic
cues to discourse segmentation in human-
computer dialogue. Using data drawn from
60 hours of interactions with a voice-only
conversational spoken language system, we
identify pitch and intensity features that sig-
nal segment boundaries. Specifically, based
on 473 pairs of segment-final and segment-
initiating utterances, we find significant in-
creases for segment-initial utterances in max-
imum pitch, average pitch, and average inten-
sity, while segment-final utterances show sig-
nificantly lower minimum pitch. These results
suggest that even in the artificial environment
of human-computer dialogue, prosodic cues ro-
bustly signal discourse segment structure, com-
parably to the contrastive uses of pitch and am-
plitude identified in natural monologues.
