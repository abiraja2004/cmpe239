This report documents the Machine
Transliteration Shared Task conducted as
a part of the Named Entities Workshop
(NEWS 2012), an ACL 2012 workshop.
The shared task features machine translit-
eration of proper names from English to
11 languages and from 3 languages to
English. In total, 14 tasks are provided.
7 teams participated in the evaluations.
Finally, 57 standard and 1 non-standard
runs are submitted, where diverse translit-
eration methodologies are explored and
reported on the evaluation data. We report
the results with 4 performance metrics.
We believe that the shared task has
successfully achieved its objective by pro-
viding a common benchmarking platform
for the research community to evaluate the
state-of-the-art technologies that benefit
the future research and development.
