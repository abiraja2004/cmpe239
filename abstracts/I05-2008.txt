 
This paper describes a system which 
solves language tests for second grade 
students (7 years old). In Japan, there 
are materials for students to measure 
understanding of what they studied, 
just like SAT for high school students 
in US. We use textbooks for the stu-
dents as the target material of this study. 
Questions in the materials are classified 
into four types: questions about Chi-
nese character (Kanji), about word 
knowledge, reading comprehension, 
and composition. This program doesn?t 
resolve the composition and some other 
questions which are not easy to be im-
plemented in text forms. We built a 
subsystem for each finer type of ques-
tions. As a result, we achieved 55% - 
83% accuracy in answering questions 
in unseen materials.
