 
The importance of the new textual genres such 
as blogs or forum entries is growing in parallel 
with the evolution of the Social Web. This pa-
per presents two corpora of blog posts in Eng-
lish and in Spanish, annotated according to the 
EmotiBlog annotation scheme. Furthermore, 
we created 20 factual and opinionated ques-
tions for each language and also the Gold 
Standard for their answers in the corpus. The 
purpose of our work is to study the challenges 
involved in a mixed fact and opinion question 
answering setting by comparing the perform-
ance of two Question Answering (QA) sys-
tems as far as mixed opinion and factual set-
ting is concerned. The first one is open do-
main, while the second one is opinion-
oriented. We evaluate separately the two sys-
tems in both languages and propose possible 
solutions to improve QA systems that have to 
process mixed questions.
