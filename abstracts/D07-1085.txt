Speech recognition transcripts are far from
perfect; they are not of sufficient quality to
be useful on their own for spoken document
retrieval. This is especially the case for con-
versational speech. Recent efforts have tried
to overcome this issue by using statistics
from speech lattices instead of only the 1-
best transcripts; however, these efforts have
invariably used the classical vector space re-
trieval model. This paper presents a novel
approach to lattice-based spoken document
retrieval using statistical language models: a
statistical model is estimated for each doc-
ument, and probabilities derived from the
document models are directly used to mea-
sure relevance. Experimental results show
that the lattice-based language modeling
method outperforms both the language mod-
eling retrieval method using only the 1-best
transcripts, as well as a recently proposed
lattice-based vector space retrieval method.
