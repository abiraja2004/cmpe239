Defining all words in a Japanese dictio-
nary by using a limited number of words
(defining vocabulary) is helpful for Japanese
children and second-language learners of
Japanese. Although some English dictio-
naries have their own defining vocabulary,
no Japanese dictionary has such vocabu-
lary as of yet. As the first step toward
building a Japanese defining vocabulary, we
ranked Japanese words based on a graph-
based method. In this paper, we introduce
the method, and show some evaluation re-
sults of applying the method to an existing
Japanese dictionary.
