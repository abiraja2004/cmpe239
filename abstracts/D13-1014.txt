We present a novel vector space model for se-
mantic co-compositionality. Inspired by Gen-
erative Lexicon Theory (Pustejovsky, 1995),
our goal is a compositional model where
both predicate and argument are allowed to
modify each others? meaning representations
while generating the overall semantics. This
readily addresses some major challenges with
current vector space models, notably the pol-
ysemy issue and the use of one represen-
tation per word type. We implement co-
compositionality using prototype projections
on predicates/arguments and show that this
is effective in adapting their word represen-
tations. We further cast the model as a
neural network and propose an unsupervised
algorithm to jointly train word representations
with co-compositionality. The model achieves
the best result to date (? = 0.47) on the
semantic similarity task of transitive verbs
(Grefenstette and Sadrzadeh, 2011).
