In this paper we present an extension of a
successful simple and effective method for
extracting parallel sentences from com-
parable corpora and we apply it to an
Arabic/English NIST system. We exper-
iment with a new TERp filter, along with
WER and TER filters. We also report a
comparison of our approach with that of
(Munteanu and Marcu, 2005) using ex-
actly the same corpora and show perfor-
mance gain by using much lesser data.
Our approach employs an SMT system
built from small amounts of parallel texts
to translate the source side of the non-
parallel corpus. The target side texts are
used, along with other corpora, in the lan-
guage model of this SMT system. We then
use information retrieval techniques and
simple filters to create parallel data from
a comparable news corpora. We evaluate
the quality of the extracted data by show-
ing that it significantly improves the per-
formance of an SMT systems.
