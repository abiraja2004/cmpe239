Searching and reading the Web is one of the
principal methods used to seek out infor-
mation to resolve problems about technol-
ogy in general and digital devices in partic-
ular. This paper addresses the problem of
text mining in the digital devices domain. In
particular, we address the task of detecting
semantic relations between digital devices in
the text of Web pages. We use a Na??ve Bayes
model trained to maximize the margin and
compare its performance with several other
comparable methods. We construct a novel
dataset which consists of segments of text
extracted from the Web, where each segment
contains pairs of devices. We also propose
a novel, inexpensive and very effective way
of getting people to label text data using a
Web service, the Mechanical Turk. Our re-
sults show that the maximum margin model
consistently outperforms the other methods.
