We present a novel context pattern in-
duction method for information extrac-
tion, specifically named entity extraction.
Using this method, we extended several
classes of seed entity lists into much larger
high-precision lists. Using token member-
ship in these extended lists as additional
features, we improved the accuracy of a
conditional random field-based named en-
tity tagger. In contrast, features derived
from the seed lists decreased extractor ac-
curacy.
