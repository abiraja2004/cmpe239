We argue that verbal patient diagnosis is a
promising application for limited-domain
speech translation, and describe an ar-
chitecture designed for this type of task
which represents a compromise between
principled linguistics-based processing on
the one hand and efficient phrasal transla-
tion on the other. We propose to demon-
strate a prototype system instantiating this
architecture, which has been built on top
of the Open Source REGULUS 2 platform.
The prototype translates spoken yes-no
questions about headache symptoms from
English to Japanese, using a vocabulary of
about 200 words.
