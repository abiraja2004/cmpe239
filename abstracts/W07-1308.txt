This paper discusses the reconstruction of
the Elamite language?s phonology from its
orthography using the Gradual Learning Al-
gorithm, which was re-purposed to ?learn?
underlying phonological forms from surface
orthography. Practical issues are raised re-
garding the difficulty of mapping between
orthography and phonology, and Optimal-
ity Theory?s neglected Lexicon Optimiza-
tion module is highlighted.
