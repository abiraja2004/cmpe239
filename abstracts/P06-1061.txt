Hidden Markov models (HMMs) are pow-
erful statistical models that have found
successful applications in Information Ex-
traction (IE). In current approaches to ap-
plying HMMs to IE, an HMM is used to
model text at the document level. This
modelling might cause undesired redun-
dancy in extraction in the sense that more
than one filler is identified and extracted.
We propose to use HMMs to model text
at the segment level, in which the extrac-
tion process consists of two steps: a seg-
ment retrieval step followed by an extrac-
tion step. In order to retrieve extraction-
relevant segments from documents, we in-
troduce a method to use HMMs to model
and retrieve segments. Our experimen-
tal results show that the resulting segment
HMM IE system not only achieves near
zero extraction redundancy, but also has
better overall extraction performance than
traditional document HMM IE systems.
