For the Affective Text task at Semeval-
1/Senseval-4, the CLaC team compared a
knowledge-based, domain-independent ap-
proach and a standard, statistical machine
learning approach to ternary sentiment an-
notation of news headlines. In this paper
we describe the two systems submitted to
the competition and evaluate their results.
We show that the knowledge-based unsu-
pervised method achieves high accuracy and
precision but low recall, while supervised
statistical approach trained on small amount
of in-domain data provides relatively high
recall at the cost of low precision.
