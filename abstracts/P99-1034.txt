 
This paper introduces a new approach to 
morpho-syntactic analysis through Humor 99 
(High-speed Unification Mo.rphology), a re- 
versible and unification-based morphological 
analyzer which has already been integrated 
with a variety of industrial applications. Hu- 
mor 99 successfully copes with problems of 
agglutinative ( .g. Hungarian, Turkish, Esto- 
nian) and other (highly) inflectional lan- 
guages (e.g. Polish, Czech, German) very ef- 
fectively. The authors conclude the paper by 
arguing that the approach used in Humor 99 
is general enough to be well suitable for a 
wide range of languages, and can serve as 
basis for higher-level linguistic operations 
such as shallow parsing.
