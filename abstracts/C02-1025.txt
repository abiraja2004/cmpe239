This paper presents a maximum entropy-based
named entity recognizer (NER). It differs from pre-
vious machine learning-based NERs in that it uses
information from the whole document to classify
each word, with just one classifier. Previous work
that involves the gathering of information from the
whole document often uses a secondary classifier,
which corrects the mistakes of a primary sentence-
based classifier. In this paper, we show that the
maximum entropy framework is able to make use
of global information directly, and achieves perfor-
mance that is comparable to the best previous ma-
chine learning-based NERs on MUC-6 and MUC-7
test data.
