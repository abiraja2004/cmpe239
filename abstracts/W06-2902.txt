Previous results have shown disappointing
performance when porting a parser trained
on one domain to another domain where
only a small amount of data is available.
We propose the use of data-defined ker-
nels as a way to exploit statistics from a
source domain while still specializing a
parser to a target domain. A probabilistic
model trained on the source domain (and
possibly also the target domain) is used to
define a kernel, which is then used in a
large margin classifier trained only on the
target domain. With a SVM classifier and
a neural network probabilistic model, this
method achieves improved performance
over the probabilistic model alone.
