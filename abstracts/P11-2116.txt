In this paper we investigate how much data
is required to train an algorithm for attribute
selection, a subtask of Referring Expressions
Generation (REG). To enable comparison be-
tween different-sized training sets, a system-
atic training method was developed. The re-
sults show that depending on the complexity
of the domain, training on 10 to 20 items may
already lead to a good performance.
