This paper describes a method for script independent
word spotting in multilingual handwritten and machine
printed documents. The system accepts a query in the
form of text from the user and returns a ranked list of word
images from document image corpus based on similarity
with the query word. The system is divided into two main
components. The first component known as Indexer, per-
forms indexing of all word images present in the document
image corpus. This is achieved by extracting Moment
Based features from word images and storing them as in-
dex. A template is generated for keyword spotting which
stores the mapping of a keyword string to its correspond-
ing word image which is used for generating query fea-
ture vector. The second component, Similarity Matcher,
returns a ranked list of word images which are most sim-
ilar to the query based on a cosine similarity metric. A
manual Relevance feedback is applied based on Rocchio?s
formula, which re-formulates the query vector to return
an improved ranked listing of word images. The perfor-
mance of the system is seen to be superior on printed text
than on handwritten text. Experiments are reported on
documents of three different languages: English, Hindi
and Sanskrit. For handwritten English, an average pre-
cision of 67% was obtained for 30 query words. For ma-
chine printed Hindi, an average precision of 71% was ob-
tained for 75 query words and for Sanskrit, an average
precision of 87% with 100 queries was obtained.
