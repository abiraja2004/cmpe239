 
This paper proposes a semi-supervised 
boosting approach to improve statistical 
word alignment with limited labeled data 
and large amounts of unlabeled data. The 
proposed approach modifies the super-
vised boosting algorithm to a semi-
supervised learning algorithm by incor-
porating the unlabeled data. In this algo-
rithm, we build a word aligner by using 
both the labeled data and the unlabeled 
data. Then we build a pseudo reference 
set for the unlabeled data, and calculate 
the error rate of each word aligner using 
only the labeled data. Based on this semi-
supervised boosting algorithm, we inves-
tigate two boosting methods for word 
alignment. In addition, we improve the 
word alignment results by combining the 
results of the two semi-supervised boost-
ing methods. Experimental results on 
word alignment indicate that semi-
supervised boosting achieves relative er-
ror reductions of 28.29% and 19.52% as 
compared with supervised boosting and 
unsupervised boosting, respectively.
