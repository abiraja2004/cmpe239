 
This short paper presents a system developed at 
the Universit? Paris 13 for the Semeval 2007 
Metonymy Resolution Task (task #08, location 
name track; see Markert and Nissim, 2007). 
The system makes use of plain word forms 
only. In this paper, we evaluate the accuracy of 
this minimalist approach, compare it to a more 
complex one which uses both syntactic and 
semantic features, and discuss its usefulness for 
metonymy resolution in general.
