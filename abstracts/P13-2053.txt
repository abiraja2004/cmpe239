Current approaches for word sense dis-
ambiguation and translation selection typ-
ically require lexical resources or large
bilingual corpora with rich information
fields and annotations, which are often
infeasible for under-resourced languages.
We extract translation context knowledge
from a bilingual comparable corpora of a
richer-resourced language pair, and inject
it into a multilingual lexicon. The multilin-
gual lexicon can then be used to perform
context-dependent lexical lookup on texts
of any language, including under-resourced
ones. Evaluations on a prototype lookup
tool, trained on a English?Malay bilingual
Wikipedia corpus, show a precision score
of 0.65 (baseline 0.55) and mean recip-
rocal rank score of 0.81 (baseline 0.771).
Based on the early encouraging results,
the context-dependent lexical lookup tool
may be developed further into an intelligent
reading aid, to help users grasp the gist of
a second or foreign language text.
