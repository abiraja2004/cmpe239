In this paper, we describe our system sub-
mitted for the Sentiment Analysis task at Se-
mEval 2013 (Task 2). We implemented a com-
bination of Explicit Semantic Analysis (ESA)
with Naive Bayes classifier. ESA represents
text as a high dimensional vector of explicitly
defined topics, following the distributional se-
mantic model. This approach is novel in the
sense that ESA has not been used for Senti-
ment Analysis in the literature, to the best of
our knowledge.
