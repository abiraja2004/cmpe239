Our goal is to automatically detect the
functional roles that meeting participants
play, as well as the expertise they bring to
meetings. To perform this task, we build
decision tree classifiers that use a combi-
nation of simple speech features (speech
lengths and spoken keywords) extracted
from the participants? speech in meetings.
We show that this algorithm results in a
role detection accuracy of 83% on unseen
test data, where the random baseline is
33.3%. We also introduce a simple aggre-
gation mechanism that combines evidence
of the participants? expertise from multi-
ple meetings. We show that this aggre-
gation mechanism improves the role de-
tection accuracy from 66.7% (when ag-
gregating over a single meeting) to 83%
(when aggregating over 5 meetings).
