We present an annotation scheme for stu-
dent emotions in tutoring dialogues. Analy-
ses of our scheme with respect to interannota-
tor agreement and predictive accuracy indicate
that our scheme is reliable in our domain, and
that our emotion labels can be predicted with
a high degree of accuracy. We discuss issues
concerning the implementation of emotion pre-
diction and adaptation in the computer tutoring
dialogue system we are developing.
