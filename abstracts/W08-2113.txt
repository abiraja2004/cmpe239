In this paper, we propose a new metho-
dology based on directed graphs and the 
TextRank algorithm to automatically in-
duce general-specific noun relations from 
web corpora frequency counts. Different 
asymmetric association measures are im-
plemented to build the graphs upon 
which the TextRank algorithm is applied 
and produces an ordered list of nouns 
from the most general to the most specif-
ic. Experiments are conducted based on 
the WordNet noun hierarchy and assess 
65.69% of correct word ordering.
