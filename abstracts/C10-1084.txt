We propose an unsupervised approach uti-
lizing only raw corpora to enhance mor-
phological alignment involving highly in-
flected languages. Our method focuses on
closed-class morphemes, modeling their
influence on nearby words. Our language-
independent model recovers important
links missing in the IBM Model 4 align-
ment and demonstrates improved end-to-
end translations for English-Finnish and
English-Hungarian.
