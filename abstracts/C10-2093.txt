The Varro toolkit is a system for identi-
fying and counting a major class of reg-
ularity in treebanks and annotated nat-
ural language data in the form of tree-
structures: frequently recurring unordered
subtrees. This software has been designed
for use in linguistics to be maximally
applicable to actually existing treebanks
and other stores of tree-structurable nat-
ural language data. It minimizes mem-
ory use so that moderately large treebanks
are tractable on commonly available com-
puter hardware. This article introduces
condensed canonically ordered trees as a
data structure for efficiently discovering
frequently recurring unordered subtrees.
