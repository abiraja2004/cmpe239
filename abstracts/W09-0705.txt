South  African languages  (and  indigenous 
African languages in general) lag behind other 
languages  in terms of  the availability of  lin-
guistic  resources.  Efforts  to  improve or  fast-
track the development of linguistic resources 
are required to bridge this ever-increasing gap. 
In this paper we emphasize the advantages of 
technology transfer between two languages to 
advance  an  existing  linguistic  technology/re-
source. The advantages of technology transfer 
are  illustrated  by  showing  how  an  existing 
lemmatiser for Setswana can be improved by 
applying a methodology that was first used in 
the  development  of  a  lemmatiser  for 
Afrikaans.
