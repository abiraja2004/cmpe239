 
Selectional preference learning 
methods have usually focused on word-
to-class relations, e.g., a verb selects as 
its subject a given nominal class. This 
papers extends previous statistical 
models to class-to-class preferences, 
and presents a model that learns 
selectional preferences for classes of 
verbs. The motivation is twofold: 
different senses of a verb may have 
different preferences, and some classes 
of verbs can share preferences. The 
model is tested on a word sense 
disambiguation task which uses 
subject-verb and object-verb 
relationships extracted from a small 
sense-disambiguated corpus.
