We present an enriched version of the Penn
Arabic Treebank (Maamouri et al, 2004),
where latent features necessary for model-
ing morpho-syntactic agreement in Arabic are
manually annotated. We describe our pro-
cess for efficient annotation, and present the
first quantitative analysis of Arabic morpho-
syntactic phenomena.
