 
Utterance-based AAC systems have the poten-
tial to significantly speed communication rate 
for someone who relies on a speech generat-
ing device for communication. At the same 
time, such systems pose interesting challenges 
including anticipating text needs, remember-
ing what text is stored, and accessing desired 
text when needed. Moreover, using such sys-
tems has profound pragmatic implications as a 
prestored message may or may not capture 
exactly what the user wishes to say in a par-
ticular discourse situation. In this paper we 
describe a prototype of an utterance-based 
AAC system whose design choices are driven 
by findings from theoretically driven studies 
concerning pragmatic choices with which the 
user of such a system is faced. These findings 
are coupled with cognitive theories to make 
choices for system design.
