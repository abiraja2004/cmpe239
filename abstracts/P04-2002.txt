Dialog participants in a non-mixed ini-
tiative dialogs, in which one participant
asks questions exclusively and the other
participant responds to those questions
exclusively, can select actions that min-
imize the expected length of the dialog.
The choice of question that minimizes
the expected number of questions to be
asked can be computed in polynomial
time in some cases.
The polynomial-time solutions to spe-
cial cases of the problem suggest a num-
ber of strategies for selecting dialog ac-
tions in the intractable general case. In
a simulation involving 1000 dialog sce-
narios, an approximate solution using
the most probable rule set/least proba-
ble question resulted in expected dialog
length of 3.60 questions per dialog, as
compared to 2.80 for the optimal case,
and 5.05 for a randomly chosen strategy.
