 
Logs of user queries to an internet search engine pro-
vide a large amount of implicit and explicit informa-
tion about language. In this paper, we investigate 
their use in spelling correction of search queries, a 
task which poses many additional challenges beyond 
the traditional spelling correction problem. We pre-
sent an approach that uses an iterative transformation 
of the input query strings into other strings that corre-
spond to more and more likely queries according to 
statistics extracted from internet search query logs.
