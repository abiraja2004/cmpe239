Large-scale linguistically annotated resources have become available in
recent years. This is partly due to sophisticated automatic and semi-
automatic approaches that work well on specific tasks such as part-of-
speech tagging. For more complex linguistic phenomena like anaphora
resolution there are no tools that result in high-quality annotations with-
out massive user intervention. Annotated corpora of the size needed for
modern computational linguistics research cannot however be created by
small groups of hand annotators. The ANAWIKI project strikes a balance
between collecting high-quality annotations from experts and applying a
game-like approach to collecting linguistic annotation from the general
Web population. More generally, ANAWIKI is a project that explores to
what extend expert annotations can be substituted by a critical mass of
non-expert judgements.
