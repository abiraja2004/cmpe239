We exploit the resources in the Arabic
Treebank (ATB) and Arabic Gigaword
(AG) to determine the best features for the
novel task of automatically creating lexi-
cal semantic verb classes for Modern Stan-
dard Arabic (MSA). The verbs are clas-
sified into groups that share semantic el-
ements of meaning as they exhibit simi-
lar syntactic behavior. The results of the
clustering experiments are compared with
a gold standard set of classes, which is
approximated by using the noisy English
translations provided in the ATB to cre-
ate Levin-like classes for MSA. The qual-
ity of the clusters is found to be sensitive
to the inclusion of syntactic frames, LSA
vectors, morphological pattern, and sub-
ject animacy. The best set of parameters
yields an F?=1 score of 0.456, compared
to a random baseline of an F?=1 score of
0.205.
