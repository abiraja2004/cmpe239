Comparative and evaluative question an-
swering (QA) requires a detailed semantic
analysis of comparative expressions and
complex processing. Semantics of predi-
cates from questions have to be translated
to quantifiable criteria before extraction
of information can be done. This paper
presents some challenges faced in answer-
ing comparative and evaluative questions.
An application on the domain of business
intelligence is discussed.
