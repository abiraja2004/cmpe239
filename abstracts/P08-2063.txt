 
Supervised word sense disambiguation re-
quires training corpora that have been tagged 
with word senses, which begs the question of 
which word senses to tag with. The default 
choice has been WordNet, with its broad cov-
erage and easy accessibility. However, con-
cerns have been raised about the 
appropriateness of its fine-grained word 
senses for WSD. WSD systems have been far 
more successful in distinguishing coarse-
grained senses than fine-grained ones (Navig-
li, 2006), but does that approach neglect ne-
cessary meaning differences? Recent 
psycholinguistic evidence seems to indicate 
that closely related word senses may be 
represented in the mental lexicon much like a 
single sense, whereas distantly related senses 
may be represented more like discrete entities. 
These results suggest that, for the purposes of 
WSD, closely related word senses can be clus-
tered together into a more general sense with 
little meaning loss. The current paper will de-
scribe this psycholinguistic research and its 
implications for automatic word sense disam-
biguation.
