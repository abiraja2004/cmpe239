We present a machine translation frame-
work that can incorporate arbitrary fea-
tures of both input and output sentences.
The core of the approach is a novel de-
coder based on lattice parsing with quasi-
synchronous grammar (Smith and Eis-
ner, 2006), a syntactic formalism that
does not require source and target trees
to be isomorphic. Using generic approx-
imate dynamic programming techniques,
this decoder can handle ?non-local? fea-
tures. Similar approximate inference tech-
niques support efficient parameter esti-
mation with hidden variables. We use
the decoder to conduct controlled exper-
iments on a German-to-English transla-
tion task, to compare lexical phrase, syn-
tax, and combined models, and to mea-
sure effects of various restrictions on non-
isomorphism.
