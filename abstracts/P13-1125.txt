Preordering of a source language sentence
to match target word order has proved to
be useful for improving machine transla-
tion systems. Previous work has shown
that a reordering model can be learned
from high quality manual word alignments
to improve machine translation perfor-
mance. In this paper, we focus on further
improving the performance of the reorder-
ing model (and thereby machine transla-
tion) by using a larger corpus of sentence
aligned data for which manual word align-
ments are not available but automatic ma-
chine generated alignments are available.
The main challenge we tackle is to gen-
erate quality data for training the reorder-
ing model in spite of the machine align-
ments being noisy. To mitigate the effect
of noisy machine alignments, we propose
a novel approach that improves reorder-
ings produced given noisy alignments and
also improves word alignments using in-
formation from the reordering model. This
approach generates alignments that are 2.6
f-Measure points better than a baseline su-
pervised aligner. The data generated al-
lows us to train a reordering model that
gives an improvement of 1.8 BLEU points
on the NIST MT-08 Urdu-English eval-
uation set over a reordering model that
only uses manual word alignments, and a
gain of 5.2 BLEU points over a standard
phrase-based baseline.
