This paper discusses computational com-
positional semantics from the perspective
of grammar engineering, in the light of ex-
perience with the use of Minimal Recur-
sion Semantics in DELPH-IN grammars.
The relationship between argument index-
ation and semantic role labelling is ex-
plored and a semantic dependency nota-
tion (DMRS) is introduced.
