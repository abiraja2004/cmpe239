 
Gazetteers or entity dictionaries are important 
knowledge resources for solving a wide range of 
NLP problems, such as entity extraction. We in-
troduce a novel method to automatically generate 
gazetteers from seed lists using an external 
knowledge resource, the Wikipedia. Unlike pre-
vious methods, our method exploits the rich con-
tent and various structural elements of Wikipe-
dia, and does not rely on language- or domain-
specific knowledge. Furthermore, applying the 
extended gazetteers to an entity extraction task in 
a scientific domain, we empirically observed a 
significant improvement in system accuracy 
when compared with those using seed gazetteers.
