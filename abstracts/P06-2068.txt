This paper explores the role of informa-
tion retrieval in answering ?relationship?
questions, a new class complex informa-
tion needs formally introduced in TREC
2005. Since information retrieval is of-
ten an integral component of many ques-
tion answering strategies, it is important
to understand the impact of different term-
based techniques. Within a framework of
sentence retrieval, we examine three fac-
tors that contribute to question answer-
ing performance: the use of different re-
trieval engines, relevance (both at the doc-
ument and sentence level), and redun-
dancy. Results point out the limitations
of purely term-based methods to this chal-
lenging task. Nevertheless, IR-based tech-
niques provide a strong baseline on top
of which more sophisticated language pro-
cessing techniques can be deployed.
