We present an online cascaded approach to
biomedical named entity recognition. This
approach uses an online training method
to substantially reduce the training time re-
quired and a cascaded framework to relax
the memory requirement. We conduct de-
tailed experiments on the BioNLP dataset
from the JNLPBA shared task and com-
pare the results with other systems and pub-
lished works. Our experimental results show
that our approach achieves comparable per-
formance with great reductions in time and
space requirements.
