It is necessary to find a proper arrangement of sen-
tences in order to generate a well-organized sum-
mary from multiple documents. In this paper we de-
scribe an approach to coherent sentence ordering for
summarizing newspaper articles. Since there is no
guarantee that chronological ordering of extracted
sentences, which is widely used by conventional sum-
marization system, arranges each sentence behind
presupposed information of the sentence, we improve
chronological ordering by resolving antecedent sen-
tences of arranged sentences. Combining the re-
finement algorithm with topical segmentation and
chronological ordering, we address our experiment to
test the effectiveness of the proposed method. The
results reveal that the proposed method improves
chronological sentence ordering.
