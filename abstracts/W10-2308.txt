As an initial effort to identify universal
and language-specific factors that influ-
ence the behavior of distributional models,
we have formulated a distributionally de-
termined word similarity network model,
implemented it for eleven different lan-
guages, and compared the resulting net-
works. In the model, vertices constitute
words and two words are linked if they oc-
cur in similar contexts. The model is found
to capture clear isomorphisms across lan-
guages in terms of syntactic and semantic
classes, as well as functional categories of
abstract discourse markers. Language spe-
cific morphology is found to be a dominat-
ing factor for the accuracy of the model.
