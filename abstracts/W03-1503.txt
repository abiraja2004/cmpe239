We are aiming to acquire named entity
(NE) translation knowledge from non-
parallel, content-aligned corpora, by uti-
lizing NE extraction techniques. For this
research, we are constructing a Japanese-
English broadcast news corpus with NE
tags. The tags represent not only NE
class information but also coreference in-
formation within the same monolingual
document and between corresponding
Japanese-English document pairs. Anal-
ysis of about 1,100 annotated article pairs
has shown that if NE occurrence informa-
tion, such as classes, number of occur-
rence and occurrence order, is given for
each language, it may provide a good clue
for corresponding NEs across languages.
