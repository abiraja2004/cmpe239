Computational humor will be needed in
interfaces, no less than other cognitive
capabilities. There are many practi-
cal settings where computational humor
will add value. Among them there are:
business world applications (such as ad-
vertisement, e-commerce, etc.), general
computer-mediated communication and
human-computer interaction, increase in
the friendliness of natural language inter-
faces, educational and edutainment sys-
tems. In particular in the educational
field it is an important resource for get-
ting selective attention, help in memoriz-
ing names and situations etc. And we all
know how well it works with children.
Automated humor production in general
is a very difficult task but we wanted to
prove that some results can be achieved
even in short time. We have worked at
a concrete limited problem, as the core
of the European Project HAHAcronym.
The main goal of HAHAcronym has been
the realization of an acronym ironic re-
analyzer and generator as a proof of con-
cept in a focalized but non restricted con-
text. To implement this system some gen-
eral tools have been adapted, or developed
for the humorous context. Systems output
has been submitted to evaluation by hu-
man subjects, with a very positive result.
