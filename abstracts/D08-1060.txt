Syntactic word reordering is essential for
translations across different grammar struc-
tures between syntactically distant language-
pairs. In this paper, we propose to em-
bed local and non-local word reordering de-
cisions in a synchronous context free gram-
mar, and leverages the grammar in a chart-
based decoder. Local word-reordering is ef-
fectively encoded in Hiero-like rules; whereas
non-local word-reordering, which allows for
long-range movements of syntactic chunks,
is represented in tree-based reordering rules,
which contain variables correspond to source-
side syntactic constituents. We demonstrate
how these rules are learned from parallel cor-
pora. Our proposed shallow Tree-to-String
rules show significant improvements in trans-
lation quality across different test sets.
