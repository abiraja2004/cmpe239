 
Current sentiment analysis systems rely on 
static (context independent) sentiment 
lexica with proximity based fixed-point 
prior polarities. However, sentiment-
orientation changes with context and these 
lexical resources give no indication of 
which value to pick at what context. The 
general trend is to pick the highest one, but 
which that is may vary at context. To 
overcome the problems of the present 
proximity-based static sentiment lexicon 
techniques, the paper proposes a new way 
to represent sentiment knowledge in a 
Vector Space Model. This model can store 
dynamic prior polarity with varying 
contextual information. The representation 
of the sentiment knowledge in the 
Conceptual Spaces of distributional 
Semantics is termed Sentimantics.
