This paper presents a novel approach for ex-
ploiting the global context for the task of
word sense disambiguation (WSD). This is
done by using topic features constructed us-
ing the latent dirichlet alocation (LDA) al-
gorithm on unlabeled data. The features are
incorporated into a modified na??ve Bayes
network alongside other features such as
part-of-speech of neighboring words, single
words in the surrounding context, local col-
locations, and syntactic patterns. In both the
English all-words task and the English lex-
ical sample task, the method achieved sig-
nificant improvement over the simple na??ve
Bayes classifier and higher accuracy than the
best official scores on Senseval-3 for both
task.
