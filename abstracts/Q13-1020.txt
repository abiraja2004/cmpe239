 
In current research, most tree-based translation 
models are built directly from parse trees. In 
this study, we go in another direction and build 
a translation model with an unsupervised tree 
structure derived from a novel non-parametric 
Bayesian model. In the model, we utilize 
synchronous tree substitution grammars (STSG) 
to capture the bilingual mapping between 
language pairs. To train the model efficiently, 
we develop a Gibbs sampler with three novel 
Gibbs operators. The sampler is capable of 
exploring the infinite space of tree structures by 
performing local changes on the tree nodes. 
Experimental results show that the string-to-
tree translation system using our Bayesian tree 
structures significantly outperforms the strong 
baseline string-to-tree system using parse trees.
