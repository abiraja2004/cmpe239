In this paper, we consider the computational
modelling of human plausibility judgements
for verb-relation-argument triples, a task
equivalent to the computation of selectional
preferences. Such models have applications
both in psycholinguistics and in computa-
tional linguistics.
By extending a recent model, we obtain
a completely corpus-driven model for this
task which achieves significant correlations
with human judgements. It rivals or exceeds
deeper, resource-driven models while exhibit-
ing higher coverage. Moreover, we show that
our model can be combined with deeper mod-
els to obtain better predictions than from ei-
ther model alone.
