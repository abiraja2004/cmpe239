We propose a new method for reformat-
ting web documents by extracting seman-
tic structures from web pages. Our ap-
proach is to extract trees that describe hier-
archical relations in documents. We devel-
oped an algorithm for this task by employ-
ing the EM algorithm and clustering tech-
niques. Preliminary experiments showed
that our approach was more effective than
baseline methods.
