Mining the answer of a natural lan-
guage open-domain question in a large
collection of on-line documents is made
possible by the recognition of the ex-
pected answer type in relevant text pas-
sages. If the technology of retriev-
ing texts where the answer might be
found is well developed, few studies
have been devoted to the recognition of
the answer type.
This paper presents a unified model of
answer types for open-domain Ques-
tion/Answering that enables the discov-
ery of exact answers. The evaluation
of the model, performed on real-world
questions, considers both the correct-
ness and the coverage of the answer
types as well as their contribution to an-
swer precision.
