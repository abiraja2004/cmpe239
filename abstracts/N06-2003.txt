 
We introduce a novel topic segmentation 
approach that combines evidence of topic 
shifts from lexical cohesion with linguistic 
evidence such as syntactically distinct fea-
tures of segment initial contributions.  Our 
evaluation demonstrates that this hybrid 
approach outperforms state-of-the-art algo-
rithms even when applied to loosely struc-
tured, spontaneous dialogue.
