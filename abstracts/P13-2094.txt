 
The task of review rating prediction can be 
well addressed by using regression algorithms 
if there is a reliable training set of reviews 
with human ratings. In this paper, we aim to 
investigate  a more challenging task of cross-
language review rating prediction, which 
makes use of only rated reviews in a source 
language (e.g. English) to predict the rating 
scores of unrated reviews in a target language 
(e.g. German). We propose a new co-
regression algorithm to address this task by 
leveraging unlabeled reviews.  Evaluation re-
sults on several datasets show that our pro-
posed co-regression algorithm can consistently 
improve the prediction results.
