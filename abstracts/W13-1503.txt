 
One of the populations that often needs some 
form of help to read everyday documents is 
non-native speakers. This paper discusses aid 
at the word and word string levels and focuses 
on the possibility of using translation and 
simplification. Seen from the perspective of 
the non-native as an ever-learning reader, we 
show how translation may be of more harm 
than help in understanding and retaining the 
meaning of a word while simplification holds 
promise. We conclude that if reading every-
day documents can be considered as a learn-
ing activity as well as a practical necessity, 
then our study reinforces the arguments that 
defend the use of simplification to make docu-
ments that non-natives need to read more ac-
cessible.
