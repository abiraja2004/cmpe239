We present progress on Joshua, an open-
source decoder for hierarchical and syntax-
based machine translation. The main fo-
cus is describing Thrax, a flexible, open
source synchronous context-free grammar ex-
tractor. Thrax extracts both hierarchical (Chi-
ang, 2007) and syntax-augmented machine
translation (Zollmann and Venugopal, 2006)
grammars. It is built on Apache Hadoop for
efficient distributed performance, and can eas-
ily be extended with support for new gram-
mars, feature functions, and output formats.
