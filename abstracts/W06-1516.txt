In this paper, we introduce SEMTAG, a
toolbox for TAG-based parsing and gen-
eration. This environment supports the
development of wide-coverage grammars
and differs from existing environments
for TAG such as XTAG, (XTAG-Research-
Group, 2001) in that it includes a semantic
dimension. SEMTAG is open-source and
freely available.
