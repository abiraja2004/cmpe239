This paper presents the systems that we par-
ticipated with in the Semantic Text Similar-
ity task at SEMEVAL 2012. Based on prior
research in semantic similarity and related-
ness, we combine various methods in a ma-
chine learning framework. The three varia-
tions submitted during the task evaluation pe-
riod ranked number 5, 9 and 14 among the 89
participating systems. Our evaluations show
that corpus-based methods display a more ro-
bust behavior on the training data, yet com-
bining a variety of methods allows a learning
algorithm to achieve a superior decision than
that achievable by any of the individual parts.
