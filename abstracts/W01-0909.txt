Many Natural Language Processing ap-
plications require semantic knowledge
about topics in order to be possible or to
be efficient. So we developed a system,
SEGAPSITH, that acquires it automat-
ically from text segments by using an
unsupervised and incremental cluster-
ing method. In such an approach, an
important problem consists of the vali-
dation of the learned classes. To do that,
we applied another clustering method,
that only needs to know the number
of classes to build, on the same sub-
set of text segments and we reformu-
late our evaluation problem in compar-
ing the two classifications. So, we es-
tablished different criteria to compare
them, based either on the words as class
descriptors or on the thematic units.
Our first results lead to show a great
correlation between the two classifica-
tions.
