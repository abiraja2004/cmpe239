While domain adaptation techniques for
SMT have proven to be effective at im-
proving translation quality, their practical-
ity for a multi-domain environment is of-
ten limited because of the computational
and human costs of developing and main-
taining multiple systems adapted to differ-
ent domains. We present an architecture
that delays the computation of translation
model features until decoding, allowing
for the application of mixture-modeling
techniques at decoding time. We also de-
scribe a method for unsupervised adapta-
tion with development and test data from
multiple domains. Experimental results on
two language pairs demonstrate the effec-
tiveness of both our translation model ar-
chitecture and automatic clustering, with
gains of up to 1 BLEU over unadapted sys-
tems and single-domain adaptation.
