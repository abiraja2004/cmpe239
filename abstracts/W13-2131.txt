This abstract describes a contribution
to the 2013 KBGen Challenge from
CNRS/LORIA and the University of Lor-
raine. Our contribution focuses on an
attempt to automate the extraction of a
Feature Based Tree Adjoining Grammar
equipped with a unification based compo-
sitional semantics which can be used to
generate from KBGen data.
