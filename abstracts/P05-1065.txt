Reading proficiency is a fundamen-
tal component of language competency.
However, finding topical texts at an appro-
priate reading level for foreign and sec-
ond language learners is a challenge for
teachers. This task can be addressed with
natural language processing technology to
assess reading level. Existing measures
of reading level are not well suited to
this task, but previous work and our own
pilot experiments have shown the bene-
fit of using statistical language models.
In this paper, we also use support vector
machines to combine features from tradi-
tional reading level measures, statistical
language models, and other language pro-
cessing tools to produce a better method
of assessing reading level.
