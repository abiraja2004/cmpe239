 
We argue that in general, the analysis of lexical co- 
hesion factors in a document can drive a summarizer, 
as well as enable other content characterization tasks. 
More narrowly, this paper focuses on how one particular 
cohesion factol~simple l xical repetition--can enhance 
an existing sentence xtraction summarizer, by enabling 
strategies for overcoming some particularly jarring end- 
user effects in the summaries, typically due to coher- 
ence degradation, readability deterioration, and topical 
under-representation. Lexical repetition is instrumental 
to, among other things, the topical make-up of a text, and 
in our framework a lexical repetition-based model of dis- 
course segmentation, capable of detecting topic shifts, is 
integrated with a linguistically-aware summarizer utiliz- 
ing notions of salience and dynamically-adjustable sum- 
mary size. We show that even by leveraging lexical rep- 
etition alone, summaries are of comparable, and under 
certain conditions bette~, quality than the ones delivered 
by a state-of-the-art summarizer. This is encouraging for 
a broad research platform focusing on the recognition 
and use of cohesive devices in text for a range of content 
characterisation a d document management tasks.
