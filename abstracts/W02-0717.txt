Performance and usability of real-
world speech-to-speech translation sys-
tems, like the one developed within
the Nespole! project, are aected by
several aspects that go beyond the
pure translation quality provided by
the underlying components of the sys-
tem. In this paper we describe these
aspects as perspectives along which
we have evaluated the Nespole! sys-
tem. Four main issues are investigated:
(1) assessing system performance un-
der various network trac conditions;
(2) a study on the usage and utility of
multi-modality in the context of multi-
lingual communication; (3) a compar-
ison of the features of the individual
speech recognition engines, and (4) an
end-to-end evaluation of the system.
