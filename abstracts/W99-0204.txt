 
This paper discusses how to automatically gen- 
erate slide shows. The reported presenta- 
tion system inputs documents annotated with 
the GDA tagset, an XML tagset which allows 
machines to automatically infer the semantic 
structure underlying the raw documents. The 
system picks up important opics in the in- 
put document on the basis of the semantic de- 
pendencies and coreferences identified from the 
tags. This topic selection depends also on inter- 
actions with the audience, leading to dynamic 
adaptation of the presentation. A slide is com- 
posed for each topic by extracting relevant sen- 
tences and paraphrasing them to an itemized 
summary. Some heuristics are employed here 
for paraphrasing and layout. Since the GDA 
tagset is independent of the domain and style 
of documents and applicable to diverse natu- 
ral languages, the reported system is also do- 
main/style independent and easy to adapt to 
different languages.
