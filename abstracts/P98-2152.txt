 
We present a novel OCR error correction method 
for languages without word delimiters that have a 
large character set, such as Japanese and Chinese. 
It consists of a statistical OCR model, an approxi- 
mate word matching method using character shape 
similarity, and a word segmentation algorithm us- 
ing a statistical language model. By using a sta- 
tistical OCR model and character shape similarity, 
the proposed error corrector outperforms the previ- 
ously published method. When the baseline char- 
acter recognition accuracy is 90%, it achieves 97.4% 
character recognition accuracy.
