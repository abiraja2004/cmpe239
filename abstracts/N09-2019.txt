We describe a simple strategy to achieve trans-
lation performance improvements by combin-
ing output from identical statistical machine
translation systems trained on alternative mor-
phological decompositions of the source lan-
guage. Combination is done by means of Min-
imum Bayes Risk decoding over a shared N-
best list. When translating into English from
two highly inflected languages such as Ara-
bic and Finnish we obtain significant improve-
ments over simply selecting the best morpho-
logical decomposition.
