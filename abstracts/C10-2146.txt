We present a web-based algorithm for the
task of POS tagging of unknown words
(words appearing only a small number
of times in the training data of a super-
vised POS tagger). When a sentence s
containing an unknown word u is to be
tagged by a trained POS tagger, our algo-
rithm collects from the web contexts that
are partially similar to the context of u in
s, which are then used to compute new
tag assignment probabilities for u. Our
algorithm enables fast multi-domain un-
known word tagging, since, unlike pre-
vious work, it does not require a corpus
from the new domain. We integrate our
algorithm into the MXPOST POS tagger
(Ratnaparkhi, 1996) and experiment with
three languages (English, German and
Chinese) in seven in-domain and domain
adaptation scenarios. Our algorithm pro-
vides an error reduction of up to 15.63%
(English), 18.09% (German) and 13.57%
(Chinese) over the original tagger.
