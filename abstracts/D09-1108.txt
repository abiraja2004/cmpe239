 
In a linguistically-motivated syntax-based trans-
lation system, the entire translation process is 
normally carried out in two steps, translation 
rule matching and target sentence decoding us-
ing the matched rules. Both steps are very time-
consuming due to the tremendous number of 
translation rules, the exhaustive search in trans-
lation rule matching and the complex nature of 
the translation task itself. In this paper, we pro-
pose a hyper-tree-based fast algorithm for trans-
lation rule matching. Experimental results on 
the NIST MT-2003 Chinese-English translation 
task show that our algorithm is at least 19 times 
faster in rule matching and is able to help to 
save 57% of overall translation time over previ-
ous methods when using large fragment transla-
tion rules.
