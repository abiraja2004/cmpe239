This paper describes the 2007 Ngram-based sta-
tistical machine translation system developed at
the TALP Research Center of the UPC (Uni-
versitat Polite`cnica de Catalunya) in Barcelona.
Emphasis is put on improvements and extensions
of the previous years system, being highlighted
and empirically compared. Mainly, these include
a novel word ordering strategy based on: (1) sta-
tistically monotonizing the training source cor-
pus and (2) a novel reordering approach based
on weighted reordering graphs. In addition, this
system introduces a target language model based
on statistical classes, a feature for out-of-domain
units and an improved optimization procedure.
The paper provides details of this system par-
ticipation in the ACL 2007 SECOND WORK-
SHOP ON STATISTICAL MACHINE TRANSLA-
TION. Results on three pairs of languages are
reported, namely from Spanish, French and Ger-
man into English (and the other way round) for
both the in-domain and out-of-domain tasks.
