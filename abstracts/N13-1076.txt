We consider the task of tagging Arabic nouns
with WordNet supersenses. Three approaches
are evaluated. The first uses an expert-
crafted but limited-coverage lexicon, Arabic
WordNet, and heuristics. The second uses un-
supervised sequence modeling. The third and
most successful approach uses machine trans-
lation to translate the Arabic into English,
which is automatically tagged with English
supersenses, the results of which are then pro-
jected back into Arabic. Analysis shows gains
and remaining obstacles in four Wikipedia
topical domains.
