We address the problem of using partially la-
belled data, eg large collections were only little
data is annotated, for extracting biological en-
tities. Our approach relies on a combination of
probabilistic models, which we use to model the
generation of entities and their context, and ker-
nel machines, which implement powerful cate-
gorisers based on a similarity measure and some
labelled data. This combination takes the form
of the so-called Fisher kernels which implement
a similarity based on an underlying probabilistic
model. Such kernels are compared with trans-
ductive inference, an alternative approach to
combining labelled and unlabelled data, again
coupled with Support Vector Machines. Exper-
iments are performed on a database of abstracts
extracted from Medline.
