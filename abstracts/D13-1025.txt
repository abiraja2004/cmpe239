Current automatic machine translation sys-
tems are not able to generate error-free trans-
lations and human intervention is often re-
quired to correct their output. Alternatively,
an interactive framework that integrates the
human knowledge into the translation pro-
cess has been presented in previous works.
Here, we describe a new interactive ma-
chine translation approach that is able to work
with phrase-based and hierarchical translation
models, and integrates error-correction all in
a unified statistical framework. In our experi-
ments, our approach outperforms previous in-
teractive translation systems, and achieves es-
timated effort reductions of as much as 48%
relative over a traditional post-edition system.
