We describe the use of XML tokenisa-
tion, tagging and mark-up tools to pre-
pare a corpus for parsing. Our tech-
niques are generally applicable but here
we focus on parsing Medline abstracts
with the ANLT wide-coverage grammar.
Hand-crafted grammars inevitably lack
coverage but many coverage failures
are due to inadequacies of their lexi-
cons. We describe a method of gain-
ing a degree of robustness by interfac-
ing POS tag information with the exist-
ing lexicon. We also show that XML
tools provide a sophisticated approach
to pre-processing, helping to ameliorate
the ?messiness? in real language data
and improve parse performance.
