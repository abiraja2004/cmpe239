We present the first full-scale event extrac-
tion experiment covering the titles and ab-
stracts of all PubMed citations. Extraction
is performed using a pipeline composed
of state-of-the-art methods: the BANNER
named entity recognizer, the McClosky-
Charniak domain-adapted parser, and the
Turku Event Extraction System. We an-
alyze the statistical properties of the re-
sulting dataset and present evaluations of
the core event extraction as well as nega-
tion and speculation detection components
of the system. Further, we study in de-
tail the set of extracted events relevant
to the apoptosis pathway to gain insight
into the biological relevance of the result.
The dataset, consisting of 19.2 million oc-
currences of 4.5 million unique events,
is freely available for use in research at
http://bionlp.utu.fi/.
