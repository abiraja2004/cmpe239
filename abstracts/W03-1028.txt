In this paper, experiments on automatic
extraction of keywords from abstracts us-
ing a supervised machine learning algo-
rithm are discussed. The main point of this
paper is that by adding linguistic know-
ledge to the representation (such as syn-
tactic features), rather than relying only on
statistics (such as term frequency and n-
grams), a better result is obtained as mea-
sured by keywords previously assigned by
professional indexers. In more detail, ex-
tracting NP-chunks gives a better preci-
sion than n-grams, and by adding the POS
tag(s) assigned to the term as a feature, a
dramatic improvement of the results is ob-
tained, independent of the term selection
approach applied.
