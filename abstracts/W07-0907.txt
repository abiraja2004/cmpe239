This research is concerned with making
recommendations to museum visitors
based on their history within the physical
environment, and textual information
associated with each item in their history.
We investigate a method of providing
such recommendations to users through
a combination of language modelling
techniques, geospatial modelling of
the physical space, and observation of
sequences of locations visited by other
users in the past. This study compares
and analyses different methods of path
prediction including an adapted naive
Bayes method, document similarity, visitor
feedback and measures of lexical similarity.
