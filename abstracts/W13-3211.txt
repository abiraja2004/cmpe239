We present a novel compositional, gener-
ative model for vector space representa-
tions of meaning. This model reformulates
earlier tensor-based approaches to vector
space semantics as a top-down process,
and provides efficient algorithms for trans-
formation from natural language to vectors
and from vectors to natural language. We
describe procedures for estimating the pa-
rameters of the model from positive exam-
ples of similar phrases, and from distribu-
tional representations, then use these pro-
cedures to obtain similarity judgments for
a set of adjective-noun pairs. The model?s
estimation of the similarity of these pairs
correlates well with human annotations,
demonstrating a substantial improvement
over several existing compositional ap-
proaches in both settings.
