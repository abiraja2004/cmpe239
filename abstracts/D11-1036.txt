Methods for evaluating dependency parsing
using attachment scores are highly sensitive
to representational variation between depen-
dency treebanks, making cross-experimental
evaluation opaque. This paper develops a ro-
bust procedure for cross-experimental eval-
uation, based on deterministic unification-
based operations for harmonizing different
representations and a refined notion of tree
edit distance for evaluating parse hypothe-
ses relative to multiple gold standards. We
demonstrate that, for different conversions of
the Penn Treebank into dependencies, perfor-
mance trends that are observed for parsing
results in isolation change or dissolve com-
pletely when parse hypotheses are normalized
and brought into the same common ground.
