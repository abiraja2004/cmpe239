In this paper we have designed and experi-
mented novel convolution kernels for automatic
classification of predicate arguments. Their
main property is the ability to process struc-
tured representations. Support Vector Ma-
chines (SVMs), using a combination of such ker-
nels and the flat feature kernel, classify Prop-
Bank predicate arguments with accuracy higher
than the current argument classification state-
of-the-art.
Additionally, experiments on FrameNet data
have shown that SVMs are appealing for the
classification of semantic roles even if the pro-
posed kernels do not produce any improvement.
