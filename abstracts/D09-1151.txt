This paper proposes a probabilistic model
for associative anaphora resolution in
Japanese. Associative anaphora is a
type of bridging anaphora, in which the
anaphor and its antecedent are not coref-
erent. Our model regards associative
anaphora as a kind of zero anaphora and
resolves it in the same manner as zero
anaphora resolution using automatically
acquired lexical knowledge. Experimen-
tal results show that our model resolves
associative anaphora with good perfor-
mance and the performance is improved
by resolving it simultaneously with zero
anaphora.
