This paper describes the University of
Sheffield?s submission to SemEval-2012 Task
6: Semantic Text Similarity. Two approaches
were developed. The first is an unsupervised
technique based on the widely used vector
space model and information from WordNet.
The second method relies on supervised ma-
chine learning and represents each sentence as
a set of n-grams. This approach also makes
use of information from WordNet. Results
from the formal evaluation show that both ap-
proaches are useful for determining the simi-
larity in meaning between pairs of sentences
with the best performance being obtained by
the supervised approach. Incorporating infor-
mation from WordNet alo improves perfor-
mance for both approaches.
