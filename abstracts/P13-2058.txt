We present an approach to mine com-
parable data for parallel sentences us-
ing translation-based cross-lingual infor-
mation retrieval (CLIR). By iteratively al-
ternating between the tasks of retrieval
and translation, an initial general-domain
model is allowed to adapt to in-domain
data. Adaptation is done by training the
translation system on a few thousand sen-
tences retrieved in the step before. Our
setup is time- and memory-efficient and of
similar quality as CLIR-based adaptation
on millions of parallel sentences.
