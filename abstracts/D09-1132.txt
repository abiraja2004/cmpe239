We present a system that finds short def-
initions of terms on Web pages. It em-
ploys a Maximum Entropy classifier, but it
is trained on automatically generated ex-
amples; hence, it is in effect unsupervised.
We use ROUGE-W to generate training ex-
amples from encyclopedias and Web snip-
pets, a method that outperforms an alter-
native centroid-based one. After training,
our system can be used to find definitions
of terms that are not covered by encyclo-
pedias. The system outperforms a compa-
rable publicly available system, as well as
a previously published form of our system.
