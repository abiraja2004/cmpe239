We present a system called AESOP that au-
tomatically produces affect states associated
with characters in a story. This research repre-
sents a first step toward the automatic genera-
tion of plot unit structures from text. AESOP
incorporates several existing sentiment analy-
sis tools and lexicons to evaluate the effective-
ness of current sentiment technology on this
task. AESOP also includes two novel compo-
nents: a method for acquiring patient polar-
ity verbs, which impart negative affect on their
patients, and affect projection rules to propa-
gate affect tags from surrounding words onto
the characters in the story. We evaluate AE-
SOP on a small collection of fables.
