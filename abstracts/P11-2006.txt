In bootstrapping (seed set expansion), select-
ing good seeds and creating stop lists are two
effective ways to reduce semantic drift, but
these methods generally need human super-
vision. In this paper, we propose a graph-
based approach to helping editors choose ef-
fective seeds and stop list instances, appli-
cable to Pantel and Pennacchiotti?s Espresso
bootstrapping algorithm. The idea is to select
seeds and create a stop list using the rankings
of instances and patterns computed by Klein-
berg?s HITS algorithm. Experimental results
on a variation of the lexical sample task show
the effectiveness of our method.
