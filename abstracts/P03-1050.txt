This paper presents an unsupervised learn-
ing approach to building a non-English
(Arabic) stemmer. The stemming model
is based on statistical machine translation
and it uses an English stemmer and a small
(10K sentences) parallel corpus as its sole
training resources. No parallel text is
needed after the training phase. Mono-
lingual, unannotated text can be used to
further improve the stemmer by allow-
ing it to adapt to a desired domain or
genre. Examples and results will be given
for Arabic , but the approach is applica-
ble to any language that needs affix re-
moval. Our resource-frugal approach re-
sults in 87.5% agreement with a state of
the art, proprietary Arabic stemmer built
using rules, affix lists, and human anno-
tated text, in addition to an unsupervised
component. Task-based evaluation using
Arabic information retrieval indicates an
improvement of 22-38% in average pre-
cision over unstemmed text, and 96% of
the performance of the proprietary stem-
mer above.
