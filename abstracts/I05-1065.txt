. In this paper, a resolution system is presented to tackle nominal and 
pronominal anaphora in biomedical literature by using rich set of syntactic and 
semantic features. Unlike previous researches, the verification of semantic as-
sociation between anaphors and their antecedents is facilitated by exploiting 
more outer resources, including UMLS, WordNet, GENIA Corpus 3.02p and 
PubMed. Moreover, the resolution is implemented with a genetic algorithm on 
its feature selection. Experimental results on different biomedical corpora 
showed that such approach could achieve promising results on resolving the 
two common types of anaphora.
