 
This paper describes classification of typed 
student utterances within AutoTutor, an intel-
ligent tutoring system.  Utterances are classi-
fied to one of 18 categories, including 16 
question categories.  The classifier presented 
uses part of speech tagging, cascaded finite 
state transducers, and simple disambiguation 
rules. Shallow NLP is well suited to the task: 
session log file analysis reveals significant 
classification of eleven question categories, 
frozen expressions, and assertions.
