This paper describes several novel hybrid
semantic similarity measures. We study
various combinations of 16 baseline mea-
sures based on WordNet, Web as a cor-
pus, corpora, dictionaries, and encyclope-
dia. The hybrid measures rely on 8 com-
bination methods and 3 measure selection
techniques and are evaluated on (a) the task
of predicting semantic similarity scores and
(b) the task of predicting semantic relation
between two terms. Our results show that
hybrid measures outperform single mea-
sures by a wide margin, achieving a correla-
tion up to 0.890 and MAP(20) up to 0.995.
