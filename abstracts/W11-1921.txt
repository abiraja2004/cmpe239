 
In this paper, we present our supervised 
learning approach to coreference resolution 
in ConLL corpus. The system relies on a 
maximum entropy-based classifier for pairs 
of mentions, and adopts a rich linguisitical- 
ly motivated feature set, which mostly has 
been introduced by Soon et al(2001), and 
experiment with alternaive resolution proc- 
ess, preprocessing tools,and classifiers. We 
optimize the system?s performance for M- 
UC (Vilain et al 1995), BCUB (Bagga and 
Baldwin, 1998) and CEAF (Luo, 2005) .
