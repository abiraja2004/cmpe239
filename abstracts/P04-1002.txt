The paper reports on progress in building com-
putational models of a constructivist approach to
language development. It introduces a formalism
for construction grammars and learning strategies
based on invention, abduction, and induction. Ex-
amples are drawn from experiments exercising the
model in situated language games played by embod-
ied artificial agents.
