The Why-Atlas tutoring system presents
students with qualitative physics questions
and encourages them to explain their an-
swers via natural language. Although
there are inexpensive techniques for ana-
lyzing explanations, we claim that better
understanding is necessary for use within
tutoring systems. In this paper we de-
scribe how Why-Atlas creates and utilizes
a proof-based representation of student es-
says. We describe how it creates the proof
given the output of sentence-level under-
standing, how it uses the proofs to give
students feedback, some preliminary run-
time measures, and the work we are cur-
rently doing to derive additional benefits
from a proof-based approach for tutoring
applications.
