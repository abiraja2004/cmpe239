We present a general framework to incor-
porate prior knowledge such as heuristics
or linguistic features in statistical generative
word alignment models. Prior knowledge
plays a role of probabilistic soft constraints
between bilingual word pairs that shall be
used to guide word alignment model train-
ing. We investigate knowledge that can be
derived automatically from entropy princi-
ple and bilingual latent semantic analysis
and show how they can be applied to im-
prove translation performance.
