This paper presents on-going work on
constructing bilingual multimodal corpora
of referring expressions in collaborative
problem solving for English and Japanese.
The corpora were collected from dia-
logues in which two participants collab-
oratively solved Tangram puzzles with
a puzzle simulator. Extra-linguistic in-
formation such as operations on puzzle
pieces, mouse cursor position and piece
positions were recorded in synchronisa-
tion with utterances. The speech data
was transcribed and time-aligned with the
extra-linguistic information. Referring
expressions in utterances that refer to puz-
zle pieces were annotated in terms of their
spans, their referents and their other at-
tributes. The Japanese corpus has already
been completed, but the English counter-
part is still undergoing annotation. We
have conducted a preliminary comparative
analysis of both corpora, mainly with re-
spect to task completion time, task suc-
cess rates and attributes of referring ex-
pressions. These corpora showed signif-
icant differences in task completion time
and success rate.
