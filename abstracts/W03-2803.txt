We present new statistical methods for
evaluating information extraction sys-
tems. The methods were developed
to evaluate a system used by polit-
ical scientists to extract event infor-
mation from news leads about inter-
national politics. The nature of this
data presents two problems for evalu-
ators: 1) the frequency distribution of
event types in international event data
is strongly skewed, so a random sample
of newsleads will typically fail to con-
tain any low frequency events. 2) Man-
ual information extraction necessary to
create evaluation sets is costly, and most
effort is wasted coding high frequency
categories .
We present an evaluation scheme that
overcomes these problems with consid-
erably less manual effort than traditional
methods, and also allows us to interpret
an information extraction system as an
estimator (in the statistical sense) and to
estimate its bias.
