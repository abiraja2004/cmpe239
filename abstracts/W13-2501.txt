We propose a data-driven approach to en-
hance translation extraction from compa-
rable corpora. Instead of resorting to an
external dictionary, we translate source
vector features by using a cross-lingual
Word Sense Disambiguation method. The
candidate senses for a feature correspond
to sense clusters of its translations in a
parallel corpus and the context used for
disambiguation consists of the vector that
contains the feature. The translations
found in the disambiguation output con-
vey the sense of the features in the source
vector, while the use of translation clusters
permits to expand their translation with
several variants. As a consequence, the
translated vectors are less noisy and richer,
and allow for the extraction of higher qual-
ity lexicons compared to simpler methods.
