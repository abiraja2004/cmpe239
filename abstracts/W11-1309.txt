A description of a system for measuring the
compositionality of collocations within the
framework of the shared task of the Distribu-
tional Semantics and Compositionality work-
shop (DISCo 2011) is presented. The system
exploits the intuition that a highly composi-
tional collocation would tend to have a consid-
erable semantic overlap with its constituents
(headword and modifier) whereas a colloca-
tion with low compositionality would share
little semantic content with its constituents.
This intuition is operationalised via three con-
figurations that exploit cosine similarity mea-
sures to detect the semantic overlap between
the collocation and its constituents. The sys-
tem performs competitively in the task.
