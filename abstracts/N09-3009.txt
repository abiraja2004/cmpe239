This paper describes research on automati-
cally building rapport. This is done by adapt-
ing responses in a spoken dialog system to
users? emotions as inferred from nonverbal
voice properties. Emotions and their acous-
tic correlates will be extracted from a persua-
sive dialog corpus and will be used to imple-
ment an emotionally intelligent dialog system;
one that can recognize emotion, choose an op-
timal strategy for gaining rapport, and render
a response that contains appropriate emotion,
both lexically and auditory. In order to deter-
mine the value of emotion modeling for gain-
ing rapport in a spoken dialog system, the final
implementation will be evaluated using differ-
ent configurations through a user study.
