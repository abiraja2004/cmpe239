This paper reports the corpus-oriented de-
velopment of a wide-coverage Japanese
HPSG parser. We first created an HPSG
treebank from the EDR corpus by us-
ing heuristic conversion rules, and then
extracted lexical entries from the tree-
bank. The grammar developed using this
method attained wide coverage that could
hardly be obtained by conventional man-
ual development. We also trained a statis-
tical parser for the grammar on the tree-
bank, and evaluated the parser in terms of
the accuracy of semantic-role identifica-
tion and dependency analysis.
