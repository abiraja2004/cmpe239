User logs of search engines have recently
been applied successfully to improve var-
ious aspects of web search quality. In this
paper, we will apply pairs of user queries
and snippets of clicked results to train a
machine translation model to bridge the
?lexical gap? between query and document
space. We show that the combination of
a query-to-snippet translation model with
a large n-gram language model trained
on queries achieves improved contextual
query expansion compared to a system
based on term correlations.
