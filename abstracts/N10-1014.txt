Syntactic machine translation systems cur-
rently use word alignments to infer syntactic
correspondences between the source and tar-
get languages. Instead, we propose an un-
supervised ITG alignment model that directly
aligns syntactic structures. Our model aligns
spans in a source sentence to nodes in a target
parse tree. We show that our model produces
syntactically consistent analyses where possi-
ble, while being robust in the face of syntactic
divergence. Alignment quality and end-to-end
translation experiments demonstrate that this
consistency yields higher quality alignments
than our baseline.
