This paper presents Illinois-Coref, a system
for coreference resolution that participated
in the CoNLL-2011 shared task. We in-
vestigate two inference methods, Best-Link
and All-Link, along with their corresponding,
pairwise and structured, learning protocols.
Within these, we provide a flexible architec-
ture for incorporating linguistically-motivated
constraints, several of which we developed
and integrated. We compare and evaluate the
inference approaches and the contribution of
constraints, analyze the mistakes of the sys-
tem, and discuss the challenges of resolving
coreference for the OntoNotes-4.0 data set.
