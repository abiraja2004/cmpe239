 
Conversational Agents have been shown to be 
effective tutors in a wide range of educational 
domains. However, these agents are often ig-
nored and abused in collaborative learning 
scenarios involving multiple students. In our 
work presented here, we design and evaluate 
interaction strategies motivated from prior re-
search in small group communication. We 
will discuss how such strategies can be im-
plemented in agents. As a first step towards 
evaluating agents that can interact socially, we 
report results showing that human tutors em-
ploying these strategies are able to cover more 
concepts with the students besides being rated 
as better integrated, likeable and friendlier.
