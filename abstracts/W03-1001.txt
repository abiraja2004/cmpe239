In this paper, we describe a phrase-based
unigram model for statistical machine
translation that uses a much simpler set
of model parameters than similar phrase-
based models. The units of translation are
blocks ? pairs of phrases. During decod-
ing, we use a block unigram model and a
word-based trigram language model. Dur-
ing training, the blocks are learned from
source interval projections using an un-
derlying high-precision word alignment.
The system performance is significantly
increased by applying a novel block exten-
sion algorithm using an additional high-
recall word alignment. The blocks are fur-
ther filtered using unigram-count selection
criteria. The system has been successfully
test on a Chinese-English and an Arabic-
English translation task.
