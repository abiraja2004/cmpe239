This paper presents G-FLOW, a novel system
for coherent extractive multi-document sum-
marization (MDS).1 Where previous work on
MDS considered sentence selection and or-
dering separately, G-FLOW introduces a joint
model for selection and ordering that balances
coherence and salience. G-FLOW?s core rep-
resentation is a graph that approximates the
discourse relations across sentences based on
indicators including discourse cues, deverbal
nouns, co-reference, and more. This graph en-
ables G-FLOW to estimate the coherence of a
candidate summary.
We evaluate G-FLOW on Mechanical Turk,
and find that it generates dramatically bet-
ter summaries than an extractive summarizer
based on a pipeline of state-of-the-art sentence
selection and reordering components, under-
scoring the value of our joint model.
