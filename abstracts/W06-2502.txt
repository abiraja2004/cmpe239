As text data becomes plentiful, unsuper-
vised methods for Word Sense Disam-
biguation (WSD) become more viable. A 
problem encountered in applying WSD 
methods is finding the exact number of 
senses an ambiguity has in a training cor-
pus collected in an automated manner. 
That number is not known a priori; rather 
it needs to be determined based on the 
data itself. We address that problem us-
ing cluster stopping methods. Such tech-
niques have not previously applied to 
WSD. We implement the methods of 
Calinski and Harabasz (1975) and Harti-
gan (1975) and our adaptation of the Gap 
statistic (Tibshirani, Walter and Hastie, 
2001). For evaluation, we use the WSD 
Test Set from the National Library of 
Medicine, whose sense inventory is the 
Unified Medical Language System. The 
best accuracy for selecting the correct 
number of clusters is 0.60 with the C&H 
method. Our error analysis shows that the 
cluster stopping methods make finer-
grained sense distinctions by creating ad-
ditional clusters. The highest F-scores 
(82.89), indicative of the quality of clus-
ter membership assignment, are compa-
rable to the baseline majority sense 
(82.63) and point to a path towards accu-
racy improvement via additional cluster 
pruning. The importance and significance 
of the current work is in applying cluster 
stopping rules to WSD.
