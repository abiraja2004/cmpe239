The various ways in which one can re-
fer to the same clinical concept needs to
be accounted for in a semantic resource
such as SNOMED CT. Developing termi-
nological resources manually is, however,
prohibitively expensive and likely to re-
sult in low coverage, especially given the
high variability of language use in clinical
text. To support this process, distributional
methods can be employed in conjunction
with a large corpus of electronic health
records to extract synonym candidates for
clinical terms. In this paper, we exem-
plify the potential of our proposed method
using the Swedish version of SNOMED
CT, which currently lacks synonyms. A
medical expert inspects two thousand term
pairs generated by two semantic spaces ?
one of which models multiword terms in
addition to single words ? for one hundred
preferred terms of the semantic types dis-
order and finding.
