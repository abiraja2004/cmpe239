The Conference on Computational Natural
Language Learning features a shared task, in
which participants train and test their learn-
ing systems on the same data sets. In 2007,
as in 2006, the shared task has been devoted
to dependency parsing, this year with both a
multilingual track and a domain adaptation
track. In this paper, I summarize the main
findings from the 2007 shared task and try
to identify major challenges for the parsing
community based on these findings.
