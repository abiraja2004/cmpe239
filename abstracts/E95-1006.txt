 
This paper defines a language Z~ for spe- 
cifying LFG grammars. This enables 
constraints on LFG's composite onto- 
logy (c-structures ynchronised with f- 
structures) to be stated directly; no ap- 
peal to the LFG construction algorithm 
is needed. We use f to specify schemata 
annotated rules and the LFG uniquen- 
ess, completeness and coherence princip- 
les. Broader issues raised by this work 
are noted and discussed.
