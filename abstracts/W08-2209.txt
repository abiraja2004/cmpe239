In this paper we will present a system for Question Answering called
GETARUNS, in its deep version applicable to closed domains, that is to
say domains for which the lexical semantics is fully specified and does
not have to be induced. In addition, no ontology is needed: semantic re-
lations are derived from linguistic relations encoded in the syntax. The
main tenet of the system is that it is possible to produce consistent seman-
tic representations using a strict linguistic approach without resorting to
extralinguistic knowledge sources. The paper will briefly present the low
level component which is responsible for pronominal binding, quantifier
raising and temporal interpretation. Then it will discuss in more detail
the high level component where a Discourse Model is created from text.
The system has been evaluated on a wide variety of texts from closed
domains, producing full and accurate parsing, semantics and anaphora
resolution for all sentences.
