Automatic assessment of the readability
level (i.e., the relative linguistic complex-
ity) of documents in a large number of
languages is an important problem that
can be applied to many real-world appli-
cations, such as retrieving age-appropriate
search engine results for kids, construct-
ing automatic tutoring systems, and so on.
Unfortunately, existing readability label-
ing techniques have only been applied to
a very small number of languages. In this
paper, we present an extensible crosslin-
guistic readability framework based on the
use of parallel corpora to quickly create
readability software for thousands of lan-
guages, including languages for which no
linguists are available to define readability
rules or for which documents with read-
ability labels are lacking to train readabil-
ity models. To demonstrate our idea, we
developed a system based on the proposed
framework. This paper discusses the theo-
retical and practical issues involved in de-
signing such a system and presents the re-
sults of an experiment conducted with the
system.
