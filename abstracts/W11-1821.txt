Recently, the focus in the BioNLP domain
has shifted from binary relations to more ex-
pressive event representations, largely owing
to the international popularity of the BioNLP
Shared Task (ST) of 2009. This year, the
ST?11 provides a further generalization on
three key aspects: text type, subject domain,
and targeted event types. One of the sup-
porting tasks established to provide more fine-
grained text predictions is the extraction of en-
tity relations. We have implemented an ex-
traction system for such non-causal relations
between named entities and domain terms, ap-
plying semantic spaces and machine learning
techniques. Our system ranks second of four
participating teams, achieving 37.04% preci-
sion, 47.48% recall and 41.62% F-score.
