Many lexical semantic relations, such as
the hyponymy relation, can be extracted
from text as they occur in detectable
syntactic constructions. This paper shows
how a hypernym-hyponym based lexi-
con for Swedish can be created directly
from a news paper corpus. An algorithm
is presented for building partial hierarchi-
cal structures from non domain-specific
texts.
