 
Is it possible to specify a grammatical 
representation (descriptors and their ap- 
plication guidelines) to such a degree 
that it can be consistently applied by 
different grammarians e.g. for producing 
a benchmark corpus for p.arser evalua- 
tion? Arguments for and against have 
been given, but very little empirical ev- 
idence. In this article we report on a 
double-blind experiment with a surface- 
oriented morphosyntactic grammatical 
representation used in a large-scale En- 
glish parser. We argue that a consis- 
tently applicable representation for mor- 
phology and also shallow syntax can be 
specified. A grammatical representation 
with a near-100% coverage of running 
text can be specified with a reasonable 
effort, especially if the representation is 
based on structural distinctions (i.e. it is 
structurally resolvable).
