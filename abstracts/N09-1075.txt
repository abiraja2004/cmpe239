Human sentence processing involves integrat-
ing probabilistic knowledge from a variety of
sources in order to incrementally determine
the hierarchical structure for the serial input
stream. While a large number of sentence pro-
cessing effects have been explained in terms of
comprehenders? rational use of probabilistic
information, effects of local coherences have
not. We present here a new model of local
coherences, viewing them as resulting from a
belief-update process, and show that the rele-
vant probabilities in our model are calculable
from a probabilistic Earley parser. Finally, we
demonstrate empirically that an implemented
version of the model makes the correct predic-
tions for the materials from the original exper-
iment demonstrating local coherence effects.
