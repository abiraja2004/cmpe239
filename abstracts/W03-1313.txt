It is well known that standardising the
annotation of language resources signifi-
cantly raises their potential, as it enables
re-use and spurs the development of com-
mon technologies. Despite the fact that
increasingly complex linguistic informa-
tion is being added to biomedical texts,
no standard solutions have so far been
proposed for their encoding. This pa-
per describes a standardised XML tagset
(DTD) for annotated biomedical corpora
and other resources, which is based on
the Text Encoding Initiative Guidelines
P4, a general and parameterisable stan-
dard for encoding language resources. We
ground the discussion in the encoding of
the GENIA corpus, which currently con-
tains 2,000 abstracts taken from the MED-
LINE database, and has almost 100,000
hand-annotated terms marked for seman-
tic class from the accompanying ontol-
ogy. The paper introduces GENIA and
TEI and implements a TEI parametrisa-
tion and conversion for the GENIA cor-
pus. A number of aspects of biomedi-
cal language are discussed, such as com-
plex tokenisation, prevalence of contrac-
tions and complex terms, and the linkage
and encoding of ontologies.
