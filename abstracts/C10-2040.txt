Verb suffixes and verb complexes of mor-
phologically rich languages carry a lot of
information. We show that this infor-
mation if harnessed for the task of shal-
low parsing can lead to dramatic improve-
ments in accuracy for a morphologically
rich language- Marathi1. The crux of the
approach is to use a powerful morpholog-
ical analyzer backed by a high coverage
lexicon to generate rich features for a CRF
based sequence classifier. Accuracy fig-
ures of 94% for Part of Speech Tagging
and 97% for Chunking using a modestly
sized corpus (20K words) vindicate our
claim that for morphologically rich lan-
guages linguistic insight can obviate the
need for large amount of annotated cor-
pora.
