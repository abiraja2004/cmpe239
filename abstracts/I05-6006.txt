The International Corpus of English is
a corpus of national and regional
varieties of English. The mega-word
British component has been con-
structed, grammatically tagged, and
syntactically parsed. This article is a
description of work that aims at the
automatic induction of a wide-coverage
grammar from this corpus as well as an
empirical evaluation of the grammar. It
first of all describes the corpus and its
annotation schemes and then presents
empirical statistics for the grammar. I
will then evaluate the coverage and the
accuracy of such a grammar when
applied automatically in a parsing
system. Results show that the grammar
enabled the parser to achieve 86.1%
recall rate and 83.5% precision rate.
