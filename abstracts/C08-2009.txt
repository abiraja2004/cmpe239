We introduce a new type of discourse con-
straints for the interaction of discourse re-
lations with the configuration of discourse
segments. We examine corpus-extracted
examples as soft constraints. We show how
to use Regular Tree Gramamrs to process
such constraints, and how the representa-
tion of some constraints depends on the ex-
pressive power of this formalism.
