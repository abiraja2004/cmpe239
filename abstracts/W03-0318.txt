 
We propose a method to split and translate 
input sentences for speech translation in order 
to overcome the long sentence problem. This 
approach is based on three criteria used to 
judge the goodness of translation  results. 
The criteria utilize the output of an MT sys-
tem only and assumes neither a particular lan-
guage nor a particular MT approach. In an 
experiment with an EBMT system, in which 
prior methods cannot work or work badly, the 
proposed split-and-translate method achieves 
much better results in translation  quality.
