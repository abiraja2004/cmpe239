automatically analyze the external function 
and internal structure of the multiword 
chunk(MWC) in a sentence. To deal with 
this problem, we proposed a rule acquisition 
algorithm to automatically learn a chunk 
rule base, under the support of a large scale 
annotated corpus and a lexical knowledge 
base. We also proposed an expectation 
precision index to objectively evaluate the 
descriptive capabilities of the refined rule 
base. Some experimental results indicate 
that the algorithm can acquire about 9% 
useful expanded rules to cover 86% 
annotated positive examples, and improve 
the expectation precision from 51% to 83%. 
These rules can be used to build an efficient 
rule-based Chinese MWC parser.
