We in this paper present the model for our
participation (BCMI) in the CoNLL-2012
Shared Task. This paper describes a pure
rule-based method, which assembles dif-
ferent filters in a proper order. Different
filters handle different situations and the
filtering strategies are designed manually.
These filters are assigned to different or-
dered tiers from general to special cases.
We participated in the Chinese and En-
glish closed tracks, scored 51.83 and 59.24
respectively.
