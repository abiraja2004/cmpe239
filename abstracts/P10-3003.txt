This work models Word Sense Disam-
biguation (WSD) problem as a Dis-
tributed Constraint Optimization Problem
(DCOP). To model WSD as a DCOP,
we view information from various knowl-
edge sources as constraints. DCOP al-
gorithms have the remarkable property to
jointly maximize over a wide range of util-
ity functions associated with these con-
straints. We show how utility functions
can be designed for various knowledge
sources. For the purpose of evaluation,
we modelled all words WSD as a simple
DCOP problem. The results are competi-
tive with state-of-art knowledge based sys-
tems.
