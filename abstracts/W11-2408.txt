Reasoning about ordinary human situations
and activities requires the availability of di-
verse types of knowledge, including expecta-
tions about the probable results of actions and
the lexical entailments for many predicates.
We describe initial work to acquire such a col-
lection of conditional (if?then) knowledge by
exploiting presuppositional discourse patterns
(such as ones involving ?but?, ?yet?, and ?hop-
ing to?) and abstracting the matched material
into general rules.
