In this paper, we introduce a new semi-supervised learning
model for word sense disambiguation based on Kernel Prin-
cipal Component Analysis (KPCA), with experiments showing
that it can further improve accuracy over supervised KPCA
models that have achieved WSD accuracy superior to the best
published individual models. Although empirical results with
supervised KPCA models demonstrate significantly better ac-
curacy compared to the state-of-the-art achieved by either na??ve
Bayes or maximum entropy models on Senseval-2 data, we
identify specific sparse data conditions under which supervised
KPCA models deteriorate to essentially a most-frequent-sense
predictor. We discuss the potential of KPCA for leveraging
unannotated data for partially-unsupervised training to address
these issues, leading to a composite model that combines both
the supervised and semi-supervised models.
