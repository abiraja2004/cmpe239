The mapping from phonetic categories to
acoustic cue values is highly flexible, and
adapts rapidly in response to exposure. There
is currently, however, no theoretical frame-
work which captures the range of this adap-
tation. We develop a novel approach to mod-
eling phonetic adaptation via a belief-updating
model, and demonstrate that this model natu-
rally unifies two adaptation phenomena tradi-
tionally considered to be distinct.
