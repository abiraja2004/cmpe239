We present MAGEAD, a morphological
analyzer and generator for the Arabic
language family. Our work is novel
in that it explicitly addresses the need
for processing the morphology of the di-
alects. MAGEAD provides an analysis to
a root+pattern representation, it has sep-
arate phonological and orthographic rep-
resentations, and it allows for combining
morphemes from different dialects.
