This paper describes a novel Bayesian ap-
proach to unsupervised topic segmentation.
Unsupervised systems for this task are driven
by lexical cohesion: the tendency of well-
formed segments to induce a compact and
consistent lexical distribution. We show that
lexical cohesion can be placed in a Bayesian
context by modeling the words in each topic
segment as draws from a multinomial lan-
guage model associated with the segment;
maximizing the observation likelihood in such
a model yields a lexically-cohesive segmenta-
tion. This contrasts with previous approaches,
which relied on hand-crafted cohesion met-
rics. The Bayesian framework provides a prin-
cipled way to incorporate additional features
such as cue phrases, a powerful indicator of
discourse structure that has not been previ-
ously used in unsupervised segmentation sys-
tems. Our model yields consistent improve-
ments over an array of state-of-the-art systems
on both text and speech datasets. We also
show that both an entropy-based analysis and
a well-known previous technique can be de-
rived as special cases of the Bayesian frame-
