 
This paper presents the annotation 
guidelines and specifications which have 
been developed for the creation of the 
Italian TimeBank, a language resource 
composed of two corpora manually 
annotated with temporal and event 
information. In particular, the adaptation 
of the TimeML scheme to Italian is 
described, and a special attention is 
given to the methodology used for the 
realization of the annotation 
specifications, which are strategic in 
order to create good quality annotated 
resources and to justify the annotated 
items. The reliability of the It-TimeML 
guidelines and specifications is 
evaluated on the basis of the results of 
the inter-coder agreement performed 
during the annotation of the two corpora.
