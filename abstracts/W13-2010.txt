We participated in the BioNLP 2013 shared
tasks, addressing the GENIA (GE) and the Can-
cer Genetics (CG) event extraction tasks. Our
event extraction is based on the system we re-
cently proposed for mining relations and events
involving genes or proteins in the biomedical
literature using a novel, approximate subgraph
matching-based approach. In addition to han-
dling the GE task involving 13 event types uni-
formly related to molecular biology, we gener-
alized our system to address the CG task tar-
geting a challenging set of 40 event types re-
lated to cancer biology with various arguments
involving 18 kinds of biological entities. More-
over, we attempted to integrate a distributional
similarity model into our system to extend the
graph matching scheme for more events. In ad-
dition, we evaluated the impact of using paths of
all possible lengths among event participants as
key contextual dependencies to extract potential
events as compared to using only the shortest
paths within the framework of our system.
We achieved a 46.38% F-score in the CG task
and a 48.93% F-score in the GE task, ranking
3rd and 4th respectively. The consistent perfor-
mance confirms that our system generalizes well
to various event extraction tasks and scales to
handle a large number of event and entity types.
