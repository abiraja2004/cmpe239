doctoral research in progress focused 
on a new genre: online 
encyclopaedias. The  introduction to 
Wikipedia and Encyclopaedia 
Britannica Online will be followed by 
a presentation of wiki as a new textual 
genre. Wikipedia analysis will focus 
firstly on the investigation of the 
?WikiLanguage?, the language used in 
official encyclopaedic articles. 
Secondly, the ?WikiSpeak?, the 
spoken-written language used by  
Wikipedians in their backstage and 
informal community, will be taken 
into account. The initial findings of 
this research seem to suggest that, the 
language of the Wikipedia?s co-
authored articles is formal and 
standardized in a way similar to that 
found in Encyclopaedia Britannica 
Online. By contrast, the WikiSpeak, as 
a new variety of NetSpeak Jargon, can 
be considered as a creative domain, an 
independent and individual expression 
of linguistic freedom of self-
representation, characterizing the wiki 
Computer Mediated Discourse 
Community.
