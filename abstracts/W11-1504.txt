e-Research explores the possibilities offered
by ICT for science and technology. Its goal is
to allow a better access to computing power,
data and library resources. In essence e-
Research is all about cyberstructure and being
connected in ways that might change how we
perceive scientific creation. The present work
advocates open access to scientific data for lin-
guists and language experts working within
the Humanities. By describing the modules of
an online application, we would like to out-
line how a linguistic tool can help the lin-
guist. Work with data, from its creation to
its integration into a publication is not rarely
perceived as a chore. Given the right tools
however, it can become a meaningful part of
the linguistic investigation. The standard for-
mat for linguistic data in the Humanities is In-
terlinear Glosses. As such they represent a
valuable resource even though linguists tend
to disagree about the role and the methods
by which data should influence linguistic ex-
ploration (Lehmann, 2004). In describing the
components of our system we focus on the po-
tential that this tool holds for real-time data-
sharing and continuous dissemination of re-
search results throughout the life-cycle of a
linguistic project.
