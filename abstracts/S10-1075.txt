We describe the University of Sheffield
system used in the TempEval-2 challenge,
USFD2. The challenge requires the au-
tomatic identification of temporal entities
and relations in text.
USFD2 identifies and anchors temporal
expressions, and also attempts two of the
four temporal relation assignment tasks.
A rule-based system picks out and an-
chors temporal expressions, and a max-
imum entropy classifier assigns temporal
link labels, based on features that include
descriptions of associated temporal signal
words. USFD2 identified temporal expres-
sions successfully, and correctly classified
their type in 90% of cases. Determin-
ing the relation between an event and time
expression in the same sentence was per-
formed at 63% accuracy, the second high-
est score in this part of the challenge.
