A number of papers have reported on meth-
ods for the automatic acquisition of large-scale,
probabilistic LFG-based grammatical resources
from treebanks for English (Cahill and al., 2002),
(Cahill and al., 2004), German (Cahill and al.,
2003), Chinese (Burke, 2004), (Guo and al.,
2007), Spanish (O?Donovan, 2004), (Chrupala
and van Genabith, 2006) and French (Schluter
and van Genabith, 2008). Here, we extend the
LFG grammar acquisition approach to Arabic and
the Penn Arabic Treebank (ATB) (Maamouri and
Bies, 2004), adapting and extending the methodol-
ogy of (Cahill and al., 2004) originally developed
for English. Arabic is challenging because of its
morphological richness and syntactic complexity.
Currently 98% of ATB trees (without FRAG and
X) produce a covering and connected f-structure.
We conduct a qualitative evaluation of our annota-
tion against a gold standard and achieve an f-score
of 95%.
