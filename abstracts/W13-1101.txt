We explore improving parsing social media
and other web data by altering the input data,
namely by normalizing web text, and by revis-
ing output parses. We find that text normal-
ization improves performance, though spell
checking has more of a mixed impact. We also
find that a very simple tree reviser based on
grammar comparisons performs slightly but
significantly better than the baseline and well
outperforms a machine learning model. The
results also demonstrate that, more than the
size of the training data, the goodness of fit
of the data has a great impact on the parser.
