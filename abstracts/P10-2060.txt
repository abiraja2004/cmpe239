We propose a novel algorithm for senti-
ment summarization that takes account of
informativeness and readability, simulta-
neously. Our algorithm generates a sum-
mary by selecting and ordering sentences
taken from multiple review texts according
to two scores that represent the informa-
tiveness and readability of the sentence or-
der. The informativeness score is defined
by the number of sentiment expressions
and the readability score is learned from
the target corpus. We evaluate our method
by summarizing reviews on restaurants.
Our method outperforms an existing al-
gorithm as indicated by its ROUGE score
and human readability experiments.
