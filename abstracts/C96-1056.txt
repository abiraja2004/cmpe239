 
The paper presents a consolidated set of princip- 
les of cooperative spoken human-machine dialo- 
gue which have the potential tor being turned 
into practically applicable design guidelines. The 
principles have been validated in three ways. 
They were established fi'om a Wizard of Oz sim- 
ulation corpus used to develop the dialogue 
model for a spoken language dialogue system. 
Developed independently of Gricean theory, 
some of the principles were refined through com- 
parison with Grice's maxims of cooperativity in
conversation. Finally, the principles were tested 
in the user test of the implemented dialogue sys- 
tem. The paper shows that Grice's maxims con- 
stitute a sub-set of the principles. The non- 
Gricean principles and dialogue aspects they in- 
troduce am presented and discussed.
