  
Syntactic models should be descriptively ade- 
quate and parsable. A syntactic description is 
autonomous in the sense that it has certain ex- 
plicit formal properties. Such a description re- 
lates to the semantic interpretation of the sen- 
tences, and to the surface text. As the formal- 
ism is implemented in a broad-coverage syntac- 
tic parser, we concentrate on issues that must 
be resolved by any practical system that uses 
such models. The correspondence between the 
structure and linear order is discussed.
