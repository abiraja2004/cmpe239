In this paper we present a novel discrimi-
native mixture model for statistical machine
translation (SMT). We model the feature space
with a log-linear combination of multiple mix-
ture components. Each component contains a
large set of features trained in a maximum-
entropy framework. All features within the
same mixture component are tied and share
the same mixture weights, where the mixture
weights are trained discriminatively to max-
imize the translation performance. This ap-
proach aims at bridging the gap between the
maximum-likelihood training and the discrim-
inative training for SMT. It is shown that the
feature space can be partitioned in a vari-
ety of ways, such as based on feature types,
word alignments, or domains, for various ap-
plications. The proposed approach improves
the translation performance significantly on a
large-scale Arabic-to-English MT task.
