We present a fully automatic method for
content selection evaluation in summariza-
tion that does not require the creation of
human model summaries. Our work capi-
talizes on the assumption that the distribu-
tion of words in the input and an informa-
tive summary of that input should be sim-
ilar to each other. Results on a large scale
evaluation from the Text Analysis Con-
ference show that input-summary compar-
isons are very effective for the evaluation
of content selection. Our automatic meth-
ods rank participating systems similarly
to manual model-based pyramid evalua-
tion and to manual human judgments of
responsiveness. The best feature, Jensen-
Shannon divergence, leads to a correlation
as high as 0.88 with manual pyramid and
0.73 with responsiveness evaluations.
