 
This study investigates the support of 
multiple information seeking strategies 
(ISSs) within a single system, and the 
relation between varieties of ISSs and 
system design. It proposes to construct 
and evaluate an interactive information 
retrieval system which can adaptively 
support multiple ISSs, and allow change 
from one ISS to another within an ISS 
space. It is conducted in a series of steps: 
iterative designing -evaluating of several 
systems supporting different ISSs; 
specifying an interaction structure for 
multiple ISSs; and, implementing and 
evaluating a dynamically adaptive system 
supporting multiple ISSs. The study aims 
to make a contribution to interactive 
information retrieval drawing attention to 
user interface design, and to HCI, in 
integration of multiple support techniques 
within a single system framework.
