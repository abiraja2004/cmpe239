Text categorization is a fundamental task in
natural language processing, and is gener-
ally defined as a multi-label categorization
problem, where each text document is as-
signed to one or more categories. We fo-
cus on providing good statistical classifiers
with a generalization ability for multi-label
categorization and present a classifier de-
sign method based on model combination
and F
1
-score maximization. In our formu-
lation, we first design multiple models for
binary classification per category. Then,
we combine these models to maximize the
F
1
-score of a training dataset. Our experi-
mental results confirmed that our proposed
method was useful especially for datasets
where there were many combinations of cat-
egory labels.
