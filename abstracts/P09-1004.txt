The task of Semantic Role Labeling
(SRL) is often divided into two sub-tasks:
verb argument identification, and argu-
ment classification. Current SRL algo-
rithms show lower results on the identifi-
cation sub-task. Moreover, most SRL al-
gorithms are supervised, relying on large
amounts of manually created data. In
this paper we present an unsupervised al-
gorithm for identifying verb arguments,
where the only type of annotation required
is POS tagging. The algorithm makes use
of a fully unsupervised syntactic parser,
using its output in order to detect clauses
and gather candidate argument colloca-
tion statistics. We evaluate our algorithm
on PropBank10, achieving a precision of
56%, as opposed to 47% of a strong base-
line. We also obtain an 8% increase in
precision for a Spanish corpus. This is
the first paper that tackles unsupervised
verb argument identification without using
manually encoded rules or extensive lexi-
cal or syntactic resources.
