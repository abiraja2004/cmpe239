In Semantic Role Labeling (SRL), it is rea-
sonable to globally assign semantic roles
due to strong dependencies among argu-
ments. Some relations between arguments
significantly characterize the structural in-
formation of argument structure. In this
paper, we concentrate on thematic hierar-
chy that is a rank relation restricting syn-
tactic realization of arguments. A log-
linear model is proposed to accurately
identify thematic rank between two argu-
ments. To import structural information,
we employ re-ranking technique to incor-
porate thematic rank relations into local
semantic role classification results. Exper-
imental results show that automatic pre-
diction of thematic hierarchy can help se-
mantic role classification.
