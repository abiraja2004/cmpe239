Web text has been successfully used as
training data for many NLP applications.
While most previous work accesses web
text through search engine hit counts, we
created a Web Corpus by downloading
web pages to create a topic-diverse collec-
tion of 10 billion words of English. We
show that for context-sensitive spelling
correction the Web Corpus results are bet-
ter than using a search engine. For the-
saurus extraction, it achieved similar over-
all results to a corpus of newspaper text.
With many more words available on the
web, better results can be obtained by col-
lecting much larger web corpora.
