We propose a new approach for the creation of
child language development metrics. A set of
linguistic features is computed on child speech
samples and used as input in two age predic-
tion experiments. In the first experiment, we
learn a child-specific metric and predicts the
ages at which speech samples were produced.
We then learn a more general developmen-
tal index by applying our method across chil-
dren, predicting relative temporal orderings of
speech samples. In both cases we compare
our results with established measures of lan-
guage development, showing improvements in
age prediction performance.
