Crisis-affected populations are often able to
maintain digital communications but in a
sudden-onset crisis any aid organizations will
have the least free resources to process such
communications. Information that aid agen-
cies can actually act on, ?actionable? informa-
tion, will be sparse so there is great poten-
tial to (semi)automatically identify actionable
communications. However, there are hurdles
as the languages spoken will often be under-
resourced, have orthographic variation, and
the precise definition of ?actionable? will be
response-specific and evolving. We present
a novel system that addresses this, drawing
on 40,000 emergency text messages sent in
Haiti following the January 12, 2010 earth-
quake, predominantly in Haitian Kreyol. We
show that keyword/ngram-based models us-
ing streaming MaxEnt achieve up to F=0.21
accuracy. Further, we find current state-of-
the-art subword models increase this substan-
tially to F=0.33 accuracy, while modeling the
spatial, temporal, topic and source contexts of
the messages can increase this to a very ac-
curate F=0.86 over direct text messages and
F=0.90-0.97 over social media, making it a vi-
able strategy for message prioritization.
