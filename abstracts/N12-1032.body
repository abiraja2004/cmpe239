We propose a linguistically motivated set of
features to capture morphological agreement
and add them to the MSTParser dependency
parser. Compared to the built-in morphologi-
cal feature set, ours is both much smaller and
more accurate across a sample of 20 morpho-
logically annotated treebanks. We find in-
creases in accuracy of up to 5.3% absolute.
While some of this results from the feature set
capturing information unrelated to morphol-
ogy, there is still significant improvement, up
to 4.6% absolute, due to the agreement model.
