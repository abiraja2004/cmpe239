 
In this allicle, we present a statistical approach to 
machine translation that is based on Data-Oriented 
Parsing: l)ata-Oriented Translation (DOT). In DOT, 
we use linked subtree lmirs for creating a derivation 
of a source sentence. Each linked subhee pair has a 
certain probability, and consists of two trees: one 
in the source language and one in the target lan- 
guage. When a derbation has been formed with 
these subtree pairs, we can create a translation from 
this deriwition. Since there are typically many dif- 
ferent derivations of tile same sentence in the source 
language, there can be as many dilTemnt ranslations 
for it. The probability of a translation can be calcu- 
lated as the total probability of all tile derivations 
that form this translation. We give the computa- 
tional aspects for Ibis model, show tlmt we can con- 
vert each subtree imir into a productive rewrite rule, 
and that tile most probable translation can be com- 
imted by means of Monte Carlo disambiguation. H- 
nally, we discuss some pilot experiments with the 
Verbmobil COl\]mS.
