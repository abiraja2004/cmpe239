An attempt was made to semi-automatically ob-
tain ?lexical units? (LUs) for Japanese from
the English LUs defined in the semantic frame
database provided by Berkeley FrameNet (BFN)
using an English-Japanese bilingual corpus.
This task was a prerequisite to building a com-
plete database of semantic frames for Japanese.
In the task, a Japanese word is first translated
into an English word or phrase, E. E is one
of the lexical units that evoked a particular se-
mantic frame, F , in the BFN database. When
other lexical units of F are translated back into
Japanese, this defines a candidate set of F for
the lexical units of F in Japanese. The via-
bility of the proposed method was tested on a
Japanese verb (X-ga Y -wo) osou (roughly mean-
ing ?X attack(s) Y ,? ?X hit(s) Y ,? ?X surprise(s)
Y ? in English, showing that it is a relatively pol-
ysemous word). The resulting translation was
compared to semantic descriptions provided by
IPAL and Nihongo Goi-Taikei (A Japanese Lex-
icon), two well-known language resources for
Japanese, and also by the Frame Oriented Con-
cept Analysis of Language (FOCAL). The com-
parison revealed that FOCAL, BFN, Goi Taikei,
and IPAL provided finer-grained descriptions in
this specific order.
