In this paper we present a novel approach to map
textual entities such as words, phrases, sentences,
paragraphs or arbitrary text fragments onto artificial
structures which we call ?Text Sense Representation
Trees? (TSR trees). These TSR trees represent an
abstract notion of the meaning of the respective text,
subjective to an abstract ?common? understanding
within the World Wide Web. TSR Trees can be
used to support text and language processing sys-
tems such as text categorizers, classifiers, automatic
summarizers and applications of the Semantic Web.
We will explain how to construct the TSR tree struc-
tures and how to use them properly; furthermore we
describe some preliminary evaluation results.
