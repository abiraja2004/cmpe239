 
Emotion computing is very important for 
expressive information extraction. In this 
paper, we provide a robust and versatile 
emotion annotation scheme based on cog-
nitive emotion theories, which not only 
can annotate both explicit and implicit 
emotion expressions, but also can encode 
different levels of emotion information for 
the given emotion content. In addition, 
motivated by a cognitive framework, an 
automatic emotion annotation system is 
developed, and large and comparatively 
high-quality emotion corpora are created 
for emotion computing, one in Chinese 
and the other in English. Such an annota-
tion system can be easily adapted for dif-
ferent kinds of emotion applications and 
be extended to other languages.
