We describe a machine learning system for the
recognition of names in biomedical texts. The sys-
tem makes extensive use of local and syntactic fea-
tures within the text, as well as external resources
including the web and gazetteers. It achieves an F-
score of 70% on the Coling 2004 NLPBA/BioNLP
shared task of identifying five biomedical named en-
tities in the GENIA corpus.
