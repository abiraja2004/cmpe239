This paper describes a Chinese word seg-
mentation system that is based on ma-
jority voting among three models: a for-
ward maximum matching model, a con-
ditional random field (CRF) model us-
ing maximum subword-based tagging, and
a CRF model using minimum subword-
based tagging. In addition, it contains a
post-processing component to deal with
inconsistencies. Testing on the closed
track of CityU, MSRA and UPUC corpora
in the third SIGHAN Chinese Word Seg-
mentation Bakeoff, the system achieves a
F-score of 0.961, 0.953 and 0.919, respec-
tively.
