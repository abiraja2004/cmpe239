 
The CL Research system for SemEval-2 Task 
10 for linking events and their participants in 
discourse is an exploration of the use of a spe-
cially created FrameNet dictionary that cap-
tures all FrameNet information about frames, 
lexical units, and frame-to-frame relations.  
This system is embedded in a specially de-
signed interface, the Linguistic Task Analyzer. 
The implementation of this system was quite 
minimal at the time of submission, allowing 
only an initial completion of the role recogni-
tion and labeling task, with recall of 0.112, 
precision of 0.670, and F-score of 0.192. We 
describe the design of the system and the con-
tinuing efforts to determine how much of this 
task can be performed with the available lexi-
cal resources. Changes since the official sub-
mission have improved the F-score to 0.266.
