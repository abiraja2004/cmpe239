In the context of lexicalized grammars, we
propose general methods for lexical disam-
biguation based on polarization and ab-
straction of grammatical formalisms. Polar-
ization makes their resource sensitivity ex-
plicit and abstraction aims at keeping essen-
tially the mechanism of neutralization be-
tween polarities. Parsing with the simpli-
fied grammar in the abstract formalism can
be used efficiently for filtering lexical selec-
tions.
