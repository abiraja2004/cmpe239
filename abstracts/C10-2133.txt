We study a novel shallow information ex-
traction problem that involves extracting
sentences of a given set of topic cate-
gories from medical forum data. Given
a corpus of medical forum documents,
our goal is to extract two related types
of sentences that describe a biomedical
case (i.e., medical problem descriptions
and medical treatment descriptions). Such
an extraction task directly generates med-
ical case descriptions that can be useful
in many applications. We solve the prob-
lem using two popular machine learning
methods Support Vector Machines (SVM)
and Conditional Random Fields (CRF).
We propose novel features to improve the
accuracy of extraction. Experiment results
show that we can obtain an accuracy of up
to 75%.
