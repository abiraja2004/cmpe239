 
This paper presents a Chinese word 
segmentation system submitted to the 
closed training evaluations of CIPS-
SIGHAN-2010 bakeoff. The system uses 
a conditional random field model with 
one simple feature called term contri-
buted boundaries (TCB) in addition to 
the ?BI? character-based tagging ap-
proach. TCB can be extracted from unla-
beled corpora automatically, and seg-
mentation variations of different do-
mains are expected to be reflected impli-
citly. The experiment result shows that 
TCB does improve ?BI? tagging domain-
independently about 1% of the F1 meas-
ure score.
