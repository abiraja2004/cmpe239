 
Using constraints in robust parsing seems to have 
what we call "robust parsing paradox". Preference 
Sem,'ultics and Coimecfionisln both offered a promis- 
ing approach to fins problem. However, Prefelence 
Semantics has not addressed the problem of how to 
make flfll use of syntactic onstraints, and Connec- 
tiouism has some inherent difficulties of its OWll 
which prevent i producing a practical system. In this 
paper we are proposing a method to add syntactic 
preferences to the Preferealce Semantics paradigm 
while nmiutaining its fundamental philosophy. It will 
be shown ttmt syntactic preferences can be coded as 
a set of weights associated with the set of symboli- 
cally manipulatable rules of a new grammar formal- 
ism. ~121e syntactic preferences uch codezt can lye 
easily used to compute with semantic preferences. 
With the help of some tectmiques borrowed from 
Connectioeisln, these weights can be adjusted 
through tralrting.
