 
The lexical transfer phase is the most crucial 
step in MT because most of difficult problems are 
caused by lexical differences between two 
languages. In order to treat lexical issues systemati- 
cally in transfer-based MT systems, we introduce 
the concept of bilingual-sings which are defined by 
pairs of equivalent monolingual signs. The bil- 
ingual signs not only relate the local linguistic 
structures of two languages but also play a central 
role in connecting the linguistic processes of transla- 
tion with knowledge based inferences. We also 
show that they can be effectively used to formulate 
appropriate questions for disambiguating "transfer 
ambiguities", which is crucial in interactive MT sys- 
tems.
