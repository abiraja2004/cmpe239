eGIFT (Extracting Gene Information From
Text) is an intelligent system which is in-
tended to aid scientists in surveying litera-
ture relevant to genes of interest. From a
gene specific set of abstracts retrieved from
PubMed, eGIFT determines the most impor-
tant terms associated with the given gene.
Annotators using eGIFT can quickly find ar-
ticles describing gene functions and individ-
uals scientists surveying the results of high-
throughput experiments can quickly extract
information important to their hits.
