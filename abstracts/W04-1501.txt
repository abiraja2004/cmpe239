Among the variety of proposals currently mak-
ing the dependency perspective on grammar
more concrete, there are several treebanks
whose annotation exploits some form of Rela-
tional Structure that we can consider a general-
ization of the fundamental idea of dependency
at various degrees and with reference to differ-
ent types of linguistic knowledge.
The paper describes the Relational Structure as
the common underlying representation of tree-
banks which is motivated by both theoretical
and task-dependent considerations. Then it
presents a system for the annotation of the Rela-
tional Structure in treebanks, called Augmented
Relational Structure, which allows for a system-
atic annotation of various components of lin-
guistic knowledge crucial in several tasks. Fi-
nally, it shows a dependency-based annotation
for an Italian treebank, i.e. the Turin Univer-
sity Treebank, that implements the Augmented
Relational Structure.
