Recognition errors hinder the prolifera-
tion of speech recognition (SR) systems.
Based on the observation that recogni-
tion errors may result in ungrammatical
sentences, especially in dictation appli-
cation where an acceptable level of ac-
curacy of generated documents is indis-
pensable, we propose to incorporate two
kinds of linguistic features into error de-
tection: lexical features of words, and syn-
tactic features from a robust lexicalized
parser. Transformation-based learning is
chosen to predict recognition errors by in-
tegrating word confidence scores with lin-
guistic features. The experimental results
on a dictation data corpus show that lin-
guistic features alone are not as useful as
word confidence scores in detecting er-
rors. However, linguistic features provide
complementary information when com-
bined with word confidence scores, which
collectively reduce the classification error
rate by 12.30% and improve the F measure
by 53.62%.
