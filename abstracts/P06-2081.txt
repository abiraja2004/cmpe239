We report initial results on the relatively
novel task of automatic classification of
author personality. Using a corpus of per-
sonal weblogs, or ?blogs?, we investigate
the accuracy that can be achieved when
classifying authors on four important per-
sonality traits. We explore both binary and
multiple classification, using differing sets
of n-gram features. Results are promising
for all four traits examined.
