Many prior studies have investigated the re-
covery of semantic arguments for nominal
predicates. The models in many of these stud-
ies have assumed that arguments are indepen-
dent of each other. This assumption simpli-
fies the computational modeling of semantic
arguments, but it ignores the joint nature of
natural language. This paper presents a pre-
liminary investigation into the joint modeling
of implicit arguments for nominal predicates.
The joint model uses propositional knowledge
extracted from millions of Internet webpages
to help guide prediction.
