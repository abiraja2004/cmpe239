 
In this paper we aim to detect some as-
pects of adjectival meanings. Concepts of 
adjectives are distributed by SOM (Self-
Organizing map) whose feature vectors 
are calculated by MI (Mutual Informa-
tion). For the SOM obtained, we make 
tight clusters from map nodes, calculated 
by cosine. In addition, the number of 
tight clusters obtained by cosine was in-
creased using map nodes and Japanese 
thesaurus. As a result, the number of ex-
tended clusters of concepts was 149 clus-
ters. From the map, we found 8 adjectival 
clusters in super-ordinate level and some 
tendencies of similar and dissimilar clus-
ters.
