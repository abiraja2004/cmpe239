The distance or similarity metric plays an
important role in many natural language
processing (NLP) tasks. Previous stud-
ies have demonstrated the effectiveness of
a number of metrics such as the Jaccard
coefficient, especially in synonym acqui-
sition. While the existing metrics per-
form quite well, to further improve perfor-
mance, we propose the use of a supervised
machine learning algorithm that fine-tunes
them. Given the known instances of sim-
ilar or dissimilar words, we estimated the
parameters of the Mahalanobis distance.
We compared a number of metrics in our
experiments, and the results show that the
proposed metric has a higher mean average
precision than other metrics.
