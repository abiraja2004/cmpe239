In this paper we present a human-based
evaluation of surface realisation alterna-
tives. We examine the relative rankings of
naturally occurring corpus sentences and
automatically generated strings chosen by
statistical models (language model, log-
linear model), as well as the naturalness of
the strings chosen by the log-linear model.
We also investigate to what extent preced-
ing context has an effect on choice. We
show that native speakers do accept quite
some variation in word order, but there are
also clearly factors that make certain real-
isation alternatives more natural.
