In ScaNaLU 2002, Chang et alpresented a
scalable natural language formalism called
Embodied Construction Grammar (ECG)
(Chang et al, 2002). ECG makes deep un-
derstanding systems possible because it is a
rigorous, unified formalism that incorporates
the semantic and pragmatic insights found
in cognitive linguistics. The work described
in this paper builds on (Chang et al, 2002)
because it leverages the ECG formalism to
perform deep, scalable construction-based
parsing and semantic analysis.
