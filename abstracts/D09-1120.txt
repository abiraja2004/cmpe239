Coreference systems are driven by syntactic, se-
mantic, and discourse constraints. We present
a simple approach which completely modularizes
these three aspects. In contrast to much current
work, which focuses on learning and on the dis-
course component, our system is deterministic and
is driven entirely by syntactic and semantic com-
patibility as learned from a large, unlabeled corpus.
Despite its simplicity and discourse naivete, our
system substantially outperforms all unsupervised
systems and most supervised ones. Primary con-
tributions include (1) the presentation of a simple-
to-reproduce, high-performing baseline and (2) the
demonstration that most remaining errors can be at-
tributed to syntactic and semantic factors external
to the coreference phenomenon (and perhaps best
addressed by non-coreference systems).
