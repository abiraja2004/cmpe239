This paper presents our work on using
the graph structure of Wiktionary for syn-
onym detection. We implement seman-
tic relatedness metrics using both a direct
measure of information flow on the graph
and a comparison of the list of vertices
found to be ?close? to a given vertex. Our
algorithms, evaluated on ESL 50, TOEFL
80 and RDWP 300 data sets, perform bet-
ter than or comparable to existing seman-
tic relatedness measures.
