Review quality is determined by identifying
the relevance of a review to a submission
(the article or paper the review was written
for). We identify relevance in terms of the se-
mantic and syntactic similarities between two
texts. We use a word order graph, whose ver-
tices, edges and double edges help determine
structure-based match across texts. We use
WordNet to determine semantic relatedness.
Ours is a lexico-semantic approach, which pre-
dicts relevance with an accuracy of 66% and
f -measure of 0.67.
