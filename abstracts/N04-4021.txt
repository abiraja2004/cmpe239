We present an approach to pronunciation mod-
eling in which the evolution of multiple lin-
guistic feature streams is explicitly represented.
This differs from phone-based models in that
pronunciation variation is viewed as the result
of feature asynchrony and changes in feature
values, rather than phone substitutions, inser-
tions, and deletions. We have implemented a
flexible feature-based pronunciation model us-
ing dynamic Bayesian networks. In this paper,
we describe our approach and report on a pilot
experiment using phonetic transcriptions of ut-
terances from the Switchboard corpus. The ex-
perimental results, as well as the model?s quali-
tative behavior, suggest that this is a promising
way of accounting for the types of pronuncia-
tion variation often seen in spontaneous speech.
