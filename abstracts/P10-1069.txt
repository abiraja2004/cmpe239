We describe the semi-automatic adapta-
tion of a TimeML annotated corpus from
English to Portuguese, a language for
which TimeML annotated data was not
available yet. In order to validate this
adaptation, we use the obtained data to
replicate some results in the literature that
used the original English data. The fact
that comparable results are obtained indi-
cates that our approach can be used suc-
cessfully to rapidly create semantically an-
notated resources for new languages.
