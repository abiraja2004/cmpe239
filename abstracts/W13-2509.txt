 
In this article, we present an automated ap-
proach of extracting English-Bengali parallel 
fragments of text from comparable corpora 
created using Wikipedia documents. Our ap-
proach exploits the multilingualism of Wiki-
pedia. The most important fact is that this ap-
proach does not need any domain specific cor-
pus. We have been able to improve the BLEU 
score of an existing domain specific English-
Bengali machine translation system by 
11.14%.
