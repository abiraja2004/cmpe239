This paper describes new default unification, lenient
default unification. It works efficiently, and gives
more informative results because it maximizes the
amount of information in the result, while other de-
fault unification maximizes it in the default. We also
describe robust processing within the framework of
HPSG. We extract grammar rules from the results of
robust parsing using lenient default unification. The
results of a series of experiments show that parsing
with the extracted rules works robustly, and the cov-
erage of a manually-developed HPSG grammar for
Penn Treebank was greatly increased with a little
overgeneration.
