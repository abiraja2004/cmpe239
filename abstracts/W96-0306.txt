 
This paper addresses the problem of large-scale acquisition of computational-semantic lexicons from 
machine-readable resources. We describe semantic filters designed to reduce the number of incorrect 
assignments (i.e., improve precision) made by a purely syntactic technique. We demonstrate hat 
it is possible to use these filters to build broad-coverage lexicons with minimal effort, at a depth of 
knowledge that lies at the syntax-semantics nterface. We report on our results of disambiguating 
the verbs in the semantic filters by adding WordNet 1sense annotations. We then show the results 
of our classification on unknown words and we evaluate these results.
