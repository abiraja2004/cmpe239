In this paper, we explore the application of inference rules for rec-
ognizing textual entailment (RTE). We start with an automatically
acquired collection and then propose methods to refine it and obtain
more rules using a hand-crafted lexical resource. Following this, we
derive a dependency-based representation from texts, which aims to
provide a proper base for the inference rule application. The evalu-
ation of our approach on the RTE data shows promising results on
precision and the error analysis suggests future improvements.
