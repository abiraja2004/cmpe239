Route directions are natural language
(NL) statements that specify, for a given
navigational task and an automatically
computed route representation, a se-
quence of actions to be followed by the
user to reach his or her goal. A corpus-
based approach to generate route direc-
tions involves (i) the selection of elements
along the route that need to be mentioned,
and (ii) the induction of a mapping from
route elements to linguistic structures that
can be used as a basis for NL generation.
This paper presents an Expectation-Maxi-
mization (EM) based algorithm that aligns
geographical route representations with
semantically annotated NL directions, as
a basis for the above tasks. We formu-
late one basic and two extended models,
the latter capturing special properties of
the route direction task. Although our
current data set is small, both extended
models achieve better results than the sim-
ple model and a random baseline. The
best results are achieved by a combination
of both extensions, which outperform the
random baseline and the simple model by
more than an order of magnitude.
