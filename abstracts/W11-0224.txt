We present MedstractPlus, a resource for min-
ing relations from the Medline bibliographic
database. It was built on the remains of Med-
stract, a previously created resource that in-
cluded a bio-relation server and an acronym
database. MedstractPlus uses simple and scal-
able natural language processing modules to
structure text and is designed with reusability
and extendibility in mind.
