Commonly used coreference resolution
evaluation metrics can only be applied to
key mentions, i.e. already annotated men-
tions. We here propose two variants of the
B3 and CEAF coreference resolution eval-
uation algorithms which can be applied
to coreference resolution systems dealing
with system mentions, i.e. automatically
determined mentions. Our experiments
show that our variants lead to intuitive and
reliable results.
