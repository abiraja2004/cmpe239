We propose a new framework for N-best
reranking on sparse feature sets. The idea
is to reformulate the reranking problem as
a Multitask Learning problem, where each
N-best list corresponds to a distinct task.
This is motivated by the observation that
N-best lists often show significant differ-
ences in feature distributions. Training a
single reranker directly on this heteroge-
nous data can be difficult.
Our proposed meta-algorithm solves this
challenge by using multitask learning
(such as ?1/?2 regularization) to discover
common feature representations across N-
best lists. This meta-algorithm is simple to
implement, and its modular approach al-
lows one to plug-in different learning algo-
rithms from existing literature. As a proof
of concept, we show statistically signifi-
cant improvements on a machine transla-
tion system involving millions of features.
