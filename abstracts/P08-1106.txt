In this paper we present a supervised method
for back-of-the-book index construction. We
introduce a novel set of features that goes be-
yond the typical frequency-based analysis, in-
cluding features based on discourse compre-
hension, syntactic patterns, and information
drawn from an online encyclopedia. In exper-
iments carried out on a book collection, the
method was found to lead to an improvement
of roughly 140% as compared to an existing
state-of-the-art supervised method.
