 
Redundancy is a good thing, at least in a learn- 
ing process. To be a good teacher you must 
say what you are going to say, say it, then say 
what you have just said. Well, three times is 
better than one. To acquire and learn knowl- 
edge from text for building a lexical knowledge 
base, we need to find a source of information 
that states facts, and repeats them a few times 
using slightly different sentence structures. A 
technique is needed for gathering information 
from that source and identify the redundant in- 
formation. The extraction of the commonality 
is an active learning of the knowledge xpressed. 
The proposed research is based on a clustering 
method developed by Barri~re and Popowich 
(1996) which performs a gathering of related 
information about a particular topic. Individ- 
ual pieces of information are represented via the 
Conceptual Graph (CG) formalism and the re- 
sult of the clustering is a large CG embedding 
all individual graphs. In the present paper, we 
suggest hat the identification of the redundant 
information within the resulting graph is very 
useful for disambiguation of the original infor- 
mation at the semantic level.
