This paper investigates semi-supervised learn-
ing of Gaussian mixture models using an uni-
fied objective function taking both labeled and
unlabeled data into account. Two methods
are compared in this work ? the hybrid dis-
criminative/generative method and the purely
generative method. They differ in the crite-
rion type on labeled data; the hybrid method
uses the class posterior probabilities and the
purely generative method uses the data like-
lihood. We conducted experiments on the
TIMIT database and a standard synthetic data
set from UCI Machine Learning repository.
The results show that the two methods be-
have similarly in various conditions. For both
methods, unlabeled data improve training on
models of higher complexity in which the su-
pervised method performs poorly. In addition,
there is a trend that more unlabeled data re-
sults in more improvement in classification ac-
curacy over the supervised model. We also
provided experimental observations on the rel-
ative weights of labeled and unlabeled parts
of the training objective and suggested a criti-
cal value which could be useful for selecting a
good weighing factor.
