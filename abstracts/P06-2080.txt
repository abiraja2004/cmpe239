We present a learning framework for struc-
tured support vector models in which
boosting and bagging methods are used to
construct ensemble models. We also pro-
pose a selection method which is based on
a switching model among a set of outputs
of individual classifiers when dealing with
natural language parsing problems. The
switching model uses subtrees mined from
the corpus and a boosting-based algorithm
to select the most appropriate output. The
application of the proposed framework on
the domain of semantic parsing shows ad-
vantages in comparison with the original
large margin methods.
