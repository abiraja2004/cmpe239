Morphological disambiguation is the pro-
cess of assigning one set of morphologi-
cal features to each individual word in a
text. When the word is ambiguous (there
are several possible analyses for the word),
a disambiguation procedure based on the
word context must be applied. This paper
deals with morphological disambiguation
of the Hebrew language, which combines
morphemes into a word in both agglutina-
tive and fusional ways. We present an un-
supervised stochastic model ? the only re-
source we use is a morphological analyzer ?
which deals with the data sparseness prob-
lem caused by the affixational morphology
of the Hebrew language.
We present a text encoding method for
languages with affixational morphology in
which the knowledge of word formation
rules (which are quite restricted in He-
brew) helps in the disambiguation. We
adapt HMM algorithms for learning and
searching this text representation, in such
a way that segmentation and tagging can
be learned in parallel in one step. Results
on a large scale evaluation indicate that
this learning improves disambiguation for
complex tag sets. Our method is applicable
to other languages with affix morphology.
