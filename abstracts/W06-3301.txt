 
Most current definitional question an-
swering systems apply one-size-fits-all 
lexicosyntactic patterns to identify defini-
tions. By analyzing a large set of online 
definitions, this study shows that the se-
mantic types of definienda constrain both 
lexical semantics and lexicosyntactic pat-
terns of the definientia. For example, 
?heart? has the semantic type [Body Part, 
Organ, or Organ Component] and its 
definition (e.g., ?heart locates between the 
lungs?) incorporates semantic-type-
dependent lexicosyntactic patterns (e.g., 
?TERM locates ??) and terms (e.g., 
?lung? has the same semantic type [Body 
Part, Organ, or Organ Component]). In 
contrast, ?AIDS? has a different semantic 
type [Disease or Syndrome]; its definition 
(e.g., ?An infectious disease caused by 
human immunodeficiency virus?) consists 
of different lexicosyntactic patterns (e.g., 
??causes by??) and terms (e.g., ?infec-
tious disease? has the semantic type [Dis-
ease or Syndrome]). The semantic types 
are defined in the widely used biomedical 
knowledge resource, the Unified Medical 
Language System (UMLS).
