We present the first English syllabification
system to improve the accuracy of letter-to-
phoneme conversion. We propose a novel dis-
criminative approach to automatic syllabifica-
tion based on structured SVMs. In comparison
with a state-of-the-art syllabification system,
we reduce the syllabification word error rate
for English by 33%. Our approach also per-
forms well on other languages, comparing fa-
vorably with published results on German and
Dutch.
