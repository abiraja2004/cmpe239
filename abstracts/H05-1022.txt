HMM-based models are developed for the
alignment of words and phrases in bitext.
The models are formulated so that align-
ment and parameter estimation can be per-
formed efficiently. We find that Chinese-
English word alignment performance is
comparable to that of IBM Model-4 even
over large training bitexts. Phrase pairs
extracted from word alignments generated
under the model can also be used for
phrase-based translation, and in Chinese
to English and Arabic to English transla-
tion, performance is comparable to sys-
tems based on Model-4 alignments. Di-
rect phrase pair induction under the model
is described and shown to improve trans-
lation performance.
