 
In this paper I propose a Binding rule for the iden- 
tification of pronoun and anaphor referents in 
phrase-structure trees, assuming the general frame- 
work of lhe Government-binding theory outlined 
by Chom,;ky (1981). The Binding rule, specified by 
means of an attribute grammar, is a particular 
instantiation of the Free Indexing rule and binding 
axioms in Chomsky's Binding theory, with certain 
empirical and practical advantages. The complexi- 
ties of the Binding rule proposed, as well as that 
inherent in Chomsky's Binding theory, are studied, 
and it i~ shown that the new rule is more 
psychologically plausible and cornputationally effi- 
cient than the original theory on wtfich it is based. 
The fragment of the attribute grammar shown here 
is part of an English grammar and parser being 
developed in tile Prolog and PLNLP languages.
