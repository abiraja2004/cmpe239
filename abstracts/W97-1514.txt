 
In order to help computational linguists, 
we have conceived and developed a lin- 
guistic software engineering environment, 
whose goal is to set up reusable and evo- 
lutive toolkits for natural language pro- 
cessing. This environment is based on a 
set of natural anguage processing compo- 
nents, at the morphologic, syntactic and 
semantic levels. These components are 
generic and evolutive, and can be used 
separately or with specific problem solv- 
ing units in global strategies built for man- 
machine communication (according to the 
general model developed in the Language 
and Cognition group: Caramel). All these 
tools are complemented with graphic in- 
terfaces, allowing users outside the field of 
Computer Science to use them very eas- 
ily. In this paper, we will present first the 
syntactic analysis, based on a chart parser 
that uses a LFG grammar for French, and 
the semantic analysis, based on conceptual 
graphs. Then we will show how these two 
analyses collaborate to produce semantic 
representations and sentences. Before con- 
cluding, we will show how these modules 
are used through a distributed architecture 
based on CORBA (distributed Smalltalk) 
implementing the CARAMEL multi-agent 
architecture.
