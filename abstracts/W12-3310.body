The current  debate  regarding  the data  struc-
ture necessary to represent discourse structure, 
specifically whether tree-structure is sufficient 
to  represent  discourse  structure  or  not,  is 
mainly focused on written text. This paper re-
views  some  of  the  major  claims  about  the 
structure in discourse and proposes an investi-
gation of discourse structure for simultaneous 
spoken Turkish by focusing on tree-violations 
and exploring ways to explain them away by 
non-structural means.
