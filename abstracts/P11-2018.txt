We investigate systems that identify opinion
expressions and assigns polarities to the ex-
tracted expressions. In particular, we demon-
strate the benefit of integrating opinion ex-
traction and polarity classification into a joint
model using features reflecting the global po-
larity structure. The model is trained using
large-margin structured prediction methods.
The system is evaluated on the MPQA opinion
corpus, where we compare it to the only previ-
ously published end-to-end system for opinion
expression extraction and polarity classifica-
tion. The results show an improvement of be-
tween 10 and 15 absolute points in F-measure.
