For many languages, the size of Wikipedia is
an order of magnitude smaller than the En-
glish Wikipedia. We present a method for
cross-lingual alignment of template and in-
fobox attributes in Wikipedia. The alignment
is used to add and complete templates and
infoboxes in one language with information
derived from Wikipedia in another language.
We show that alignment between English and
Dutch Wikipedia is accurate and that the re-
sult can be used to expand the number of tem-
plate attribute-value pairs in Dutch Wikipedia
by 50%. Furthermore, the alignment pro-
vides valuable information for normalization
of template and attribute names and can be
used to detect potential inconsistencies.
