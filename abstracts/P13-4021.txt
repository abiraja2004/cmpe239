We present DKPro Similarity, an open
source framework for text similarity. Our
goal is to provide a comprehensive repos-
itory of text similarity measures which
are implemented using standardized inter-
faces. DKPro Similarity comprises a wide
variety of measures ranging from ones
based on simple n-grams and common
subsequences to high-dimensional vector
comparisons and structural, stylistic, and
phonetic measures. In order to promote
the reproducibility of experimental results
and to provide reliable, permanent ex-
perimental conditions for future studies,
DKPro Similarity additionally comes with
a set of full-featured experimental setups
which can be run out-of-the-box and be
used for future systems to built upon.
