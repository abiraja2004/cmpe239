Traditional information retrieval models as-
sume keyword-based queries and use unstruc-
tured document representations. There is
an abundance of event-centered texts (e.g.,
breaking news) and event-oriented informa-
tion needs that often involve structure that
cannot be expressed using keywords. We
present a novel retrieval model that uses a struc-
tured event-based representation. We struc-
ture queries and documents as graphs of event
mentions and employ graph kernels to measure
the query-document similarity. Experimental
results on two event-oriented test collections
show significant improvements over state-of-
the-art keyword-based models.
