In this paper we do two things: a) we dis-
cuss in general terms the task of incre-
mental reference resolution (IRR), in par-
ticular resolution of exophoric reference,
and specify metrics for measuring the per-
formance of dialogue system components
tackling this task, and b) we present a sim-
ple Bayesian filtering model of IRR that
performs reasonably well just using words
directly (no structure information and no
hand-coded semantics): it picks the right
referent out of 12 for around 50% of real-
world dialogue utterances in our test cor-
pus. It is also able to learn to interpret not
only words but also hesitations, just as hu-
mans have shown to do in similar situa-
tions, namely as markers of references to
hard-to-describe entities.
