 
We present our work on open-domain 
multi-document summarization in the 
framework of Web search. Our system, 
SNS (pronounced "essence"), retrieves 
documents related to an unrestricted user 
query and summarizes a subset of them as 
selected by the user. We present a task- 
based extrinsic evaluation of the quality of 
the produced multi-document summaries. 
The evaluation results show that 
summarization quality is relatively high 
and does help improve the reading speed 
and judge the relevance of the retrieved 
URLs.
