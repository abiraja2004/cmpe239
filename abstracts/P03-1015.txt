The paper describes two parsing schemes:
a shallow approach based on machine
learning and a cascaded finite-state parser
with a hand-crafted grammar. It dis-
cusses several ways to combine them and
presents evaluation results for the two in-
dividual approaches and their combina-
tion. An underspecification scheme for
the output of the finite-state parser is intro-
duced and shown to improve performance.
