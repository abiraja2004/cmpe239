  
Knowledge Technologies need to extract 
knowledge from existing texts, which 
calls for advanced Human Language 
Technologies (HLT). Progress is being 
made in Natural Language Processing but 
there is still a long way towards Natural 
Language Understanding. An important 
step towards this goal is the development 
of technologies and resources that deal 
with concepts rather than words. The 
MEANING project argues that we need to 
solve two complementary and 
intermediate tasks to enable the next 
generation of intelligent open domain 
HLT application systems: Word Sense 
Disambiguation and large-scale 
enrichment of Lexical Knowledge Bases. 
Innovations in this area will lead to HLT 
with deeper understanding of texts, and 
immediate progress in real applications of 
Knowledge Technologies.
