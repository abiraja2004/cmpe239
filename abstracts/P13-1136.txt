We consider the problem of using sentence
compression techniques to facilitate query-
focused multi-document summarization. We
present a sentence-compression-based frame-
work for the task, and design a series of
learning-based compression models built on
parse trees. An innovative beam search de-
coder is proposed to efficiently find highly
probable compressions. Under this frame-
work, we show how to integrate various in-
dicative metrics such as linguistic motivation
and query relevance into the compression pro-
cess by deriving a novel formulation of a com-
pression scoring function. Our best model
achieves statistically significant improvement
over the state-of-the-art systems on several
metrics (e.g. 8.0% and 5.4% improvements in
ROUGE-2 respectively) for the DUC 2006 and
2007 summarization task.
