Tree Substitution Grammar rules form a large
and expressive class of features capable of rep-
resenting syntactic and lexical patterns that
provide evidence of an author?s native lan-
guage. However, this class of features can
be applied to any general constituent based
model of grammar and previous work has
done little to explore these options, relying
primarily on the common Penn Treebank an-
notation standard. In this work we contrast
the performance of syntactic features for Na-
tive Language Indentification using five dif-
ferent formalisms. The use of different for-
malisms captures complementary information
from second language data, and can be used
in combination to yield classification perfor-
mance superior to any formalism taken on its
own.
