In this paper, we address the issue of au-
tomatic extending lexical resources by ex-
ploiting existing knowledge repositories.
In particular, we deal with the new task
of linking FrameNet and Wikipedia us-
ing a word sense disambiguation system
that, for a given pair frame ? lexical unit
(F, l), finds the Wikipage that best ex-
presses the the meaning of l. The mapping
can be exploited to straightforwardly ac-
quire new example sentences and new lex-
ical units, both for English and for all lan-
guages available in Wikipedia. In this way,
it is possible to easily acquire good-quality
data as a starting point for the creation of
FrameNet in new languages. The evalua-
tion reported both for the monolingual and
the multilingual expansion of FrameNet
shows that the approach is promising.
