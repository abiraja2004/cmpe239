This paper presents a methodology for the
comparative performance analysis of the
parsers developed for different grammar
frameworks. For such a comparison, we
need a common representation format of
the parsing results since the representation
of the parsing results depends on the gram-
mar frameworks; hence they are not di-
rectly comparable to each other. We first
convert the parsing result to a shallow CFG
analysis by using an automatic tree con-
verter based on synchronous grammars.
The use of such a shallow representation as
a common format has the advantage of re-
duced noise introduced by the conversion
in comparison with the noise produced by
the conversion to deeper representations.
We compared an HPSG parser with sev-
eral CFG parsers in our experiment and
found that meaningful differences among
the parsers? performance can still be ob-
served by such a shallow representation.
