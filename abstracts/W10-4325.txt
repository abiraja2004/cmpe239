The paper investigates discourse particles
on the example of German doch, assigning
to them very specific semantic interpreta-
tions that still cover a wide range of their
uses.
The analysis highlights the role of dis-
course particles in managing the common
ground and crucially takes into account
that discourse particles can refer not only
to utterances they are a part of and to previ-
ously uttered utterances, but also to felicity
conditions of these utterances.
