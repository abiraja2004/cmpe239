We propose a novel approach for develop-
ing a two-stage document-level discourse
parser. Our parser builds a discourse tree
by applying an optimal parsing algorithm
to probabilities inferred from two Con-
ditional Random Fields: one for intra-
sentential parsing and the other for multi-
sentential parsing. We present two ap-
proaches to combine these two stages of
discourse parsing effectively. A set of
empirical evaluations over two different
datasets demonstrates that our discourse
parser significantly outperforms the state-
of-the-art, often by a wide margin.
