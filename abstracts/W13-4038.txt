Goal-oriented dialog agents are expected
to recognize user-intentions from an utter-
ance and execute appropriate tasks. Typi-
cally, such systems use a semantic parser
to solve this problem. However, semantic
parsers could fail if user utterances contain
out-of-grammar words/phrases or if the se-
mantics of uttered phrases did not match
the parser?s expectations. In this work,
we have explored a more robust method
of task prediction. We define task predic-
tion as a classification problem, rather than
?parsing? and use semantic contexts to im-
prove classification accuracy. Our classi-
fier uses semantic smoothing kernels that
can encode information from knowledge
bases such as Wordnet, NELL and Free-
base.com. Our experiments on two spoken
language corpora show that augmenting
semantic information from these knowl-
edge bases gives about 30% absolute im-
provement in task prediction over a parser-
based method. Our approach thus helps
make a dialog agent more robust to user
input and helps reduce number of turns re-
quired to detected intended tasks.
