In this work, we provide an empiri-
cal analysis of differences in word use
between genders in telephone conversa-
tions, which complements the consid-
erable body of work in sociolinguistics
concerned with gender linguistic differ-
ences. Experiments are performed on a
large speech corpus of roughly 12000 con-
versations. We employ machine learn-
ing techniques to automatically catego-
rize the gender of each speaker given only
the transcript of his/her speech, achiev-
ing 92% accuracy. An analysis of the
most characteristic words for each gender
is also presented. Experiments reveal that
the gender of one conversation side influ-
ences lexical use of the other side. A sur-
prising result is that we were able to clas-
sify male-only vs. female-only conversa-
tions with almost perfect accuracy.
