This paper presents a pragmatic approach to Dis-
course Representation Theory (DRT) in an attempt
to address the pragmatic limitations of DRT (Werth
1999; Simons 2003). To achieve a more prag-
matic DRT model, this paper extends standard DRT
framework to incorporate more pragmatic elements
such as representing agents? cognitive states and the
complex process through which agents recognize
utterances employing the linguistic content in form-
ing mental representations of other agent?s cogni-
tive states. The paper gives focus to the usually
ignored link in DRT literature between speaker be-
liefs and the linguistic content, and between the lin-
guistic content and hearer?s beliefs.
