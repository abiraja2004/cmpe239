 
We present he first sizable grammar written for TAG. 
We present he linguistic coverage of our grammar, and 
explain the linguistic reasons which lead us to choose the 
particular epresentations. We show that TAG formal- 
ism provides sufficient constraints for handling most of 
the linguistic phenomena, with minimal inguistic stipula- 
tions. We first state the basic structures needed for pars- 
ing French, with a particular emphasis on TAG's extended 
domain of locality that enables us to state complex sub- 
categorizaeion phenomena in a natural way. We then give 
a detailed analysis of sentential complements, because it 
has lead us to introduce substitution in the formalism, 
and because TAG makes interesting predictions. We dis- 
cuss the different linguistic phenomena corresponding to
adjunction and to substitution respectively. We then movc 
on to support verb constructions, which are represented in 
a TAG in a simpler way than the usual double analysis. 
It is the first time support verb constructions are handled 
in a parser. We lastly give an overview of the treatment 
of adverbs, and suggest a treatment of idioms which make 
them fall into the same representations as 'free' structures.
