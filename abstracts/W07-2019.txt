This paper presents a combined super-
vised and unsupervised approach for multi-
document person name disambiguation.
Based on feature vectors reflecting pairwise
comparisons between web pages, a classifi-
cation algorithm provides linking informa-
tion about document pairs, which leads to
initial clusters. In addition, two different
clustering algorithms are fed with matrices
of weighted keywords. In a final step the
?seed? clusters are combined with the results
of the clustering algorithms. Results on the
validation data show that a combined classi-
fication and clustering approach doesn?t al-
ways compare favorably to those obtained
by the different algorithms separately.
