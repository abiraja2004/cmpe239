In this paper, we describe a source-
side reordering method based on syntac-
tic chunks for phrase-based statistical ma-
chine translation. First, we shallow parse
the source language sentences. Then, re-
ordering rules are automatically learned
from source-side chunks and word align-
ments. During translation, the rules are
used to generate a reordering lattice for
each sentence. Experimental results are
reported for a Chinese-to-English task,
showing an improvement of 0.5%?1.8%
BLEU score absolute on various test sets
and better computational efficiency than
reordering during decoding. The exper-
iments also show that the reordering at
the chunk-level performs better than at the
POS-level.
