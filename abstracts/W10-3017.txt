With the dramatic growth of scientific
publishing, Information Extraction (IE)
systems are becoming an increasingly im-
portant tool for large scale data analy-
sis. Hedge detection and uncertainty clas-
sification are important components of a
high precision IE system. This paper
describes a two part supervised system
which classifies words as hedge or non-
hedged and sentences as certain or uncer-
tain in biomedical and Wikipedia data. In
the first stage, our system trains a logistic
regression classifier to detect hedges based
on lexical and Part-of-Speech collocation
features. In the second stage, we use the
output of the hedge classifier to generate
sentence level features based on the num-
ber of hedge cues, the identity of hedge
cues, and a Bag-of-Words feature vector
to train a logistic regression classifier for
sentence level uncertainty. With the result-
ing classification, an IE system can then
discard facts and relations extracted from
these sentences or treat them as appropri-
ately doubtful. We present results for in
domain training and testing and cross do-
main training and testing based on a sim-
ple union of training sets.
