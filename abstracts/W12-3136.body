We describe the systems developed by the
team of the Qatar Computing Research Insti-
tute for the WMT12 Shared Translation Task.
We used a phrase-based statistical machine
translation model with several non-standard
settings, most notably tuning data selection
and phrase table combination. The evaluation
results show that we rank second in BLEU and
TER for Spanish-English, and in the top tier
for German-English.
