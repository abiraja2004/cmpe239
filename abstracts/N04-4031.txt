It is known that context words tend to be self-
triggers, that is, the probability of a content
word to appear more than once in a document,
given that it already appears once, is signifi-
cantly higher than the probability of the first oc-
currence. We look at self-triggerability across
hyperlinks on the Web. We show that the prob-
ability of a word  to appear in a Web docu-
ment 	
 depends on the presence of  in doc-
uments pointing to 	
 . In Document Model-
ing, we will propose the use of a correction fac-
tor,  , which indicates how much more likely
a word is to appear in a document given that
another document containing the same word is
linked to it.
