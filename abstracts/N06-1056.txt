We present a novel statistical approach to
semantic parsing, WASP, for construct-
ing a complete, formal meaning represen-
tation of a sentence. A semantic parser
is learned given a set of sentences anno-
tated with their correct meaning represen-
tations. The main innovation of WASP
is its use of state-of-the-art statistical ma-
chine translation techniques. A word
alignment model is used for lexical acqui-
sition, and the parsing model itself can be
seen as a syntax-based translation model.
We show that WASP performs favorably
in terms of both accuracy and coverage
compared to existing learning methods re-
quiring similar amount of supervision, and
shows better robustness to variations in
task complexity and word order.
