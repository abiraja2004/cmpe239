Extractive summarization typically uses sen-
tences as summarization units. In contrast,
joint compression and summarization can use
smaller units such as words and phrases, re-
sulting in summaries containing more infor-
mation. The goal of compressive summariza-
tion is to find a subset of words that max-
imize the total score of concepts and cut-
ting dependency arcs under the grammar con-
straints and summary length constraint. We
propose an efficient decoding algorithm for
fast compressive summarization using graph
cuts. Our approach first relaxes the length con-
straint using Lagrangian relaxation. Then we
propose to bound the relaxed objective func-
tion by the supermodular binary quadratic pro-
gramming problem, which can be solved ef-
ficiently using graph max-flow/min-cut. S-
ince finding the tightest lower bound suffers
from local optimality, we use convex relax-
ation for initialization. Experimental results
on TAC2008 dataset demonstrate our method
achieves competitive ROUGE score and has
good readability, while is much faster than the
integer linear programming (ILP) method.
