 
This document summarizes contributions and discussions from two workshops that took place 
in November 2000 and July 2001.  It presents some visions of NLP-related applications that 
may become reality within ten years from now. It investigates the technological requirements 
that must be met in order to make these visions realistic and sketches milestones that may 
help to measure our progress towards these goals.
