Automatic paraphrasing is a transformation
of expressions into semantically equivalent
expressions within one language. For gener-
ating a wider variety of phrasal paraphrases
in Japanese, it is necessary to paraphrase
functional expressions as well as content ex-
pressions. We propose a method of para-
phrasing of Japanese functional expressions
using a dictionary with two hierarchies: a
morphological hierarchy and a semantic hi-
erarchy. Our system generates appropriate
alternative expressions for 79% of source
phrases in Japanese in an open test. It also
accepts style and readability specifications.
