The difficulties involved in spelling er-
ror detection and correction in a lan-
guage have been investigated in this work
through the conceptualization of SpellNet
? the weighted network of words, where
edges indicate orthographic proximity be-
tween two words. We construct SpellNets
for three languages - Bengali, English and
Hindi. Through appropriate mathemati-
cal analysis and/or intuitive justification,
we interpret the different topological met-
rics of SpellNet from the perspective of
the issues related to spell-checking. We
make many interesting observations, the
most significant among them being that
the probability of making a real word error
in a language is propotionate to the aver-
age weighted degree of SpellNet, which is
found to be highest for Hindi, followed by
Bengali and English.
