While shortest paths in WordNet are known to correlate well with
semantic similarity, an is-a hierarchy is less suited for estimating se-
mantic relatedness. We demonstrate this by comparing two free scale
networks ( ConceptNet and Wikipedia) to WordNet. Using the Finkelstein-
353 dataset we show that a shortest path metric run on Wikipedia
attains a better correlation than WordNet-based metrics. Concept-
Net attains a good correlation as well, but suffers from a low concept
coverage.
