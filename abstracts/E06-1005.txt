This paper describes a novel method for
computing a consensus translation from
the outputs of multiple machine trans-
lation (MT) systems. The outputs are
combined and a possibly new transla-
tion hypothesis can be generated. Simi-
larly to the well-established ROVER ap-
proach of (Fiscus, 1997) for combining
speech recognition hypotheses, the con-
sensus translation is computed by voting
on a confusion network. To create the con-
fusion network, we produce pairwise word
alignments of the original machine trans-
lation hypotheses with an enhanced sta-
tistical alignment algorithm that explicitly
models word reordering. The context of a
whole document of translations rather than
a single sentence is taken into account to
produce the alignment.
The proposed alignment and voting ap-
proach was evaluated on several machine
translation tasks, including a large vocab-
ulary task. The method was also tested in
the framework of multi-source and speech
translation. On all tasks and conditions,
we achieved significant improvements in
translation quality, increasing e. g. the
BLEU score by as much as 15% relative.
