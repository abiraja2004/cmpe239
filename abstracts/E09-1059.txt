We present the results of a large-scale,
end-to-end human evaluation of various
sentiment summarization models. The
evaluation shows that users have a strong
preference for summarizers that model
sentiment over non-sentiment baselines,
but have no broad overall preference be-
tween any of the sentiment-based models.
However, an analysis of the human judg-
ments suggests that there are identifiable
situations where one summarizer is gener-
ally preferred over the others. We exploit
this fact to build a new summarizer by
training a ranking SVM model over the set
of human preference judgments that were
collected during the evaluation, which re-
sults in a 30% relative reduction in error
over the previous best summarizer.
