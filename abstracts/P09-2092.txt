The automatic extraction of relations be-
tween entities expressed in natural lan-
guage text is an important problem for IR
and text understanding. In this paper we
show how different kernels for parse trees
can be combined to improve the relation
extraction quality. On a public benchmark
dataset the combination of a kernel for
phrase grammar parse trees and for depen-
dency parse trees outperforms all known
tree kernel approaches alone suggesting
that both types of trees contain comple-
mentary information for relation extrac-
tion.
