 
This research is a continuation of that reported in Axiomatic 
Characterization of Synonymy and Antonymy, which was presented at 
the 1967 International Conference on Computational Linguistics \[3\]. 
In that paper on mathematical linguistics the relations of synonymy 
and antonymy were regarded as ternary relations and their domains 
and ranges were discussed. Synonymy and antonymy were defined jointly 
and implicity by a system of eight axioms, which permitted the proofs 
of several intuitively satisfying theorems. The present paper on 
computational linguistics is a preliminary report which describes 
some computer programs that have been used to investigate the extent 
to which those axioms model an existing dictionary of synonyms and 
antonyms \[9\]. A set of computer programs is discussed that (i) input 
the dictionary data concerning synonyms and antonyms, (2) create a 
data structure in core memory to permit the manipulation of data, 
(3) query this data structure about words and relations, and (4) out- 
put the answers to queries or the entire data structure, if desired. 
Some examples of computer output are also given to indicate present 
directions of the computer-aided research.
