Abstract
Extractive  summarization  is  the  strategy  of 
concatenating  extracts  taken  from  a  corpus 
into a summary, while abstractive summariza-
tion  involves  paraphrasing  the  corpus  using 
novel sentences.  We define a novel  measure 
of  corpus  controversiality  of  opinions  con-
tained in evaluative text, and report the results 
of  a  user  study  comparing  extractive  and 
NLG-based abstractive summarization at dif-
ferent levels of controversiality. While the ab-
stractive summarizer performs better overall, 
the results suggest  that the margin by which 
abstraction  outperforms  extraction  is  greater 
when  controversiality  is  high,  providing  a 
context  in  which  the  need  for  generation-
based methods is especially great.
