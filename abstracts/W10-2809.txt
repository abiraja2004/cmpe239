Recent work applied Dirichlet Process
Mixture Models to the task of verb cluster-
ing, incorporating supervision in the form
of must-links and cannot-links constraints
between instances. In this work, we intro-
duce an active learning approach for con-
straint selection employing uncertainty-
based sampling. We achieve substantial
improvements over random selection on
two datasets.
