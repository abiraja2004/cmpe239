We propose a novel language-independent
approach for improving statistical ma-
chine translation for resource-poor lan-
guages by exploiting their similarity to
resource-rich ones. More precisely, we
improve the translation from a resource-
poor source language X
1
into a resource-
rich language Y given a bi-text contain-
ing a limited number of parallel sentences
for X
1
-Y and a larger bi-text for X
2
-Y
for some resource-rich language X
2
that
is closely related to X
1
. The evaluation
for Indonesian?English (using Malay)
and Spanish?English (using Portuguese
and pretending Spanish is resource-poor)
shows an absolute gain of up to 1.35 and
3.37 Bleu points, respectively, which is an
improvement over the rivaling approaches,
while using much less additional data.
