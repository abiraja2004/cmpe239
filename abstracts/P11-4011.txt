Virtual instructors can be used in several ap-
plications, ranging from trainers in simulated
worlds to non player characters for virtual
games. In this paper we present a novel
algorithm for rapidly prototyping virtual in-
structors from human-human corpora without
manual annotation. Automatically prototyp-
ing full-fledged dialogue systems from cor-
pora is far from being a reality nowadays. Our
algorithm is restricted in that only the virtual
instructor can perform speech acts while the
user responses are limited to physical actions
in the virtual world. We evaluate a virtual in-
structor, generated using this algorithm, with
human users. We compare our results both
with human instructors and rule-based virtual
instructors hand-coded for the same task.
