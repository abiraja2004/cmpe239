This paper studies two methods for train-
ing hierarchical MT rules independently
of word alignments. Bilingual chart pars-
ing and EM algorithm are used to train bi-
text correspondences. The first method,
rule arithmetic, constructs new rules as
combinations of existing and reliable rules
used in the bilingual chart, significantly
improving the translation accuracy on the
German-English and Farsi-English trans-
lation task. The second method is pro-
posed to construct additional rules directly
from the chart using inside and outside
probabilities to determine the span of the
rule and its non-terminals. The paper also
presents evidence that the rule arithmetic
can recover from alignment errors, and
that it can learn rules that are difficult to
learn from bilingual alignments.
