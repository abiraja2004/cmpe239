In this paper we describe the system with
which we participated in the CoNLL-2011
Shared Task on modelling coreference. Our
system is based on a cluster-ranking model
proposed by Rahman and Ng (2009), with
novel semantic features based on recent re-
search on narrative event schema (Chambers
and Jurafsky, 2009). We demonstrate some
improvements over the baseline when using
schema information, although the effect var-
ied between the metrics used. We also explore
the impact of various features on our system?s
performance.
