This paper describes the statistical machine
translation system submitted to the WMT11
Featured Translation Task, which involves
translating Haitian Creole SMS messages into
English. In our experiments we try to ad-
dress the issue of noise in the training data,
as well as the lack of parallel training data.
Spelling normalization is applied to reduce
out-of-vocabulary words in the corpus. Us-
ing Semantic Role Labeling rules we expand
the available training corpus. Additionally we
investigate extracting parallel sentences from
comparable data to enhance the available par-
allel data.
