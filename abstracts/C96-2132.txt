 
This paper proposes a method of the 
zero pronoun resohition, which is one 
of the essential processes in understand- 
ing systems for Japanese manual sen- 
tences. It is based on pragmatic proper- 
ties of Japanese conditionals. We exam- 
ined a uumber of sentences appearing in 
Japanese manuals according to the clas- 
sillcation based on the types of agent and 
the types of verb phrase. As ~ result, we 
obtained the following pattern of usage 
in matrix clauses: 1) The connective par- 
ticles TO and REBA have tt, e same distri- 
bution of usage. TARA and NARA have 
the same distribution of usage. 2) '\['he 
distribution of usage of TO and REBA, 
and that of TARA and NARA are com- 
plementary to each other. We show that 
these distributions of usage can be used 
for resolution of zero subjects.
