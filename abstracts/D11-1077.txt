We propose an architecture for expressing
various linguistically-motivated features that
help identify multi-word expressions in nat-
ural language texts. The architecture com-
bines various linguistically-motivated clas-
sification features in a Bayesian Network.
We introduce novel ways for computing
many of these features, and manually de-
fine linguistically-motivated interrelationships
among them, which the Bayesian network
models. Our methodology is almost en-
tirely unsupervised and completely language-
independent; it relies on few language re-
sources and is thus suitable for a large num-
ber of languages. Furthermore, unlike much
recent work, our approach can identify ex-
pressions of various types and syntactic con-
structions. We demonstrate a significant im-
provement in identification accuracy, com-
pared with less sophisticated baselines.
