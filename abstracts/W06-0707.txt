The Document Understanding Conference
(DUC) 2005 evaluation had a single user-
oriented, question-focused summarization
task, which was to synthesize from a set
of 25-50 documents a well-organized, flu-
ent answer to a complex question. The
evaluation shows that the best summariza-
tion systems have difficulty extracting rel-
evant sentences in response to complex
questions (as opposed to representative
sentences that might be appropriate to a
generic summary). The relatively gener-
ous allowance of 250 words for each an-
swer also reveals how difficult it is for
current summarization systems to produce
fluent text from multiple documents.
