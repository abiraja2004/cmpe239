 
We propose an efficient text summarization 
technique that involves two basic opera-
tions. The first operation involves finding 
coherent chunks in the document and the 
second operation involves ranking the text 
in the individual coherent chunks and pick-
ing the sentences that rank above a given 
threshold. The coherent chunks are formed 
by exploiting the lexical relationship be-
tween adjacent sentences in the document. 
Occurrence of words through repetition or 
relatedness by sense relation plays a major 
role in forming a cohesive tie. The pro-
posed text ranking approach is based on a 
graph theoretic ranking model applied to 
text summarization task.
