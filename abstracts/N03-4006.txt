The QCS information retrieval (IR) system is
presented as a tool for querying, clustering, and
summarizing document sets. QCS has been de-
veloped as a modular development framework,
and thus facilitates the inclusion of new tech-
nologies targeting these three IR tasks. Details
of the system architecture, the QCS interface,
and preliminary results are presented.
