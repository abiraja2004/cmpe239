 
In this paper, we present a Bayesian Learn-
ing based method to train word dependent 
transition models for HMM based word 
alignment. We present word alignment re-
sults on the Canadian Hansards corpus as 
compared to the conventional HMM and 
IBM model 4. We show that this method 
gives consistent and significant alignment 
error rate (AER) reduction. We also con-
ducted machine translation (MT) experi-
ments on the Europarl corpus. MT results 
show that word alignment based on this 
method can be used in a phrase-based ma-
chine translation system to yield up to 1% 
absolute improvement in BLEU score, 
compared to a conventional HMM, and 
0.8% compared to a IBM model 4 based 
word alignment.
