In this paper we report the results of a pi-
lot study of basing readability prediction
on training data annotated with reading
time. Although reading time is known to
be a good metric for predicting readabil-
ity, previous work has mainly focused on
annotating the training data with subjec-
tive readability scores usually on a 1 to
5 scale. Instead of the subjective assess-
ments of complexity, we use the more ob-
jective measure of reading time. We create
and evaluate a predictor using the binary
classification problem; the predictor iden-
tifies the better of two documents correctly
with 68.55% accuracy. We also report a
comparison of predictors based on reading
time and on readability scores.
