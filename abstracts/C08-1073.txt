This paper looks at the transcribed data of
patient-doctor consultations in an exami-
nation setting. The doctors are interna-
tionally qualified and enrolled in a bridg-
ing course as preparation for their Aus-
tralian Medical Council examination. In
this study, we attempt to ascertain if there
are measurable linguistic features of the
consultations, and to investigate whether
there is any relevant information about
the communicative styles of the qualify-
ing doctors that may predict satisfactory
or non-satisfactory examination outcomes.
We have taken a discourse analysis ap-
proach in this study, where the core unit of
analysis is a ?turn?. We approach this prob-
lem as a binary classification task and em-
ploy data mining methods to see whether
the application of which to richly anno-
tated dialogues can produce a system with
an adequate predictive capacity.
