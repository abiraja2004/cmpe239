 
We specify an algorithm that builds up a hi- 
erarchy of referential discourse segments from 
local centering data. The spatial extension and 
nesting of these discourse segments constrain 
the reachability of potential antecedents of an 
anaphoric expression beyond the local level 
of adjacent center pairs. Thus, the centering 
model is scaled up to the level of the global 
referential structure of discourse. An empiri- 
cal evaluation of the algorithm is supplied.
