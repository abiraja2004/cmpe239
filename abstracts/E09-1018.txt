We present an algorithm for pronoun-
anaphora (in English) that uses Expecta-
tion Maximization (EM) to learn virtually
all of its parameters in an unsupervised
fashion. While EM frequently fails to find
good models for the tasks to which it is
set, in this case it works quite well. We
have compared it to several systems avail-
able on the web (all we have found so far).
Our program significantly outperforms all
of them. The algorithm is fast and robust,
and has been made publically available for
downloading.
