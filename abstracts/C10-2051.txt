Because English is a low morphology lan-
guage, current statistical parsers tend to
ignore morphology and accept some level
of redundancy. This paper investigates
how costly such redundancy is for a lex-
icalised grammar such as CCG.
We use morphological analysis to split
verb inflectional suffixes into separate to-
kens, so that they can receive their own
lexical categories. We find that this im-
proves accuracy when the splits are based
on correct POS tags, but that errors in gold
standard or automatically assigned POS
tags are costly for the system. This shows
that the parser can benefit from morpho-
logical analysis, so long as the analysis is
correct.
