 
S-MINDS is a speech translation engine, 
which allows an English speaker to communi-
cate with a non-English speaker easily within 
a question-and-answer, interview-style format. 
It can handle limited dialogs such as medical 
triage or hospital admissions. We have built 
and tested an English-Korean system for do-
ing medical triage with a translation accuracy 
of 79.8% (for English) and 78.3% (for Ko-
rean) for all non-rejected utterances.  We will 
give an overview of the system building proc-
ess and the quantitative and qualitatively sys-
tem performance.
