Information on subcategorization and selec-
tional restrictions is very important for nat-
ural language processing in tasks such as
monolingual parsing, accurate rule-based ma-
chine translation and automatic summarization.
However, adding this detailed information to a
valency dictionary is both time consuming and
costly.
In this paper we present a method of assign-
ing valency information and selectional restric-
tions to entries in a bilingual dictionary, based
on information in an existing valency dictio-
nary. The method is based on two assump-
tions: words with similar meaning have simi-
lar subcategorization frames and selectional re-
strictions; and words with the same translations
have similar meanings. Based on these assump-
tions, new valency entries are constructed for
words in a plain bilingual dictionary, using en-
tries with similar source-language meaning and
the same target-language translations. We eval-
uate the effects of various measures of similarity.
