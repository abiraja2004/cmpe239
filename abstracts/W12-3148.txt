We provide a few insights on data selection for
machine translation. We evaluate the quality
of the new CzEng 1.0, a parallel data source
used in WMT12. We describe a simple tech-
nique for reducing out-of-vocabulary rate af-
ter phrase extraction. We discuss the bene-
fits of tuning towards multiple reference trans-
lations for English-Czech language pair. We
introduce a novel approach to data selection
by full-text indexing and search: we select
sentences similar to the test set from a large
monolingual corpus and explore several op-
tions of incorporating them in a machine trans-
lation system. We show that this method can
improve translation quality. Finally, we de-
scribe our submitted system CU-TAMCH-BOJ.
