We propose a generative dependency pars-
ing model which uses binary latent variables
to induce conditioning features. To define
this model we use a recently proposed class
of Bayesian Networks for structured predic-
tion, Incremental Sigmoid Belief Networks.
We demonstrate that the proposed model
achieves state-of-the-art results on three dif-
ferent languages. We also demonstrate that
the features induced by the ISBN?s latent
variables are crucial to this success, and
show that the proposed model is particularly
good on long dependencies.
