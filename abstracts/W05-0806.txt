In this work, we examine the quality of
several statistical machine translation sys-
tems constructed on a small amount of
parallel Serbian-English text. The main
bilingual parallel corpus consists of about
3k sentences and 20k running words from
an unrestricted domain. The translation
systems are built on the full corpus as well
as on a reduced corpus containing only
200 parallel sentences. A small set of
about 350 short phrases from the web is
used as additional bilingual knowledge. In
addition, we investigate the use of mono-
lingual morpho-syntactic knowledge i.e.
base forms and POS tags.
