We introduce Incremental Semantic Analy-
sis, a fully incremental word space model,
and we test it on longitudinal child-directed
speech data. On this task, ISA outperforms
the related Random Indexing algorithm, as
well as a SVD-based technique. In addi-
tion, the model has interesting properties
that might also be characteristic of the se-
mantic space of children.
