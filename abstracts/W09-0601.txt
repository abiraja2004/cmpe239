 
Augmentative and Alternative Communication 
(AAC) systems are communication aids for 
people who cannot speak because of motor or 
cognitive impairments.  We are developing 
AAC systems where users select information 
they wish to communicate, and this is ex-
pressed using an NLG system.  We believe 
this model will work well in contexts where 
AAC users wish to go beyond simply making 
requests or answering questions, and have 
more complex communicative goals such as 
story-telling and social interaction.
