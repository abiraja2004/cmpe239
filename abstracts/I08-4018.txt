 
This paper presents the results of our sys-
tem that has participated in the word seg-
mentation task in the Fourth SIGHAN 
Bakeoff. Our system consists of several ba-
sic components which include the pre-
processing, token identification and the 
post-processing. An agent-based approach 
is introduced to identify the weak segmen-
tation points. Our system has participated 
in two open and five closed tracks in five 
major corpora. Our results have attained 
top five in most of the tracks in the bakeoff. 
In particular, it is ranked first in the open 
track of the corpus from Academia Sinica, 
second in the closed track of the corpus 
from City University of Hong Kong, third 
in two closed tracks of the corpora from 
State Language Commission of P.R.C. and 
Academia Sinica.
