 
The frequency of occurrence of words in 
natural languages exhibits a periodic and 
a non-periodic component when analysed 
as a time series. This work presents an 
unsupervised method of extracting perio-
dicity information from text, enabling 
time series creation and filtering to be 
used in the creation of sophisticated lan-
guage models that can discern between 
repetitive trends and non-repetitive writ-
ing patterns. The algorithm performs in 
O(n log n) time for input of length n. The 
temporal language model is used to cre-
ate rules based on temporal-word asso-
ciations inferred from the time series. 
The rules are used to guess automatically 
at likely document creation dates, based 
on the assumption that natural languages 
have unique signatures of changing word 
distributions over time. Experimental re-
sults on news items spanning a nine year 
period show that the proposed method 
and algorithms are accurate in discover-
ing periodicity patterns and in dating 
documents automatically solely from 
their content.
