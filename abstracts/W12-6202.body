Previous work for encoding Optimality The-
ory grammars as finite-state transducers has
included two prominent approaches: the so-
called ?counting? method where constraint vi-
olations are counted and filtered out to some
set limit of approximability in a finite-state
system, and the ?matching? method, where
constraint violations in alternative strings are
matched through violation alignment in order
to remove suboptimal candidates. In this pa-
per we extend the matching approach to show
how not only markedness constraints, but also
faithfulness constraints and the interaction of
the two types of constraints can be captured
by the matching method. This often produces
exact and small FST representations for OT
grammars which we illustrate with two practi-
cal example grammars. We also provide a new
proof of nonregularity of simple OT gram-
mars.
