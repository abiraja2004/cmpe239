Opinion mining is a recent subdiscipline
of computational linguistics which is con-
cerned not with the topic a document is
about, but with the opinion it expresses.
To aid the extraction of opinions from
text, recent work has tackled the issue
of determining the orientation of ?subjec-
tive? terms contained in text, i.e. decid-
ing whether a term that carries opinion-
ated content has a positive or a negative
connotation. This is believed to be of key
importance for identifying the orientation
of documents, i.e. determining whether a
document expresses a positive or negative
opinion about its subject matter.
We contend that the plain determination
of the orientation of terms is not a realis-
tic problem, since it starts from the non-
realistic assumption that we already know
whether a term is subjective or not; this
would imply that a linguistic resource that
marks terms as ?subjective? or ?objective?
is available, which is usually not the case.
In this paper we confront the task of de-
ciding whether a given term has a positive
connotation, or a negative connotation, or
has no subjective connotation at all; this
problem thus subsumes the problem of de-
termining subjectivity and the problem of
determining orientation. We tackle this
problem by testing three different variants
of a semi-supervised method previously
proposed for orientation detection. Our
results show that determining subjectivity
and orientation is a much harder problem
than determining orientation alone.
