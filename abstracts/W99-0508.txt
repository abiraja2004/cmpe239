prehmlnary analysis of translation 
equivalents in four languages from different 
language famdles, extracted from an on-hne 
parallel corpus of George Orwell's Nmeteen 
Eighty-Four The goal of the study is to 
determine the degree to which translatmn 
equivalents for different meamngs of a 
polysemous word In Enghsh are lexlcahzed 
differently across a variety of languages, and 
to detelmme whether this information can be 
used to structure or create a set of sense 
distinctions useful in natural language 
processing apphcatmns A coherence Index 
is computed that measures the tendency for 
different senses o1 the same English word to
