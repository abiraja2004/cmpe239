 
Most spoken dialogue systems are still 
lacking in their ability to accurately model 
the complex process that is human turn-
taking.  This research analyzes a human-
human tutoring corpus in order to identify 
prosodic turn-taking cues, with the hopes 
that they can be used by intelligent tutoring 
systems to predict student turn boundaries.  
Results show that while there was variation 
between subjects, three features were sig-
nificant turn-yielding cues overall.  In addi-
tion, a positive relationship between the 
number of cues present and the probability 
of a turn yield was demonstrated.
