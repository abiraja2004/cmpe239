In this paper we propose and evaluate
a technique to perform semi-supervised
learning for Text Categorization. In
particular we defined a kernel function,
namely the Domain Kernel, that allowed
us to plug ?external knowledge? into the
supervised learning process. External
knowledge is acquired from unlabeled
data in a totally unsupervised way, and it
is represented by means of Domain Mod-
els.
We evaluated the Domain Kernel in two
standard benchmarks for Text Categoriza-
tion with good results, and we compared
its performance with a kernel function that
exploits a standard bag-of-words feature
representation. The learning curves show
that the Domain Kernel allows us to re-
duce drastically the amount of training
data required for learning.
