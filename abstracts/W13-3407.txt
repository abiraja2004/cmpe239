We present the concept of a correspon-
dence seminar as a way to complement
and support one-time contests, especially
olympiads. We evaluate specific payoffs
of this way of teaching linguistics, and
compare its nature to that of a linguistics
olympiad. We believe that the correspon-
dence seminar is a great way to introduce
talented high school students to linguis-
tics.
