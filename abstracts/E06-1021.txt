Aligning sentences belonging to compa-
rable monolingual corpora has been sug-
gested as a first step towards training
text rewriting algorithms, for tasks such
as summarization or paraphrasing. We
present here a new monolingual sen-
tence alignment algorithm, combining a
sentence-based TF*IDF score, turned into
a probability distribution using logistic re-
gression, with a global alignment dynamic
programming algorithm. Our approach
provides a simpler and more robust solu-
tion achieving a substantial improvement
in accuracy over existing systems.
