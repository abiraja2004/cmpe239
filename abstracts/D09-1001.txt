We present the first unsupervised approach
to the problem of learning a semantic
parser, using Markov logic. Our USP
system transforms dependency trees into
quasi-logical forms, recursively induces
lambda forms from these, and clusters
them to abstract away syntactic variations
of the same meaning. The MAP semantic
parse of a sentence is obtained by recur-
sively assigning its parts to lambda-form
clusters and composing them. We evalu-
ate our approach by using it to extract a
knowledge base from biomedical abstracts
and answer questions. USP substantially
outperforms TextRunner, DIRT and an in-
formed baseline on both precision and re-
call on this task.
