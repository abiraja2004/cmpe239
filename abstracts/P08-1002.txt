We present an automatic approach to deter-
mining whether a pronoun in text refers to
a preceding noun phrase or is instead non-
referential. We extract the surrounding tex-
tual context of the pronoun and gather, from
a large corpus, the distribution of words that
occur within that context. We learn to reliably
classify these distributions as representing ei-
ther referential or non-referential pronoun in-
stances. Despite its simplicity, experimental
results on classifying the English pronoun it
show the system achieves the highest perfor-
mance yet attained on this important task.
