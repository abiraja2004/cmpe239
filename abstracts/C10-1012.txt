Most of the known stochastic sentence
generators use syntactically annotated
corpora, performing the projection to
the surface in one stage. However,
in full-fledged text generation, sentence
realization usually starts from semantic
(predicate-argument) structures. To be
able to deal with semantic structures,
stochastic generators require semantically
annotated, or, even better, multilevel an-
notated corpora. Only then can they
deal with such crucial generation issues as
sentence planning, linearization and mor-
phologization. Multilevel annotated cor-
pora are increasingly available for multi-
ple languages. We take advantage of them
and propose a multilingual deep stochastic
sentence realizer that mirrors the state-of-
the-art research in semantic parsing. The
realizer uses an SVM learning algorithm.
For each pair of adjacent levels of anno-
tation, a separate decoder is defined. So
far, we evaluated the realizer for Chinese,
English, German, and Spanish.
