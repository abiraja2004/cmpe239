We present a simple method for transferring
dependency parsers from source languages
with labeled training data to target languages
without labeled training data. We first demon-
strate that delexicalized parsers can be di-
rectly transferred between languages, produc-
ing significantly higher accuracies than unsu-
pervised parsers. We then use a constraint
driven learning algorithm where constraints
are drawn from parallel corpora to project the
final parser. Unlike previous work on project-
ing syntactic resources, we show that simple
methods for introducing multiple source lan-
guages can significantly improve the overall
quality of the resulting parsers. The projected
parsers from our system result in state-of-the-
art performance when compared to previously
studied unsupervised and projected parsing
systems across eight different languages.
