We explain dialogue management tech-
niques for collaborative activities with hu-
mans, involving multiple concurrent tasks.
Conversational context for multiple con-
current activities is represented using a
?Dialogue Move Tree? and an ?Activity
Tree? which support multiple interleaved
threads of dialogue about different activi-
ties and their execution status. We also de-
scribe the incremental message selection,
aggregation, and generation method em-
ployed in the system.
