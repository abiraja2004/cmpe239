 
Recognizing speech act types in Twitter is of 
much theoretical interest and practical use. 
Our previous research did not adequately 
address the deficiency of training data for this 
multi-class learning task. In this work, we set 
out by assuming only a small seed training set 
and experiment with two semi-supervised 
learning schemes, transductive SVM and 
graph-based label propagation, which can 
leverage the knowledge about unlabeled data. 
The efficacy of semi-supervised learning is 
established by our extensive experiments, 
which also show that transductive SVM is 
more suitable than graph-based label 
propagation for our task. The empirical 
findings and detailed evidences can 
contribute to scalable speech act recognition 
in Twitter.
