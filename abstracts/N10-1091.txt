Previous work on dependency parsing used
various kinds of combination models but a
systematic analysis and comparison of these
approaches is lacking. In this paper we imple-
mented such a study for English dependency
parsing and find several non-obvious facts: (a)
the diversity of base parsers is more important
than complex models for learning (e.g., stack-
ing, supervised meta-classification), (b) ap-
proximate, linear-time re-parsing algorithms
guarantee well-formed dependency trees with-
out significant performance loss, and (c) the
simplest scoring model for re-parsing (un-
weighted voting) performs essentially as well
as other more complex models. This study
proves that fast and accurate ensemble parsers
can be built with minimal effort.
