We show that phrase structures in Penn Tree-
bank style parses are not optimal for syntax-
based machine translation. We exploit a se-
ries of binarization methods to restructure
the Penn Treebank style trees such that syn-
tactified phrases smaller than Penn Treebank
constituents can be acquired and exploited in
translation. We find that by employing the
EM algorithm for determining the binariza-
tion of a parse tree among a set of alternative
binarizations gives us the best translation re-
sult.
