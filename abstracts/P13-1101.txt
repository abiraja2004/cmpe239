This study proposes a text summarization
model that simultaneously performs sen-
tence extraction and compression. We
translate the text summarization task into
a problem of extracting a set of depen-
dency subtrees in the document cluster.
We also encode obligatory case constraints
as must-link dependency constraints in or-
der to guarantee the readability of the gen-
erated summary. In order to handle the
subtree extraction problem, we investigate
a new class of submodular maximization
problem, and a new algorithm that has
the approximation ratio 12(1 ? e?1). Ourexperiments with the NTCIR ACLIA test
collections show that our approach outper-
forms a state-of-the-art algorithm.
