We describe the use of a weakly supervised
bootstrapping algorithm in discovering con-
trasting semantic categories from a source lex-
icon with little training data. Our method pri-
marily exploits the patterns in sentential con-
texts where different categories of words may
appear. Experimental results are presented
showing that such automatically categorized
terms tend to agree with human judgements.
