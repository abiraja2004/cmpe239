Sentiment analysis seeks to identify the view-
point(s) underlying a text span; an example appli-
cation is classifying a movie review as ?thumbs up?
or ?thumbs down?. To determine this sentiment po-
larity, we propose a novel machine-learning method
that applies text-categorization techniques to just
the subjective portions of the document. Extracting
these portions can be implemented using efficient
techniques for finding minimum cuts in graphs; this
greatly facilitates incorporation of cross-sentence
contextual constraints.
