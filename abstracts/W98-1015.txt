 
The paper presents a new segmentation-free 
approach to the Arabic optical character 
recognition. Extended with a suitable pre- 
and post-processing the method offers a 
simple and fast framework to develop a full 
OCR system. The method was developed 
primarily for the Naskhi font, it is however 
robust and flexible and can be easily 
extended.
