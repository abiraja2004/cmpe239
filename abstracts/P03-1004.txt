Kernel-based learning (e.g., Support Vec-
tor Machines) has been successfully ap-
plied to many hard problems in Natural
Language Processing (NLP). In NLP, al-
though feature combinations are crucial to
improving performance, they are heuris-
tically selected. Kernel methods change
this situation. The merit of the kernel
methods is that effective feature combina-
tion is implicitly expanded without loss
of generality and increasing the compu-
tational costs. Kernel-based text analysis
shows an excellent performance in terms
in accuracy; however, these methods are
usually too slow to apply to large-scale
text analysis. In this paper, we extend
a Basket Mining algorithm to convert a
kernel-based classifier into a simple and
fast linear classifier. Experimental results
on English BaseNP Chunking, Japanese
Word Segmentation and Japanese Depen-
dency Parsing show that our new classi-
fiers are about 30 to 300 times faster than
the standard kernel-based classifiers.
