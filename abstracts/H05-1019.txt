In order to promote the study of auto-
matic summarization and translation, we
need an accurate automatic evaluation
method that is close to human evalua-
tion. In this paper, we present an eval-
uation method that is based on convolu-
tion kernels that measure the similarities
between texts considering their substruc-
tures. We conducted an experiment us-
ing automatic summarization evaluation
data developed for Text Summarization
Challenge 3 (TSC-3). A comparison with
conventional techniques shows that our
method correlates more closely with hu-
man evaluations and is more robust.
