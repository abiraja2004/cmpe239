Significant amount of work has been
devoted recently to develop learning
techniques that can be used to gener-
ate partial (shallow) analysis of natu-
ral language sentences rather than a full
parse. In this work we set out to evalu-
ate whether this direction is worthwhile
by comparing a learned shallow parser
to one of the best learned full parsers
on tasks both can perform ? identify-
ing phrases in sentences. We conclude
that directly learning to perform these
tasks as shallow parsers do is advanta-
geous over full parsers both in terms of
performance and robustness to new and
lower quality texts.
