We describe the design and implementation of
a system for data exploration over dependency
parses and derived semantic representations
in a large-scale NLP-based search system at
powerset.com. Because of the distributed
nature of the document repository and the pro-
cessing infrastructure, and also the complex
representations of the corpus data, standard
text analysis tools such as grep or awk or
language modeling toolkits are not applicable.
This paper explores the challenges of extract-
ing statistical information and of building lan-
guage models in such a distributed NLP envi-
ronment, and introduces a corpus analysis sys-
tem, Oceanography, that simplifies the writ-
ing of analysis code and transparently takes
advantage of existing distributed processing
infrastructure.
