We propose a novel method for inducing monolingual
semantic hierarchies and sense clusters from numerous
foreign-language-to-English bilingual dictionaries. The
method exploits patterns of non-transitivity in transla-
tions across multiple languages. No complex or hierar-
chical structure is assumed or used in the input dictio-
naries: each is initially parsed into the ?lowest common
denominator? form, which is to say, a list of pairs of the
form (foreign word, English word). We then propose a
monolingual synonymy measure derived from this ag-
gregate resource, which is used to derive multilingually-
motivated sense hierarchies for monolingual English
words, with potential applications in word sense classifi-
cation, lexicography and statistical machine translation.
