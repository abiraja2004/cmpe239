This paper presents a method of improv-
ing the accuracy of subcategorization
frames (SCFs) acquired from corpora to
augment existing lexicon resources. I
estimate a confidence value of each SCF
using corpus-based statistics, and then
perform clustering of SCF confidence-
value vectors for words to capture co-
occurrence tendency among SCFs in the
lexicon. I apply my method to SCFs
acquired from corpora using lexicons
of two large-scale lexicalized grammars.
The resulting SCFs achieve higher pre-
cision and recall compared to SCFs ob-
tained by naive frequency cut-off.
