: 
in this paper, we proposed a shallow 
syntactic knowledge description: 
constituent boundary representation a d its 
simple and efficient prediction algorithm, 
based on different local context templates 
learned fiom the annotated corpus. An open 
test on 2780 Chinese real text sentences 
showed the satisfying results: 94%(92%) 
precision for the words with multiple 
(single) boundary tag output. 
llt simplified the complex constituent levels in 
parse trees and only kept the boundary 
information of every word in different 
constituents. Then, we developed a simple and 
efficient constituent boundary prediction 
algorithm, based on different local context 
templates learned flom the annotated corpus. An 
open test on 2780 Chinese real text sentences 
showed the satisfying results: 94%(92%) 
precision for lhe words with multiple (single) 
boundary lag output.
