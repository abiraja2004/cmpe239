 
Localisation is one of the fastest growing 
industrial sectors in the digital world. Since 
the mid-eighties, the role of localisation has 
developed and changed dramatically. 
Localisation has been redefined as the 
provision of services and technologies for the 
management of multilinguality across the 
global information flow. This paper discusses 
the need for easily accessible dedicated 
language resources for localisation, provides a 
practical example of what can be achieved 
with appropriate language resources in the 
context of localisation and proposes a strategy 
to acquire, maintain and make them easily 
accessible.
