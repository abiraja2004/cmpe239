 
Traditionally, word sense disambiguation 
(WSD) involves a different context model for 
each individual word. This paper presents a 
new approach to WSD using weakly 
supervised learning. Statistical models are not 
trained for the contexts of each individual 
word, but for the similarities between context 
pairs at category level. The insight is that the 
correlation regularity between the sense 
distinction and the context distinction can be 
captured at category level, independent of 
individual words. This approach only requires 
a limited amount of existing annotated training 
corpus in order to disambiguate the entire 
vocabulary. A context clustering scheme is 
developed within the Bayesian framework. A 
maximum entropy model is then trained to 
represent the generative probability 
distribution of context similarities based on 
heterogeneous features, including trigger 
words and parsing structures. Statistical 
annealing is applied to derive the final context 
clusters by globally fitting the pairwise 
context similarity distribution. Benchmarking 
shows that this new approach significantly 
outperforms the existing WSD systems in the 
unsupervised category, and rivals supervised 
WSD systems.
