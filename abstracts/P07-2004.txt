In this paper, we introduce SEMTAG, a free
and open software architecture for the de-
velopment of Tree Adjoining Grammars in-
tegrating a compositional semantics. SEM-
TAG differs from XTAG in two main ways.
First, it provides an expressive grammar
formalism and compiler for factorising and
specifying TAGs. Second, it supports se-
mantic construction.
