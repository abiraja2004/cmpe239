We propose an efficient method to detect
end-of-utterances from prosodic information in
conversational speech. Our method is based
on the application of a large set of binary and
ramp filters to the energy and fundamental fre-
quency signals obtained from the speech sig-
nal. These filter responses, which can be com-
puted very efficiently, are used as input to a
learning algorithm that generates the final de-
tector. Preliminary experiments using data ob-
tained from conversations show that an accu-
rate classifier can be trained efficiently and that
good results can be obtained without requiring
a speech recognition system.
