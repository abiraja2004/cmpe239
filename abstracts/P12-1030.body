This paper addresses the search problem in
textual inference, where systems need to infer
one piece of text from another. A prominent
approach to this task is attempts to transform
one text into the other through a sequence
of inference-preserving transformations, a.k.a.
a proof, while estimating the proof?s valid-
ity. This raises a search challenge of find-
ing the best possible proof. We explore this
challenge through a comprehensive investi-
gation of prominent search algorithms and
propose two novel algorithmic components
specifically designed for textual inference: a
gradient-style evaluation function, and a local-
lookahead node expansion method. Evalua-
tions, using the open-source system, BIUTEE,
show the contribution of these ideas to search
efficiency and proof quality.
