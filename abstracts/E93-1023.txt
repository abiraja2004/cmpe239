 
One of the major problems one is faced 
with when decomposing words into their 
constituent parts is ambiguity: the gen- 
eration of multiple analyses for one input 
word, many of which are implausible. In 
order to deal with ambiguity, the MOR- 
phological PArser MORPA is provided 
with a probabilistic ontext-free grammar 
(PCFG), i.e. it combines a "conventional" 
context-free morphological grammar to fil- 
ter out ungrammatical segmentations with 
a probability-based scoring function which 
determines the likelihood of each success- 
ful parse. Consequently, remaining analy- 
ses can be ordered along a scale of plausi- 
bility. Test performance data will show that 
a PCFG yields good results in morphologi- 
cal parsing. MORPA is a fully implemented 
parser developed for use in a text-to-speech 
conversion system.
