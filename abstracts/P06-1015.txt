 
In this paper, we present Espresso, a 
weakly-supervised, general-purpose, 
and accurate algorithm for harvesting 
semantic relations. The main contribu-
tions are: i) a method for exploiting ge-
neric patterns by filtering incorrect 
instances using the Web; and ii) a prin-
cipled measure of pattern and instance 
reliability enabling the filtering algo-
rithm. We present an empirical com-
parison of Espresso with various state of 
the art systems, on different size and 
genre corpora, on extracting various 
general and specific relations. Experi-
mental results show that our exploita-
tion of generic patterns substantially 
increases system recall with small effect 
on overall precision.
