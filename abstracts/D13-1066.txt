A common form of sarcasm on Twitter con-
sists of a positive sentiment contrasted with a
negative situation. For example, many sarcas-
tic tweets include a positive sentiment, such as
?love? or ?enjoy?, followed by an expression
that describes an undesirable activity or state
(e.g., ?taking exams? or ?being ignored?). We
have developed a sarcasm recognizer to iden-
tify this type of sarcasm in tweets. We present
a novel bootstrapping algorithm that automati-
cally learns lists of positive sentiment phrases
and negative situation phrases from sarcastic
tweets. We show that identifying contrast-
ing contexts using the phrases learned through
bootstrapping yields improved recall for sar-
casm recognition.
