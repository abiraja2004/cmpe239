This article presents empirical evaluations
of aspects of annotation for the linguis-
tic property of animacy in Swedish, rang-
ing from manual human annotation, auto-
matic classification and, finally, an exter-
nal evaluation in the task of syntactic pars-
ing. We show that a treatment of animacy
as a lexical semantic property of noun
types enables generalization over distri-
butional properties of these nouns which
proves beneficial in automatic classifica-
tion and furthermore gives significant im-
provements in terms of parsing accuracy
for Swedish, compared to a state-of-the-
art baseline parser with gold standard ani-
macy information.
