We present an operational framework al-
lowing to express a large scale Tree Ad-
joining Grammar (TAG) by using higher
level operational constraints on tree de-
scriptions. These constraints first meant
to guarantee the well formedness of the
grammatical units may also be viewed as
a way to put model theoretic syntax at
work through an efficient offline grammat-
ical compilation process. Our strategy pre-
serves TAG formal properties, hence en-
sures a reasonable processing efficiency.
