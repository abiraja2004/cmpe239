While most work on parsing with PCFGs
has focused on local correlations between
tree configurations, we attempt to model
non-local correlations using a finite mix-
ture of PCFGs. A mixture grammar fit
with the EM algorithm shows improve-
ment over a single PCFG, both in parsing
accuracy and in test data likelihood. We
argue that this improvement comes from
the learning of specialized grammars that
capture non-local correlations.
