Statistical ranking methods based on cen-
troid vector (profile) extracted from ex-
ternal knowledge have become widely 
adopted in the top definitional QA sys-
tems in TREC 2003 and 2004. In these 
approaches, terms in the centroid vector 
are treated as a bag of words based on the 
independent assumption. To relax this as-
sumption, this paper proposes a novel 
language model-based answer reranking 
method to improve the existing bag-of-
words model approach by considering the 
dependence of the words in the centroid 
vector. Experiments have been conducted 
to evaluate the different dependence 
models. The results on the TREC 2003 
test set show that the reranking approach 
with biterm language model, significantly 
outperforms the one with the bag-of-
words model and unigram language 
model by 14.9% and 12.5% respectively 
in F-Measure(5).
