Parallel corpora are crucial for training
SMT systems. However, for many lan-
guage pairs they are available only in
very limited quantities. For these lan-
guage pairs a huge portion of phrases en-
countered at run-time will be unknown.
We show how techniques from paraphras-
ing can be used to deal with these oth-
erwise unknown source language phrases.
Our results show that augmenting a state-
of-the-art SMT system with paraphrases
leads to significantly improved coverage
and translation quality. For a training
corpus with 10,000 sentence pairs we in-
crease the coverage of unique test set un-
igrams from 48% to 90%, with more than
half of the newly covered items accurately
translated, as opposed to none in current
approaches.
