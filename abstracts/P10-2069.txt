We initiate a study comparing effective-
ness of the transformed spaces learned by
recently proposed supervised, and semi-
supervised metric learning algorithms
to those generated by previously pro-
posed unsupervised dimensionality reduc-
tion methods (e.g., PCA). Through a va-
riety of experiments on different real-
world datasets, we find IDML-IT, a semi-
supervised metric learning algorithm to be
the most effective.
