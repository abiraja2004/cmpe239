Cognitive theories of dialogue hold that en-
trainment, the automatic alignment between
dialogue partners at many levels of linguistic
representation, is key to facilitating both pro-
duction and comprehension in dialogue. In
this paper we examine novel types of entrain-
ment in two corpora?Switchboard and the
Columbia Games corpus. We examine en-
trainment in use of high-frequency words (the
most common words in the corpus), and its as-
sociation with dialogue naturalness and flow,
as well as with task success. Our results show
that such entrainment is predictive of the per-
ceived naturalness of dialogues and is signifi-
cantly correlated with task success; in overall
interaction flow, higher degrees of entrainment
are associated with more overlaps and fewer
interruptions.
