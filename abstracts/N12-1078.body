Given a parallel corpus, if two distinct words
in language A, a1 and a2, are aligned to the
same word b1 in language B, then this might
signal that b1 is polysemous, or it might sig-
nal a1 and a2 are synonyms. Both assump-
tions with successful work have been put for-
ward in the literature. We investigate these
assumptions, along with other questions of
word sense, by looking at sampled parallel
sentences containing tokens of the same type
in English, asking how often they mean the
same thing when they are: 1. aligned to the
same foreign type; and 2. aligned to different
foreign types. Results for French-English and
Chinese-English parallel corpora show simi-
lar behavior: Synonymy is only very weakly
the more prevalent scenario, where both cases
regularly occur.
