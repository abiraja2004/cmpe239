 
In this paper, we propose an algorithm for 
aligning words with their translation in a 
bilingual corpus. Conventional algorithms are 
based on word-by-word models which require 
bilingual data with hundreds of thousand 
sentences for training. By using a word-based 
approach, less frequent words or words with 
diverse translations generally do not have 
statistically significant evidence for confident 
alignment. Consequently, incomplete or 
incorrect alignments occur. Our algorithm 
attempts to handle the problem using class- 
based rules which are automatic acquired from 
bilingual materials uch as a bilingual corpus or 
machine readable dictionary. The procedures for 
acquiring these rules is also described. We found 
that the algorithm can align over 80% of word 
pairs while maintaining a comparably high 
precision rate, even when a small corpus was 
used in .training. The algorithm also poses the 
advantage of producing a tagged corpus for 
word sense disambiguation.
