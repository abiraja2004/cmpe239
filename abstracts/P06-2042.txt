Japanese dependency structure is usu-
ally represented by relationships between
phrasal units called bunsetsus. One of the
biggest problems with dependency struc-
ture analysis in spontaneous speech is that
clause boundaries are ambiguous. This
paper describes a method for detecting
the boundaries of quotations and inserted
clauses and that for improving the depen-
dency accuracy by applying the detected
boundaries to dependency structure anal-
ysis. The quotations and inserted clauses
are determined by using an SVM-based
text chunking method that considers in-
formation on morphemes, pauses, fillers,
etc. The information on automatically an-
alyzed dependency structure is also used
to detect the beginning of the clauses.
Our evaluation experiment using Corpus
of Spontaneous Japanese (CSJ) showed
that the automatically estimated bound-
aries of quotations and inserted clauses
helped to improve the accuracy of depen-
dency structure analysis.
