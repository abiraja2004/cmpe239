This demo showcases Thoughtland, an
end-to-end system that takes training data
and a selected machine learning model,
produces a cloud of points via cross-
validation to approximate its error func-
tion, then uses model-based clustering to
identify interesting components of the er-
ror function and natural language genera-
tion to produce an English text summariz-
ing the error function.
