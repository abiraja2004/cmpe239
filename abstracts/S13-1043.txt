Implicit arguments are a discourse-level phe-
nomenon that has not been extensively stud-
ied in semantic processing. One reason for
this lies in the scarce amount of annotated data
sets available. We argue that more data of
this kind would be helpful to improve exist-
ing approaches to linking implicit arguments
in discourse and to enable more in-depth stud-
ies of the phenomenon itself. In this paper, we
present a range of studies that empirically val-
idate this claim. Our contributions are three-
fold: we present a heuristic approach to auto-
matically identify implicit arguments and their
antecedents by exploiting comparable texts;
we show how the induced data can be used as
training data for improving existing argument
linking models; finally, we present a novel ap-
proach to modeling local coherence that ex-
tends previous approaches by taking into ac-
count non-explicit entity references.
