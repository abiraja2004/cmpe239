The CoNLL-2012 shared task is an extension
of the last year?s coreference task. We partici-
pated in the closed track of the shared tasks in
both years. In this paper, we present the im-
provements of Illinois-Coref system from last
year. We focus on improving mention detec-
tion and pronoun coreference resolution, and
present a new learning protocol. These new
strategies boost the performance of the system
by 5% MUC F1, 0.8% BCUB F1, and 1.7%
CEAF F1 on the OntoNotes-5.0 development
set.
