 Mitkov and Ha (2003) and Mitkov et al (2006) offered an alternative to the lengthy and demanding activity of developing multiple-choice test items by proposing an NLP-based methodology for construction of test items from instructive texts such as textbook chapters and encyclopaedia entries. One of the interesting research questions which emerged during these projects was how better quality distractors could automatically be chosen. This paper reports the results of a study seeking to establish which similarity measures generate better quality distractors of multiple-choice tests. Similarity measures employed in the procedure of selection of distractors are collocation patterns, four different methods of WordNet-based semantic similarity (extended gloss overlap measure, Leacock and Chodorow?s, Jiang and Conrath?s as well as Lin?s measures), distributional similarity, phonetic similarity as well as a mixed strategy combining the aforementioned measures. The evaluation results show that the methods based on Lin?s measure and on the mixed strategy outperform the rest, albeit not in a statistically significant fashion. 1
