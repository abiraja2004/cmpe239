 
In business, the retrieval of up-to-date, or fresh, 
information is very important. It is difficult for 
conventional search engines based on a centralized 
architecture to retrieve fresh information, because 
they take a long time to collect documents via Web 
robots. In contrast to a centralized architecture, a 
search engine based on a distributed architecture 
does not need to collect documents, because each 
site makes an index independently. As a result, 
distributed search engines can be used to retrieve 
fresh information. However, fast indexing alone is 
not enough to retrieve fresh information, as support 
for temporal information based retrieval is also 
required. In this paper, we describe temporal 
information retrieval in distributed search engines. In 
particular, we propose an implementation of 
temporal ranking.
