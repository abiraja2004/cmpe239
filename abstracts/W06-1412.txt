We report on a study examining the gener-
ation of noun phrases within a spoken di-
alog agent for a navigation domain. The
task is to provide real-time instructions
that direct the user to move between a se-
ries of destinations within a large interior
space. A subtask within sentence plan-
ning is determining what form to choose
for noun phrases. This choice is driven by
both the discourse history and spatial con-
text features derived from the direction-
follower?s position, e.g. his view angle,
distance from the target referent and the
number of similar items in view. The al-
gorithm was developed as a decision tree
and its output was evaluated by a group of
human judges who rated 62.6% of the ex-
pressions generated by the system to be as
good as or better than the language origi-
nally produced by human dialog partners.
