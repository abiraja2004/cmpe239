In this paper we describe the SemEval-
2010 Cross-Lingual Lexical Substitution task,
which is based on the English Lexical Substi-
tution task run at SemEval-2007. In the En-
glish version of the task, annotators and sys-
tems had to find an alternative substitute word
or phrase for a target word in context. In this
paper we propose a task where the target word
and contexts will be in English, but the substi-
tutes will be in Spanish. In this paper we pro-
vide background and motivation for the task
and describe how the dataset will differ from
a machine translation task and previous word
sense disambiguation tasks based on parallel
data. We describe the annotation process and
how we anticipate scoring the system output.
We finish with some ideas for participating
systems.
