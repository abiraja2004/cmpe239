This paper revisits the work of (Malladi and
Mannem, 2013) which focused on building
a Statistical Morphological Analyzer (SMA)
for Hindi and compares the performance of
SMA with other existing statistical analyzer,
Morfette. We shall evaluate SMA in vari-
ous experiment scenarios and look at how it
performs for unseen words. The later part
of the paper presents the effect of the pre-
dicted morph features on dependency parsing
and extends the work to other morphologically
rich languages: Hindi and Telugu, without any
language-specific engineering.
