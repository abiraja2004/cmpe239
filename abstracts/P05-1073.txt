Despite much recent progress on accu-
rate semantic role labeling, previous work
has largely used independent classifiers,
possibly combined with separate label se-
quence models via Viterbi decoding. This
stands in stark contrast to the linguistic
observation that a core argument frame is
a joint structure, with strong dependen-
cies between arguments. We show how to
build a joint model of argument frames,
incorporating novel features that model
these interactions into discriminative log-
linear models. This system achieves an
error reduction of 22% on all arguments
and 32% on core arguments over a state-
of-the art independent classifier for gold-
standard parse trees on PropBank.
