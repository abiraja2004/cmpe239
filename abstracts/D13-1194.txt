This short paper presents a pilot study in-
vestigating the training of a standard Seman-
tic Role Labeling (SRL) system on product
reviews for the new task of detecting com-
parisons. An (opinionated) comparison con-
sists of a comparative ?predicate? and up to
three ?arguments?: the entity evaluated posi-
tively, the entity evaluated negatively, and the
aspect under which the comparison is made.
In user-generated product reviews, the ?predi-
cate? and ?arguments? are expressed in highly
heterogeneous ways; but since the elements
are textually annotated in existing datasets,
SRL is technically applicable. We address the
interesting question how well training an out-
of-the-box SRL model works for English data.
We observe that even without any feature en-
gineering or other major adaptions to our task,
the system outperforms a reasonable heuristic
baseline in all steps (predicate identification,
argument identification and argument classifi-
cation) and in three different datasets.
