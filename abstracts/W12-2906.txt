 
The number of people with dementia of the Alzheimer's 
type (DAT) continues to grow. One of the significant 
impacts of this disease is a decline in the ability to 
communicate using natural language. This decline in 
language facility often results in decreased social inter-
action and life satisfaction for persons with DAT and 
their caregivers. One possible strategy to lessen the ef-
fects of this loss of language facility is for the unaffect-
ed conversational partner (Facilitator) to "co-construct" 
short autobiographical stories from the life of the DAT-
affected conversational partner (Storyteller).  It has been 
observed that a skilled conversational partner can facili-
tate co-constructed narrative with individuals who have 
mild to moderate DAT.  Developing a computational 
model of this type of co-constructed narrative would 
enable assistive technology to be developed that can 
monitor a conversation between a Storyteller and Facili-
tator. This technology could provide context-sensitive 
suggestions to an unskilled Facilitator to help maintain 
the flow of conversation. This paper describes a frame-
work in which the necessary computational model of 
co-constructed narrative can be developed. An analysis 
of the fundamental elements of such a model will be 
presented.
