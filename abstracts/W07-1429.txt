1 In this paper, we present a study for ex-
tracting and aligning paraphrases in the con-
text of Sentence Compression. First, we jus-
tify the application of a new measure for the
automatic extraction of paraphrase corpora.
Second, we discuss the work done by (Barzi-
lay & Lee, 2003) who use clustering of para-
phrases to induce rewriting rules. We will
see, through classical visualization method-
ologies (Kruskal & Wish, 1977) and exhaus-
tive experiments, that clustering may not be
the best approach for automatic pattern iden-
tification. Finally, we will provide some re-
sults of different biology based methodolo-
gies for pairwise paraphrase alignment.
