Examples from chat interaction are
presented to demonstrate that machine
translation of written interaction
shares many problems with translation
of spoken interaction. The potential
for common solutions to the problems
is illustrated by describing operations
that normalize and tag input before
translation.  Segmenting utterances
into small translation units and
processing short turns separately  are
also motivated using data from chat.
