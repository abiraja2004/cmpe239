This paper presents the participation of the
University of Bari (UBA) at the SemEval-
2010 Cross-Lingual Lexical Substitution
Task. The goal of the task is to substi-
tute a word in a language L
s
, which oc-
curs in a particular context, by provid-
ing the best synonyms in a different lan-
guage L
t
which fit in that context. This
task has a strict relation with the task of
automatic machine translation, but there
are some differences: Cross-lingual lexi-
cal substitution targets one word at a time
and the main goal is to find as many good
translations as possible for the given tar-
get word. Moreover, there are some con-
nections with Word Sense Disambiguation
(WSD) algorithms. Indeed, understand-
ing the meaning of the target word is nec-
essary to find the best substitutions. An
important aspect of this kind of task is
the possibility of finding synonyms with-
out using a particular sense inventory or a
specific parallel corpus, thus allowing the
participation of unsupervised approaches.
UBA proposes two systems: the former is
based on an automatic translation system
which exploits Google Translator, the lat-
ter is based on a parallel corpus approach
which relies on Wikipedia in order to find
the best substitutions.
