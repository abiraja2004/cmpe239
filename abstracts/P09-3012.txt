Sentence Clustering is often used as a first
step in Multi-Document Summarization
(MDS) to find redundant information. All
the same there is no gold standard avail-
able. This paper describes the creation
of a gold standard for sentence cluster-
ing from DUC document sets. The proce-
dure of building the gold standard and the
guidelines which were given to six human
judges are described. The most widely
used and promising evaluation measures
are presented and discussed.
