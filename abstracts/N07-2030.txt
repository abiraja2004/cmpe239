This paper presents a way to perform
speaker adaptation for automatic speech
recognition using the stream weights in a
multi-stream setup, which included acous-
tic models for ?Articulatory Features?
such as ROUNDED or VOICED. We
present supervised speaker adaptation ex-
periments on a spontaneous speech task
and compare the above stream-based ap-
proach to conventional approaches, in
which the models, and not stream com-
bination weights, are being adapted. In
the approach we present, stream weights
model the importance of features such as
VOICED for word discrimination, which
offers a descriptive interpretation of the
adaptation parameters.
