We introduce the zipfR package, a power-
ful and user-friendly open-source tool for
LNRE modeling of word frequency distribu-
tions in the R statistical environment. We
give some background on LNRE models,
discuss related software and the motivation
for the toolkit, describe the implementation,
and conclude with a complete sample ses-
sion showing a typical LNRE analysis.
