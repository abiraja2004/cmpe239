Traditionally, automated triage of papers is
performed using lexical (unigram, bigram,
and sometimes trigram) features. This pa-
per explores the use of information extrac-
tion (IE) techniques to create richer linguistic
features than traditional bag-of-words models.
Our classifier includes lexico-syntactic pat-
terns and more-complex features that repre-
sent a pattern coupled with its extracted noun,
represented both as a lexical term and as a
semantic category. Our experimental results
show that the IE-based features can improve
performance over unigram and bigram fea-
tures alone. We present intrinsic evaluation
results of full-text document classification ex-
periments to determine automatically whether
a paper should be considered of interest to
biologists at the Mouse Genome Informatics
(MGI) system at the Jackson Laboratories. We
also further discuss issues relating to design
and deployment of our classifiers as an ap-
plication to support scientific knowledge cu-
ration at MGI.
