We have explored the usefulness of incorporat-
ing speech and discourse features in an automatic
speech summarization system applied to meeting
recordings from the ICSI Meetings corpus. By an-
alyzing speaker activity, turn-taking and discourse
cues, we hypothesize that such a system can out-
perform solely text-based methods inherited from
the field of text summarization. The summariza-
tion methods are described, two evaluation meth-
ods are applied and compared, and the results
clearly show that utilizing such features is advanta-
geous and efficient. Even simple methods relying
on discourse cues and speaker activity can outper-
form text summarization approaches.
