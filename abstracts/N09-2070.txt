Information retrieval and spoken-term detec-
tion from audio such as broadcast news, tele-
phone conversations, conference calls, and
meetings are of great interest to the academic,
government, and business communities. Mo-
tivated by the requirement for high-quality in-
dexes, this study explores the effect of using
both word and sub-word information to find
in-vocabulary and OOV query terms. It also
explores the trade-off between search accu-
racy and the speed of audio transcription. We
present a novel, vocabulary independent, hy-
brid LVCSR approach to audio indexing and
search and show that using phonetic confu-
sions derived from posterior probabilities es-
timated by a neural network in the retrieval
of OOV queries can help in reducing misses.
These methods are evaluated on data sets from
the 2006 NIST STD task.
