OCR (Optical Character Recognition) scan-
ners do not always produce 100% accuracy
in recognizing text documents, leading to
spelling errors that make the texts hard to
process further. This paper presents an in-
vestigation for the task of spell checking
for OCR-scanned text documents. First, we
conduct a detailed analysis on characteris-
tics of spelling errors given by an OCR
scanner. Then, we propose a fully auto-
matic approach combining both error detec-
tion and correction phases within a unique
scheme. The scheme is designed in an un-
supervised & data-driven manner, suitable
for resource-poor languages. Based on the
evaluation on real dataset in Vietnamese
language, our approach gives an acceptable
performance (detection accuracy 86%, cor-
rection accuracy 71%). In addition, we also
give a result analysis to show how accurate
our approach can achieve.
