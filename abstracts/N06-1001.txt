We present a probabilistic bilingual capi-
talization model for capitalizing machine
translation outputs using conditional ran-
dom fields. Experiments carried out on
three language pairs and a variety of ex-
periment conditions show that our model
significantly outperforms a strong mono-
lingual capitalization model baseline, es-
pecially when working with small datasets
and/or European language pairs.
