Word sense induction and discrimination
(WSID) identifies the senses of an am-
biguous word and assigns instances of this
word to one of these senses. We have build
a WSID system that exploits syntactic and
semantic features based on the results of
a natural language parser component. To
achieve high robustness and good general-
ization capabilities, we designed our sys-
tem to work on a restricted, but grammat-
ically rich set of features. Based on the
results of the evaluations our system pro-
vides a promising performance and robust-
ness.
