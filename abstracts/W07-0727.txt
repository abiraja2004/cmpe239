In this paper we describe the Interactive Sys-
tems Laboratories (ISL) phrase-based ma-
chine translation system used in the shared
task ?Machine Translation for European
Languages? of the ACL 2007 Workshop on
Statistical Machine Translation. We present
results for a system combination of the
ISL syntax-augmented MT system and the
ISL phrase-based system by combining and
rescoring the n-best lists of the two systems.
We also investigate the combination of two
of our phrase-based systems translating from
different source languages, namely Spanish
and German, into their common target lan-
guage, English.
