This paper reports on experiments in clas-
sifying the semantic role annotations as-
signed to prepositional phrases in both the
PENN TREEBANK and FRAMENET. In
both cases, experiments are done to see
how the prepositions can be classified
given the dataset?s role inventory, using
standard word-sense disambiguation fea-
tures. In addition to using traditional word
collocations, the experiments incorporate
class-based collocations in the form of
WordNet hypernyms. For Treebank, the
word collocations achieve slightly better
performance: 78.5% versus 77.4% when
separate classifiers are used per preposi-
tion. When using a single classifier for
all of the prepositions together, the com-
bined approach yields a significant gain at
85.8% accuracy versus 81.3% for word-
only collocations. For FrameNet, the
combined use of both collocation types
achieves better performance for the indi-
vidual classifiers: 70.3% versus 68.5%.
However, classification using a single
classifier is not effective due to confusion
among the fine-grained roles.
