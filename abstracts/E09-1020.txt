In this paper, we first demonstrate the in-
terest of the Loopy Belief Propagation al-
gorithm to train and use a simple align-
ment model where the expected marginal
values needed for an efficient EM-training
are not easily computable. We then im-
prove this model with a distortion model
based on structure conservation.
