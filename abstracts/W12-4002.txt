This paper presents a game with a purpose
for the construction of a Portuguese lexical-
semantic network. The network creation is
implicit, as players collaboratively create links
between words while they have fun. We de-
scribe the principles and implementation of
the platform. As this is an ongoing project,
we discuss challenges and long-term goals.We
present the current network in terms a quanti-
tative and qualitative analysis, comparing it to
other resources. Finally, we describe our tar-
get applications.
