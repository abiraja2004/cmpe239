This paper presents a novel approach of in-
corporating fine-grained treebanking deci-
sions made by human annotators as dis-
criminative features for automatic parse
disambiguation. To our best knowledge,
this is the first work that exploits treebank-
ing decisions for this task. The advan-
tage of this approach is that use of human
judgements is made. The paper presents
comparative analyses of the performance
of discriminative models built using tree-
banking decisions and state-of-the-art fea-
tures. We also highlight how differently
these features scale when these models are
tested on out-of-domain data. We show
that, features extracted using treebanking
decisions are more efficient, informative
and robust compared to traditional fea-
tures.
