zation technique in spoken dialogue systems. 
Opinion mining has been well studied for 
years, but very few have considered its appli-
cation in spoken dialogue systems. Review 
summarization, when applied to real dialogue 
systems, is much more complicated than pure 
text-based summarization. We conduct a sys-
tematic study on dialogue-system-oriented 
review analysis and propose a three-level 
framework for a recommendation dialogue 
system. In previous work we have explored a 
linguistic parsing approach to phrase extrac-
tion from reviews. In this paper we will de-
scribe an approach using statistical models 
such as decision trees and SVMs to select the 
most representative phrases from the ex-
tracted phrase set. We will also explain how 
to generate informative yet concise review 
summaries for dialogue purposes. Experimen-
tal results in the restaurant domain show that 
the proposed approach using decision tree al-
gorithms achieves an outperformance of 13% 
compared to SVM models and an improve-
ment of 36% over a heuristic rule baseline. 
Experiments also show that the decision-tree-
based phrase selection model can achieve ra-
ther reliable predictions on the phrase label, 
comparable to human judgment. The pro-
posed statistical approach is based on do-
main-independent learning features and can 
be extended to other domains effectively.
