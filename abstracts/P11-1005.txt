Active Learning (AL) has been proposed as a
technique to reduce the amount of annotated
data needed in the context of supervised clas-
sification. While various simulation studies
for a number of NLP tasks have shown that
AL works well on goldstandard data, there is
some doubt whether the approach can be suc-
cessful when applied to noisy, real-world data
sets. This paper presents a thorough evalua-
tion of the impact of annotation noise on AL
and shows that systematic noise resulting from
biased coder decisions can seriously harm the
AL process. We present a method to filter out
inconsistent annotations during AL and show
that this makes AL far more robust when ap-
plied to noisy data.
