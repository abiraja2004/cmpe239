Motivated by recent work in phonotac-
tic learning (Hayes and Wilson 2008, Al-
bright 2009), this paper shows how to de-
fine feature-based probability distributions
whose parameters can be provably effi-
ciently estimated. The main idea is that
these distributions are defined as a prod-
uct of simpler distributions (cf. Ghahra-
mani and Jordan 1997). One advantage
of this framework is it draws attention to
what is minimally necessary to describe
and learn phonological feature interactions
in phonotactic patterns. The ?bottom-up?
approach adopted here is contrasted with
the ?top-down? approach in Hayes and
Wilson (2008), and it is argued that the
bottom-up approach is more analytically
transparent.
