We consider synchronous tree substitution
grammars (STSG). With the help of a
characterization of the expressive power
of STSG in terms of weighted tree bimor-
phisms, we show that both the forward and
the backward application of an STSG pre-
serve recognizability of weighted tree lan-
guages in all reasonable cases. As a con-
sequence, both the domain and the range
of an STSG without chain rules are recog-
nizable weighted tree languages.
