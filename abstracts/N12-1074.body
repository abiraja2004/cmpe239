Microblogging networks serve as vehicles for
reaching and influencing users. Predicting
whether a message will elicit a user response
opens the possibility of maximizing the viral-
ity, reach and effectiveness of messages and
ad campaigns on these networks. We propose
a discriminative model for predicting the like-
lihood of a response or a retweet on the Twit-
ter network. The approach uses features de-
rived from various sources, such as the lan-
guage used in the tweet, the user?s social net-
work and history. The feature design process
leverages aggregate statistics over the entire
social network to balance sparsity and infor-
mativeness. We use real-world tweets to train
models and empirically show that they are ca-
pable of generating accurate predictions for a
large number of tweets.
