The amount of documents directly published
by end users is increasing along with the
growth of Web 2.0. Such documents of-
ten contain spoken-style expressions, which
are difficult to analyze using conventional
parsers. This paper presents dependency
parsing whose goal is to analyze Japanese
semi-spoken expressions. One characteris-
tic of our method is that it can parse self-
dependent (independent) segments using se-
quential labeling.
