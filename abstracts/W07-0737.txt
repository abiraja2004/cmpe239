 
This paper studies the impact that difficult-to-
translate source-language phrases might have 
on the machine translation process. We formu-
late the notion of difficulty as a measurable 
quantity; we show that a classifier can be 
trained to predict whether a phrase might be 
difficult to translate; and we develop a frame-
work that makes use of the classifier and ex-
ternal resources (such as human translators) to 
improve the overall translation quality. 
Through experimental work, we verify that by 
isolating difficult-to-translate phrases and 
processing them as special cases, their nega-
tive impact on the translation of the rest of the 
sentences can be reduced.
