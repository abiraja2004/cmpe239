Strong indications of perspective can often
come from collocations of arbitrary length; for
example, someone writing get the government
out of my X is typically expressing a conserva-
tive rather than progressive viewpoint. How-
ever, going beyond unigram or bigram features
in perspective classification gives rise to prob-
lems of data sparsity. We address this prob-
lem using nonparametric Bayesian modeling,
specifically adaptor grammars (Johnson et al,
2006). We demonstrate that an adaptive na??ve
Bayes model captures multiword lexical usages
associated with perspective, and establishes a
new state-of-the-art for perspective classifica-
tion results using the Bitter Lemons corpus, a
collection of essays about mid-east issues from
Israeli and Palestinian points of view.
