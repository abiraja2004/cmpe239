Most word segmentation methods em-
ployed in Chinese Information Retrieval
systems are based on a static dictionary
or a model trained against a manually
segmented corpus. These general seg-
mentation approaches may not be opti-
mal because they disregard information
within semantic units. We propose a novel
method for improving word-based Chi-
nese IR, which performs segmentation ac-
cording to the tightness of phrases. In
order to evaluate the effectiveness of our
method, we employ a new test collection
of 203 queries, which include a broad dis-
tribution of phrases with different tight-
ness values. The results of our experi-
ments indicate that our method improves
IR performance as compared with a gen-
eral word segmentation approach. The ex-
periments also demonstrate the need for
the development of better evaluation cor-
pora.
