Languages with rich inflectional morphology
pose a difficult challenge for statistical ma-
chine translation. To address the problem of
morphologically inconsistent output, we add
unification-based constraints to the target-side
of a string-to-tree model. By integrating con-
straint evaluation into the decoding process,
implausible hypotheses can be penalised or
filtered out during search. We use a sim-
ple heuristic process to extract agreement con-
straints for German and test our approach on
an English-German system trained on WMT
data, achieving a small improvement in trans-
lation accuracy as measured by BLEU.
