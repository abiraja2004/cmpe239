Statistical machine learning methods are em-
ployed to train a Named Entity Recognizer
from annotated data. Methods like Maxi-
mum Entropy and Conditional Random Fields
make use of features for the training purpose.
These methods tend to overfit when the avail-
able training corpus is limited especially if the
number of features is large or the number of
values for a feature is large. To overcome
this we proposed two techniques for feature
reduction based on word clustering and se-
lection. A number of word similarity mea-
sures are proposed for clustering words for
the Named Entity Recognition task. A few
corpus based statistical measures are used for
important word selection. The feature reduc-
tion techniques lead to a substantial perfor-
mance improvement over baseline Maximum
Entropy technique.
