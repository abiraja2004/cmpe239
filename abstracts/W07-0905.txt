This paper describes the mutually benefi-
cial relationship between a cultural heritage
digital library and a historical treebank: an
established digital library can provide the
resources and structure necessary for effi-
ciently building a treebank, while a tree-
bank, as a language resource, is a valuable
tool for audiences traditionally served by
such libraries.
