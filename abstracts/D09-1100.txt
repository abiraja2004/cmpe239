Abstract
Machine learning offers a range of tools
for training systems from data, but these
methods are only as good as the underly-
ing representation. This paper proposes to
acquire representations for machine learn-
ing by reading text written to accommo-
date human learning. We propose a novel
form of semantic analysis called read-
ing to learn, where the goal is to obtain
a high-level semantic abstract of multi-
ple documents in a representation that fa-
cilitates learning. We obtain this abstract
through a generative model that requires
no labeled data, instead leveraging repe-
tition across multiple documents. The se-
mantic abstract is converted into a trans-
formed feature space for learning, result-
ing in improved generalization on a rela-
tional learning task.
