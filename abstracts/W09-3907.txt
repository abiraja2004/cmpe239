This paper describes a probabilistic mech-
anism for the interpretation of sentence se-
quences developed for a spoken dialogue
system mounted on a robotic agent. The
mechanism receives as input a sequence of
sentences, and produces an interpretation
which integrates the interpretations of in-
dividual sentences. For our evaluation, we
collected a corpus of hypothetical requests
to a robot. Our mechanism exhibits good
performance for sentence pairs, but re-
quires further improvements for sentence
sequences.
