In this paper I outline Type-inheritance Combi-
natory Categorial Grammar (TCCG), an imple-
mented feature structure based CCG fragment
of English. TCCG combines the fully lexical
nature of CCG with the type-inheritance hierar-
chies and complex feature structures of Head-
driven Phrase Structure Grammars (HPSG).
The result is a CCG/HPSG hybrid that com-
bines linguistic generalizations previously only
statable in one theory or the other, even extend-
ing the set of statable generalizations to those
not easily captured by either theory.
