In this paper, we consider the problem of un-
supervised morphological analysis from a new
angle. Past work has endeavored to design un-
supervised learning methods which explicitly
or implicitly encode inductive biases appropri-
ate to the task at hand. We propose instead
to treat morphological analysis as a structured
prediction problem, where languages with la-
beled data serve as training examples for un-
labeled languages, without the assumption of
parallel data. We define a universal morpho-
logical feature space in which every language
and its morphological analysis reside. We de-
velop a novel structured nearest neighbor pre-
diction method which seeks to find the mor-
phological analysis for each unlabeled lan-
guage which lies as close as possible in the
feature space to a training language. We ap-
ply our model to eight inflecting languages,
and induce nominal morphology with substan-
tially higher accuracy than a traditional, MDL-
based approach. Our analysis indicates that
accuracy continues to improve substantially as
the number of training languages increases.
