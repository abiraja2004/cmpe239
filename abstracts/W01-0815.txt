 
We consider how far two attributes of 
text quality commonly used in MT 
evaluation ? intelligibility and fidelity ? 
apply within NLG. While the former 
appears to transfer directly, the latter 
needs to be completely re-interpreted. 
We make a crucial distinction between 
the needs of symbolic authors and 
those of end-readers. We describe a 
form of textual feedback, based on a 
controlled language used for specifying 
software requirements that appears well 
suited to authors? needs, and an 
approach for incrementally improving 
the fidelity of this feedback text to the 
content model.
