 
This paper presents a project whose main goal 
is to construct a corpus of clinical text 
manually annotated for part-of-speech 
information. We describe and discuss the 
process of training three domain experts to 
perform linguistic annotation. We list some of 
the challenges as well as encouraging results 
pertaining to inter-rater agreement and 
consistency of annotation. We also present 
preliminary experimental results indicating the 
necessity for adapting state-of-the-art POS 
taggers to the sublanguage domain of medical 
text.
