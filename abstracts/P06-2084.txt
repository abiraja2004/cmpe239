We introduce the possibility of combining
lexical association measures and present
empirical results of several methods em-
ployed in automatic collocation extrac-
tion. First, we present a comprehensive
summary overview of association mea-
sures and their performance on manu-
ally annotated data evaluated by precision-
-recall graphs and mean average precision.
Second, we describe several classification
methods for combining association mea-
sures, followed by their evaluation and
comparison with individual measures. Fi-
nally, we propose a feature selection algo-
rithm significantly reducing the number of
combined measures with only a small per-
formance degradation.
