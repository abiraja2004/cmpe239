This paper investigates adapting a lexicalized
probabilistic context-free grammar (PCFG) to
a novel domain, using maximum a posteriori
(MAP) estimation. The MAP framework is gen-
eral enough to include some previous model
adaptation approaches, such as corpus mixing in
Gildea (2001), for example. Other approaches
falling within this framework are more effec-
tive. In contrast to the results in Gildea (2001),
we show F-measure parsing accuracy gains of as
much as 2.5% for high accuracy lexicalized pars-
ing through the use of out-of-domain treebanks,
with the largest gains when the amount of in-
domain data is small. MAP adaptation can also be
based on either supervised or unsupervised adap-
tation data. Even when no in-domain treebank is
available, unsupervised techniques provide a sub-
stantial accuracy gain over unadapted grammars,
as much as nearly 5% F-measure improvement.
