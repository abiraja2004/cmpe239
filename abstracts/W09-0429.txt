Edinburgh University participated in the
WMT 2009 shared task using the Moses
phrase-based statistical machine transla-
tion decoder, building systems for all lan-
guage pairs. The system configuration was
identical for all language pairs (with a few
additional components for the German-
English language pairs). This paper de-
scribes the configuration of the systems,
plus novel contributions to Moses includ-
ing truecasing, more efficient decoding
methods, and a framework to specify re-
ordering constraints.
