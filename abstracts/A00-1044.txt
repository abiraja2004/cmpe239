 
In this paper, we analyze the performance 
of name finding in the context of a variety 
of automatic speech recognition (ASR) 
systems and in the context of one optical 
character recognition (OCR) system. We 
explore the effects of word error rate from 
ASR and OCR, performance as a function 
of the amount of training data, and for 
speech, the effect of out-of-vocabulary 
errors and the loss of punctuation and mixed 
case
