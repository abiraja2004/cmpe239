Pivoting on bilingual parallel corpora is a
popular approach for paraphrase acquisi-
tion. Although such pivoted paraphrase
collections have been successfully used to
improve the performance of several dif-
ferent NLP applications, it is still difficult
to get an intrinsic estimate of the qual-
ity and coverage of the paraphrases con-
tained in these collections. We present
ParaQuery, a tool that helps a user inter-
actively explore and characterize a given
pivoted paraphrase collection, analyze its
utility for a particular domain, and com-
pare it to other popular lexical similarity
resources ? all within a single interface.
