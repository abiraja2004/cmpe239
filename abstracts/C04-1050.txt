This paper proposes unsupervised word
sense disambiguation based on automati-
cally constructed case frames and its in-
corporation into our zero pronoun resolu-
tion system. The word sense disambigua-
tion is applied to verbs and nouns. We
consider that case frames define verb senses
and semantic features in a thesaurus define
noun senses, respectively, and perform sense
disambiguation by selecting them based on
case analysis. In addition, according to the
one sense per discourse heuristic, the word
sense disambiguation results are cached and
applied globally to the subsequent words.
We integrated this global word sense disam-
biguation into our zero pronoun resolution
system, and conducted experiments of zero
pronoun resolution on two different domain
corpora. Both of the experimental results
indicated the effectiveness of our approach.
