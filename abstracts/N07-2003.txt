 
We describe ConQuest, an open-source, 
reusable spoken dialog system that pro-
vides technical program information dur-
ing conferences. The system uses a 
transparent, modular and open infrastruc-
ture, and aims to enable applied research 
in spoken language interfaces. The con-
ference domain is a good platform for ap-
plied research since it permits periodical 
redeployments and evaluations with a real 
user-base. In this paper, we describe the 
system?s functionality, overall architec-
ture, and we discuss two initial deploy-
ments.
