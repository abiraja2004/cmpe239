. Katakana, Japanese phonogram mainly used for loan words, is a 
trou-blemaker in Japanese word segmentation. Since Katakana words are heavily 
domain-dependent and there are many Katakana neologisms, it is almost 
impossible to construct and maintain Katakana word dictionary by hand. This 
paper proposes an automatic segmentation method of Japanese Katakana 
compounds, which makes it possible to construct precise and concise Katakana 
word dictionary automati-cally, given only a medium or large size of Japanese 
corpus of some domain.
