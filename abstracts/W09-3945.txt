 
This paper presents a simple, yet effective 
model for managing attention and interaction 
control in multimodal spoken dialogue sys-
tems. The model allows the user to switch at-
tention between the system and other hu-
mans, and the system to stop and resume 
speaking. An evaluation in a tutoring setting 
shows that the user?s attention can be effec-
tively monitored using head pose tracking, 
and that this is a more reliable method than 
using push-to-talk.
