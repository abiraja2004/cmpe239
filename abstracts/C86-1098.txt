 
Traditionally, text is stored on computers as 
a stremn of characters. The goal of this research is 
to store text in a form that facilitates word manipu- 
lation whilst reducing storage space. A word list 
with syntactic linear ordering is stored and words in 
a text are given two-byte integer codes that point to 
their respective positions in this list. The imple- 
mentation of the encoding scheme is described and the 
perfomnance statistics of ~lis encoding scheme is 
presented.
