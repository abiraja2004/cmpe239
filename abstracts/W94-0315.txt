 linguistic resources become the terms in which 
the micro-planning component takes its decisions and 
that way they constrain the system to only do what is ex- 
pressible in the language since it is not allowed to choose 
them independently. We made some modifications on 
two kinds of abstract resources defined by Meteer: we 
improved her semantic categories by using perspectives 
from systemic functional linguistics (cf. section 2.1) and 
we extended the notion of resource trees (cf. section 2.2). 
l"Textual" is used in the sense of the textual metafunc- 
tion in the systemic functional theory (see below). For pre- 
sentations of systemic functional inguistics, see \[Halliday 85\] or 
\[Matthiessen & Bateman 91\]. 
2Meteer used the abstract linguistic resources to build a struc- 
ture which she called text structure.  We do not use the same name 
because Meteer's tructure could exist at the same level of rhetor- 
ical structure theory (i.e., tile message planning level) whereas our 
structure is complementary to this level.

Moreover, we explicitly defined lezical resources (cf. sec- 
tion 2.3). 
2 .1  Semant ic  h ie rarch ies  
Semantic ategories (cf. figure 2) reflect pertinent combi- 
nations of linguistic features (e.g., syntactic features and 
lexical items). For example, the five sub-categories of
ob jec t  s are specified from definiteness (i.e., definite or 
indefinite) and number (i.e., singular or plural). These 
categories constrain the composition of the utterance by 
defining what kinds of constituents can be extended and 
how they can be composed. For example, an adjunct 
constituent of type manner  can be added to an event  
(e.g., Peter suddenly decided to go to the beach) whereas 
an adjunct of type proper ty  cannot (e.g., *Peter impor- 
tantly decided to go to the beach4); a process -event  can 
be composed with a durat ive -adverb ia l  (e.g., Karen 
watched TV for an hour) whereas a t rans i t ion -event  
may be composed of a f rame-adverb ia l  (e.g., Karen 
solved the problem in one hour). 
On the one hand, we think that according to sys- 
temic linguistic theory s, the hierarchy of semantic cat- 
egories mikes ideational constraints and textual con- 
straints; both are semantic, but semantic of rather dif- 
ferent kinds. Thus, while it is correct hat the categories 
event,  manner, and proper ty  are semantic (ideational) 
categories, taking an event perspective on something is a 
textual decision, e.g., 
"The ship sank." 
is an ideational event,  and it is textually presented within 
an EVENT-PERSPECTIVE. 
"The sinking of the ship" 
is still an ideational event,  but it is now presented within 
an OBJECT-PERSPECTIVE. Even clearer are cases such 
as definite and indefinite noun phrases. Thus the dif- 
ferences between "a man" and "the man" can be char- 
acterized as follows. They are both ideational of cate- 
gory PERSON. The noun phrase '% man" presents a dis- 
course entity of that ideational semantic ategory which 
is textually UNIDENTIFIABLE. This is a category drawn 
from textual semantics. Textual semantic lassifications 
of discourse ntities change as a text develops. The noun 
phrase "the man" is classified textually as IDENTIFI- 
ABLE. The former is realized grammatically (largely on 
3The semantic categories are noted in typewriter text. 
4FoUowing the general convention i  linguistics, we use "*" to 
mark magrarrmaatical sentences. 
sin this theory, language is organized functionally according to 
three metafunctions, concerned with the representation f experi- 
ence (ideational), symbolic interaction between interlocutors (in- 
terpersonal), and presentation f information as text in context 
(textual). 
the basis of the textual semantic lassification) as an in- 
definite noun phrase, the latter as a definite noun phrase. 
In this way, ideational semantics and textual semantics 
are complementary to each other and both help constrain 
grammatical realization. 
On the other hand, we think that the textual part of 
Meteer's hierarchy is too abstract to treat phenomena 
that need syntactic information such as anaphora plan- 
ning and selection of grammatical constructions ( ee also 
the other examples of linguistic phenomena given in sec- 
tion 1); in particular, syntactic information such as gen- 
der or verb voice is missing. 
In order to solve these problems, we propose to re-- 
place the hierarchy with two constituent hierarchies: an 
ideational semantic hierarchy and a textual semantic hi- 
erarchy. The former is based on the Upper Model de- 
fined in \[Bateman et al 90\]. The latter was developed 
by ourselves; we call it the hierarchy of textual semantic 
categories. These two hierarchies are not incompatible 
since 
\[a\] language.., embodies a multiplicity of con- 
stituent hierarchies, coexisting in different parts 
of the system. They are not unrelated: on the 
contrary, lhey are all different facets of the same 
phenomenon. \[...\] At the same time, each of 
these hierarchies is independent of the others, 
and lhere are infinite possibilities of matching 
them up in a meaningful way \[Halliday 85, p. 
18\]. 
The Upper  Mode l  provides a domain-independent, 
general and reusable conceptual organization which is 
used to classify the world knowledge when linguistic pro- 
cessing is to be performed. This general semantic taxon- 
omy can also be seen as an inheritance hierarchy that 
organizes concepts according to how they can be ex- 
pressed (cf. figure 3). The Upper Model also'expresses 
(ideational) semantic restrictions on arguments required 
by entities it involves. For example, the realization-event 6 
requires two participants: an agent that must be an an- 
imate and a patient hat must be a product. The Upper 
Model also provides the type of qualities which may be 
ascribed to particular concepts. For example, the Up- 
per Model expresses that the destination relation relates 
a place object to an event. 
The h ie rarchy  of  textua l  semant ic  categor ies  
is a property inheritance network that represents tex- 
tual knowledge of the target language. Figure 4 shows 
a part of our hierarchy; the whole hierarchy contains 
about eighty categories. The definition of the textual 
semantic categories is based on an analysis of French 
\[Bescherelle 90\] and of English \[nalliday 85, Shinghal 92\].

We will explain the meaning of each textual category 
by describing the way in which they are realized from 
a grammatical viewpoint. Complex-clauses 7 are realized 
as sentences. The sub-hierarchy of clause represents dif- 
ferent linguistic forms of clause; in particular, the time- 
anchored-event is realized as a finite clause, the activity 
as a non finite clause and the object-perspective as clause 
nominalization. The clause-nucleus sub-hierarchy classi- 
fies different kinds of verbs (e.g., transitive and intransi- 
tive verbs) and verb voice. The other-argument is realized 
as verb argument hat has no specific grammatical  func- 
tion, whereas the three other clause-nucleus-arguments 
are realized as constituents whose grammatical  function 
is subject, direct object or indirect object. For exam- 
ple, the verb "to get to" requires two arguments: one 
subject-argument (realized as the subject) and one other- 
argument which represents the destination. The textual- 
object is realized as a noun phrase, and, in particular, 
the unidentifiable-object as an indefinite noun phrase and 
the identifiable-object as a definite one. The hierarchy of 
textual-object-nucleus corresponds to nouns; it represents 
various linguistic forms of nouns with respect o their gen- 
der and number. The modifiers are realized as adjectives, 
adverbs, prepositional phrases, and subordinate clauses. 
2 .2  Resource  t rees  
Resource trees are primitive trees from which textual 
structures are built. In particular, they indicate the way 
in which a constituent (i.e., a textual structure node) can 
be expanded, that is, what are its sub--constituents, or ex- 
gended, that is, what kind of additional sub-constituents 
can be added. They are defined from elementary trees. 
Meteer distinguished two basic forms of elementary trees: 
the kernel tree and the composite tree. These two trees 
represent Halliday's distinction between the multivariate 
and the univariate structure, respectively \[Halliday 85\]. 
The kernel tree (i.e., the HEAD-ARGUMENT structure) is 
an atomic structure, that means, it cannot be modified in- 
dependently from the whole structure. Essentially, it rep- 
resents a predicate/argument structure. The composite 
tree is an incremental structure, that is, new child nodes 
can be added at any t ime of the expansion of the mother 
node. Meteer distinguished the COMPOSITE-MATRIX- 
ADJUNCT structure, which corresponds to the hypotac- 
tic relation (i.e., the relation between dependent ele- 
ments and their dominating node), and the COMPOSITE- 
COORDINATE structure, which represents the paratactic 
relation (i.e., the relation between elements of equal sta- 
tus). Meteer defined resource trees as follows: 
(define-composite-tree complex-event-tree 
(matrix &rest adjunct) 
7The textual semantic categories are noted in sans serif text. 
:constructor-function build-complex-event-tree 
:matrix-restrictions (state event) 
:adjunct-restrictions (manner location)) 
This definition expresses that the complex-event  re- 
source tree is a COMPOSITE tree whose MATRIX has 
to be of type s ta te  or event  and ADJUNCTs of type 
raarmer or locat ion .  It also specifies a constructor func- 
tion which builds the tree. 
We think that the language for defining resource trees 
is not powerful enough. For instance, it must be explic- 
itly specified that a composite tree only has one matrix 
node or that an ac t iv?~y does not have an explicit sub- 
ject. In order to solve this problem, a more powerful an- 
guage had to be defined. In particular, the restriction on 
daughter nodes is more precise. In addition, we introduce 
the notions of relevance and constraints. Restrictions are 
expressed by using a specific language which expresses 
quantities (e.g., "one" or "several") and description of 
the daughter constituents. In particular, each daughter 
constituent is described by a structure, which we call ab-  
s t rac t  const i tuent ,  which specifies the ideational and 
textual semantic ategories of the constituent, its struc- 
tural relationship with the mother node, and its rele- 
vance. The re levance  is the link between textual struc- 
ture nodes and parts of the message; it indicates the part 
of the message verbalized by the mother node and its child 
nodes. Const ra in ts  are conditions which must be satis- 
fied by the textual structure. For example, constraints 
can express that the subject-argument of an infinitive- 
activity will not explicitly appear in the final text. Figure 
5 shows the definition of the "infinitive-activity" resource 
tree s, which is a composite tree whose mother node has 
the textual category infinitive-activity. The tree has one 
and only one matrix node of the ideational category pro- 
cess and of the textual category clause-nucleus, and ad- 
ditional adjunct nodes of the ideational category circum- 
stance and of the textual category clause-modifier. It spec- 
ifies a constraint which states that the subject-argument 
must be implicit. It also indicates that the mother node 
and its daughter nodes correspond to the same part of 
the message, that is, they have the same relevance (cf. 
the variable X in figure 5) 9. 
2 .3  Lex ica l  resources  
Lexical items, i.e., words, are lexical resources of the lan- 
guage. We represent heir meaning by associating each 
of them with entities of the Upper Model and of the tex- 
8Meteer's resource trees axe expressed in terms of semantic cat- 
egories whereas our resource trees axe defined in terms of textual 
categories. 
9 The variable of the field "relevance" is unified with the relevance 
of a textual structure's node during the expansion of the node with 
the resource tree.

which corresponds to the direct transitive verb "to write" 
is defined as follows:

(direct-transltive-nucleus) 
(write-action) 
A lexical resource can be linked to more than one textual 
category; for example, the following resources 
"article" \] 
(slngular-neuter-nucleus pl ral-neuter-nucleus) 
(a icle) 
"quick" \] 
(object-modifier clause-modifier) 
(quick) 
correspond to the nouns "article" and "articles" and to 
the adjective "quick" and the adverb "quickly", respec- 
tively. A lexical resource can also be associated with 
several ideational categories; for example, the following 
resource 
\[ \] (clause-modifier) 
(purpose enablemen~} 
can be used to verbalize a rhetorical relation "purpose" 
or "enablement". 
2.4 Textua l  s t ruc ture  
The textual structure is a tree-like structure built from 
resource trees. It represents the constituency of the 
utterance (each node is a complete constituent of the 
utterance), the structural relations among constituents 
(head-argument, composite-matrix-adjunct, composite- 
coordinate), the ideational and textual categories, the rel- 
evance and the restriction of each node, and the lexemes. 
In addition, a marker which describes the lexical cohe- 
sion of the text (see \[Halliday & Hasan 76\]) is associated 
to each lexeme. The textual structure provides linguistic 
information which is required for treating specific linguis- 
tic phenomena such as anaphora planning (see section 1). 
For example, in figure 6 (only the main information con- 
tained in each node is depicted), the textual structure 
indicates that the domain instance "Stock" corresponds 
to a male and will be verbalized as a singular masculine 
proper name (named-object + singular-masculine-name). 
Several textual structures can be built to verbalize one 
message. The structure which is selected is the one which 
has the higher cohesive score. This score is obtained by 
summing the scores of lexical cohesion of all lexical re- 
sources used in the textual structure. The score of each 
resource is obtained as follows: 
? if the lexical resource appears in the local context (eft 
history of dialogue acts) then the lexical cohesion is 
scored 3; 
? if the lexical resource appears in the active set of the 
history of linguistic resources then the score is 2; 
? if the lexical resource appears in the open set of the 
history of linguistic resources then the score is 1; 
* otherwise, the score is 0. 
3 Utterance generation in the 
context of dialogue 
A plan of dialogue acts is verbalized by transforming it 
into two successive representational levels: surface lin- 
guistic acts and textual representations. These two main 
transformations are achieved with respect o the current 
dialogue context. We represent the context hrough four 
histories. The h i s to ry  of dialogue acts stores, in par- 
ticular, the requests of the interlocutor that have not been

answered yet. Each item of this list provides information 
on the dialogue act itself, the way in which conceptual 
entities that appear in its propositional content were re- 
alized with respect o the lexical semantics and the list 
of linguistic resources used. This information constitutes 
a local context  during the verbalization of the answer. 
The h i s to ry  of  conceptua l  ent i t ies contains informa- 
tion on the conceptual entities (e.g., "arrival-airport") al- 
ready verbalized in the dialogue and the way in which 
they were realized with respect o lexical semantics. This 
history is used for the verbalization of all surface linguis- 
tic acts, except for "answers" (the semantic realization 
of conceptual entities that appear in an "answer" is con- 
strained by the local context retrieved from the history 
of dialogue acts). The h i s to ry  of  objects  involves in- 
formation on the instances of conceptual entities (e.g., 
" JFK") mentioned in the dialogue. It is used to retrieve 
objects that are required from the lexical semantics point 
of view during the surface linguistic act planning (cf. the 
ideational semantic restrictions on arguments of entities 
of the Upper Model). It also provides information that is 
useful during anaphora planning, such as the information 
status (given or new) of objects. Finally, the h is tory  of 
l inguist ic-resources indicates which abstract linguistic 
resources have been used in the dialogue. It is divided into 
two sets: an active set and an open set. The act ive set 
contains the linguistic resources used in the last sentence 
of the dialogue, and the open  set the resources used in 
the preceding sentences. In particular, this history is used 
to evaluate the cohesion of textual structures. 
We will take an example to show how the generation 
system deals with these histories in order to verbalize a 
plan of dialogue acts. We will assume that the interlocu- 
tor (i.e., the user) uttered the following question during 
the dialogue: 
The 10:00 flight goes to which airport? 
The dialogue act planner builds a dialogue act of inform- 
ing that the airport is " JFK "1? (this act is shown in fig- 
ure 1). Since there is a request in the history of dia- 
logue acts that corresponds to the dialogue act, the sur- 
face linguistic act planner decides to build an "answer" 
surface linguistic act. Then, it uses the local context pro- 
vided by this history in order to transform the semantico- 
conceptual content into a semantic ontent. In particular, 
it builds a propositional content expressing a destination- 
event whose theme is "the 10:00 flight" and whose desti- 
nation is "JFK" ~cf. content 1 in figure 1). Finally, the 
constructed linguistic act is passed to the micro-planning 
component. This component builds at least two textual 
structures representing the cases where the des~ination- 
even~ is verbalized by "to go" or "to arrive". Since "to go"

built is explained in \[Sadek 91\]. 
appears in the local context, the selected textual struc- 
ture is the one corresponding to the following utterance: 
The 10:00 .flight goes to JFK. 
According to the content of the history of objects, the 
micro-planner can introduce anaphoric expressions. In 
that case, the built textual structure corresponds to: 
It goes to JFK. 
Finally, using the history of linguistic resources, the plan- 
ner can produce llipsis, in which case, the textual struc- 
ture built corresponds to: 
To JFK. 
4 Concluding remarks 
In this paper we described a component of a natural an- 
guage generation, called the micro-planner, which is situ- 
ated between the message planner and the linguistic real- 
ization component. Its role is to bridge the gap between 
the two traditional components in order to avoid some 
of the problems which arise in two-component genera- 
tion systems. In order to achieve this, the micro-planner 
transforms the message built by the message planner into 
an intermediate structure, which we call textual struc- 
ture. This structure represents an abstract grammatical 
organization of the final text. In particular, it provides 
semantic and syntactic information, which is useful to 
handle linguistic phenomena such as anaphora planning. 
This new representational level is based on the notion of 
abstract linguistic resources \[Meteer 92\]. We made two 
main modifications. Firstly, Meteer's semantic ategory 
hierarchy was substituted by two distinct semantic hier- 
archies: an ideational semantic hierarchy (i.e., the Upper 
Model \[Bateman et al 90\]) and a textual semantic hier- 
archy. Secondly, we increased the expressibility of the 
resource tree definition language. Moreover, we defined 
a simple mechanism to represent lexical resources of the 
language. 
In a three-component generation system, the micro- 
planner makes the linguistic decisions (e.g., the selection 
of syntactic structures and the choice of lexical items) 
that are usually taken by the linguistic realizer in a 
two-component generation system. The advantages are, 
firstly, taking a decision is simpler since the micro-planner 
de~ls with abstract linguistic knowledge, secondly, the 
micro-planner is closer to the message planner than the 
linguistic realizer, and, thirdly~ the linguistic realization 
component is simplified since it no longer has to take lin- 
guistic decisions. Such a component appears in the gen- 
eration system of \[Danlos 87\]: the strategic component 
takes conceptual and linguistic decisions, and the tacti- 
cal component only applies grammar ules. In fact, the 
135 
7th International Generation Workshop ? Kennebunkport, Maine ? June 21-24, 1994 
linguistic realization component only deals with syntactic 
details uch as agreement and complete surface order and 
morphology. 
Our micro-planning component is currently being in- 
tegrated in a text generation system developed at IRST 
(see \[Maier & Not 93, Panaget 94\]). A previous version 
(\[Panaget 92\]) was implemented in order to be integrated 
in a human-computer oral dialogue systefn developed at 
CNET \[Sadek et al 94\]. For the former case, the linguis- 
tic realization component \[Pianesi 91\] is based on the gov- 
ernment and binding theory and a head-driven bottom- 
up generation algorithm. The component consists of an 
integrated system for editing, modifying and maintain- 
ing unification-based grammars. For the latter case, the 
linguistic realizer is based on Tree Adjoining Grammar 
\[Joshi 87\]. In particular, the textual structure is trans- 
formed into a derivation tree (i.e., a tree which specifies 
a derived tree through a bottom-up traversal), which is 
then 'executed' by the linguistic component in order to 
build a derived tree (i.e., a syntactic tree).
