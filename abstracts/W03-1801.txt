Question Answering provides a method of
locating precise answers to specic ques-
tions but in technical domains the amount
of Multi-Word Terms complicates this task.
This paper outlines the Question Answer-
ing task in such a domain and explores two
ways of detecting relations between Multi-
Word Terms. The rst targets specic se-
mantic relations, the second uses a cluster-
ing algorithm, but they are both based on
the idea of syntactic variation. The pa-
per demonstrates how the combination of
these two methodologies provide sophisti-
cated access to technical domains.
