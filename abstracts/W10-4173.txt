Sense Induction is the process of identify-
ing the word sense given its context, often
treated as a clustering task. This paper ex-
plores the use of spectral cluster method
which incorporates word features and n-
gram features to determine which cluster
the word belongs to, each cluster repre-
sents one sense in the given document set.
