We propose an approach to adjective-noun
composition (AN) for corpus-based distribu-
tional semantics that, building on insights
from theoretical linguistics, represents nouns
as vectors and adjectives as data-induced (lin-
ear) functions (encoded as matrices) over
nominal vectors. Our model significantly out-
performs the rivals on the task of reconstruct-
ing AN vectors not seen in training. A small
post-hoc analysis further suggests that, when
the model-generated AN vector is not simi-
lar to the corpus-observed AN vector, this is
due to anomalies in the latter. We show more-
over that our approach provides two novel
ways to represent adjective meanings, alter-
native to its representation via corpus-based
co-occurrence vectors, both outperforming the
latter in an adjective clustering task.
