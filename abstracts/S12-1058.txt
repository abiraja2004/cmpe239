 
This paper presents our system participated on 
SemEval-2012 task: Chinese Semantic De-
pendency Parsing. Our system extends the 
second-order MST model by adding two 
third-order features. The two third-order fea-
tures are grand-sibling and tri-sibling. In the 
decoding phase, we keep the k best results for 
each span. After using the selected third-order 
features, our system presently achieves LAS 
of 61.58% ignoring punctuation tokens which 
is 0.15% higher than the result of purely 
second-order model on the test dataset.
