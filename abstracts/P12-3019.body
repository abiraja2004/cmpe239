Information extraction (IE) is becoming a crit-
ical building block in many enterprise appli-
cations. In order to satisfy the increasing text
analytics demands of enterprise applications,
it is crucial to enable developers with general
computer science background to develop high
quality IE extractors. In this demonstration,
we present WizIE, an IE development envi-
ronment intended to reduce the development
life cycle and enable developers with little or
no linguistic background to write high qual-
ity IE rules. WizIE provides an integrated
wizard-like environment that guides IE devel-
opers step-by-step throughout the entire devel-
opment process, based on best practices syn-
thesized from the experience of expert devel-
opers. In addition, WizIE reduces the manual
effort involved in performing key IE develop-
ment tasks by offering automatic result expla-
nation and rule discovery functionality. Pre-
liminary results indicate that WizIE is a step
forward towards enabling extractor develop-
ment for novice IE developers.
