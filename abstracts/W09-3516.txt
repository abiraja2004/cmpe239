 
This paper describes our systems participating 
in the NEWS 2009 Machine Transliteration 
Shared Task.  Two runs were submitted for the 
English-Chinese track.  The system for the 
standard run is based on graphemic approxi-
mation of local phonological context.  The one 
for the non-standard run is based on parallel 
modelling of sound and tone patterns for treat-
ing homophones in Chinese.  Official results 
show that both systems stand in the mid range 
amongst all participating systems.
