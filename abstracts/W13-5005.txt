In this work, we propose a graph-based
approach to computing similarities between
words in an unsupervised manner, and take ad-
vantage of heterogeneous feature types in the
process. The approach is based on the creation
of two separate graphs, one for words and
one for features of different types (alignment-
based, orthographic, etc.). The graphs are con-
nected through edges that link nodes in the
feature graph to nodes in the word graph, the
edge weights representing the importance of a
particular feature for a particular word. High
quality graphs are learned during training, and
the proposed method outperforms experimen-
tal baselines.
