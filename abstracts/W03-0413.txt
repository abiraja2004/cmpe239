The purpose of this work is to investigate the
use of machine learning approaches for confi-
dence estimation within a statistical machine
translation application. Specifically, we at-
tempt to learn probabilities of correctness for
various model predictions, based on the native
probabilites (i.e. the probabilites given by the
original model) and on features of the current
context. Our experiments were conducted us-
ing three original translation models and two
types of neural nets (single-layer and multi-
layer perceptrons) for the confidence estima-
tion task.
