Most learning algorithms for undirected
graphical models require complete inference
over at least one instance before parameter up-
dates can be made. SampleRank is a rank-
based learning framework that alleviates this
problem by updating the parameters during in-
ference. Most semi-supervised learning algo-
rithms also perform full inference on at least
one instance before each parameter update.
We extend SampleRank to semi-supervised
learning in order to circumvent this compu-
tational bottleneck. Different approaches to
incorporate unlabeled data and prior knowl-
edge into this framework are explored. When
evaluated on a standard information extraction
dataset, our method significantly outperforms
the supervised method, and matches results of
a competing state-of-the-art semi-supervised
learning approach.
