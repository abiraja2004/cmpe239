In this paper, we present a learning ap-
proach to the scenario template task of
information extraction, where information
filling one template could come from mul-
tiple sentences. When tested on the MUC-
4 task, our learning approach achieves
accuracy competitive to the best of the
MUC-4 systems, which were all built with
manually engineered rules. Our analy-
sis reveals that our use of full parsing
and state-of-the-art learning algorithms
have contributed to the good performance.
To our knowledge, this is the first re-
search to have demonstrated that a learn-
ing approach to the full-scale informa-
tion extraction task could achieve per-
formance rivaling that of the knowledge-
engineering approach.
