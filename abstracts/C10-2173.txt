 
This paper presents a novel semi-
supervised learning algorithm called Ac-
tive Deep Networks (ADN), to address 
the semi-supervised sentiment classifica-
tion problem with active learning. First, 
we propose the semi-supervised learning 
method of ADN. ADN is constructed by 
Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM) 
with unsupervised learning using labeled 
data and abundant of unlabeled data. 
Then the constructed structure is fine-
tuned by gradient-descent based super-
vised learning with an exponential loss 
function. Second, we apply active learn-
ing in the semi-supervised learning 
framework to identify reviews that 
should be labeled as training data. Then 
ADN architecture is trained by the se-
lected labeled data and all unlabeled data. 
Experiments on five sentiment classifica-
tion datasets show that ADN outper-
forms the semi-supervised learning algo-
rithm and deep learning techniques ap-
plied for sentiment classification.
