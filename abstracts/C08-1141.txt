 
We present a diagnostic evaluation plat-
form which provides multi-factored eval-
uation based on automatically con-
structed check-points. A check-point is a 
linguistically motivated unit (e.g. an am-
biguous word, a noun phrase, a verb~obj 
collocation, a prepositional phrase etc.), 
which are pre-defined in a linguistic tax-
onomy. We present a method that auto-
matically extracts check-points from pa-
rallel sentences. By means of check-
points, our method can monitor a MT 
system in translating important linguistic 
phenomena to provide diagnostic evalua-
tion. The effectiveness of our approach 
for diagnostic evaluation is verified 
through experiments on various types of 
MT systems.
