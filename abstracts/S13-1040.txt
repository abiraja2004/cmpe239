Automatic metaphor identification and inter-
pretation in text have been traditionally con-
sidered as two separate tasks in natural lan-
guage processing (NLP) and addressed in-
dividually within computational frameworks.
However, cognitive evidence suggests that hu-
mans are likely to perform these two tasks si-
multaneously, as part of a holistic metaphor
comprehension process. We present a novel
method that performs metaphor identification
through its interpretation, being the first one
in NLP to combine the two tasks in one
step. It outperforms the previous approaches
to metaphor identification both in terms of ac-
curacy and coverage, as well as providing an
interpretation for each identified expression.
