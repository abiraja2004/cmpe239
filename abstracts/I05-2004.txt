This paper describes a method for lan-
guage independent extractive summariza-
tion that relies on iterative graph-based
ranking algorithms. Through evalua-
tions performed on a single-document
summarization task for English and Por-
tuguese, we show that the method per-
forms equally well regardless of the lan-
guage. Moreover, we show how a meta-
summarizer relying on a layered appli-
cation of techniques for single-document
summarization can be turned into an ef-
fective method for multi-document sum-
marization.
