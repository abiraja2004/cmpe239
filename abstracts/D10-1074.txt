While a significant amount of research has
been devoted to textual entailment, automated
entailment from conversational scripts has re-
ceived less attention. To address this limi-
tation, this paper investigates the problem of
conversation entailment: automated inference
of hypotheses from conversation scripts. We
examine two levels of semantic representa-
tions: a basic representation based on syntac-
tic parsing from conversation utterances and
an augmented representation taking into con-
sideration of conversation structures. For each
of these levels, we further explore two ways of
capturing long distance relations between lan-
guage constituents: implicit modeling based
on the length of distance and explicit mod-
eling based on actual patterns of relations.
Our empirical findings have shown that the
augmented representation with conversation
structures is important, which achieves the
best performance when combined with ex-
plicit modeling of long distance relations.
