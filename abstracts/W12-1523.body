We demonstrate a novel, robust vision-to-
language generation system called Midge.
Midge is a prototype system that connects
computer vision to syntactic structures with
semantic constraints, allowing for the auto-
matic generation of detailed image descrip-
tions. We explain how to connect vision de-
tections to trees in Penn Treebank syntax,
which provides the scaffolding necessary to
further refine data-driven statistical generation
approaches for a variety of end goals.
