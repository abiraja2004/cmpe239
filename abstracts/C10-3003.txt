We present a tool for annotation of se?
mantic  inter?sentential  discourse  rela?
tions  on  the  tectogrammatical  layer  of 
the  Prague  Dependency  Treebank 
(PDT).  We present  the way of helping 
the annotators by several useful features 
implemented in the annotation tool, such 
as a possibility to combine surface and 
deep  syntactic  representation  of  sen?
tences during the annotation, a possibili?
ty  to  define,  display and connect  arbi?
trary  groups  of  nodes,  a  clause?based 
compact  depiction  of  trees,  etc.  For 
studying differences among parallel an?
notations, the tool offers a simultaneous 
depiction of parallel  annotations of the 
data.
