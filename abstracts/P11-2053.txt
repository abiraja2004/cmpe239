This paper presents a new approach to detect-
ing and tracking changes in word meaning by
visually modeling and representing diachronic
development in word contexts. Previous stud-
ies have shown that computational models
are capable of clustering and disambiguat-
ing senses, a more recent trend investigates
whether changes in word meaning can be
tracked by automatic methods. The aim of our
study is to offer a new instrument for inves-
tigating the diachronic development of word
senses in a way that allows for a better under-
standing of the nature of semantic change in
general. For this purpose we combine tech-
niques from the field of Visual Analytics with
unsupervised methods from Natural Language
Processing, allowing for an interactive visual
exploration of semantic change.
