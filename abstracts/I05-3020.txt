 
This paper describes a Chinese word 
segmentor (CWS) based on backward 
maximum matching (BMM) technique 
for the 2nd Chinese Word Segmenta-
tion Bakeoff in the Microsoft Research 
(MSR) closed testing track. Our CWS 
comprises of a context-based Chinese 
unknown word identifier (UWI). All 
the context-based knowledge for the 
UWI is fully automatically generated 
by the MSR training corpus. Accord-
ing to the scored results of the MSR 
closed testing track and our analysis, it 
shows that our BMM-based CWS with 
the context-based UWI is a simple and 
effective system to achieve high Chi-
nese word segmentation performance 
of more than 95.5% F-measure.
