We present a technique for identifying the
sources and targets of opinions without
actually identifying the opinions them-
selves. We are able to use an informa-
tion extraction approach that treats opin-
ion mining as relation mining; we iden-
tify instances of a binary ?expresses-an-
opinion-about? relation. We find that
we can classify source-target pairs as be-
longing to the relation at a performance
level significantly higher than two relevant
baselines.
This technique is particularly suited to
emerging approaches in corpus-based so-
cial science which focus on aggregating
interactions between sources to determine
their effects on socio-economically sig-
nificant targets. Our application is the
analysis of information technology (IT)
innovations. This is an example of a
more general problem where opinion is
expressed using either sub- or supersets
of expressive words found in newswire.
We present an annotation scheme and an
SVM-based technique that uses the lo-
cal context as well as the corpus-wide
frequency of a source-target pair as data
to determine membership in ?expresses-
an-opinion-about?. While the presence
of conventional subjectivity keywords ap-
pears significant in the success of this
technique, we are able to find the most
domain-relevant keywords without sacri-
ficing recall.
