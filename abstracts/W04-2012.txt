Answer validation is a component of question
answering system, which selects reliable answer
from answer candidates extracted by certain
methods. In this paper, we propose an approach
of answer validation based on the strengths of
lexical association between the keywords ex-
tracted from a question sentence and each an-
swer candidate. The proposed answer valida-
tion process is decomposed into two steps: the
first is to extract appropriate keywords from a
question sentence using word features and the
strength of lexical association, while the second
is to estimate the strength of the association
between the keywords and an answer candidate
based on the hits of search engines. In the re-
sult of experimental evaluation, we show that a
good proportion (79%) of a multiple-choice quiz
?Who wants to be a millionaire? can be solved
by the proposed method.
