This paper describes our coreference resolu-
tion system for the CoNLL-2012 shared task.
Our system is based on the Stanford?s dcore-
f deterministic system which applies multiple
sieves with the order from high precision to
low precision to generate coreference chains.
We introduce the newly added constraints and
sieves and discuss the improvement on the o-
riginal system. We evaluate the system using
OntoNotes data set and report our results of
average F-score 58.25 in the closed track.
