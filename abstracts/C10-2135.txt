In this paper we address methodological
issues in the evaluation of a projection-
based framework for dependency parsing
in which annotations for a source lan-
guage are transfered to a target language
using word alignments in a parallel cor-
pus. The projected trees then constitute
the training data for a data-driven parser in
the target language. We discuss two prob-
lems that arise in the evaluation of such
cross-lingual approaches. First, the anno-
tation scheme underlying the source lan-
guage annotations ? and hence the pro-
jected target annotations and predictions
of the parser derived from them ? is likely
to differ from previously existing gold
standard test sets devised specifically for
the target language. Second, the stan-
dard procedure of cross-validation cannot
be performed in the absence of parallel
gold standard annotations, so an alterna-
tive method has to be used to assess the
generalization capabilities of the projected
parsers.
