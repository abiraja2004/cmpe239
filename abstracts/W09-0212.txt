This paper presents a graph-theoretic
approach to the identification of yet-
unknown word translations. The proposed
algorithm is based on the recursive Sim-
Rank algorithm and relies on the intuition
that two words are similar if they estab-
lish similar grammatical relationships with
similar other words. We also present a for-
mulation of SimRank in matrix form and
extensions for edge weights, edge labels
and multiple graphs.
