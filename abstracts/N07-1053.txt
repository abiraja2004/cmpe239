A new architecture for identifying and in-
terpreting temporal expressions is intro-
duced, in which the large set of com-
plex hand-crafted rules standard in sys-
tems for this task is replaced by a series
of machine learned classifiers and a much
smaller set of context-independent seman-
tic composition rules. Experiments with
the TERN 2004 data set demonstrate that
overall system performance is comparable
to the state-of-the-art, and that normaliza-
tion performance is particularly good.
