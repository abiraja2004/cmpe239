Spoken dialogue management strategy op-
timization by means of Reinforcement
Learning (RL) is now part of the state of
the art. Yet, there is still a clear mis-
match between the complexity implied by
the required naturalness of dialogue sys-
tems and the inability of standard RL al-
gorithms to scale up. Another issue is the
sparsity of the data available for training in
the dialogue domain which can not ensure
convergence of most of RL algorithms.
In this paper, we propose to combine a
sample-efficient generalization framework
for RL with a feature selection algorithm
for the learning of an optimal spoken dia-
logue management strategy.
