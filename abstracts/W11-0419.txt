In this paper, we discuss some of the chal-
lenges of adequately applying a specification
language to an annotation task, as embodied
in a specific guideline. In particular, we dis-
cuss some issues with TimeML motivated by
error analysis on annotated TLINKs in Time-
Bank. We introduce a document level in-
formation structure we call a narrative con-
tainer (NC), designed to increase informative-
ness and accuracy of temporal relation identi-
fication. The narrative container is the default
interval containing the events being discussed
in the text, when no explicit temporal anchor
is given. By exploiting this notion in the cre-
ation of a new temporal annotation over Time-
Bank, we were able to reduce inconsistencies
and increase informativeness when compared
to existing TLINKs in TimeBank.
