 
This paper reports on a treebanking 
project where eight different modern 
Chinese translations of the Bible are 
syntactically analyzed.  The trees are 
created through dynamic treebanking 
which uses a parser to produce the 
trees.   The trees have been going 
through manual checking, but correc-
tions are made not by editing the tree 
files but by re-generating the trees with 
an updated grammar and dictionary.  
The accuracy of the treebank is high 
due to the fact that the grammar and 
dictionary are optimized for this specif-
ic domain.  The tree structures essen-
tially follow the guidelines of the Penn 
Chinese Treebank.  The total number 
of characters covered by the treebank is 
7,872,420 characters. The data has 
been used in Bible translation and Bi-
ble search.  It should also prove useful 
in the computational study of the Chi-
nese language in general.
