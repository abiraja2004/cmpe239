Topic segmentation classically relies on one
of two criteria, either finding areas with co-
herent vocabulary use or detecting discontinu-
ities. In this paper, we propose a segmenta-
tion criterion combining both lexical cohesion
and disruption, enabling a trade-off between
the two. We provide the mathematical formu-
lation of the criterion and an efficient graph
based decoding algorithm for topic segmenta-
tion. Experimental results on standard textual
data sets and on a more challenging corpus
of automatically transcribed broadcast news
shows demonstrate the benefit of such a com-
bination. Gains were observed in all condi-
tions, with segments of either regular or vary-
ing length and abrupt or smooth topic shifts.
Long segments benefit more than short seg-
ments. However the algorithm has proven ro-
bust on automatic transcripts with short seg-
ments and limited vocabulary reoccurrences.
