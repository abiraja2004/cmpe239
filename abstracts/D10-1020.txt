We define the crouching Dirichlet, hidden
Markov model (CDHMM), an HMM for part-
of-speech tagging which draws state prior dis-
tributions for each local document context.
This simple modification of the HMM takes
advantage of the dichotomy in natural lan-
guage between content and function words. In
contrast, a standard HMM draws all prior dis-
tributions once over all states and it is known
to perform poorly in unsupervised and semi-
supervised POS tagging. This modification
significantly improves unsupervised POS tag-
ging performance across several measures on
five data sets for four languages. We also show
that simply using different hyperparameter
values for content and function word states in
a standard HMM (which we call HMM+) is
surprisingly effective.
