In this paper, we describe our system
which participated in the SemEval 2010
task of disambiguating sentiment ambigu-
ous adjectives for Chinese. Our system
uses text messages from Twitter, a popu-
lar microblogging platform, for building a
dataset of emotional texts. Using the built
dataset, the system classifies the meaning
of adjectives into positive or negative sen-
timent polarity according to the given con-
text. Our approach is fully automatic. It
does not require any additional hand-built
language resources and it is language in-
dependent.
