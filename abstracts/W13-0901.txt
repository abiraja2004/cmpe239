This paper evaluates four metaphor identi-
fication systems on the 200,000 word VU
Amsterdam Metaphor Corpus, comparing re-
sults by genre and by sub-class of metaphor.
The paper then compares the rate of agree-
ment between the systems for each genre and
sub-class. Each of the identification systems
is based, explicitly or implicitly, on a the-
ory of metaphor which hypothesizes that cer-
tain properties are essential to metaphor-in-
language. The goal of this paper is to see what
the success or failure of these systems can tell
us about the essential properties of metaphor-
in-language. The success of the identification
systems varies significantly across genres and
sub-classes of metaphor. At the same time, the
different systems achieve similar success rates
on each even though they show low agree-
ment among themselves. This is taken to
be evidence that there are several sub-types
of metaphor-in-language and that the ideal
metaphor identification system will first de-
fine these sub-types and then model the lin-
guistic properties which can distinguish these
sub-types from one another and from non-
metaphors.
