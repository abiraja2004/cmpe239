In the last decade, substantial progress has
been made in the induction of semantic rela-
tions from raw text, especially of hypernymy
and meronymy in the English language and
in the classification of noun-noun relations in
compounds or other contexts. We investigate
the question of learning qualia-like semantic
relations that cross part-of-speech boundaries
for German, by first introducing a hand-tagged
dataset of associated noun-verb pairs for this
task, and then provide classification results us-
ing a general framework for supervised classi-
fication of lexical relations.
