This paper describes Stanford University?s sub-
mission to the Shared Evaluation Task of WMT
2012. Our proposed metric (SPEDE) com-
putes probabilistic edit distance as predictions
of translation quality. We learn weighted edit
distance in a probabilistic finite state machine
(pFSM) model, where state transitions corre-
spond to edit operations. While standard edit
distance models cannot capture long-distance
word swapping or cross alignments, we rectify
these shortcomings using a novel pushdown
automaton extension of the pFSM model. Our
models are trained in a regression framework,
and can easily incorporate a rich set of linguis-
tic features. Evaluated on two different pre-
diction tasks across a diverse set of datasets,
our methods achieve state-of-the-art correla-
tion with human judgments.
