We describe Prograder, a software package for
automatic checking of requirements for pro-
gramming homework assignments. Prograder
lets instructors specify requirements in natural
language as well as explains grading results to
students in natural language. It does so using
a grammar that generates as well as parses to
translate between a small fragment of English
and a first-order logical specification language
that can be executed directly in Python. This
execution embodies multiple semantics?both
to check the requirement and to search for ev-
idence that proves or disproves the require-
ment. Such a checker needs to interpret and
generate sentences containing quantifiers and
negation. To handle quantifier and negation
scope, we systematically simulate continua-
tion grammars using record structures in the
Grammatical Framework.
