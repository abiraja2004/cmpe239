 
The paper studies the automatic extraction of 
diagnostic word endings for Slavonic langua-
ges aimed to determine some grammatical, 
morphological and semantic properties of the 
underlying word. In particular, ending gues-
sing rules are being learned from a large mor-
phological dictionary of Bulgarian in order to 
predict POS, gender, number, article and se-
mantics. A simple exact high accuracy algo-
rithm is developed and compared to an appro-
ximate one, which uses a scoring function pre-
viously proposed by Mikheev for POS gues-
sing. It is shown how the number of rules of 
the latter can be reduced by a factor of up to 
35, without sacrificing performance. The eva-
luation demonstrates coverage close to 100%, 
and precision of 97-99% for the approximate 
algorithm.
