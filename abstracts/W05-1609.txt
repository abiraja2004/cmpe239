The paper presents an approach to utterance plan-
ning, which can dynamically use context informa-
tion about the environment in which a dialogue
is situated. The approach is functional in nature,
using systemic networks to specify its planning
grammar. The planner takes a description of a
communicative goal as input, and produces one
or more logical forms that can express that goal
in a contextually appropriate way. Both the goal
and the resulting logical forms are expressed in a
single formalism as ontologically rich, relational
structures. To realize the logical forms, OpenCCG
is used. The paper focuses primarily on the im-
plementation, but also discusses how the planning
grammar can be based on the grammar used in
OpenCCG, and trained on (parseable) data.
