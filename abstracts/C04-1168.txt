Based upon a statistically trained speech
translation system, in this study, we try
to combine distinctive features derived from
the two modules: speech recognition and
statistical machine translation, in a log-
linear model. The translation hypotheses
are then rescored and translation perfor-
mance is improved. The standard trans-
lation evaluation metrics, including BLEU,
NIST, multiple reference word error rate
and its position independent counterpart,
were optimized to solve the weights of the
features in the log-linear model. The exper-
imental results have shown significant im-
provement over the baseline IBM model 4
in all automatic translation evaluation met-
rics. The largest was for BLEU, by 7.9%
absolute.
