This paper considers the task of automatically
collecting words with their entity class labels,
starting from a small number of labeled ex-
amples (?seed? words). We show that spec-
tral analysis is useful for compensating for the
paucity of labeled examples by learning from
unlabeled data. The proposed method signif-
icantly outperforms a number of methods that
employ techniques such as EM and co-training.
Furthermore, when trained with 300 labeled
examples and unlabeled data, it rivals Naive
Bayes classifiers trained with 7500 labeled ex-
amples.
