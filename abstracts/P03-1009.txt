Previous research has demonstrated the
utility of clustering in inducing semantic
verb classes from undisambiguated cor-
pus data. We describe a new approach
which involves clustering subcategoriza-
tion frame (SCF) distributions using the
Information Bottleneck and nearest neigh-
bour methods. In contrast to previous
work, we particularly focus on cluster-
ing polysemic verbs. A novel evaluation
scheme is proposed which accounts for
the effect of polysemy on the clusters, of-
fering us a good insight into the potential
and limitations of semantically classifying
undisambiguated SCF data.
