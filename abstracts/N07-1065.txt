We introduce an answer typing strategy
specific to quantifiable how questions. Us-
ing the web as a data source, we auto-
matically collect answer units appropri-
ate to a given how-question type. Exper-
imental results show answer typing with
these units outperforms traditional fixed-
category answer typing and other strate-
gies based on the occurrences of numeri-
cal entities in text.
