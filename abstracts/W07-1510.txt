This paper presents a multimodal corpus of
comparable pack messages and the concor-
dancer that has been built to query it. The
design of the corpus and its annotation is
introduced. This is followed by a descrip-
tion of the concordancer?s interface, imple-
mentation and concordance display. Finally,
some ideas for future work are outlined.
