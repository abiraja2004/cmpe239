 
We describe our approach for the GENIA 
Event Extraction in the Main Task of BioNLP 
Shared Task 2011.  There are two important 
parts in our method: Event Trigger Annotation 
and Event Extraction. We use rules and dic-
tionary to annotate event triggers. Event ex-
traction is based on patterns created from 
dependent graphs. We apply UIMA Frame-
work to support all stages in our system.
