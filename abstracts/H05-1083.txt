In this paper, we study the impact of a
group of features extracted automatically from
machine-generated parse trees on coreference
resolution. One focus is on designing syn-
tactic features using the binding theory as the
guideline to improve pronoun resolution, al-
though linguistic phenomenon such as apposi-
tion is also modeled. These features are ap-
plied to the Arabic, Chinese and English coref-
erence resolution systems and their effective-
ness is evaluated on data from the Automatic
Content Extraction (ACE) task. The syntactic
features improve the Arabic and English sys-
tems significantly, but play a limited role in the
Chinese one. Detailed analyses are done to un-
derstand the syntactic features? impact on the
three coreference systems.
