 
We apply machine learning techniques 
to classify automatically a set of verbs 
into lexical semantic classes, based on 
distributional approximations of diathe- 
ses, extracted from a very large anno- 
tated corpus. Distributions of four gram- 
matical features are sufficient o reduce 
error rate by 50% over chance. We con- 
clude that corpus data is a usable repos- 
itory of verb class information, and that 
corpus-driven extraction of grammatical 
features is a promising methodology for 
automatic lexical acquisition.
