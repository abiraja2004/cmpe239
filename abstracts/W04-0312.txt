Standard grammar formalisms are defined with-
out reflection of the incremental and serial na-
ture of language processing, and incremental-
ity must therefore be reflected by independently
defined parsing and/or generation techniques.
We argue that this leads to a poor setup for
modelling dialogue, with its rich speaker-hearer
interaction, and instead propose context-based
parsing and generation models defined in terms
of an inherently incremental grammar formal-
ism (Dynamic Syntax), which allow a straight-
forward model of otherwise problematic dia-
logue phenomena such as shared utterances, el-
lipsis and alignment.
