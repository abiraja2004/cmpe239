. When acquiring synonyms from large corpora, it is important to deal
not only with such surface information as the context of the words but also their
latent semantics. This paper describes how to utilize a latent semantic model PLSI
to acquire synonyms automatically from large corpora. PLSI has been shown
to achieve a better performance than conventional methods such as tf?idf and
LSI, making it applicable to automatic thesaurus construction. Also, various PLSI
techniques have been shown to be effective including: (1) use of Skew Divergence
as a distance/similarity measure; (2) removal of words with low frequencies, and
(3) multiple executions of PLSI and integration of the results.
