From the perspective of structural linguistics,
we explore paradigmatic and syntagmatic lex-
ical relations for Chinese POS tagging, an im-
portant and challenging task for Chinese lan-
guage processing. Paradigmatic lexical rela-
tions are explicitly captured by word cluster-
ing on large-scale unlabeled data and are used
to design new features to enhance a discrim-
inative tagger. Syntagmatic lexical relations
are implicitly captured by constituent pars-
ing and are utilized via system combination.
Experiments on the Penn Chinese Treebank
demonstrate the importance of both paradig-
matic and syntagmatic relations. Our linguis-
tically motivated approaches yield a relative
error reduction of 18% in total over a state-
of-the-art baseline.
