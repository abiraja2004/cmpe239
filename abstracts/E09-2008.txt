Foma is a compiler, programming lan-
guage, and C library for constructing
finite-state automata and transducers for
various uses. It has specific support for
many natural language processing appli-
cations such as producing morphologi-
cal and phonological analyzers. Foma is
largely compatible with the Xerox/PARC
finite-state toolkit. It also embraces Uni-
code fully and supports various differ-
ent formats for specifying regular expres-
sions: the Xerox/PARC format, a Perl-like
format, and a mathematical format that
takes advantage of the ?Mathematical Op-
erators? Unicode block.
