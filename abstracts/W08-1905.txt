 
When consulting a dictionary, people can 
find the meaning of a word via the defini-
tion, which usually contains the relevant 
information to fulfil their requirement. 
Lexicographers produce dictionaries and 
their work consists in presenting informa-
tion essential for grasping the meaning of 
words. However, when people need to 
find a word it is likely that they do not 
obtain the information they are looking 
for. There is a gap between dictionary 
definitions and the information being 
available in peoples? mind. This paper at-
tempts to present the conceptualisation 
people engage in, in order to arrive at a 
word from its meaning. The insights of 
an experiment conducted show us the dif-
ferences between the knowledge availa-
ble in peoples? minds and in dictionary 
definitions.
