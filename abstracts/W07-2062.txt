We present a simple, two-steps supervised
strategy for the identification and classifica-
tion of thematic roles in natural language
texts. We employ no external source of in-
formation but automatic parse trees of the in-
put sentences. We use a few attribute-value
features and tree kernel functions applied to
specialized structured features. The result-
ing system has an F1 of 75.44 on the Se-
mEval2007 closed task on semantic role la-
beling.
