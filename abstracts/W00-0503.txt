 
A growing trend in Machine Translation 
(MT) is to view MT as an embedded part of 
an overall process instead of an end result 
itself. For the last four years, we have 
fielded (primarily) Commercial-Off-The- 
Shelf (COTS) MT systems in an operational 
process. MT has been used to facilitate 
cross-language information retrieval (IR), 
topic detection and other, wide-scoped 
scenarios. These uses caused a fundamental 
shift in our views about MT - everything 
from user interface to system evaluation to 
the basic system structures. This paper 
presents our lessons learned in developing 
an MT service for a wide range of user 
needs.
