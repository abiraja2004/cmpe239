Non-statistical natural language under-
standing components need world knowl-
edge of the domain for which they are ap-
plied in a machine-readable form. This
knowledge can be represented by manu-
ally created ontologies. However, as soon
as new concepts, instances or relations
are involved in the domain, the manually
created ontology lacks necessary informa-
tion, i.e. it becomes obsolete and/or in-
complete. This means its ?world model?
will be insufficient to understand the user.
The scalability of a natural language un-
derstanding system, therefore, essentially
depends on its capability to be up to
date. The approach presented herein ap-
plies the information provided by the user
in a dialog system to acquire the knowl-
edge needed to understand him or her ad-
equately. Furthermore, it takes the posi-
tion that the type of incremental ontology
learning as proposed herein constitutes a
viable approach to enhance the scalability
of natural language systems.
