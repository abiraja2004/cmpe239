This paper describes a method of multi-
modal language processing that reflects
experiences shared by people and robots.
Through incremental online optimization
in the process of interaction, the user and
the robot form mutual beliefs represented
by a stochastic model. Based on these mu-
tual beliefs, the robot can interpret even
fragmental and ambiguous utterances, and
can act and generate utterances appropri-
ate for a given situation.
