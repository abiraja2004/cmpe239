We present an integrated probabilistic
model for Japanese syntactic and case
structure analysis. Syntactic and case
structure are simultaneously analyzed
based on wide-coverage case frames that
are constructed from a huge raw corpus in
an unsupervised manner. This model se-
lects the syntactic and case structure that
has the highest generative probability. We
evaluate both syntactic structure and case
structure. In particular, the experimen-
tal results for syntactic analysis on web
sentences show that the proposed model
significantly outperforms known syntactic
analyzers.
