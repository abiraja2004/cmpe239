 
This paper describes a project to develop a lexicon 
for use both as an electronic dictionary and as a 
database for a range of NLP tasks. It proposes that 
a lexicon for such open-ended application may be 
derived from a human-user dictionary, retaining 
and enhancing the richness of its editorial content 
but abandoning its entry-list structure in favour of 
networks of relationships between discrete lexical 
objects, where each object represents a discrete 
lexeme-meaning unit.
