In this document, we illustrate how com-
plex questions such as procedural (how-to)
ones can be addressed in an interactive for-
mat by means of a spoken dialogue sys-
tem. The advantages of interactivity and
in particular of spoken dialogue with re-
spect to standard Question Answering set-
tings are numerous. First, addressing user
needs that do not necessarily arise in front
of a computer; moreover, a spoken or mul-
timodal answer format can often be bet-
ter suited to the user?s need. Finally, the
procedural nature of the information itself
makes iterative question formulation and
answer production particularly appealing.
