Syntactic analysis of search queries is im-
portant for a variety of information-retrieval
tasks; however, the lack of annotated data
makes training query analysis models diffi-
cult. We propose a simple, efficient proce-
dure in which part-of-speech tags are trans-
ferred from retrieval-result snippets to queries
at training time. Unlike previous work, our
final model does not require any additional re-
sources at run-time. Compared to a state-of-
the-art approach, we achieve more than 20%
relative error reduction. Additionally, we an-
notate a corpus of search queries with part-
of-speech tags, providing a resource for future
work on syntactic query analysis.
