MonoTrans2 is a translation system that com-
bines machine translation (MT) with human
computation using two crowds of monolin-
gual source (Haitian Creole) and target (En-
glish) speakers. We report on its use in the
WMT 2011 Haitian Creole to English trans-
lation task, showing that MonoTrans2 trans-
lated 38% of the sentences well compared to
Google Translate?s 25%.
