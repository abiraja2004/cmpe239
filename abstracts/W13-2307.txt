We introduce a framework for lightweight
dependency syntax annotation. Our for-
malism builds upon the typical represen-
tation for unlabeled dependencies, per-
mitting a simple notation and annotation
workflow. Moreover, the formalism en-
courages annotators to underspecify parts
of the syntax if doing so would streamline
the annotation process. We demonstrate
the efficacy of this annotation on three lan-
guages and develop algorithms to evaluate
and compare underspecified annotations.
