We present a two-stage multilingual de-
pendency parser and evaluate it on 13
diverse languages. The first stage is
based on the unlabeled dependency pars-
ing models described by McDonald and
Pereira (2006) augmented with morpho-
logical features for a subset of the lan-
guages. The second stage takes the out-
put from the first and labels all the edges
in the dependency graph with appropri-
ate syntactic categories using a globally
trained sequence classifier over compo-
nents of the graph. We report results on
the CoNLL-X shared task (Buchholz et
al., 2006) data sets and present an error
analysis.
