Morphological segmentation breaks words
into morphemes (the basic semantic units). It
is a key component for natural language pro-
cessing systems. Unsupervised morphologi-
cal segmentation is attractive, because in ev-
ery language there are virtually unlimited sup-
plies of text, but very few labeled resources.
However, most existing model-based systems
for unsupervised morphological segmentation
use directed generative models, making it dif-
ficult to leverage arbitrary overlapping fea-
tures that are potentially helpful to learning.
In this paper, we present the first log-linear
model for unsupervised morphological seg-
mentation. Our model uses overlapping fea-
tures such as morphemes and their contexts,
and incorporates exponential priors inspired
by the minimum description length (MDL)
principle. We present efficient algorithms
for learning and inference by combining con-
trastive estimation with sampling. Our sys-
tem, based on monolingual features only, out-
performs a state-of-the-art system by a large
margin, even when the latter uses bilingual in-
formation such as phrasal alignment and pho-
netic correspondence. On the Arabic Penn
Treebank, our system reduces F1 error by 11%
compared to Morfessor.
