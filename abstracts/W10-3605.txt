 
A web based Manipuri corpus is devel-
oped for identification of reduplicated 
multiword expression (MWE) and mul-
tiword named entity recognition (NER). 
Manipuri is one of the rarely investi-
gated language and its resources for 
natural language processing are not 
available in the required measure. The 
web content of Manipuri is also very 
poor. News corpus from a popular Ma-
nipuri news website is collected. Ap-
proximately four and a half million Ma-
nipuri wordforms have been collected 
from the web. The mode of corpus col-
lection and the identification of redupli-
cated MWEs and multiword NE based 
on support vector machine (SVM) 
learning technique are reported. The 
SVM based reduplicated MWE system 
is evaluated with recall, precision and F-
Score values of 94.62%, 93.53% and 
94.07% respectively outperforming the 
rule based approach. The recall, preci-
sion and F-Score for multiword NE are 
evaluated as 94.82%, 93.12% and 
93.96% respectively.
