 
This paper deals with two linguistic 
phenomena which are usually considered cases 
of ill-formedness by the computational 
linguistics community: intersentential el ipsis 
and coordination (possibly with gaps). We 
present an original solution, if compared to 
those already known for the two phenomena. 
This solution is conceived within a relevant 
approach to parsing, i.e. chart parsing, and is 
coherent with the basic ideas of this approach.
