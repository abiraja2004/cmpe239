Shortage of manually sense-tagged data is
an obstacle to supervised word sense dis-
ambiguation methods. In this paper we in-
vestigate a label propagation based semi-
supervised learning algorithm for WSD,
which combines labeled and unlabeled
data in learning process to fully realize
a global consistency assumption: simi-
lar examples should have similar labels.
Our experimental results on benchmark
corpora indicate that it consistently out-
performs SVM when only very few la-
beled examples are available, and its per-
formance is also better than monolingual
bootstrapping, and comparable to bilin-
gual bootstrapping.
