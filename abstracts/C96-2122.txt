 
The paper is a first attempt to fill a gap in the 
dependency literature, by providing a 
mathematical result on the complexity of 
recognition with a dependency grammar. The 
paper describes an improved Earley-type 
recognizer with a complexity O(IGl2n3). The 
improvement is due to a precompilation f the 
dependency rules into parse tables, that determine 
the conditions of applicability of two primary 
actions, predict and scan, used in recognition.
