One of the major bottlenecks in the develop-
ment of data-driven AI Systems is the cost of
reliable human annotations. The recent ad-
vent of several crowdsourcing platforms such
as Amazon?s Mechanical Turk, allowing re-
questers the access to affordable and rapid re-
sults of a global workforce, greatly facilitates
the creation of massive training data. Most
of the available studies on the effectiveness of
crowdsourcing report on English data. We use
Mechanical Turk annotations to train an Opin-
ion Mining System to classify Spanish con-
sumer comments. We design three different
Human Intelligence Task (HIT) strategies and
report high inter-annotator agreement between
non-experts and expert annotators. We evalu-
ate the advantages/drawbacks of each HIT de-
sign and show that, in our case, the use of
non-expert annotations is a viable and cost-
effective alternative to expert annotations.
