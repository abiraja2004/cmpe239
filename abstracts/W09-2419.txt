This paper presents the evaluation setting
for the SemEval-2010 Word Sense Induction
(WSI) task. The setting of the SemEval-2007
WSI task consists of two evaluation schemes,
i.e. unsupervised evaluation and supervised
evaluation. The first one evaluates WSI meth-
ods in a similar fashion to Information Re-
trieval exercises using F-Score. However,
F-Score suffers from the matching problem
which does not allow: (1) the assessment of
the entire membership of clusters, and (2) the
evaluation of all clusters in a given solution. In
this paper, we present the use of V-measure as
a measure of objectively assessing WSI meth-
ods in an unsupervised setting, and we also
suggest a small modification on the supervised
evaluation.
