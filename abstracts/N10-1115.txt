We present a novel deterministic dependency pars-
ing algorithm that attempts to create the easiest arcs
in the dependency structure first in a non-directional
manner. Traditional deterministic parsing algorithms
are based on a shift-reduce framework: they traverse
the sentence from left-to-right and, at each step, per-
form one of a possible set of actions, until a complete
tree is built. A drawback of this approach is that
it is extremely local: while decisions can be based
on complex structures on the left, they can look only
at a few words to the right. In contrast, our algo-
rithm builds a dependency tree by iteratively select-
ing the best pair of neighbours to connect at each
parsing step. This allows incorporation of features
from already built structures both to the left and to the
right of the attachment point. The parser learns both
the attachment preferences and the order in which
they should be performed. The result is a determin-
istic, best-first, O(nlogn) parser, which is signifi-
cantly more accurate than best-first transition based
parsers, and nears the performance of globally opti-
mized parsing models.
