This paper describes our method based on Support
Vector Machines for automatically assigning seman-
tic roles to constituents of English sentences. This
method employs four different feature sets, one of
which being first reported herein. The combination
of features as well as the extended training data we
considered have produced in the Senseval-3 experi-
ments an F1-score of 92.5% for the unrestricted case
and of 76.3% for the restricted case.
