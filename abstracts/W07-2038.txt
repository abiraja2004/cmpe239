In this paper we present a semantic role la-
beling system submitted to the task Multi-
level Semantic Annotation of Catalan and
Spanish in the context of SemEval?2007.
The core of the system is a memory?based
classifier that makes use of full syntactic in-
formation. Building on standard features,
we train two classifiers to predict separately
the semantic class of the verb and the seman-
tic roles.
