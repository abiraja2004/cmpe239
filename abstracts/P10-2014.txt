This paper proposes a method of correct-
ing annotation errors in a treebank. By us-
ing a synchronous grammar, the method
transforms parse trees containing annota-
tion errors into the ones whose errors are
corrected. The synchronous grammar is
automatically induced from the treebank.
We report an experimental result of apply-
ing our method to the Penn Treebank. The
result demonstrates that our method cor-
rects syntactic annotation errors with high
precision.
