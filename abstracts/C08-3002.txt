 
This article provides description about the 
grammar checking system developed for 
detecting various grammatical errors in 
Punjabi texts. This system utilizes a full-
form lexicon for morphological analysis, 
and applies rule-based approaches for 
part-of-speech tagging and phrase 
chunking. The system follows a novel 
approach of performing agreement 
checks at phrase and clause levels using 
the grammatical information exhibited by 
POS tags in the form of feature value 
pairs. The system can detect and suggest 
rectifications for a number of 
grammatical errors, resulting from the 
lack of agreement, order of words in 
various phrases etc., in literary style 
Punjabi texts. To the best of our 
knowledge, this grammar checking 
system is the first such system reported 
for Indian languages.
