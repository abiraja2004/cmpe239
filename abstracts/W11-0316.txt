Keyphrase extraction aims to select a set of
terms from a document as a short summary
of the document. Most methods extract
keyphrases according to their statistical prop-
erties in the given document. Appropriate
keyphrases, however, are not always statis-
tically significant or even do not appear in
the given document. This makes a large
vocabulary gap between a document and its
keyphrases. In this paper, we consider that
a document and its keyphrases both describe
the same object but are written in two different
languages. By regarding keyphrase extraction
as a problem of translating from the language
of documents to the language of keyphrases,
we use word alignment models in statistical
machine translation to learn translation proba-
bilities between the words in documents and
the words in keyphrases. According to the
translation model, we suggest keyphrases giv-
en a new document. The suggested keyphrases
are not necessarily statistically frequent in the
document, which indicates that our method
is more flexible and reliable. Experiments
on news articles demonstrate that our method
outperforms existing unsupervised methods
on precision, recall and F-measure.
