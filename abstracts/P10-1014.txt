As information extraction (IE) becomes
more central to enterprise applications,
rule-based IE engines have become in-
creasingly important. In this paper, we
describe SystemT, a rule-based IE sys-
tem whose basic design removes the ex-
pressivity and performance limitations of
current systems based on cascading gram-
mars. SystemT uses a declarative rule
language, AQL, and an optimizer that
generates high-performance algebraic ex-
ecution plans for AQL rules. We com-
pare SystemT?s approach against cascad-
ing grammars, both theoretically and with
a thorough experimental evaluation. Our
results show that SystemT can deliver re-
sult quality comparable to the state-of-the-
art and an order of magnitude higher an-
notation throughput.
