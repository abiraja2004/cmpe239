 
This paper presents an empirical analysis 
of prosodic phenomena (intonation and 
timing) in 'common ground units' 
(Nakatani & Traurn 1999). The analysis 
is used to address questions of the role of 
prosody in dialogue while taking into 
account he complexities of multispeaker 
discourse. We address some 
methodological concerns of how best to 
carry out a study of this kind as well as 
our theoretical questions about he formal 
identification of dialogue structures at 
levels higher than the micro-level of 
'dialogue act', or 'move'.
