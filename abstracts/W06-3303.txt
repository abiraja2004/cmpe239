Abstract
The field of molecular biology is growing
at an astounding rate and research findings
are being deposited into public databases,
such as Swiss-Prot. Many of the over
200,000 protein entries in Swiss-Prot 49.1
lack annotations such as subcellular lo-
calization or function, but the vast major-
ity have references to journal abstracts de-
scribing related research. These abstracts
represent a huge amount of information
that could be used to generate annotations
for proteins automatically. Training clas-
sifiers to perform text categorization on
abstracts is one way to accomplish this
task. We present a method for improving
text classification for biological journal
abstracts by generating additional text fea-
tures using the knowledge represented in
a biological concept hierarchy (the Gene
Ontology). The structure of the ontology,
as well as the synonyms recorded in it, are
leveraged by our simple technique to sig-
nificantly improve the F-measure of sub-
cellular localization text classifiers by as
much as 0.078 and we achieve F-measures
as high as 0.935.
