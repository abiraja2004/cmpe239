 
We propose anovel context heterogeneity similarity measure between words and their translations 
in helping to compile bilingual lexicon entries from a non-parallel English-Chinese corpus. Current 
algorithms for bilingual exicon compilation rely on occurrence frequencies, length or positional statistics 
derived from parallel texts. There is little correlation between such statistics of a word and its translation 
in non-parallel corpora. On the other hand, we suggest that words with productive context in one language 
translate to words with productive context in another language, and words with rigid context ranslate 
into words With rigid context. Context heterogeneity measures how productive the context of a word is in 
a given domain, independent of its absolute occurrence frequency in the text. Based on this information, 
we derive statistics of bilingual word pairs from a non-parallel corpus. These statistics can be used to 
bootstrap a bilingual dictionary compilation algorithm.
