Obtaining labeled data is a significant obstacle
for many NLP tasks. Recently, online games
have been proposed as a new way of obtain-
ing labeled data; games attract users by be-
ing fun to play. In this paper, we consider the
application of this idea to collecting seman-
tic relations between words, such as hyper-
nym/hyponym relationships. We built three
online games, inspired by the real-life games
of ScattergoriesTM and TabooTM. As of June
2008, players have entered nearly 800,000
data instances, in two categories. The first
type of data consists of category/answer pairs
(?Types of vehicle?,?car?), while the second
is essentially free association data (?subma-
rine?,?underwater?). We analyze both types
of data in detail and discuss potential uses of
the data. We show that we can extract from
our data set a significant number of new hy-
pernym/hyponym pairs not already found in
WordNet.
