This paper presents AsdeCopas, a module de-
signed to interface syntax and semantics. Asde-
Copas is based on hierarchically organised se-
mantic rules, that output formulas in a flat lan-
guage. In this paper, we show how this system
can be used in the following applications: a) se-
mantic disambiguation; b) logical formulas con-
struction (in Minimal Recursion Semantics); c)
question interpretation.
