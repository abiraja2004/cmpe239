 
With the supply of 8 closely interpreted 
dialectometrical maps, this paper analyses 
the linguistic change of the geolinguistic 
deep structures in Northern France (Do-
maine d?O?l)  between 1300 and 1900. As a 
matter of fact, the result will show ? with 
one exception ? the great stability of these 
deep structures.
