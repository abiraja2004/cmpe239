In this work, we apply Dirichlet Process
Mixture Models (DPMMs) to a learning
task in natural language processing (NLP):
lexical-semantic verb clustering. We thor-
oughly evaluate a method of guiding DP-
MMs towards a particular clustering so-
lution using pairwise constraints. The
quantitative and qualitative evaluation per-
formed highlights the benefits of both
standard and constrained DPMMs com-
pared to previously used approaches. In
addition, it sheds light on the use of evalu-
ation measures and their practical applica-
tion.
