Here, we introduce a machine learning-
based approach that allows us to identify
light verb constructions (LVCs) in Hun-
garian and English free texts. We also
present the results of our experiments on
the SzegedParalellFX English?Hungarian
parallel corpus where LVCs were manu-
ally annotated in both languages. With
our approach, we were able to contrast
the performance of our method and define
language-specific features for these typo-
logically different languages. Our pre-
sented method proved to be sufficiently ro-
bust as it achieved approximately the same
scores on the two typologically different
languages.
