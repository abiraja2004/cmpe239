In this paper, we focus on the adaptation
problem that has a large labeled data in the
source domain and a large but unlabeled
data in the target domain. Our aim is to
learn reliable information from unlabeled
target domain data for dependency pars-
ing adaptation. Current state-of-the-art sta-
tistical parsers perform much better for
shorter dependencies than for longer ones.
Thus we propose an adaptation approach
by learning reliable information on shorter
dependencies in an unlabeled target data
to help parse longer distance words. The
unlabeled data is parsed by a dependency
parser trained on labeled source domain
data. The experimental results indicate
that our proposed approach outperforms
the baseline system, and is better than cur-
rent state-of-the-art adaptation techniques.
