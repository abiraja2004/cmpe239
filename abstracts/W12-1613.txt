A robust system that understands route instructions
should be able to process instructions generated nat-
urally by humans. Also desirable would be the abil-
ity to handle repairs and other modifications to exist-
ing instructions. To this end, we collected a corpus
of spoken instructions (and modified instructions)
produced by subjects provided with an origin and
a destination. We found that instructions could be
classified into four categories, depending on their
intent such as imperative, feedback, or meta com-
ment. We asked a different set of subjects to fol-
low these instructions to determine the usefulness
and comprehensibility of individual instructions. Fi-
nally, we constructed a semantic grammar and evalu-
ated its coverage. To determine whether instruction-
giving forms a predictable sub-language, we tested
the grammar on three corpora collected by others
and determined that this was largely the case. Our
work suggests that predictable sub-languages may
exist for well-defined tasks.
