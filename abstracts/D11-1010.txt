We present a novel approach for automatic
collocation error correction in learner English
which is based on paraphrases extracted from
parallel corpora. Our key assumption is that
collocation errors are often caused by se-
mantic similarity in the first language (L1-
language) of the writer. An analysis of a
large corpus of annotated learner English con-
firms this assumption. We evaluate our ap-
proach on real-world learner data and show
that L1-induced paraphrases outperform tradi-
tional approaches based on edit distance, ho-
mophones, and WordNet synonyms.
