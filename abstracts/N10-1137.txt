Datasets annotated with semantic roles are
an important prerequisite to developing high-
performance role labeling systems. Unfortu-
nately, the reliance on manual annotations,
which are both difficult and highly expen-
sive to produce, presents a major obstacle to
the widespread application of these systems
across different languages and text genres. In
this paper we describe a method for induc-
ing the semantic roles of verbal arguments di-
rectly from unannotated text. We formulate
the role induction problem as one of detecting
alternations and finding a canonical syntactic
form for them. Both steps are implemented in
a novel probabilistic model, a latent-variable
variant of the logistic classifier. Our method
increases the purity of the induced role clus-
ters by a wide margin over a strong baseline.
