They require training on specifically annotated corpora, whose level of detail must be fine enough to capture the phenomena involved. This paper presents EmotiBlog ? a fine-grained annotation scheme for subjectivity. We show the manner in which it is built and demonstrate the benefits it brings to the sys-tems using it for training, through the experi-ments we carried out on opinion mining and emotion detection. We employ corpora of dif-ferent textual genres ?a set of annotated re-ported speech extracted from news articles, the set of news titles annotated with polarity and emotion from the SemEval 2007 (Task 14) and ISEAR, a corpus of real-life self-expressed emotion. We also show how the model built from the EmotiBlog annotations can be enhanced with external resources. The results demonstrate that EmotiBlog, through its structure and annotation paradigm, offers high quality training data for systems dealing both with opinion mining, as well as emotion detec-tion. 1 Credits This paper has been supported by Ministe-rio de Ciencia e Innovaci?n- Spanish Gov-ernment (grant no.
