We propose a method for cross-language
identification of semantic relations based
on word similarity measurement and mor-
phosemantic relations in WordNet. We
transfer these relations to pairs of deriva-
tionally unrelated words and train a model
for automatic classification of new in-
stances of (morpho)semantic relations in
context based on the existing ones and
the general semantic classes of collocated
verb and noun senses. Our experiments
are based on Bulgarian-English parallel
and comparable texts but the method is to
a great extent language-independent and
particularly suited to less-resourced lan-
guages, since it does not need parsed or se-
mantically annotated data. The application
of the method leads to an increase in the
number of discovered semantic relations
by 58.35% and performs relatively consis-
tently, with a small decrease in precision
between the baseline (based on morphose-
mantic relations identified in wordnet) ?
0.774, and the extended method (based on
the data obtained through machine learn-
ing) ? 0.721.
