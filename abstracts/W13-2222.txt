This paper describes shallow
semantically-informed Hierarchical
Phrase-based SMT (HPBSMT) and
Phrase-Based SMT (PBSMT) systems
developed at Dublin City University
for participation in the translation task
between EN-ES and ES-EN at the Work-
shop on Statistical Machine Translation
(WMT 13). The system uses PBSMT
and HPBSMT decoders with multiple
LMs, but will run only one decoding
path decided before starting translation.
Therefore the paper does not present a
multi-engine system combination. We
investigate three types of shallow seman-
tics: (i) Quality Estimation (QE) score,
(ii) genre ID, and (iii) context ID derived
from context-dependent language models.
Our results show that the improvement is
0.8 points absolute (BLEU) for EN-ES
and 0.7 points for ES-EN compared to
the standard PBSMT system (single best
system). It is important to note that we
developed this method when the standard
(confusion network-based) system com-
bination is ineffective such as in the case
when the input is only two.
