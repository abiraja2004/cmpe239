This paper presents the LIU system for the
WMT 2011 shared task for translation be-
tween German and English. For English?
German we attempted to improve the trans-
lation tables with a combination of standard
statistical word alignments and phrase-based
word alignments. For German?English trans-
lation we tried to make the German text more
similar to the English text by normalizing Ger-
man morphology and performing rule-based
clause reordering of the German text. This re-
sulted in small improvements for both transla-
tion directions.
