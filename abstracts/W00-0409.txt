  
This paper describes a framework for multi- 
document summarization which combines three 
premises: coherent themes can be identified reli- 
ably; highly representative themes, running across 
subsets of the document collection, can function as 
multi-document summary surrogates; and effective 
end-use of such themes hould be facilitated by a vi- 
sualization environment which clarifies the relation- 
ship between themes and documents. We present al- 
gorithms that formalize our framework, describe an 
implementation, and demonstrate a prototype sys- 
tem and interface.
