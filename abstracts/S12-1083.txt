 
This article presents the experiments car-
ried out at Jadavpur University as part of 
the participation in Semantic Textual Si-
milarity (STS) of Task 6 @ Semantic 
Evaluation Exercises (SemEval-2012). 
Task-6 of SemEval- 2012 focused on se-
mantic relations of text pair. Task-6 pro-
vides five different text pair files to 
compare different semantic relations and 
judge these relations through a similarity 
and confidence score. Similarity score is 
one kind of multi way classification in the 
form of grade between 0 to 5. We have 
submitted one run for the STS task. Our 
system has two basic modules - one deals 
with lexical relations and another deals 
with dependency based syntactic relations 
of the text pair. Similarity score given to a 
pair is the average of the scores of the 
above-mentioned modules. The scores 
from each module are identified using rule 
based techniques. The Pearson Correlation 
of our system in the task is 0.3880.
