Multi-word expressions (MWEs) account for
a large portion of the language used in day-
to-day interactions. A formal system that is
flexible enough to model these large and often
syntactically-rich non-compositional chunks as
single units in naturally occurring text could
considerably simplify large-scale semantic an-
notation projects, in which it would be un-
desirable to have to develop internal compo-
sitional analyses of common technical expres-
sions that have specific idiosyncratic meanings.
This paper will first define a notion of functor-
argument decomposition on phrase structure
trees analogous to graph coloring, in which the
tree is cast as a graph, and the elementary
structures of a grammar formalism are colors.
The paper then presents a formal argument
that tree-rewriting systems, a class of grammar
formalism that includes Tree Adjoining Gram-
mars, are able to produce a proper superset
of the functor-argument decompositions that
string-rewriting systems can produce.
