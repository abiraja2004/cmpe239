 
This work attempts to provide a robust Thai 
morphological analyzer which can automatically 
assign the correct part-of-speech tag to the correct 
word with time and space efficiency. Instead of using 
a corpus based approach which requires a large 
amount of training data and validation data, a new 
simple hybrid technique which incorporates heuristic, 
syntactic and semantic knowledge is proposed. To 
implement his technique, a three-stage approach is 
adopted to the gradual refinement module. It consists 
of preference based pruning, syntactic based pruning 
and semantic based pruning. Each stage will 
gradually weeds out word boundary ambiguities, tag 
ambiguities and implicit spelling errors. Frdm the 
result of the experiment, the proposed model can 
work with time-efficiency and increase the accuracy 
of word boundary segmentations, POS tagging as 
well as implicit spelling error correction.
