The amount of cognitive effort required to
process a word has been argued to depend
on the word?s effect on the uncertainty
about the incoming sentence, as quanti-
fied by the entropy over sentence probabil-
ities. The current paper tests this hypoth-
esis more thoroughly than has been done
before by using recurrent neural networks
for entropy-reduction estimation. A com-
parison between these estimates and word-
reading times shows that entropy reduc-
tion is positively related to processing ef-
fort, confirming the entropy-reduction hy-
pothesis. This effect is independent from
the effect of surprisal.
