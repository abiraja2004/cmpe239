We extend Zhao and Ng's (2007) Chinese
anaphoric zero pronoun resolver by (1) using
a richer set of features and (2) exploiting the
coreference links between zero pronouns dur-
ing resolution. Results on OntoNotes show
that our approach significantly outperforms
two state-of-the-art anaphoric zero pronoun re-
solvers. To our knowledge, this is the first
work to report results obtained by an end-to-
end Chinese zero pronoun resolver.
