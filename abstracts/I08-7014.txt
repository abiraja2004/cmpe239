 
In this paper, we report a survey of lan-
guage resources in Indonesia, primarily of 
indigenous languages. We look at the offi-
cial Indonesian language (Bahasa Indone-
sia) and 726 regional languages of Indone-
sia (Bahasa Nusantara) and list all the 
available LRs that we can gathered. This 
paper suggests that the smaller regional 
languages may remain relatively unstudied, 
and unknown, but they are still worthy of 
our attention. Various LRs of these endan-
gered languages are being built and col-
lected by regional language centers for 
study and its preservation. We will also 
briefly report its presence on the Internet.
