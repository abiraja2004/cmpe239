We present a machine learning approach for
the task of ranking previously answered ques-
tions in a question repository with respect to
their relevance to a new, unanswered refer-
ence question. The ranking model is trained
on a collection of question groups manually
annotated with a partial order relation reflect-
ing the relative utility of questions inside each
group. Based on a set of meaning and struc-
ture aware features, the new ranking model is
able to substantially outperformmore straight-
forward, unsupervised similarity measures.
