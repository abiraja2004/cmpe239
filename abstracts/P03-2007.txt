This paper suggests the efficient indexing
method based on a concept vector space
that is capable of representing the semantic
content of a document. The two informa-
tion measure, namely the information quan-
tity and the information ratio, are defined
to represent the degree of the semantic im-
portance within a document. The proposed
method is expected to compensate the lim-
itations of term frequency based methods
by exploiting related lexical items. Further-
more, with information ratio, this approach
is independent of document length.
