Many discourse connectives can signal several
types of relations between sentences. Their
automatic disambiguation, i.e. the labeling of
the correct sense of each occurrence, is impor-
tant for discourse parsing, but could also be
helpful to machine translation. We describe
new approaches for improving the accuracy
of manual annotation of three discourse con-
nectives (two English, one French) by using
parallel corpora. An appropriate set of labels
for each connective can be found using infor-
mation from their translations. Our results for
automatic disambiguation are state-of-the-art,
at up to 85% accuracy using surface features.
Using feature analysis, contextual features are
shown to be useful across languages and con-
nectives.
