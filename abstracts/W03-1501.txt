 
This paper investigates three multilingual 
named entity corpora, including named 
people, named locations and named 
organizations.  Frequency-based 
approaches with and without dictionary 
are proposed to extract formulation rules 
of named entities for individual languages, 
and transformation rules for mapping 
among languages.  We consider the issues 
of abbreviation and compound keyword at 
a distance.  Keywords specify not only the 
types of named entities, but also tell out 
which parts of a named entity should be 
meaning-translated and which part should 
be phoneme-transliterated.  An 
application of the results on cross 
language information retrieval is also 
shown.
