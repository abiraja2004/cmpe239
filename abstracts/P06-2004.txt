We investigate the effect of corpus size
in combining supervised and unsuper-
vised learning for two types of attach-
ment decisions: relative clause attach-
ment and prepositional phrase attach-
ment. The supervised component is
Collins? parser, trained on the Wall
Street Journal. The unsupervised com-
ponent gathers lexical statistics from
an unannotated corpus of newswire
text. We find that the combined sys-
tem only improves the performance of
the parser for small training sets. Sur-
prisingly, the size of the unannotated
corpus has little effect due to the noisi-
ness of the lexical statistics acquired by
unsupervised learning.
