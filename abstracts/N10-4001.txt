1. Overview
This half-day tutorial introduces participants to data-intensive text
processing with the MapReduce programming model [1], using the
open-source Hadoop implementation. The focus will be on scalability
and the tradeoffs associated with distributed processing of large
datasets. Content will include general discussions about algorithm
design, presentation of illustrative algorithms, case studies in HLT
applications, as well as practical advice in writing Hadoop programs
and running Hadoop clusters.
2. Intended Audience
The tutorial is targeted at any NLP researcher who is interested in
data-intensive processing and scalability issues in general. No
background in parallel or distributed computing is necessary, but a
prior knowledge of HLT is assumed.
3. Course Objectives
* Acquire understanding of the MapReduce programming model and how it
  relates to alternative approaches to concurrent programming.
* Acquire understanding of how data-intensive HLT problems (e.g., text
  retrieval, iterative optimization problems, and graph algorithms)
  can be solved using MapReduce.
* Acquire understanding of the tradeoffs involved in designing
  MapReduce algorithms and awareness of associated engineering issues.
4. Tutorial Topics
The following represents a tentative list of topics that will be covered:
