Transliterated compound nouns not
separated by whitespaces pose diffi-
culty on word segmentation (WS). Of-
fline approaches have been proposed to
split them using word statistics, but
they rely on static lexicon, limiting
their use. We propose an online ap-
proach, integrating source LM, and/or,
back-transliteration and English LM.
The experiments on Japanese and Chi-
nese WS have shown that the pro-
posed models achieve significant im-
provement over state-of-the-art, reduc-
ing 16% errors in Japanese.
