We apply pattern-based methods for collect-
ing hypernym relations from the web. We
compare our approach with hypernym ex-
traction from morphological clues and from
large text corpora. We show that the abun-
dance of available data on the web enables
obtaining good results with relatively unso-
phisticated techniques.
