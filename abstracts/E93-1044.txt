 
This paper contributes to the theory of 
substructural logics .that are of interest o 
categorial grammarians. Combining se- 
mantic ideas of Hepple \[1990\] and Mor- 
rill \[1990\], proof-theoretic ideas of Venema 
\[1993b; 1993a\] and the theory of equational 
specifications, a class of resource-preserving 
logics is defined, for which decidability and 
completeness theorems are established.
