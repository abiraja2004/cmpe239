 
A dialogue based Question Answering 
(QA) system for Railway information in 
Telugu has been described. Telugu is an 
important language in India belonging to 
the Dravidian family. The main compo-
nent of our QA system is the Dialogue 
Manager (DM), to handle the dialogues 
between user and system. It is necessary 
in generating dialogue for clarifying par-
tially understood questions, resolving 
Anaphora and Co-reference problems. 
Besides, different modules have been de-
veloped for processing the query and its 
translation into formal database query 
language statement(s). Based on the re-
sult from the database, a natural language 
answer is generated. The empirical re-
sults obtained on the current system are 
encouraging. Testing with a set of ques-
tions in Railway domain, the QA system 
showed 96.34% of precision and 83.96% 
of dialogue success rate. Such a question 
answering system can be effectively util-
ized when integrated with a speech input 
and speech output system.
