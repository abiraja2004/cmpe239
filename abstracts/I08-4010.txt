The Fourth International Chinese Language
Processing Bakeoff was held in 2007 to as-
sess the state of the art in three important
tasks: Chinese word segmentation, named
entity recognition and Chinese POS tagging.
Twenty-eight groups submitted result sets in
the three tasks across two tracks and a total
of seven corpora. Strong results have been
found in all the tasks as well as continuing
challenges.
