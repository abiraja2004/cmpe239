We present an upcoming web-based centre for
information and documentation on language
technology (LT) in Sweden and/or in Swedish.
Some ways to collect and represent data using
data harvesting and XML are suggested. Users
providing data may choose one of four input
modes, two of which will allow the user to edit
existing documents at her own site. Thus we
hope to facilitate data entry and inter-site
communication, and reduce the amount of stale
data. The entry modes use annotated HTML and
an emerging XML-application, respectively.
In conclusion, we propose that an XML-
application in the field of LT would facilitate for
the LT community to share information, and that
automatic data harvesting will emerge as an
important technique for building information
centres in the future.
