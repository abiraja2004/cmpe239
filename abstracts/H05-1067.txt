Humor is one of the most interesting and
puzzling aspects of human behavior. De-
spite the attention it has received in fields
such as philosophy, linguistics, and psy-
chology, there have been only few at-
tempts to create computational models for
humor recognition or generation. In this
paper, we bring empirical evidence that
computational approaches can be success-
fully applied to the task of humor recogni-
tion. Through experiments performed on
very large data sets, we show that auto-
matic classification techniques can be ef-
fectively used to distinguish between hu-
morous and non-humorous texts, with sig-
nificant improvements observed over apri-
ori known baselines.
