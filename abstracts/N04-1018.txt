The regular occurrence of disfluencies is a
distinguishing characteristic of spontaneous
speech. Detecting and removing such disflu-
encies can substantially improve the usefulness
of spontaneous speech transcripts. This pa-
per presents a system that detects various types
of disfluencies and other structural information
with cues obtained from lexical and prosodic
information sources. Specifically, combina-
tions of decision trees and language models are
used to predict sentence ends and interruption
points and, given these events, transformation-
based learning is used to detect edit disfluen-
cies and conversational fillers. Results are re-
ported on human and automatic transcripts of
conversational telephone speech.
