 
This paper introduces simplified yet effective 
features that can robustly identify named enti-
ties in Arabic text without the need for mor-
phological or syntactic analysis or gazetteers. 
A CRF sequence labeling model is trained on 
features that primarily use character n-gram of 
leading and trailing letters in words and word 
n-grams.  The proposed features help over-
come some of the morphological and ortho-
graphic complexities of Arabic.  In comparing 
to results in the literature using Arabic specific 
features such POS tags on the same dataset 
and same CRF implementation, the results in 
this paper are lower by 2 F-measure points for 
locations, but are better by 8 points for organi-
zations and 9 points for persons.
