In this paper we propose a generalization
of the Stack-based decoding paradigm for
Statistical Machine Translation. The well
known single and multi-stack decoding
algorithms defined in the literature have
been integrated within a new formalism
which also defines a new family of stack-
based decoders. These decoders allows
a tradeoff to be made between the ad-
vantages of using only one or multiple
stacks. The key point of the new formal-
ism consists in parameterizeing the num-
ber of stacks to be used during the de-
coding process, and providing an efficient
method to decide in which stack each par-
tial hypothesis generated is to be inserted-
during the search process. Experimental
results are also reported for a search algo-
rithm for phrase-based statistical transla-
tion models.
