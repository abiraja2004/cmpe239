We derive variants of the fertility based
models IBM-3 and IBM-4 that, while
maintaining their zero and first order pa-
rameters, are nondeficient. Subsequently,
we proceed to derive a method to com-
pute a likely alignment and its neighbors
as well as give a solution of EM training.
The arising M-step energies are non-trivial
and handled via projected gradient ascent.
Our evaluation on gold alignments shows
substantial improvements (in weighted F-
measure) for the IBM-3. For the IBM-
4 there are no consistent improvements.
Training the nondeficient IBM-5 in the
regular way gives surprisingly good re-
sults.
Using the resulting alignments for phrase-
based translation systems offers no clear
insights w.r.t. BLEU scores.
