This paper describes techniques for unsu-
pervised word sense disambiguation of En-
glish and German medical documents us-
ing UMLS. We present both monolingual
techniques which rely only on the structure
of UMLS, and bilingual techniques which
also rely on the availability of parallel cor-
pora. The best results are obtained using
relations between terms given by UMLS,
a method which achieves 74% precision,
66% coverage for English and 79% preci-
sion, 73% coverage for German on evalua-
tion corpora and over 83% coverage over the
whole corpus. The success of this technique
for German shows that a lexical resource
giving relations between concepts used to
index an English document collection can
be used for high quality disambiguation in
another language.
