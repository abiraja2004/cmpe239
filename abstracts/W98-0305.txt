 
This paper tackles the methodological 
question of how coherence relations and their 
surface cues, e.g. causal connectives, may be 
categorised into different discourse domains. 
In this context, the central issue is the need for 
explicit and objective criteria that can be 
applied by different analysts to all kinds of 
natural texts. Strengths and weaknesses of 
different methods that are currently used in 
corpus studies are passed in review.
