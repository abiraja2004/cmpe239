A discourse typically involves numerous en-
tities, but few are mentioned more than once.
Distinguishing discourse entities that die out
after just one mention (singletons) from those
that lead longer lives (coreferent) would ben-
efit NLP applications such as coreference res-
olution, protagonist identification, topic mod-
eling, and discourse coherence. We build a lo-
gistic regression model for predicting the sin-
gleton/coreferent distinction, drawing on lin-
guistic insights about how discourse entity
lifespans are affected by syntactic and seman-
tic features. The model is effective in its own
right (78% accuracy), and incorporating it into
a state-of-the-art coreference resolution sys-
tem yields a significant improvement.
