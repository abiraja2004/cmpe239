We evaluate the accuracy of an unlexi-
calized statistical parser, trained on 4K
treebanked sentences from balanced data
and tested on the PARC DepBank. We
demonstrate that a parser which is compet-
itive in accuracy (without sacrificing pro-
cessing speed) can be quickly tuned with-
out reliance on large in-domain manually-
constructed treebanks. This makes it more
practical to use statistical parsers in ap-
plications that need access to aspects of
predicate-argument structure. The com-
parison of systems using DepBank is not
straightforward, so we extend and validate
DepBank and highlight a number of repre-
sentation and scoring issues for relational
evaluation schemes.
