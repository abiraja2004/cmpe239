In this paper we propose a data intensive ap-
proach for inferring sentence-internal tempo-
ral relations, which relies on a simple prob-
abilistic model and assumes no manual cod-
ing. We explore various combinations of fea-
tures, and evaluate performance against a gold-
standard corpus and human subjects perform-
ing the same task. The best model achieves
70.7% accuracy in inferring the temporal rela-
tion between two clauses and 97.4% accuracy
in ordering them, assuming that the temporal
relation is known.
