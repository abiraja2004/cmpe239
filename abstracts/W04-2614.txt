Current lexical semantic representations for
natural language applications view verbs as
simple predicates over their arguments. These
structures are too coarse-grained to capture
many important generalizations about verbal
argument structure. In this paper, I specifi-
cally defend the following two claims: verbs
have rich internal structure expressible in terms
of finer-grained primitives of meaning, and at
least for some languages, verbal meaning is
compositionally derived from these primitive
elements. I primarily present evidence from
Mandarin Chinese, whose verbal system is very
different from that of English. Many empiri-
cal facts about the typology of verbs in Man-
darin cannot be captured by a ?flat? lexical se-
mantic representation. These theoretical results
hold important practical consequences for nat-
ural language processing applications.
