Corpora of child language are essential for
psycholinguistic research. Linguistic anno-
tation of the corpora provides researchers
with better means for exploring the develop-
ment of grammatical constructions and their
usage. We describe an ongoing project that
aims to annotate the English section of the
CHILDES database with grammatical re-
lations in the form of labeled dependency
structures. To date, we have produced a cor-
pus of over 65,000 words with manually cu-
rated gold-standard grammatical relation an-
notations. Using this corpus, we have devel-
oped a highly accurate data-driven parser for
English CHILDES data. The parser and the
manually annotated data are freely available
for research purposes.
