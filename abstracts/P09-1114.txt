Creating labeled training data for rela-
tion extraction is expensive. In this pa-
per, we study relation extraction in a spe-
cial weakly-supervised setting when we
have only a few seed instances of the tar-
get relation type we want to extract but
we also have a large amount of labeled
instances of other relation types. Ob-
serving that different relation types can
share certain common structures, we pro-
pose to use a multi-task learning method
coupled with human guidance to address
this weakly-supervised relation extraction
problem. The proposed framework mod-
els the commonality among different re-
lation types through a shared weight vec-
tor, enables knowledge learned from the
auxiliary relation types to be transferred
to the target relation type, and allows easy
control of the tradeoff between precision
and recall. Empirical evaluation on the
ACE 2004 data set shows that the pro-
posed method substantially improves over
two baseline methods.
