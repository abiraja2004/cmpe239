We describe a graphical logical form as a semantic representation for text
understanding. This representation was designed to bridge the gap be-
tween highly expressive "deep" representations of logical forms and more
shallow semantic encodings such as word senses and semantic relations.
It preserves rich semantic content while allowing for compact ambigu-
ity encoding and viable partial representations. We describe our system
for semantic text processing, which has the TRIPS parser at the core,
augmented with statistical preprocessing techniques and online lexical
lookup. We also present an evaluation metric for the representation and
use it to evaluate the performance of the TRIPS parser on the common
task paragraphs.
