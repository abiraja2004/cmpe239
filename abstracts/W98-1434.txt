 
The MLWFA (Multilingual Weather Forecasts Assistant) system will be demonstrated. It is 
developed to generate the multilingual text of the weather forecasts automatically. The raw data 
from the weather observation can be used to generate the weather element chart. According to the 
weather change trend, the forecasters can directly modify the value Of the element on the chart, 
such as the center .point value, the isoline and the isocircle. After ?that, the modified data are 
stored as the input for the system. The system can select a schema depending on the input or the 
requirement from the users. The schema library can be conveniently maintained, such as the 
schema modification or extension. Through optimizing and mapping the schema ?tree, the 
microplanner constructs the brief and coherent internal text structure for the surface generator. 
After the processing of the generator, the muitilingual ?weather forecasts used for the broadcast 
program are generated.
