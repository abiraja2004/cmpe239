We present a semi-supervised method to
improve statistical parsing performance.
We focus on the well-known problem of
lexical data sparseness and present exper-
iments of word clustering prior to pars-
ing. We use a combination of lexicon-
aided morphological clustering that pre-
serves tagging ambiguity, and unsuper-
vised word clustering, trained on a large
unannotated corpus. We apply these clus-
terings to the French Treebank, and we
train a parser with the PCFG-LA unlex-
icalized algorithm of (Petrov et al, 2006).
We find a gain in French parsing perfor-
mance: from a baseline of F1=86.76% to
F1=87.37% using morphological cluster-
ing, and up to F1=88.29% using further
unsupervised clustering. This is the best
known score for French probabilistic pars-
ing. These preliminary results are encour-
aging for statistically parsing morpholog-
ically rich languages, and languages with
small amount of annotated data.
