This paper explores the close relationship be-
tween question answering and machine read-
ing, and how the active use of reasoning to 
answer (and in the process, disambiguate) 
questions can also be applied to reading de-
clarative texts, where a substantial proportion 
of the text?s contents is already known to (rep-
resented in) the system. In question answer-
ing, a question may be ambiguous, and it may 
only be in the process of trying to answer it 
that the "right" way to disambiguate it be-
comes apparent. Similarly in machine reading, 
a text may be ambiguous, and may require 
some process to relate it to what is already 
known. Our conjecture in this paper is that 
these two processes are similar, and that we 
can modify a question answering tool to help 
"read" new text that augments existing system 
knowledge. Specifically, interpreting a new 
text T can be recast as trying to answer, or 
partially answer, the question "Is it true that 
T?", resulting in both appropriate disambigua-
tion and connection of T to existing knowl-
edge. Some preliminary investigation suggests 
this might be useful for proposing knowledge 
base extensions, extracted from text, to a 
knowledge engineer.
