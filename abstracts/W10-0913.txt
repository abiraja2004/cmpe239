 
 This paper describes a hybrid approach for 
unsupervised and unrestricted relation discov-
ery between entities using output from linguis-
tic analysis and semantic typing information 
from a knowledge base. We use Factz (en-
coded as subject, predicate and object triples) 
produced by Powerset as a result of linguistic 
analysis. A particular relation may be ex-
pressed in a variety of ways in text and hence 
have multiple facts associated with it. We 
present an unsupervised approach for collaps-
ing multiple facts which represent the same 
kind of semantic relation between entities.  
Then a label is selected for the relation based 
on the input facts and entropy based label 
ranking of context words.  Finally, we demon-
strate relation discovery between entities at 
different levels of abstraction by leveraging 
semantic typing information from a know-
ledge base.
