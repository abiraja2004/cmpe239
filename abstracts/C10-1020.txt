 
In this paper, we propose an unsuper-
vised approach for identifying bipolar 
person names in a set of topic documents. 
We employ principal component analysis 
(PCA) to discover bipolar word usage 
patterns of person names in the docu-
ments and show that the signs of the en-
tries in the principal eigenvector of PCA 
partition the person names into bipolar 
groups spontaneously. Empirical evalua-
tions demonstrate the efficacy of the 
proposed approach in identifying bipolar 
person names of topics.
