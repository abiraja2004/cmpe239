Traditional text similarity measures consider
each term similar only to itself and do not
model semantic relatedness of terms. We pro-
pose a novel discriminative training method
that projects the raw term vectors into a com-
mon, low-dimensional vector space. Our ap-
proach operates by finding the optimal matrix
to minimize the loss of the pre-selected sim-
ilarity function (e.g., cosine) of the projected
vectors, and is able to efficiently handle a
large number of training examples in the high-
dimensional space. Evaluated on two very dif-
ferent tasks, cross-lingual document retrieval
and ad relevance measure, our method not
only outperforms existing state-of-the-art ap-
proaches, but also achieves high accuracy at
low dimensions and is thus more efficient.
