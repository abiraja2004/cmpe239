 
This paper describes results achieved in a 
project which addresses the issue of how the 
gap between unification-based grammars as a 
scientific concept and real world applications 
can be narrowed own 1. Application-oriented 
grammar development has to take into ac- 
count the following parameters: Efficiency: 
The project chose a so called 'lean' formal 
ism, a term-encodable language providing effi- 
cient term unification, ALEP. Coverage: The 
project adopted a corpus-based approach. 
Completeness: All modules needed from text 
handling to semantics must be there. The 
paper reports on a text handling compo- 
nent, Two Level morphology, word structure, 
phrase structure, semantics and the interfaces 
between these components. Mainstream ap- 
proach: The approach claims to be main- 
stream, very much indebted to HPSG, thus 
based on the currently most prominent and 
recent linguistic theory. The relation (and 
tension) between these parameters are de- 
scribed in this paper.
