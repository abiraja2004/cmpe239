Abstract. One generally accepted hallmark of creative thinking is an ability to 
look beyond conventional labels and recategorize a concept based on its behav-
iour and functional potential. So while taxonomies are useful in any domain of 
reasoning, they typically represent the conventional label set that creative think-
ing attempts to look beyond. So if a linguistic taxonomy like WordNet [1] is to 
be useful in driving linguistic creativity, it must support some basis for recate-
gorization, to allow an agent to reorganize its category structures in a way that 
unlocks the functional potential of objects, or that recognizes similarity between 
literally dissimilar ideas. In this paper we consider how recategorization can be 
used to generate analogies using the HowNet [2] ontology, a lexical resource 
like WordNet that in addition to being bilingual (Chinese/English) also provides 
explicit semantic definitions for each of the terms that it defines.
