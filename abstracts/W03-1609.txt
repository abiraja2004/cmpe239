We are trying to find paraphrases from
Japanese news articles which can be used
for Information Extraction. We focused
on the fact that a single event can be re-
ported in more than one article in differ-
ent ways. However, certain kinds of noun
phrases such as names, dates and numbers
behave as ?anchors? which are unlikely to
change across articles. Our key idea is to
identify these anchors among comparable
articles and extract portions of expressions
which share the anchors. This way we
can extract expressions which convey the
same information. Obtained paraphrases
are generalized as templates and stored for
future use.
In this paper, first we describe our ba-
sic idea of paraphrase acquisition. Our
method is divided into roughly four steps,
each of which is explained in turn. Then
we illustrate several issues which we en-
counter in real texts. To solve these prob-
lems, we introduce two techniques: coref-
erence resolution and structural restriction
of possible portions of expressions. Fi-
nally we discuss the experimental results
and conclusions.
