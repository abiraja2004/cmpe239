We present a method for identifying the pos-
itive or negative semantic orientation of for-
eign words. Identifying the semantic orienta-
tion of words has numerous applications in the
areas of text classification, analysis of prod-
uct review, analysis of responses to surveys,
and mining online discussions. Identifying
the semantic orientation of English words has
been extensively studied in literature. Most of
this work assumes the existence of resources
(e.g. Wordnet, seeds, etc) that do not exist
in foreign languages. In this work, we de-
scribe a method based on constructing a mul-
tilingual network connecting English and for-
eign words. We use this network to iden-
tify the semantic orientation of foreign words
based on connection between words in the
same language as well as multilingual connec-
tions. The method is experimentally tested us-
ing a manually labeled set of positive and neg-
ative words and has shown very promising re-
sults.
