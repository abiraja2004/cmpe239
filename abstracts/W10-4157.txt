 
This document presents the bakeoff re-
sults of Chinese personal name in the 
First CIPS-SIGHAN Joint Conference 
on Chinese Language Processing. The 
authors introduce the frame of person 
disambiguation system LJPD, which 
uses a new person model. LJPD was 
built in short time, and it is not given 
enough training and adjustment. Evalua-
tion on LJPD shows that the precision is 
competitive, but the recall is very low. It 
has more space for further improvement.
