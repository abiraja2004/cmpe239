 
In BBN's natural language understanding and 
generation system (Janus), we have used a hybrid 
approach to representation, employing an intensional 
logic for the representation of the semantics of ut- 
terances and a taxonomic language with formal 
semantics for specification of descriptive constants 
and axioms relating them. Remarkably, 99.9% of 
7,000 vocabulary items in our natural language ap- 
plications could be adequately axiomatlzed in the 
taxonomic language.
