 
Previous research on temporal anchoring 
and ordering has focused on the annota-
tion and learning of temporal relations 
between events. These qualitative rela-
tions can be usefully supplemented with 
information about metric constraints, 
specifically as to how long events last. 
This paper describes the first steps in ac-
quiring metric temporal constraints for 
events. The work is carried out in the 
context of the TimeML framework for 
marking up events and their temporal re-
lations. This pilot study examines the fea-
sibility of acquisition of metric temporal 
constraints from corpora.
