We describe the beginning stages of our work
on summarizing chat, which is motivated by
our observations concerning the information
overload of US Navy watchstanders. We de-
scribe the challenges of summarizing chat and
focus on two chat-specific types of summa-
rizations we are interested in: thread sum-
maries and temporal summaries. We then dis-
cuss our plans for addressing these challenges
and evaluation issues.
