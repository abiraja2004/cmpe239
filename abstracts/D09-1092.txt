Topic models are a useful tool for analyz-
ing large text collections, but have previ-
ously been applied in only monolingual,
or at most bilingual, contexts. Mean-
while, massive collections of interlinked
documents in dozens of languages, such
as Wikipedia, are now widely available,
calling for tools that can characterize con-
tent in many languages. We introduce a
polylingual topic model that discovers top-
ics aligned across multiple languages. We
explore the model?s characteristics using
two large corpora, each with over ten dif-
ferent languages, and demonstrate its use-
fulness in supporting machine translation
and tracking topic trends across languages.
