We compare the performance of three
statistical parsing architectures on the
problem of deriving typed dependency
structures for French. The architectures
are based on PCFGs with latent vari-
ables, graph-based dependency parsing
and transition-based dependency parsing,
respectively. We also study the in?u-
ence of three types of lexical informa-
tion: lemmas, morphological features,
and word clusters. The results show that
all three systems achieve competitive per-
formance, with a best labeled attachment
score over 88%. All three parsers bene?t
from the use of automatically derived lem-
mas, while morphological features seem
to be less important. Word clusters have a
positive effect primarily on the latent vari-
able parser.
