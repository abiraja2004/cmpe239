 
This paper presents a fast consensus hy-
pothesis regeneration approach for ma-
chine translation. It combines the advan-
tages of feature-based fast consensus de-
coding and hypothesis regeneration.  Our 
approach is more efficient than previous 
work on hypothesis regeneration, and it 
explores a wider search space than con-
sensus decoding, resulting in improved 
performance.  Experimental results show 
consistent improvements across language 
pairs, and an improvement of up to 0.72 
BLEU is obtained over a competitive 
single-pass baseline on the Chinese-to-
English NIST task.
