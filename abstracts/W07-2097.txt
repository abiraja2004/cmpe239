This paper describes the WSD system devel-
oped for our participation to the SemEval-1.
It combines various methods by means of a
fuzzy Borda voting. The fuzzy Borda vote-
counting scheme is one of the best known
methods in the field of collective decision
making. In our system the different disam-
biguation methods are considered as experts
that give a preference ranking for the senses
a word can be assigned. Then the prefer-
ences are evaluated using the fuzzy Borda
scheme in order to select the best sense. The
methods we considered are the sense fre-
quency probability calculated over SemCor,
the Conceptual Density calculated over both
hyperonyms and meronyms hyerarchies in
WordNet, the extended Lesk by Banerjee
and Pedersen, and finally a method based on
WordNet domains.
