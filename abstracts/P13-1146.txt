Methods for information extraction (IE)
and knowledge base (KB) construction
have been intensively studied. However, a
largely under-explored case is tapping into
highly dynamic sources like news streams
and social media, where new entities are
continuously emerging. In this paper, we
present a method for discovering and se-
mantically typing newly emerging out-of-
KB entities, thus improving the freshness
and recall of ontology-based IE and im-
proving the precision and semantic rigor
of open IE. Our method is based on a prob-
abilistic model that feeds weights into in-
teger linear programs that leverage type
signatures of relational phrases and type
correlation or disjointness constraints. Our
experimental evaluation, based on crowd-
sourced user studies, show our method
performing significantly better than prior
work.
