In this paper, we improve an unsuper-
vised learning method using the Expectation-
Maximization (EM) algorithm proposed by
Nigam et al for text classification problems
in order to apply it to word sense disambigua-
tion (WSD) problems. The improved method
stops the EM algorithm at the optimum itera-
tion number. To estimate that number, we pro-
pose two methods. In experiments, we solved
50 noun WSD problems in the Japanese Dic-
tionary Task in SENSEVAL2. The score of our
method is a match for the best public score of
this task. Furthermore, our methods were con-
firmed to be effective also for verb WSD prob-
lems.
