We present a novel unsupervised approach to
the problem of multi-document summariza-
tion of scientific articles, in which the doc-
ument collection is a list of papers cited to-
gether within the same source article, other-
wise known as a co-citation. At the heart of
the approach is a topic based clustering of
fragments extracted from each co-cited arti-
cle and relevance ranking using a query gen-
erated from the context surrounding the co-
cited list of papers. This analysis enables the
generation of an overview of common themes
from the co-cited papers that relate to the con-
text in which the co-citation was found. We
present a system called SciSumm that em-
bodies this approach and apply it to the 2008
ACL Anthology. We evaluate this summa-
rization system for relevant content selection
using gold standard summaries prepared on
principle based guidelines. Evaluation with
gold standard summaries demonstrates that
our system performs better in content selec-
tion than an existing summarization system
(MEAD). We present a detailed summary of
our findings and discuss possible directions
for future research.
