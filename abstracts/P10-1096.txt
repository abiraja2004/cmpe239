We describe our experiments with training
algorithms for tree-to-tree synchronous
tree-substitution grammar (STSG) for
monolingual translation tasks such as
sentence compression and paraphrasing.
These translation tasks are characterized
by the relative ability to commit to parallel
parse trees and availability of word align-
ments, yet the unavailability of large-scale
data, calling for a Bayesian tree-to-tree
formalism. We formalize nonparametric
Bayesian STSG with epsilon alignment in
full generality, and provide a Gibbs sam-
pling algorithm for posterior inference tai-
lored to the task of extractive sentence
compression. We achieve improvements
against a number of baselines, including
expectation maximization and variational
Bayes training, illustrating the merits of
nonparametric inference over the space of
grammars as opposed to sparse parametric
inference with a fixed grammar.
