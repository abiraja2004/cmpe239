This paper presents the Carnegie Mellon
University statistical transfer MT system
submitted to the 2009 WMT shared task
in French-to-English translation. We de-
scribe a syntax-based approach that incor-
porates both syntactic and non-syntactic
phrase pairs in addition to a syntactic
grammar. After reporting development
test results, we conduct a preliminary anal-
ysis of the coverage and effectiveness of
the system?s components.
