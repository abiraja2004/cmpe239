We have participated in both English all words
task and English lexical sample task of SENSEVAL-
3. Our system disambiguates senses of a target
word in a context by selecting a substituent among
WordNet relatives of the target word, such as syn-
onyms, hypernyms, meronyms and so on. The deci-
sion is made based on co-occurrence frequency be-
tween candidate relatives and each of the context
words. Since the co-occurrence frequency is obtain-
able from raw corpus, our method is considered to
be an unsupervised learning algorithm that does not
require a sense-tagged corpus.
