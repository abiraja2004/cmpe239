 
This paper examines language similarity 
in messages over time in an online com-
munity of adolescents from around the 
world using three computational meas-
ures: Spearman?s Correlation Coefficient, 
Zipping and Latent Semantic Analysis.  
Results suggest that the participants? lan-
guage diverges over a six-week period, 
and that divergence is not mediated by 
demographic variables such as leadership 
status or gender.  This divergence may 
represent the introduction of more unique 
words over time, and is influenced by a 
continual change in subtopics over time, 
as well as community-wide historical 
events that introduce new vocabulary at 
later time periods. Our results highlight 
both the possibilities and shortcomings of 
using document similarity measures to as-
sess convergence in language use.
