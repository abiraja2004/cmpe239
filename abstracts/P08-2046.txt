Automatic extraction of collocations from
large corpora has been the focus of many re-
search efforts. Most approaches concentrate
on improving and combining known lexical
association measures. In this paper, we de-
scribe a genetic programming approach for
evolving new association measures, which is
not limited to any specific language, corpus,
or type of collocation. Our preliminary experi-
mental results show that the evolved measures
outperform three known association measures.
