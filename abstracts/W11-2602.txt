This paper is about improving the quality
of Arabic-English statistical machine trans-
lation (SMT) on dialectal Arabic text us-
ing morphological knowledge. We present a
light-weight rule-based approach to producing
Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) paraphrases
of dialectal Arabic out-of-vocabulary (OOV)
words and low frequency words. Our ap-
proach extends an existing MSA analyzer with
a small number of morphological clitics, and
uses transfer rules to generate paraphrase lat-
tices that are input to a state-of-the-art phrase-
based SMT system. This approach improves
BLEU scores on a blind test set by 0.56 abso-
lute BLEU (or 1.5% relative). A manual error
analysis of translated dialectal words shows
that our system produces correct translations
in 74% of the time for OOVs and 60% of the
time for low frequency words.
