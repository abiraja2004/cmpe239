In this paper, we use the information re-
dundancy in multilingual input to correct
errors in machine translation and thus im-
prove the quality of multilingual sum-
maries. We consider the case of multi-
document summarization, where the input
documents are in Arabic, and the output
summary is in English. Typically, infor-
mation that makes it to a summary appears
in many different lexical-syntactic forms
in the input documents. Further, the use of
multiple machine translation systems pro-
vides yet more redundancy, yielding dif-
ferent ways to realize that information in
English. We demonstrate how errors in the
machine translations of the input Arabic
documents can be corrected by identify-
ing and generating from such redundancy,
focusing on noun phrases.
