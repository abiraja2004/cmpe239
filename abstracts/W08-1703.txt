This paper describes a more precise anal-
ysis of punctuation for a bi-directional,
broad coverage English grammar extracted
from the CCGbank (Hockenmaier and
Steedman, 2007). We discuss various ap-
proaches which have been proposed in
the literature to constrain overgeneration
with punctuation, and illustrate how as-
pects of Briscoe?s (1994) influential ap-
proach, which relies on syntactic features
to constrain the appearance of balanced
and unbalanced commas and dashes to ap-
propriate sentential contexts, is unattrac-
tive for CCG. As an interim solution
to constrain overgeneration, we propose
a rule-based filter which bars illicit se-
quences of punctuation and cases of im-
properly unbalanced apposition. Using
the OpenCCG toolkit, we demonstrate
that our punctuation-augmented grammar
yields substantial increases in surface re-
alization coverage and quality, helping to
achieve state-of-the-art BLEU scores.
