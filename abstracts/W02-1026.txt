In this paper, we address the problem of
dealing with a large collection of data
and propose a method for text classifi-
cation which manipulates data using two
well-known machine learning techniques,
Naive Bayes(NB) and Support Vector Ma-
chines(SVMs). NB is based on the as-
sumption of word independence in a text,
which makes the computation of it far
more efficient. SVMs, on the other hand,
have the potential to handle large feature
spaces, which makes it possible to pro-
duce better performance. The training
data for SVMs are extracted using NB
classifiers according to the category hier-
archies, which makes it possible to reduce
the amount of computation necessary for
classification without sacrificing accuracy.
