Two of the current issues of Question Answer-
ing (QA) systems are the lack of personaliza-
tion to the individual users? needs, and the lack
of interactivity by which at the end of each Q/A
session the context of interaction is lost.
We address these issues by designing and im-
plementing a model of personalized, interac-
tive QA based on a User Modelling component
and on a conversational interface. Our eval-
uation with respect to a baseline QA system
yields encouraging results in both personaliza-
tion and interactivity.
