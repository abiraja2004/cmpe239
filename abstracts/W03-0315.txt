 
This paper presents a study on optimizing sen-
tence pair alignment scores of a bilingual sen-
tence alignment module. Five candidate 
scores based on perplexity and sentence 
length are introduced and tested. Then a linear 
regression model based on those candidates is 
proposed and trained to predict sentence pairs? 
alignment quality scores solicited from human 
subjects. Experiments are carried out on data 
automatically collected from Internet. The 
correlation between the scores generated by 
the linear regression model and the scores 
from human subjects is in the range of the in-
ter-subject agreement score correlations. Pear-
son's correlation ranges from 0.53 up to 0.72 
in our experiments.
