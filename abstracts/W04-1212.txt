The accelerating growth in biomedical literature has
stimulated activity on automated classification of
and information extraction from this literature. The
work described here attempts to improve on an ear-
lier classification study associating biological arti-
cles to GO codes. It demonstrates the need, under
particular assumptions, for more access to full text
articles and for the use of Part-of-Speech tagging.
