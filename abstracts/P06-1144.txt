This paper presents an approach for Mul-
tilingual Document Clustering in compa-
rable corpora. The algorithm is of heuris-
tic nature and it uses as unique evidence
for clustering the identification of cognate
named entities between both sides of the
comparable corpora. One of the main ad-
vantages of this approach is that it does
not depend on bilingual or multilingual re-
sources. However, it depends on the pos-
sibility of identifying cognate named enti-
ties between the languages used in the cor-
pus. An additional advantage of the ap-
proach is that it does not need any infor-
mation about the right number of clusters;
the algorithm calculates it. We have tested
this approach with a comparable corpus
of news written in English and Spanish.
In addition, we have compared the results
with a system which translates selected
document features. The obtained results
are encouraging.
