We present an approach for the construction of text
similarity functions using a parameterized resem-
blance coefficient in combination with a softened
cardinality function called soft cardinality. Our ap-
proach provides a consistent and recursive model,
varying levels of granularity from sentences to char-
acters. Therefore, our model was used to compare
sentences divided into words, and in turn, words di-
vided into q-grams of characters. Experimentally,
we observed that a performance correlation func-
tion in a space defined by all parameters was rel-
atively smooth and had a single maximum achiev-
able by ?hill climbing.? Our approach used only sur-
face text information, a stop-word remover, and a
stemmer to tackle the semantic text similarity task
6 at SEMEVAL 2012. The proposed method ranked
3rd (average), 5th (normalized correlation), and 15th
(aggregated correlation) among 89 systems submit-
ted by 31 teams.
