 
In this paper, we have identified event and sen-
timent expressions at word level from the sen-
tences of TempEval-2010 corpus and evaluated 
their association in terms of lexical equivalence 
and co-reference. A hybrid approach that con-
sists of Conditional Random Field (CRF) based 
machine learning framework in conjunction 
with several rule based strategies has been 
adopted for event identification within the 
TimeML framework. The strategies are based 
on semantic role labeling, WordNet relations 
and some handcrafted rules. The sentiment ex-
pressions are identified simply based on the 
cues that are available in the sentiment lexicons 
such as Subjectivity Wordlist, SentiWordNet 
and WordNet Affect. The identification of lexi-
cal equivalence between event and sentiment 
expressions based on the part-of-speech (POS) 
categories is straightforward. The emotional 
verbs from VerbNet have also been employed 
to improve the coverage of lexical equivalence. 
On the other hand, the association of sentiment 
and event has been analyzed using the notion of 
co-reference. The parsed dependency relations 
along with basic rhetoric knowledge help to 
identify the co-reference between event and 
sentiment expressions. Manual evaluation on 
the 171 sentences of TempEval-2010 dataset 
yields the precision, recall and F-Score values 
of 61.25%, 70.29% and 65.23% respectively.
