Structural events, (i.e., the structure of clauses
and disfluencies) in spontaneous speech, are
important components of human speaking and
have been used to measure language devel-
opment. However, they have not been ac-
tively used in automated speech assessment
research. Given the recent substantial progress
on automated structural event detection on
spontaneous speech, we investigated the de-
tection of clause boundaries and interruption
points of edit disfluencies on transcriptions
of non-native speech data and extracted fea-
tures from the detected events for speech
assessment. Compared to features com-
puted on human-annotated events, the features
computed on machine-generated events show
promising correlations to holistic scores that
reflect speaking proficiency levels.
