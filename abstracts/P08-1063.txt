This paper presents an empirical study on the
robustness and generalization of two alterna-
tive role sets for semantic role labeling: Prop-
Bank numbered roles and VerbNet thematic
roles. By testing a state?of?the?art SRL sys-
tem with the two alternative role annotations,
we show that the PropBank role set is more
robust to the lack of verb?specific semantic
information and generalizes better to infre-
quent and unseen predicates. Keeping in mind
that thematic roles are better for application
needs, we also tested the best way to generate
VerbNet annotation. We conclude that tagging
first PropBank roles and mapping into Verb-
Net roles is as effective as training and tagging
directly on VerbNet, and more robust for do-
main shifts.
