In recent years Dialogue Acts have be-
come a popular means of modelling the
communicative intentions of human and
machine utterances in many modern di-
alogue systems. Many of these systems
rely heavily on the availability of dialogue
corpora that have been annotated with Di-
alogue Act labels. The manual annota-
tion of dialogue corpora is both tedious
and expensive. Consequently, there is a
growing interest in unsupervised systems
that are capable of automating the annota-
tion process. This paper investigates the
use of a Dirichlet Process Mixture Model
as a means of clustering dialogue utter-
ances in an unsupervised manner. These
clusters can then be analysed in terms of
the possible Dialogue Acts that they might
represent. The results presented here are
from the application of the Dirichlet Pro-
cess Mixture Model to the Dihana corpus.
