Topic detection and tracking approaches mon-
itor broadcast news in order to spot new, pre-
viously unreported events and to track the de-
velopment of the previously spotted ones. The
dynamical nature of the events makes the use of
state-of-the-art methods difficult. We present a
new topic definition that has potential to model
evolving events. We also discuss incorporat-
ing ontologies into the similarity measures of
the topics, and illustrate a dynamic hierarchy
that decreases the exhaustive computation per-
formed in the TDT process. This is mainly
work-in-progress.
