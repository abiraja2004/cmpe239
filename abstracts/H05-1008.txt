The accuracy of event extraction is lim-
ited by a number of complicating factors,
with errors compounded at all sages in-
side the Information Extraction pipeline.
In this paper, we present methods for re-
covering automatically from errors com-
mitted in the pipeline processing. Recov-
ery is achieved via post-processing facts
aggregated over a large collection of doc-
uments, and suggesting corrections based
on evidence external to the document. A
further improvement is derived from prop-
agating multiple, locally non-best slot fills
through the pipeline. Evaluation shows
that the global analysis is over 10 times
more likely to suggest valid corrections to
the local-only analysis than it is to suggest
erroneous ones. This yields a substantial
overall gain, with no supervised training.
