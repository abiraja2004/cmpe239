We discuss the problem of model adapta-
tion for the task of named entity recog-
nition with respect to the variation of la-
bel distributions in data from different do-
mains. We investigate an adaptive exten-
sion of the sequence perceptron, where the
adaptive component includes parameters
estimated from unlabelled data in combi-
nation with background knowledge in the
form of gazetteers. We apply this idea
empirically on adaptation experiments in-
volving two newswire datasets from dif-
ferent domains and compare with other
popular methods such as self training and
structural correspondence learning.
