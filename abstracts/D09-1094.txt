Models of language learning play a cen-
tral role in a wide range of applica-
tions: from psycholinguistic theories of
how people acquire new word knowledge,
to information systems that can automati-
cally match content to users? reading abil-
ity. We present a novel statistical ap-
proach that can infer the distribution of
a word?s likely acquisition age automati-
cally from authentic texts collected from
the Web. We then show that combining
these acquisition age distributions for all
words in a document provides an effective
semantic component for predicting read-
ing difficulty of new texts. We also com-
pare our automatically inferred acquisition
ages with norms from existing oral stud-
ies, revealing interesting historical trends
as well as differences between oral and
written word acquisition processes.
