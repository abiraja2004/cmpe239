  
This presentation introduces a Python module (PyCWN) for accessing and processing 
Chinese lexical resources. In particular, our focus is put on the Chinese Wordnet (CWN) that 
has been developed and released by CWN group at Academia Sinica. PyCWN provides the 
access to Chinese Wordnet (sense and relation data) under the Python environment.  The 
presenation further demonstrates how this module applies to a variety of lexical processing 
tasks as well as the potentials for multilingual lexical processing.
