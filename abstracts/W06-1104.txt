Semantic relatedness is a special form of
linguistic distance between words. Eval-
uating semantic relatedness measures is
usually performed by comparison with hu-
man judgments. Previous test datasets had
been created analytically and were limited
in size. We propose a corpus-based system
for automatically creating test datasets.1
Experiments with human subjects show
that the resulting datasets cover all de-
grees of relatedness. As a result of the
corpus-based approach, test datasets cover
all types of lexical-semantic relations and
contain domain-specific words naturally
occurring in texts.
