We present a theoretical and empirical
comparative analysis of the two domi-
nant categories of approaches in Chinese
word segmentation: word-based models
and character-based models. We show
that, in spite of similar performance over-
all, the two models produce different dis-
tribution of segmentation errors, in a way
that can be explained by theoretical prop-
erties of the two models. The analysis is
further exploited to improve segmentation
accuracy by integrating a word-based seg-
menter and a character-based segmenter.
A Bootstrap Aggregating model is pro-
posed. By letting multiple segmenters
vote, our model improves segmentation
consistently on the four different data sets
from the second SIGHAN bakeoff.
