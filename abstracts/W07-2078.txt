In this article a multiclassifier approach for
word sense disambiguation (WSD) prob-
lems is presented, where a set of k-NN
classifiers is used to predict the category
(sense) of each word. In order to combine
the predictions generated by the multiclas-
sifier, Bayesian voting is applied. Through
all the classification process, a reduced di-
mensional vector representation obtained by
Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is
used. Each word is considered an indepen-
dent classification problem, and so differ-
ent parameter setting, selected after a tun-
ing phase, is applied to each word. The ap-
proach has been applied to the lexical sam-
ple WSD subtask of SemEval 2007 (task
17).
