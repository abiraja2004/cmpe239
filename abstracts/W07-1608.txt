 
The paper describes an approach to auto-
matically select from Indian Language the 
appropriate lexical correspondence of Eng-
lish simple preposition. The paper de-
scribes this task from a Machine Transla-
tion (MT) perspective. We use the proper-
ties of the head and complement of the 
preposition to select the appropriate sense 
in the target language. We later show that 
the results obtained from this approach are 
promising.
