The results of experiments on the appli-
cation of a variety of distance measures
to a question-answering task are reported.
Variants of tree-distance are considered,
including whole-vs-sub tree, node weight-
ing, wild cards and lexical emphasis. We
derive string-distance as a special case
of tree-distance and show that a particu-
lar parameterisation of tree-distance out-
performs the string-distance measure.
