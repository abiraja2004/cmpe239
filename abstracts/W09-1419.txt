The BioNLP?09 Shared Task on Event Ex-
traction is a challenge which concerns the de-
tection of bio-molecular events from text. In
this paper, we present a detailed account of
the challenges encountered during the con-
struction of a machine learning framework for
participation in this task. We have focused
our work mainly around the filtering of false
positives, creating a high-precision extraction
method. We have tested techniques such as
SVMs, feature selection and various filters for
data pre- and post-processing, and report on
the influence on performance for each of them.
To detect negation and speculation in text,
we describe a custom-made rule-based sys-
tem which is simple in design, but effective in
performance.
