Vector space models of word meaning typi-
cally represent the meaning of a word as a vec-
tor computed by summing over all its corpus
occurrences. Words close to this point in space
can be assumed to be similar to it in meaning.
But how far around this point does the region
of similar meaning extend? In this paper we
discuss two models that represent word mean-
ing as regions in vector space. Both represen-
tations can be computed from traditional point
representations in vector space. We find that
both models perform at over 95% F-score on
a token classification task.
