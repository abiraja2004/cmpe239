We present evidence for the importance
of low-level phenomena in dialogue in-
teraction and use this to motivate a
multi-layered approach to dialogue pro-
cessing. We describe an architecture
that separates content-level communica-
tive processes from interaction-level phe-
nomena (such as feedback, grounding,
turn-management), and provide details of
specific implementations of a number of
such phenomena.
