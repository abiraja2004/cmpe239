This paper describes a temporal expression
identification and normalization system, Man-
TIME, developed for the TempEval-3 chal-
lenge. The identification phase combines
the use of conditional random fields along
with a post-processing identification pipeline,
whereas the normalization phase is carried out
using NorMA, an open-source rule-based tem-
poral normalizer. We investigate the perfor-
mance variation with respect to different fea-
ture types. Specifically, we show that the use
of WordNet-based features in the identifica-
tion task negatively affects the overall perfor-
mance, and that there is no statistically sig-
nificant difference in using gazetteers, shal-
low parsing and propositional noun phrases
labels on top of the morphological features.
On the test data, the best run achieved 0.95
(P), 0.85 (R) and 0.90 (F1) in the identifica-
tion phase. Normalization accuracies are 0.84
(type attribute) and 0.77 (value attribute). Sur-
prisingly, the use of the silver data (alone or in
addition to the gold annotated ones) does not
improve the performance.
