  
This paper describes a novel computer-aided 
procedure for generating multiple-choice tests from 
electronic instructional documents. In addition to 
employing various NLP techniques including term 
extraction and shallow parsing, the program makes 
use of language resources such as a corpus and 
WordNet. The system generates test questions and 
distractors, offering the user the option to post-edit 
the test items.
