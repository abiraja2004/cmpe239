 
Recent research suggests that sentence 
structure can improve the accuracy of 
recognizing textual entailments and 
paraphrasing. Although background 
knowledge such as gazetteers, WordNet 
and custom built knowledge bases are 
also likely to improve performance, our 
goal in this paper is to characterize the 
syntactic features alone that aid in 
accurate entailment prediction. We 
describe candidate features, the role of 
machine learning, and two final decision 
rules. These rules resulted in an accuracy 
of 60.50 and 65.87% and average 
precision of 58.97 and 60.96% in 
RTE3Test and suggest that sentence 
structure alone can improve entailment 
accuracy by 9.25 to 14.62% over the 
baseline majority class.
