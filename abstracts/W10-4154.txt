 
This paper presents the HITSZ_CITYU 
system in the CIPS-SIGHAN bakeoff 
2010 Task 3, Chinese person name dis-
ambiguation. This system incorporates 
person name string recognition, person 
identity string recognition and an agglo-
merative hierarchical clustering for 
grouping the documents to each identical 
person. Firstly, for the given name index 
string, three segmentors are applied to 
segment the sentences having the index 
string into Chinese words, respectively. 
Their outputs are compared and analyzed. 
An unsupervised clustering is applied 
here to help the personal name recogni-
tion. The document set is then divided 
into subsets according to each recog-
nized person name string. Next, the sys-
tem identifies/extracts the person identity 
string from the sentences based on lex-
icon and heuristic rules. By incorporat-
ing the recognized person identity string, 
person name, organization name and 
contextual content words as features, an 
agglomerative hierarchical clustering is 
applied to group the similar documents 
in the document subsets to obtain the fi-
nal person name disambiguation results. 
Evaluations show that the proposed sys-
tem, which incorporates extraction and 
clustering technique, achieves encourag-
ing recall and good overall performance.
