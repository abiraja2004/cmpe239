Automatically determining the temporal order
of events and times in a text is difficult, though
humans can readily perform this task. Some-
times events and times are related through use
of an explicit co-ordination which gives infor-
mation about the temporal relation: expres-
sions like ?before? and ?as soon as?. We in-
vestigate the ro?le that these co-ordinating tem-
poral signals have in determining the type of
temporal relations in discourse. Using ma-
chine learning, we improve upon prior ap-
proaches to the problem, achieving over 80%
accuracy at labelling the types of temporal re-
lation between events and times that are re-
lated by temporal signals.
