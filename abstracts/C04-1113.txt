The paper presents a new way of accounting for
the meaning of verbs in natural languages, using
a diagrammatic notation based on the Unified
Modeling Language (UML). We will introduce
the new framework by outlining some model-
ing elements and indicating major differences
to the UML. An extended example will be dis-
cussed in more detail. We will then focus on
the cognitive background of the framework, and
in particular address the question why the usage
of graphical elements within a linguistic model-
ing language proves to be very fruitful. Finally,
we will briefly indicate the potential of the new
framework and its applicability.
