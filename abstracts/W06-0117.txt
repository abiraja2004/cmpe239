 
This paper presents two word segmenta-
tion (WS) systems and a named entity 
recognition (NER) system in France 
Telecom R&D Beijing. The one system 
of WS is for open tracks based on n-
gram language model and another one is 
for closed tracks based on maximum en-
tropy approach. The NER system uses a 
hybrid algorithm based on Class-based 
language model and rule-based knowl-
edge. These systems are all augmented 
with a set of post-processors.
