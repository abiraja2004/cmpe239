 
Interests to realize semantic frames data-
bases as a stable starting point in develop-
ing semantic knowledge based systems 
exists in countries such as Germany (the 
Salsa project), England (the PropBank pro-
ject), United States (the FrameNet project), 
Spain, Japan, etc. I thus propose to create a 
semantic frame database for Romanian, 
similar to the FrameNet database. Since 
creating language resources demands many 
temporal, financial and human resources, a 
possible solution could be the import of 
standardized annotation of a resource de-
veloped for a specific language to other 
languages. This paper presents such a 
method for the importing of the FrameNet 
annotation from English to Romanian.
