We propose a new integrated approach based on
Markov logic networks (MLNs), an effective com-
bination of probabilistic graphical models and first-
order logic for statistical relational learning, to ex-
tracting relations between entities in encyclopedic
articles from Wikipedia. The MLNs model en-
tity relations in a unified undirected graph col-
lectively using multiple features, including contex-
tual, morphological, syntactic, semantic as well as
Wikipedia characteristic features which can cap-
ture the essential characteristics of relation extrac-
tion task. This model makes simultaneous statisti-
cal judgments about the relations for a set of related
entities. More importantly, implicit relations can
also be identified easily. Our experimental results
showed that, this integrated probabilistic and logic
model significantly outperforms the current state-
of-the-art probabilistic model, Conditional Random
Fields (CRFs), for relation extraction from encyclo-
pedic articles.
