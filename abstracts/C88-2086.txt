 
/S0aanes 1979/provides some counterexamples to the theory of nat- 
ural language presuppositions that is presented in /Gazdar 1979/. 
/Soames 1982/ provides a theory which explains these eounterex- 
amples. /Mercer 1987/ rejects the solution found in/Soames 1982/ 
leaving these ounterexamples unexplained. By reappraising these in- 
sightful counterexamples, theinferential theory for natural language 
presuppositions described in/Mercer 1987, 1988/gives a simple and 
straightforward explanation for the presupposiitional nature of these 
sentences.
