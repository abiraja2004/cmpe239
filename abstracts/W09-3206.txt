Computing semantic relatedness of natural
language texts is a key component of tasks
such as information retrieval and sum-
marization, and often depends on knowl-
edge of a broad range of real-world con-
cepts and relationships. We address this
knowledge integration issue by comput-
ing semantic relatedness using person-
alized PageRank (random walks) on a
graph derived from Wikipedia. This pa-
per evaluates methods for building the
graph, including link selection strategies,
and two methods for representing input
texts as distributions over the graph nodes:
one based on a dictionary lookup, the
other based on Explicit Semantic Analy-
sis. We evaluate our techniques on stan-
dard word relatedness and text similarity
datasets, finding that they capture similar-
ity information complementary to existing
Wikipedia-based relatedness measures, re-
sulting in small improvements on a state-
of-the-art measure.
