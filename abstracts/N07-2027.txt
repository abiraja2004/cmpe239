We describe our linguistic rule-based tag-
ger IceTagger, and compare its tagging ac-
curacy to the TnT tagger, a state-of-the-
art statistical tagger, when tagging Ice-
landic, a morphologically complex lan-
guage. Evaluation shows that the average
tagging accuracy is 91.54% and 90.44%,
obtained by IceTagger and TnT, respec-
tively. When tag profile gaps in the lex-
icon, used by the TnT tagger, are filled
with tags produced by our morphological
analyser IceMorphy, TnT?s tagging accu-
racy increases to 91.18%.
