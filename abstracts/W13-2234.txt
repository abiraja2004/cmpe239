We propose a technique for improving
the quality of phrase-based translation
systems by creating synthetic translation
options?phrasal translations that are gen-
erated by auxiliary translation and post-
editing processes?to augment the de-
fault phrase inventory learned from par-
allel data. We apply our technique to
the problem of producing English deter-
miners when translating from Russian and
Czech, languages that lack definiteness
morphemes. Our approach augments the
English side of the phrase table using a
classifier to predict where English arti-
cles might plausibly be added or removed,
and then we decode as usual. Doing
so, we obtain significant improvements in
quality relative to a standard phrase-based
baseline and to a to post-editing complete
translations with the classifier.
