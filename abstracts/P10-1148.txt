 
Weblogs are a source of human activity know-
ledge comprising valuable information such as 
facts, opinions and personal experiences. In 
this paper, we propose a method for mining 
personal experiences from a large set of web-
logs. We define experience as knowledge em-
bedded in a collection of activities or events 
which an individual or group has actually un-
dergone. Based on an observation that expe-
rience-revealing sentences have a certain lin-
guistic style, we formulate the problem of de-
tecting experience as a classification task us-
ing various features including tense, mood, as-
pect, modality, experiencer, and verb classes. 
We also present an activity verb lexicon con-
struction method based on theories of lexical 
semantics. Our results demonstrate that the ac-
tivity verb lexicon plays a pivotal role among 
selected features in the classification perfor-
mance and shows that our proposed method 
outperforms the baseline significantly.
