Probabilistic models have been effective in re-
solving prepositional phrase attachment am-
biguity, but sparse data remains a significant
problem. We propose a solution based on
similarity-based smoothing, where the proba-
bility of new PPs is estimated with informa-
tion from similar examples generated using a
thesaurus. Three thesauruses are compared on
this task: two existing generic thesauruses and
a new specialist PP thesaurus tailored for this
problem. We also compare three smoothing
techniques for prepositional phrases. We find
that the similarity scores provided by the the-
saurus tend to weight distant neighbours too
highly, and describe a better score based on the
rank of a word in the list of similar words. Our
smoothing methods are applied to an existing
PP attachment model and we obtain significant
improvements over the baseline.
