 
Machine transliteration is an important Natu-
ral Language Processing task. This paper 
proposes a Noisy Channel Model for Graph-
eme-based machine transliteration. Moses, a 
phrase-based Statistical Machine Translation 
tool, is employed for the implementation of 
the system. Experiments are carried out on 
the NEWS 2009 Machine Transliteration 
Shared Task English-Chinese track. English-
Chinese back transliteration is studied as well.
