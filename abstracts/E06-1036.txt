Detection of discourse structure is crucial
in many text-based applications. This pa-
per presents an original framework for de-
scribing textual parallelism which allows
us to generalize various discourse phe-
nomena and to propose a unique method
to recognize them. With this prospect, we
discuss several methods in order to iden-
tify the most appropriate one for the prob-
lem, and evaluate them based on a manu-
ally annotated corpus.
