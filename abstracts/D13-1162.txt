The goal of our research is to distinguish vet-
erinary message board posts that describe a
case involving a specific patient from posts
that ask a general question. We create a text
classifier that incorporates automatically gen-
erated attribute lists for veterinary patients to
tackle this problem. Using a small amount of
annotated data, we train an information extrac-
tion (IE) system to identify veterinary patient
attributes. We then apply the IE system to a
large collection of unannotated texts to pro-
duce a lexicon of veterinary patient attribute
terms. Our experimental results show that us-
ing the learned attribute lists to encode pa-
tient information in the text classifier yields
improved performance on this task.
