In this paper, we describe the Argument Se-
lection and Coercion task, currently in devel-
opment for the SemEval-2 evaluation exercise
scheduled for 2010. This task involves char-
acterizing the type of compositional operation
that exists between a predicate and the argu-
ments it selects. Specifically, the goal is to
identify whether the type that a verb selects is
satisfied directly by the argument, or whether
the argument must change type to satisfy the
verb typing. We discuss the problem in detail
and describe the data preparation for the task.
