We describe an algorithm that relies on
web frequency counts to identify and correct
writing errors made by non-native writers of
English. Evaluation of the system on a real-
world ESL corpus showed very promising
performance on the very difficult problem of
critiquing English determiner use: 62% pre-
cision and 41% recall, with a false flag rate
of only 2% (compared to a random-guessing
baseline of 5% precision, 7% recall, and
more than 80% false flag rate). Performance
on collocation errors was less good, sug-
gesting that a web-based approach should be
combined with local linguistic resources to
achieve both effectiveness and efficiency.
