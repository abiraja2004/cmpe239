In multi-party conversations it may not al-
ways be obvious who is talking to whom.
Backchannels may provide a partial answer

with some other events, such as gaze behav-
iors of the interlocutors. We look at some
patterns in multi-party interaction relating
features of backchannel behaviours to as-
pects of the partipation framework.
