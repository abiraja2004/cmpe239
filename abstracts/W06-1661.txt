In this paper we describe and evaluate
several statistical models for the task of
realization ranking, i.e. the problem of
discriminating between competing surface
realizations generated for a given input se-
mantics. Three models (and several vari-
ants) are trained and tested: an n-gram
language model, a discriminative maxi-
mum entropy model using structural in-
formation (and incorporating the language
model as a separate feature), and finally an
SVM ranker trained on the same feature
set. The resulting hybrid tactical generator
is part of a larger, semantic transfer MT
system.
