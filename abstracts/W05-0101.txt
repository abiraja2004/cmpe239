In Fall 2004 I introduced a new course
called Applied Natural Language Process-
ing, in which students acquire an under-
standing of which text analysis techniques
are currently feasible for practical appli-
cations. The class was intended for in-
terdisciplinary students with a somewhat
technical background. This paper de-
scribes the topics covered and the pro-
gramming exercises, emphasizing which
aspects were successful and which prob-
lematic, and makes recommendations for
future versions of the course.
