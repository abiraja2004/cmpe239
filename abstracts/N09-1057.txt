Work on sentiment analysis often focuses on
the words and phrases that people use in
overtly opinionated text. In this paper, we in-
troduce a new approach to the problem that
focuses not on lexical indicators, but on the
syntactic ?packaging? of ideas, which is well
suited to investigating the identification of im-
plicit sentiment, or perspective. We establish a
strong predictive connection between linguis-
tically well motivated features and implicit
sentiment, and then show how computational
approximations of these features can be used
to improve on existing state-of-the-art senti-
ment classification results.
