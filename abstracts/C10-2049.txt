We introduce the novel problem of auto-
matic related work summarization. Given
multiple articles (e.g., conference/journal
papers) as input, a related work sum-
marization system creates a topic-biased
summary of related work specific to the
target paper. Our prototype Related Work
Summarization system, ReWoS, takes in
set of keywords arranged in a hierarchical
fashion that describes a target paper?s top-
ics, to drive the creation of an extractive
summary using two different strategies for
locating appropriate sentences for general
topics as well as detailed ones. Our initial
results show an improvement over generic
multi-document summarization baselines
in a human evaluation.
