Inspired by robust generalization and adver-
sarial learning we describe a novel approach
to learning structured perceptrons for part-of-
speech (POS) tagging that is less sensitive to
domain shifts. The objective of our method is
to minimize average loss under random distri-
bution shifts. We restrict the possible target
distributions to mixtures of the source distri-
bution and random Zipfian distributions. Our
algorithm is used for POS tagging and eval-
uated on the English Web Treebank and the
Danish Dependency Treebank with an average
4.4% error reduction in tagging accuracy.
