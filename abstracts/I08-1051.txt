We present a general approach to formally
modelling corpora with multi-layered anno-
tation, thereby inducing a lexicon model in a
typed logical representation language, OWL
DL. This model can be interpreted as a graph
structure that offers flexible querying func-
tionality beyond current XML-based query
languages and powerful methods for consis-
tency control. We illustrate our approach by
applying it to the syntactically and semanti-
cally annotated SALSA/TIGER corpus.
