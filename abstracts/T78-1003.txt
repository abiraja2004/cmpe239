 
A sentence (or other portion of discourse) is 
taken to evoke in the listener a meaning complex, 
here called a "cognitive representation". The lex- 
ical elements of the sentence, to simplify, by and 
large specify the content of the cognitive represen- 
tation, while the grammatical elements specify its 
structure. Thus, looking systematically at the 
actual notions specified by grammatical elements can 
give us a handle for ascertaining the very makeup of 
(l~nguistic-) cognitive structuring. We accordingly 
examine a number of grammatically specified notions, 
observe the categories and systems in which they 
pattern, and speculate on broader cognitive connec- 
tions. 
Some provisional findings have already emerged. 
Grammatical specifications for structure are prepon- 
derantly relat iv ist ic  or topological, and exclude the 
fixed or metrically Euclidean. The categories in 
which grammatical notions pattern include: 
plexity perspectival mode 
state of boundedness level of synthesis 
state of dividedness level of exemplarity 
degree of extensionality axial characteristics 
pattern of distribution scene-breakup " 
Grammatical specification of structuring appears to 
be the same, in certain abstract characteristics, as 
the structuring of visual perception.
