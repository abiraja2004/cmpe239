 
This is a pilot study which aims at the design of a 
Chinese morphological analyzer which is in state 
to predict the syntactic and semantic properties of 
nominal, verbal and adjectival compounds. 
Morphological structures of compound words 
contain the essential information of knowing their 
syntactic and semantic characteristics. In 
particular, morphological analysis is a primary 
step for predicting the syntactic and semantic 
categories of out-of-vocabulary (unknown) words. 
The designed Chinese morphological analyzer 
contains three major functions, 1) to segment a 
word into a sequence of morphemes, 2) to tag the 
part-of-speech of those morphemes, and 3) to 
identify the morpho-syntactic relation between 
morphemes. We propose a method of using 
associative strength among morphemes, 
morpho-syntactic patterns, and syntactic 
categories to solve the ambiguities of 
segmentation and part-of-speech. In our 
evaluation report, it is found that the accuracy of 
our analyzer is 81%. 5% errors are caused by the 
segmentation and 14% errors are due to 
part-of-speech. Once the internal information of a 
compound is known, it would be beneficial for the 
further researches of the prediction of a word 
meaning and its function.
