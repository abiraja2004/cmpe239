A set of labeled classes of instances is ex-
tracted from text and linked into an exist-
ing conceptual hierarchy. Besides a signif-
icant increase in the coverage of the class
labels assigned to individual instances, the
resulting resource of labeled classes is
more effective than similar data derived
from the manually-created Wikipedia, in
the task of attribute extraction over con-
ceptual hierarchies.
