One of the major challenges facing statistical
machine translation is how to model differ-
ences in word order between languages. Al-
though a great deal of research has focussed
on this problem, progress is hampered by the
lack of reliable metrics. Most current metrics
are based on matching lexical items in the
translation and the reference, and their abil-
ity to measure the quality of word order has
not been demonstrated. This paper presents
a novel metric, the LRscore, which explic-
itly measures the quality of word order by
using permutation distance metrics. We show
that the metric is more consistent with human
judgements than other metrics, including the
BLEU score. We also show that the LRscore
can successfully be used as the objective func-
tion when training translation model parame-
ters. Training with the LRscore leads to output
which is preferred by humans. Moreover, the
translations incur no penalty in terms of BLEU
scores.
