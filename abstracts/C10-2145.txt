This paper proposes a novel topic model,
Citation-Author-Topic (CAT) model that
addresses a semantic search task we define
as expert search ? given a research area as
a query, it returns names of experts in this
area. For example, Michael Collins would
be one of the top names retrieved given the
query Syntactic Parsing.
Our contribution in this paper is two-fold.
First, we model the cited author informa-
tion together with words and paper au-
thors. Such extra contextual information
directly models linkage among authors
and enhances the author-topic association,
thus produces more coherent author-topic
distribution. Second, we provide a prelim-
inary solution to the task of expert search
when the learning repository contains ex-
clusively research related documents au-
thored by the experts. When compared
with a previous proposed model (Johri
et al, 2010), the proposed model pro-
duces high quality author topic linkage
and achieves over 33% error reduction
evaluated by the standard MAP measure-
ment.
