 
There is an increasing need for document 
search mechanisms capable of matching a 
natural language query with documents 
written in a different language. Recently, we 
conducted several experiments aimed at 
comparing various methods of incorporating a 
cross-linguistic capability to existing 
information retrieval (IR) systems. Our results 
indicate that translating queries with off-the- 
shelf machine translation systems can result in 
relatively good performance. But the results 
also indicate that other methods can perfonn 
even better. More specifically, we tested a 
probabilistic translation model of the kind 
proposed by Brown & al. \[2\]. The parameters 
of that system had been estimated 
automatically on a different, unrelated, corpus 
of parallel texts. After we augmented it with a 
small bilingual dictionary, this probabilistic 
translation model outperformed machine 
translation systems on our cross-language IR 
task.
