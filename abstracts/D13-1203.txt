Classical coreference systems encode various
syntactic, discourse, and semantic phenomena
explicitly, using heterogenous features com-
puted from hand-crafted heuristics. In con-
trast, we present a state-of-the-art coreference
system that captures such phenomena implic-
itly, with a small number of homogeneous
feature templates examining shallow proper-
ties of mentions. Surprisingly, our features
are actually more effective than the corre-
sponding hand-engineered ones at modeling
these key linguistic phenomena, allowing us
to win ?easy victories? without crafted heuris-
tics. These features are successful on syntax
and discourse; however, they do not model
semantic compatibility well, nor do we see
gains from experiments with shallow seman-
tic features from the literature, suggesting that
this approach to semantics is an ?uphill bat-
tle.? Nonetheless, our final system1 outper-
forms the Stanford system (Lee et al (2011),
the winner of the CoNLL 2011 shared task)
by 3.5% absolute on the CoNLL metric and
outperforms the IMS system (Bjo?rkelund and
Farkas (2012), the best publicly available En-
glish coreference system) by 1.9% absolute.
