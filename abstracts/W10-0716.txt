 
Due to its complexity, meeting speech pro-
vides a challenge for both transcription and 
annotation. While Amazon?s Mechanical Turk 
(MTurk) has been shown to produce good re-
sults for some types of speech, its suitability 
for transcription and annotation of spontane-
ous speech has not been established. We find 
that MTurk can be used to produce high-
quality transcription and describe two tech-
niques for doing so (voting and corrective). 
We also show that using a similar approach, 
high quality annotations useful for summari-
zation systems can also be produced. In both 
cases, accuracy is comparable to that obtained 
using trained personnel.
