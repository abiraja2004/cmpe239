Chinese named entity recognition (NER) has re-
cently been viewed as a classification or sequence
labeling problem, and many approaches have been
proposed. However, they tend to address this
problem without considering linguistic informa-
tion in Chinese NEs. We propose a new framework
based on probabilistic graphical models with first-
order logic for Chinese NER. First, we use Condi-
tional Random Fields (CRFs), a standard and the-
oretically well-founded machine learning method
based on undirected graphical models as a base
system. Second, we introduce various types of
domain knowledge into Markov Logic Networks
(MLNs), an effective combination of first-order
logic and probabilistic graphical models for vali-
dation and error correction of entities. Experimen-
tal results show that our framework of probabilis-
tic graphical models with first-order logic signifi-
cantly outperforms the state-of-the-art models for
solving this task.
