This paper describes a probabilistic an-
swer selection framework for question an-
swering. In contrast with previous work
using individual resources such as ontolo-
gies and the Web to validate answer can-
didates, our work focuses on developing
a unified framework that not only uses
multiple resources for validating answer
candidates, but also considers evidence of
similarity among answer candidates in or-
der to boost the ranking of the correct an-
swer. This framework has been used to se-
lect answers from candidates generated by
four different answer extraction methods.
An extensive set of empirical results based
on TREC factoid questions demonstrates
the effectiveness of the unified framework.
