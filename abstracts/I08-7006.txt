In Myanmar language, sentences are
clearly delimited by a unique sentence
boundary marker but are written without
necessarily pausing between words with
spaces. It is therefore non-trivial to seg-
ment sentences into words. Word tokeniz-
ing plays a vital role in most Natural Lan-
guage Processing applications. We observe
that word boundaries generally align with
syllable boundaries. Working directly with
characters does not help. It is therefore
useful to syllabify texts first. Syllabification
is also a non-trivial task in Myanmar. We
have collected 4550 syllables from avail-
able sources . We have evaluated our syl-
lable inventory on 2,728 sentences spread
over 258 pages and observed a coverage of
99.96%. In the second part, we build word
lists from available sources such as dic-
tionaries, through the application of mor-
phological rules, and by generating syllable
n-grams as possible words and manually
checking. We have thus built list of 800,000
words including inflected forms. We have
tested our algorithm on a 5000 sentence
test data set containing a total of (35049
words) and manually checked for evaluat-
ing the performance. The program recog-
nized 34943 words of which 34633 words
were correct, thus giving us a Recall of
98.81%, a Precision of 99.11% and a F-
Measure is 98.95%.
