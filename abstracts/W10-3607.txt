 
In this paper we present a lightweight 
stemmer for Gujarati using a hybrid ap-
proach. Instead of using a completely 
unsupervised approach, we have har-
nessed linguistic knowledge in the form 
of a hand-crafted Gujarati suffix list in 
order to improve the quality of the stems 
and suffixes learnt during the training 
phase. We used the EMILLE corpus for 
training and evaluating the stemmer?s 
performance. The use of hand-crafted 
suffixes boosted the accuracy of our 
stemmer by about 17% and helped us 
achieve an accuracy of 67.86 %.
