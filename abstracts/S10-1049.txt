The automatic interpretation of semantic
relations between nominals is an impor-
tant subproblem within natural language
understanding applications and is an area
of increasing interest. In this paper, we
present the system we used to participate
in the SEMEVAL 2010 Task 8 Multi-Way
Classification of Semantic Relations be-
tween Pairs of Nominals. Our system,
based upon a Maximum Entropy classifier
trained using a large number of boolean
features, received the third highest score.
