Paraphrase recognition is a critical step for nat-
ural language interpretation. Accordingly, many
NLP applications would benefit from high coverage
knowledge bases of paraphrases. However, the scal-
ability of state-of-the-art paraphrase acquisition ap-
proaches is still limited. We present a fully unsuper-
vised learning algorithm for Web-based extraction
of entailment relations, an extended model of para-
phrases. We focus on increased scalability and gen-
erality with respect to prior work, eventually aiming
at a full scale knowledge base. Our current imple-
mentation of the algorithm takes as its input a verb
lexicon and for each verb searches the Web for re-
lated syntactic entailment templates. Experiments
show promising results with respect to the ultimate
goal, achieving much better scalability than prior
Web-based methods.
