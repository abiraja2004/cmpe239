Automatically clustering words from a mono-
lingual or bilingual training corpus into
classes is a widely used technique in statisti-
cal natural language processing. We present
a very simple and easy to implement method
for using these word classes to improve trans-
lation quality. It can be applied across differ-
ent machine translation paradigms and with
arbitrary types of models. We show its ef-
ficacy on a small German?English and a
larger French?German translation task with
both standard phrase-based and hierarchical
phrase-based translation systems for a com-
mon set of models. Our results show that with
word class models, the baseline can be im-
proved by up to 1.4% BLEU and 1.0% TER
on the French?German task and 0.3% BLEU
and 1.1% TER on the German?English task.
