 
In this paper 1 we present a new pars- 
ing algorithm for linear indexed grammars 
(LIGs) in the same spirit as the one de- 
scribed in (Vijay-Shanker and Weir, 1993) 
for tree adjoining grammars. For a LIG L 
and an input string x of length n, we build 
a non ambiguous context-free grammar 
whose sentences are all (and exclusively) 
valid derivation sequences in L which lead 
to x. We show that this grammar can 
be built in (9(n 6) time and that individ- 
ual parses can be extracted in linear time 
with the size of the extracted parse tree. 
Though this O(n 6) upper bound does not 
improve over previous results, the average 
case behaves much better. Moreover, prac- 
tical parsing times can be decreased by 
some statically performed computations.
