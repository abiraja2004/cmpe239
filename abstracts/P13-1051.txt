Paratactic syntactic structures are noto-
riously difficult to represent in depen-
dency formalisms. This has painful con-
sequences such as high frequency of pars-
ing errors related to coordination. In other
words, coordination is a pending prob-
lem in dependency analysis of natural lan-
guages. This paper tries to shed some
light on this area by bringing a system-
atizing view of various formal means de-
veloped for encoding coordination struc-
tures. We introduce a novel taxonomy of
such approaches and apply it to treebanks
across a typologically diverse range of 26
languages. In addition, empirical obser-
vations on convertibility between selected
styles of representations are shown too.
