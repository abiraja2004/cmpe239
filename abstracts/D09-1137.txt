 This paper connects two research areas: auto-matic tagging on the web and statistical key-phrase extraction. First, we analyze the quality of tags in a collaboratively created folksonomy using traditional evaluation techniques. Next, we demonstrate how documents can be tagged automatically with a state-of-the-art keyphrase extraction algorithm, and further improve per-formance in this new domain using a new al-gorithm, ?Maui?, that utilizes semantic infor-mation extracted from Wikipedia. Maui out-performs existing approaches and extracts tags that are competitive with those assigned by the best performing human taggers. 1
