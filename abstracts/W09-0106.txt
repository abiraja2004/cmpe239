In this position paper, I argue that in order
to create truly language-independent NLP
systems, we need to incorporate linguis-
tic knowledge. The linguistic knowledge
in question is not intricate rule systems,
but generalizations from linguistic typol-
ogy about the range of variation in linguis-
tic structures across languages.
