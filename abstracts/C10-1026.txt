This paper addresses two problems that
commonly arise in parsing with precision-
oriented, rule-based models of grammar:
lack of speed and lack of robustness. First,
we show how we can reduce parsing times
by restricting the number of tasks the
parser will carry out, based on a gener-
ative model of rule applications. Sec-
ond, we show that a combination of search
space restriction and radically overgen-
erating robustness rules lead to a more
robust parser, with only a small penalty
in precision. Applying both the robust-
ness rules and a fragment fallback strat-
egy showed better recall than just giving
fragment analyses, with equal precision.
Results are reported on a medium-sized
HPSG grammar for German. 1
