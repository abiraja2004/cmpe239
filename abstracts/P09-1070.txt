This paper presents a set of Bayesian
methods for automatically extending the
WORDNET ontology with new concepts
and annotating existing concepts with
generic property fields, or attributes. We
base our approach on Latent Dirichlet Al-
location and evaluate along two dimen-
sions: (1) the precision of the ranked
lists of attributes, and (2) the quality of
the attribute assignments to WORDNET
concepts. In all cases we find that the
principled LDA-based approaches outper-
form previously proposed heuristic meth-
ods, greatly improving the specificity of
attributes at each concept.
