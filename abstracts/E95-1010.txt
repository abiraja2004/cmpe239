 
Alignment methods based on byte-length 
comparisons of alignment blocks have been 
remarkably successful for aligning good 
translations from legislative transcriptions. 
For noisy translations in which the parallel 
text of a document has significant structural 
differences, byte-alignment methods often 
do not perform well. The Pan American 
Health Organization (PAHO) corpus is a 
series of articles that were first translated by 
machine methods and then improved by pro- 
fessional translators. Many of the Spanish 
PAHO texts do not share formatting conven- 
tions with the corresponding English docu- 
ments, refer to tables in stylistically different 
ways and contain extraneous information. A
method based on a dynamic programming 
framework, but using a decision criterion 
derived from a combination of byte-length 
ratio measures, hard matching of numbers, 
string comparisons and n-gram co-occur- 
rence matching substantially improves the 
performance of the alignment process.
