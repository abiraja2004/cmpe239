 
Relaxation labelling is an optimization 
technique used in many fields to solve 
constraint satisfael,ion problems. The al- 
gorithm finds a combination of values 
for a set of variables such that satis- 
fies -to the maximum possible degree- a 
set of given constraints. This paper de- 
scribes some experiments performed ap- 
plying it to POS tagging, and the results 
obtained, it also ponders the possibil- 
ity of applying it to Word Sense Disam- 
biguation.
