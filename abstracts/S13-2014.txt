This paper describes a system for temporal
processing of text, which participated in the
Temporal Evaluations 2013 campaign. The
system employs a number of machine learning
classifiers to perform the core tasks of: identi-
fication of time expressions and events, recog-
nition of their attributes, and estimation of
temporal links between recognized events and
times. The central feature of the proposed sys-
tem is temporal parsing ? an approach which
identifies temporal relation arguments (event-
event and event-timex pairs) and the semantic
label of the relation as a single decision.
