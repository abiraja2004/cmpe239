In this paper we propose a statistical pars-
ing technique that simultaneously iden-
tifies biomedical named-entities (NEs)
and extracts subcellular localization re-
lations for bacterial proteins from the
text in MEDLINE articles. We build
a parser that derives both syntactic and
domain-dependent semantic information
and achieves an F-score of 48.4% for the
relation extraction task. We then propose
a semi-supervised approach that incor-
porates noisy automatically labeled data
to improve the F-score of our parser to
83.2%. Our key contributions are: learn-
ing from noisy data, and building an an-
notated corpus that can benefit relation ex-
traction research.
