Supporting natural language input may
improve learning in intelligent tutoring
systems. However, interpretation errors
are unavoidable and require an effective
recovery policy. We describe an evaluation
of an error recovery policy in the BEE-
TLE II tutorial dialogue system and dis-
cuss how different types of interpretation
problems affect learning gain and user sat-
isfaction. In particular, the problems aris-
ing from student use of non-standard ter-
minology appear to have negative conse-
quences. We argue that existing strategies
for dealing with terminology problems are
insufficient and that improving such strate-
gies is important in future ITS research.
