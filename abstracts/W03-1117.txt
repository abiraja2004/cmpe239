Document clustering is an aggregation of 
related documents to a cluster based on the 
similarity evaluation task between documents and 
the representatives of clusters. Terms and their 
discriminating features of terms are the clue to 
the clustering and the discriminating features are 
based on the term and document frequencies. 
Feature selection method on the basis of 
frequency statistics has a limitation to the 
enhancement of the clustering algorithm because 
it does not consider the contents of the cluster 
objects. In this paper, we adopt a content-based 
analytic approach to refine the similarity 
computation and propose a keyword-based 
clustering algorithm. Experimental results show 
that content-based keyword weighting 
outperforms frequency-based weighting method.
