We present a new approach to relation ex-
traction that requires only a handful of train-
ing examples. Given a few pairs of named
entities known to exhibit or not exhibit a
particular relation, bags of sentences con-
taining the pairs are extracted from the web.
We extend an existing relation extraction
method to handle this weaker form of su-
pervision, and present experimental results
demonstrating that our approach can reliably
extract relations from web documents.
