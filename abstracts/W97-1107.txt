 
In foundational works of generative 
phonology it is claimed that subjects can 
reliably discriminate between possible but 
non-occurring words and words that could 
not be English. In this paper we examine the 
use of a pr0babilistic phonological parser for 
words to model experimentally-obtained 
judgements of the acceptability of a set of 
nonsense words. We compared various 
methods oft scoring the goodness of the parse 
as a predictor of acceptability. We found that 
the probability of the worst part is not the 
best score of acceptability, indicating that 
classical generative phonology and 
Optimality Theory miss an important fact, as 
these app\[oaches do not recognise a 
mechanism by which the frequency of well- 
formed parts may ameliorate the 
unacceptability of low-frequency parts. We 
argue that probabilistic generative grammars 
are demonstrably a more psychologically 
realistic model of phonological competence 
than standard generative phonology or 
Optimality Theory.
