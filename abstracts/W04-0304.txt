We present a general architecture for incremen-
tal interaction between modules in a speech-to-
intention continuous understanding dialogue sys-
tem. This architecture is then instantiated in the
form of an incremental parser which receives suit-
ability feedback on NP constituents from a refer-
ence resolution module. Oracle results indicate
that perfect NP suitability judgments can provide a
labelled-bracket error reduction of as much as 42%
and an efficiency improvement of 30%. Prelimi-
nary experiments in which the parser incorporates
feedback judgments based on the set of referents
found in the discourse context achieve a maximum
error reduction of 9.3% and efficiency gain of 4.6%.
The parser is also able to incrementally instantiate
the semantics of underspecified pronouns based on
matches from the discourse context. These results
suggest that the architecture holds promise as a plat-
form for incremental parsing supporting continuous
understanding.
