We are interested in contributing a small, publicly
available Urdu corpus of written text to the natu-
ral language processing community. The Urdu
text is stored in the Unicode character set, in its
native Arabic script, and marked up according to
the Corpus Encoding Standard (CES) XML Docu-
ment Type Definition (DTD). All the tags and
metadata are in English. To date, the corpus is
made entirely of data from British Broadcasting
Company?s (BBC) Urdu Web site, although we
plan to add data from other Urdu newspapers.
Upon completion, the corpus will consist mostly
of raw Urdu text marked up only to the paragraph
level so it can be used as input for natural lan-
guage processing (NLP) tasks. In addition, it will
be hand-tagged for parts of speech so the data can
be used to train and test NLP  tools.
