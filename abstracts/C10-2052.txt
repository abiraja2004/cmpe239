Choosing the right parameters for a word
sense disambiguation task is critical to
the success of the experiments. We ex-
plore this idea for prepositions, an of-
ten overlooked word class. We examine
the parameters that must be considered in
preposition disambiguation, namely con-
text, features, and granularity. Doing
so delivers an increased performance that
significantly improves over two state-of-
the-art systems, and shows potential for
improving other word sense disambigua-
tion tasks. We report accuracies of 91.8%
and 84.8% for coarse and fine-grained
preposition sense disambiguation, respec-
tively.
