We examine predicative adjectives as an unsu-
pervised criterion to extract subjective adjec-
tives. We do not only compare this criterion
with a weakly supervised extraction method
but also with gradable adjectives, i.e. another
highly subjective subset of adjectives that can
be extracted in an unsupervised fashion. In or-
der to prove the robustness of this extraction
method, we will evaluate the extraction with
the help of two different state-of-the-art senti-
ment lexicons (as a gold standard).
