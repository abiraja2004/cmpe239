Dynamic sentiment ambiguous
adjectives (DSAAs) like ?large, small,
high, low? pose a challenging task on
sentiment analysis. This paper proposes a
knowledge-based method to
automatically determine the semantic
orientation of DSAAs within context.
The task is reduced to sentiment
classification of target nouns, which we
refer to sentiment expectation instead of
semantic orientation widely used in
previous researches. We mine the Web
using lexico-syntactic patterns to infer
sentiment expectation of nouns, and then
exploit character-sentiment model to
reduce noises caused by the Web data.
At sentence level, our method achieves
promising result with an f-score of
78.52% that is substantially better than
baselines. At document level, our
method outperforms previous work in
sentiment classification of product
reviews.
