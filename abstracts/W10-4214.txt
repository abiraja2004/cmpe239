In the field of referring expression gener-
ation, while in the static domain both in-
trinsic and extrinsic evaluations have been
considered, extrinsic evaluation in the dy-
namic domain, such as in a situated col-
laborative dialog, has not been discussed
in depth. In a dynamic domain, a cru-
cial problem is that referring expressions
do not make sense without an appropriate
preceding dialog context. It is unrealistic
for an evaluation to simply show a human
evaluator the whole period from the be-
ginning of a dialog up to the time point
at which a referring expression is used.
Hence, to make evaluation feasible it is
indispensable to determine an appropriate
shorter context. In order to investigate the
context necessary to understand a referring
expression in a situated collaborative dia-
log, we carried out an experiment with 33
evaluators and a Japanese referring expres-
sion corpus. The results contribute to find-
ing the proper contexts for extrinsic evalu-
tion in dynamic domains.
