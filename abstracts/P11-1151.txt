This paper explores approaches to sentiment
classification of U.S. Congressional floor-
debate transcripts. Collective classification
techniques are used to take advantage of the
informal citation structure present in the de-
bates. We use a range of methods based on
local and global formulations and introduce
novel approaches for incorporating the outputs
of machine learners into collective classifica-
tion algorithms. Our experimental evaluation
shows that the mean-field algorithm obtains
the best results for the task, significantly out-
performing the benchmark technique.
