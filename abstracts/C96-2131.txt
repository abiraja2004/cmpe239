 
The paper describes an application-oriented 
system that corrects agreement errors. In order 
to correct a sentence with such errors, an ex- 
tended morphological structure is created 
which contains various grammatical forms of 
the words used in the sentence. For this struc- 
ture the bottom-up arsing is performed, and 
syntactic structures are found that contain 
minimal number of changes in comparison 
with the original sentence. Experiments with 
real sentences have shown promising results.
