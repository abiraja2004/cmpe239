 
A Question Answering (QA) system allows 
the user to ask questions in natural language 
and to obtain one or several answers. If 
compared with a classical IR engine like 
Google, what kind of key benefits QA bring 
to users and how to measure their distinctive 
performances. This is what we shall attempt 
here to determine, specially in providing a 
comparative weak and strong points table of 
each system, along with showing how QA 
systems, in particular our Qristal QA system, 
requires up two to six time less ?user effort?.
