Syntax-based Machine Translation systems
have recently become a focus of research
with much hope that they will outperform
traditional Phrase-Based Statistical Machine
Translation (PBSMT). Toward this goal, we
present a method for analyzing the mor-
phosyntactic content of language from an
Elicitation Corpus such as the one included in
the LDC?s upcoming LCTL language packs.
The presented method discovers a mapping
between morphemes and linguistically rele-
vant features. By providing this tool that
can augment structure-based MT models with
these rich features, we believe the discrimina-
tive power of current models can be improved.
We conclude by outlining how the resulting
output can then be used in inducing a mor-
phosyntactically feature-rich grammar for AV-
ENUE, a modern syntax-based MT system.
