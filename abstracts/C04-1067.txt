In this paper, we present a hybrid method
for Chinese and Japanese word segmentation.
Word-level information is useful for analysis
of known words, while character-level informa-
tion is useful for analysis of unknown words,
and the method utilizes both these two types
of information in order to effectively handle
known and unknown words. Experimental re-
sults show that this method achieves high over-
all accuracy in Chinese and Japanese word seg-
mentation.
