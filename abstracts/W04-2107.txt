 
This paper presents one of the main 
computerized resources of the research 
Laboratory ATILF (Analyse et traitement 
informatique de la langue fran?aise) available 
via the Web: the computerized dictionary 
TLFi (Tr?sor de la langue fran?aise 
informatis?). Its highly detailed XML 
structure (over 3,6 million tags) is powered by 
Stella: the extended capacities and 
potentialities of this software allows high level 
queries as well as hypernavigation through 
and between different databases.
