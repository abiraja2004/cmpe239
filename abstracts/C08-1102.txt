Supervised approaches to Word Sense Dis-
ambiguation (WSD) have been shown to
outperform other approaches but are ham-
pered by reliance on labeled training ex-
amples (the data acquisition bottleneck).
This paper presents a novel approach to the
automatic acquisition of labeled examples
for WSD which makes use of the Informa-
tion Retrieval technique of relevance feed-
back. This semi-supervised method gener-
ates additional labeled examples based on
existing annotated data. Our approach is
applied to a set of ambiguous terms from
biomedical journal articles and found to
significantly improve the performance of a
state-of-the-art WSD system.
