 
This paper presents a method for auto-
matic classification of semantic relations 
between nominals using Sequential 
Minimal Optimization. We participated 
in the four categories of SEMEVAL task 
4 (A: No Query, No Wordnet; B: Word-
Net, No Query; C: Query, No WordNet; 
D: WordNet and Query) and for all train-
ing datasets. Best scores were achieved 
in category B using a set of feature vec-
tors including lexical file numbers of 
nominals obtained from WordNet and a 
new feature WordNet Vector designed 
for the task1.
