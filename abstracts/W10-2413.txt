This paper presents modeling of translit-
eration as a phrase-based machine transla-
tion system. We used a popular phrase-
based machine translation system for
English-Hindi machine transliteration. We
have achieved an accuracy of 38.1% on the
test set. We used some basic rules to mod-
ulate the existing phrased-based transliter-
ation system. Our experiments show that
phrase-based machine translation systems
can be adopted by modulating the system
to fit the transliteration problem.
