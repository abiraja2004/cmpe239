In this paper, we describe our system1
for CIPS-SIGHAN-2010 bake-off task of
Chinese word segmentation, which fo-
cused on the cross-domain performance
of Chinese word segmentation algorithms.
We use the online passive-aggressive al-
gorithm with domain invariant informa-
tion for cross-domain Chinese word seg-
mentation.
