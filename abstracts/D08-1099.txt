This paper explores the use of set expan-
sion (SE) to improve question answering (QA)
when the expected answer is a list of entities
belonging to a certain class. Given a small
set of seeds, SE algorithms mine textual re-
sources to produce an extended list including
additional members of the class represented
by the seeds. We explore the hypothesis that
a noise-resistant SE algorithm can be used to
extend candidate answers produced by a QA
system and generate a new list of answers that
is better than the original list produced by the
QA system. We further introduce a hybrid ap-
proach which combines the original answers
from the QA system with the output from the
SE algorithm. Experimental results for several
state-of-the-art QA systems show that the hy-
brid system performs better than the QA sys-
tems alone when tested on list question data
from past TREC evaluations.
