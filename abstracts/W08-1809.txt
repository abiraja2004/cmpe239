The method of Topic Indexing and Re-
trieval for QA persented in this paper
enables fast and efficent QA for ques-
tions with named entity answers. This is
achieved by identifying all possible named
entity answers in a corpus off-line and
gathering all possible evidence for their di-
rect retrieval as answer candidates using
standard IR techniques. An evaluation of
this method on 377 TREC questions pro-
duced a score of 0.342 in Accuracy and
0.413 in Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR).
