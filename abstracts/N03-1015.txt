 
Manually constructing an inventory of word 
senses has suffered from problems including 
high cost, arbitrary assignment of meaning to 
words, and mismatch to domains. To over-
come these problems, we propose a method 
to assign word meaning from a bilingual 
comparable corpus and a bilingual dictionary. 
It clusters second-language translation 
equivalents of a first-language target word on 
the basis of their translingually aligned dis-
tribution patterns. Thus it produces a hierar-
chy of corpus-relevant meanings of the target 
word, each of which is defined with a set of 
translation equivalents. The effectiveness of 
the method has been demonstrated through an 
experiment using a comparable corpus con-
sisting of Wall Street Journal and Nihon Kei-
zai Shimbun corpora together with the EDR 
bilingual dictionary.
