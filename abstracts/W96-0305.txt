 
This paper describes a heuristic algorithm capable of automatically assigning a label to 
each of the senses in a machine readable dictionary (MRD) for the purpose of acquiring a com- 
putational-semantic lexicon for treatment of lexical ambiguity. Including these labels in the 
MRD-based lexical database offers several positive ffects. The labels can be used as a coarser 
sense division so unnecessarily fine sense distinction can be avoided in word sense disambigu- 
ation (WSD).The algorithm is based primarily on simple word matching between an MRD defi- 
nition sentence and word lists of an LLOCE topic. We also describe an implementation f the 
algorithm for labeling definition sentences in Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English 
(LDOCE). For this purpose the topics and sets of related words in Longman Lexicon of Con- 
temporary English (LLOCE) are used in this work. Quantitative r sults for a 12-word test set 
are reported. Our discussion entails how the availability of these labels provides the means for 
treating such problems as: acquisition of a lexicon capable of providing broad coverage, sys- 
tematic word sense shifts, lexical underspecification, and acquisition of zero-derivatives.
