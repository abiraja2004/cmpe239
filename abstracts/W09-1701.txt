In this paper, a framework for acquiring com-
mon sense knowledge from the Web is pre-
sented. Common sense knowledge includes
information about the world that humans use
in their everyday lives. To acquire this knowl-
edge, relationships between nouns are re-
trieved by using search phrases with automat-
ically filled constituents. Through empirical
analysis of the acquired nouns over Word-
Net, probabilities are produced for relation-
ships between a concept and a word rather
than between two words. A specific goal of
our acquisition method is to acquire knowl-
edge that can be successfully applied to NLP
problems. We test the validity of the acquired
knowledge by means of an application to the
problem of word sense disambiguation. Re-
sults show that the knowledge can be used to
improve the accuracy of a state of the art un-
supervised disambiguation system.
