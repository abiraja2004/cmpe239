In this paper we investigate the theoretical
causes of the disparity between the theo-
retical and practical running times for the
A? algorithm proposed in Corlett and Penn
(2010) for deciphering letter-substitution
ciphers. We argue that the difference seen
is due to the relatively low entropies of the
probability distributions of character tran-
sitions seen in natural language, and we
develop a principled way of incorporat-
ing entropy into our complexity analysis.
Specifically, we find that the low entropy
of natural languages can allow us, with
high probability, to bound the depth of the
heuristic values expanded in the search.
This leads to a novel probabilistic bound
on search depth in these tasks.
