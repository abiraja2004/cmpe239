This study investigates whether some
speech recognition (SR) errors are eas-
ier to detect and what patterns can be
identified from those errors. Specifically,
SR errors were examined from both non-
linguistic and linguistic perspectives. The
analyses of non-linguistic properties re-
vealed that high error ratios and consecu-
tive errors lowered the ease of error detec-
tion. The analyses of linguistic properties
showed that ease of error detection was as-
sociated with changing parts-of-speech of
reference words in SR errors. Addition-
ally, syntactic relations themselves and the
change of syntactic relations had impact
on the ease of error detection.
