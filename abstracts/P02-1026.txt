We present a constancy rate princi-
ple governing language generation. We
show that this principle implies that lo-
cal measures of entropy (ignoring con-
text) should increase with the sentence
number. We demonstrate that this is
indeed the case by measuring entropy
in three dierent ways. We also show
that this eect has both lexical (which
words are used) and non-lexical (how
the words are used) causes.
