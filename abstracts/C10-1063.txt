Sense annotation and lexicon building are
costly affairs demanding prudent invest-
ment of resources. Recent work on mul-
tilingual WSD has shown that it is possi-
ble to leverage the annotation work done
for WSD of one language (SL) for another
(TL), by projecting Wordnet and sense
marked corpus parameters of SL to TL.
However, this work does not take into ac-
count the cost of manually cross-linking
the words within aligned synsets. Further,
it does not answer the question of ?Can
better accuracy be achieved if a user is
willing to pay additional money?? We
propose a measure for cost-benefit analy-
sis which measures the ?value for money?
earned in terms of accuracy by invest-
ing in annotation effort and lexicon build-
ing. Two key ideas explored in this pa-
per are (i) the use of probabilistic cross-
linking model to reduce manual cross-
linking effort and (ii) the use of selective
sampling to inject a few training examples
for hard-to-disambiguate words from the
target language to boost the accuracy.
