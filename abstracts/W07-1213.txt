 
In the paper, we describe methods for 
exploitation of a new lexical database of 
valency frames (VerbaLex) in relation to 
Transparent Intensional Logic (TIL). We 
present a detailed description of the 
Complex Valency Frames (CVF) as they 
appear in VerbaLex including basic 
ontology of the VerbaLex semantic roles. 
TIL is a typed logical system developed for 
natural language semantic representation 
using TIL logical forms known as 
constructions. TIL is well suited to handle 
the difficult language phenomena such as 
temporal relations, intensionality and 
propositional attitudes. Here we make use 
of the long-term development of the 
Normal Translation Algorithm aimed at 
automatic translation of natural language 
sentences into TIL constructions. 
We examine the relations between CVFs 
and TIL constructions of predicate-
argument structures and discuss the 
procedure of automatic acquisition of the 
verbal object constructions. The 
exploitation of CVFs in the syntactic 
parsing is also briefly mentioned.
