We address the problem of smoothing trans-
lation probabilities in a bilingual N-gram-
based statistical machine translation system.
It is proposed to project the bilingual tuples
onto a continuous space and to estimate the
translation probabilities in this representa-
tion. A neural network is used to perform the
projection and the probability estimation.
Smoothing probabilities is most important
for tasks with a limited amount of training
material. We consider here the BTEC task
of the 2006 IWSLT evaluation. Improve-
ments in all official automatic measures are
reported when translating from Italian to En-
glish. Using a continuous space model for
the translation model and the target language
model, an improvement of 1.5 BLEU on the
test data is observed.
