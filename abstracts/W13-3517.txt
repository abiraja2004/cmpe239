Coreference resolution systems can benefit
greatly from inclusion of global context,
and a number of recent approaches have
demonstrated improvements when precom-
puting an alignment to external knowledge
sources. However, since alignment itself
is a challenging task and is often noisy, ex-
isting systems either align conservatively,
resulting in very few links, or combine the
attributes of multiple candidates, leading
to a conflation of entities. Our approach
instead performs joint inference between
within-document coreference and entity
linking, maintaining ranked lists of candi-
date entities that are dynamically merged
and reranked during inference. Further, we
incorporate a large set of surface string vari-
ations for each entity by using anchor texts
from the web that link to the entity. These
forms of global context enables our system
to improve classifier-based coreference by
1.09 B3 F1 points, and improve over the
previous state-of-art by 0.41 points, thus
introducing a new state-of-art result on the
ACE 2004 data.
