 
This paper describes a language-independent, 
scalable system for both challenges of cross-
document co-reference: name variation and 
entity disambiguation. We provide system re-
sults from the ACE 2008 evaluation in both 
English and Arabic. Our English system?s ac-
curacy is 8.4% relative better than an exact 
match baseline (and 14.2% relative better over 
entities mentioned in more than one docu-
ment). Unlike previous evaluations, ACE 
2008 evaluated both name variation and entity 
disambiguation over naturally occurring 
named mentions.  An information extraction 
engine finds document entities in text. We de-
scribe how our architecture designed for the 
10K document ACE task is scalable to an 
even larger corpus.  Our cross-document ap-
proach uses the names of entities to find an 
initial set of document entities that could refer 
to the same real world entity and then uses an 
agglomerative clustering algorithm to disam-
biguate the potentially co-referent document 
entities. We analyze how different aspects of 
our system affect performance using ablation 
studies over the English evaluation set. In ad-
dition to evaluating cross-document co-
reference performance, we used the results of 
the cross-document system to improve the ac-
curacy of within-document extraction, and 
measured the impact in the ACE 2008 within-
document evaluation.
