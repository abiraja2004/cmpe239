We extend Combinatory Categorial Grammar
(CCG) with a generalized notion of multi-
dimensional sign, inspired by the types of rep-
resentations found in constraint-based frame-
works like HPSG or LFG. The generalized
sign allows multiple levels to share information,
but only in a resource-bounded way through
a very restricted indexation mechanism. This
improves representational perspicuity without
increasing parsing complexity, in contrast to
full-blown unification used in HPSG and LFG.
Well-formedness of a linguistic expressions re-
mains entirely determined by the CCG deriva-
tion. We show how the multidimensionality
and perspicuity of the generalized signs lead to
a simplification of previous CCG accounts of
how word order and prosody can realize infor-
mation structure.
