As the amount of spoken communications ac-
cessible by computers increases, searching and
browsing is becoming crucial for utilizing such
material for gathering information. It is desir-
able for multimedia content analysis systems
to handle various formats of data and to serve
varying user needs while presenting a simple
and consistent user interface. In this paper,
we present a research system for searching and
browsing spoken communications. The system
uses core technologies such as speaker segmen-
tation, automatic speech recognition, transcrip-
tion alignment, keyword extraction and speech
indexing and retrieval to make spoken commu-
nications easy to navigate. The main focus is
on telephone conversations and teleconferences
with comparisons to broadcast news.
