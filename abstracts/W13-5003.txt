WordNet, a widely used sense inventory for
Word Sense Disambiguation(WSD), is often
too fine-grained for many Natural Language
applications because of its narrow sense dis-
tinctions. We present a semi-supervised ap-
proach to learn similarity between WordNet
synsets using a graph based recursive sim-
ilarity definition. We seed our framework
with sense similarities of all the word-sense
pairs, learnt using supervision on human-
labelled sense clusterings. Finally we discuss
our method to derive coarse sense invento-
ries at arbitrary granularities and show that the
coarse-grained sense inventory obtained sig-
nificantly boosts the disambiguation of nouns
on standard test sets.
