. This paper explores two linguistically motivated restrictions on the
set of words used for topic tracking on newspaper articles: named entities and
headline words. We assume that named entities is one of the linguistic features
for topic tracking, since both topic and event are related to a specific place and
time in a story. The basic idea to use headline words for the tracking task is that
headline is a compact representation of the original story, which helps people to
quickly understand the most important information contained in a story. Head-
line words are automatically generated using headline generation technique. The
method was tested on the Mainichi Shimbun Newspaper in Japanese, and the re-
sults of topic tracking show that the system works well even for a small number
of positive training data.
