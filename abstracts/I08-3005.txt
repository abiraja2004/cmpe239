 
Collective intelligence is the capability for 
a group of people to collaborate in order to 
achieve goals in a complex context than its 
individual member. This common concept 
increases topic of interest in many sciences 
including computer science where com-
puters are bring about as group support 
elements. This paper presents a new plat-
form, called Knowledge Unifying Initiator 
(KUI) for knowledge development which 
enables connection and collaboration 
among individual intelligence in order to 
accomplish a complex mission. KUI is a 
platform to unify the various thoughts fol-
lowing the process of thinking, i.e., initiat-
ing the topic of interest, collecting the 
opinions to the selected topics, localizing 
the opinions through the translation or cus-
tomization and posting for public hearing 
to conceptualize the knowledge. The proc-
ess of thinking is done under the selectional 
preference simulated by voting mechanism 
in case that many alternatives occur. By 
measuring the history of participation of 
each member, KUI adaptively manages the 
reliability of each member?s opinion and 
vote according to the estimated Ex-
pertScore.
