Planning-based approaches to reference
provide a uniform treatment of linguistic
decisions, from content selection to lexi-
cal choice. In this paper, we show how
the issues of lexical ambiguity, vague-
ness, unspecific descriptions, ellipsis, and
the interaction of subsective modifiers can
be expressed using a belief-state plan-
ner modified to support context-dependent
actions. Because the number of dis-
tinct denotations it searches grows doubly-
exponentially with the size of the refer-
ential domain, we present representational
and search strategies that make generation
and interpretation tractable.
