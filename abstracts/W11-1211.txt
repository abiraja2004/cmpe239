 
In this paper, we question the 
homogeneity of a large parallel corpus 
by measuring the similarity between 
various sub-parts. We compare results 
obtained using a general measure of 
lexical similarity based on ?2 and by 
counting the number of discourse 
connectives. We argue that discourse 
connectives provide a more sensitive 
measure, revealing differences that are 
not visible with the general measure. We 
also provide evidence for the existence 
of specific characteristics defining 
translated texts as opposed to non-
translated ones, due to a universal 
tendency for explicitation.
