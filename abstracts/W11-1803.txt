This paper presents the preparation, resources,
results and analysis of the Epigenetics and
Post-translational Modifications (EPI) task, a
main task of the BioNLP Shared Task 2011.
The task concerns the extraction of detailed
representations of 14 protein and DNA modifi-
cation events, the catalysis of these reactions,
and the identification of instances of negated
or speculatively stated event instances. Seven
teams submitted final results to the EPI task in
the shared task, with the highest-performing
system achieving 53% F-score in the full task
and 69% F-score in the extraction of a simpli-
fied set of core event arguments.
