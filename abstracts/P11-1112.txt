In this paper we describe an unsupervised
method for semantic role induction which
holds promise for relieving the data acqui-
sition bottleneck associated with supervised
role labelers. We present an algorithm that it-
eratively splits and merges clusters represent-
ing semantic roles, thereby leading from an
initial clustering to a final clustering of bet-
ter quality. The method is simple, surpris-
ingly effective, and allows to integrate lin-
guistic knowledge transparently. By com-
bining role induction with a rule-based com-
ponent for argument identification we obtain
an unsupervised end-to-end semantic role la-
beling system. Evaluation on the CoNLL
2008 benchmark dataset demonstrates that
our method outperforms competitive unsuper-
vised approaches by a wide margin.
