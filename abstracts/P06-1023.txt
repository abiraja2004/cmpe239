This paper describes a parser which gen-
erates parse trees with empty elements in
which traces and fillers are co-indexed.
The parser is an unlexicalized PCFG
parser which is guaranteed to return the
most probable parse. The grammar is
extracted from a version of the PENN
treebank which was automatically anno-
tated with features in the style of Klein
and Manning (2003). The annotation in-
cludes GPSG-style slash features which
link traces and fillers, and other features
which improve the general parsing accu-
racy. In an evaluation on the PENN tree-
bank (Marcus et al, 1993), the parser
outperformed other unlexicalized PCFG
parsers in terms of labeled bracketing f-
score. Its results for the empty cate-
gory prediction task and the trace-filler co-
indexation task exceed all previously re-
ported results with 84.1% and 77.4% f-
score, respectively.
