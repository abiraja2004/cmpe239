We use machine learners trained on a combina-
tion of acoustic confidence and pragmatic plausi-
bility features computed from dialogue context to
predict the accuracy of incoming n-best recogni-
tion hypotheses to a spoken dialogue system. Our
best results show a 25% weighted f-score improve-
ment over a baseline system that implements a
?grammar-switching? approach to context-sensitive
speech recognition.
