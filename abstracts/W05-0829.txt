This article describes the competitive
grouping algorithm at the core of our Inte-
grated Segmentation and Alignment (ISA)
model. ISA extracts phrase pairs from a
bilingual corpus without requiring the pre-
calculated word alignment as many other
phrase alignment models do. Experiments
conducted within the WPT-05 shared task
on statistical machine translation demon-
strate the simplicity and effectiveness of
this approach.
