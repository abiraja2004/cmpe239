In this paper, we describe a sentence po-
sition based summarizer that is built based
on a sentence position policy, created from
the evaluation testbed of recent summariza-
tion tasks at Document Understanding Con-
ferences (DUC). We show that the summa-
rizer thus built is able to outperform most sys-
tems participating in task focused summariza-
tion evaluations at Text Analysis Conferences
(TAC) 2008. Our experiments also show that
such a method would perform better at pro-
ducing short summaries (upto 100 words) than
longer summaries. Further, we discuss the
baselines traditionally used for summarization
evaluation and suggest the revival of an old
baseline to suit the current summarization task
at TAC: the Update Summarization task.
