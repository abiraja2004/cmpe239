We present two systems that pick the ten
most appropriate substitutes for a marked
word in a test sentence. The first system
scores candidates based on how frequently
their local contexts match that of the marked
word. The second system, an enhancement
to the first, incorporates cosine similarity us-
ing unigram features. The core of both sys-
tems bypasses intermediate sense selection.
Our results show that a knowledge-light, di-
rect method for scoring potential replace-
ments is viable.
