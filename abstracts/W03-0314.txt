We present an unsupervised extraction of
sequence-to-sequence correspondences from
parallel corpora by sequential pattern mining.
The main characteristics of our method are
two-fold. First, we propose a systematic way
to enumerate all possible translation pair can-
didates of rigid and gapped sequences without
falling into combinatorial explosion. Second,
our method uses an efficient data structure and
algorithm for calculating frequencies in a con-
tingency table for each translation pair candi-
date. Our method is empirically evaluated us-
ing English-Japanese parallel corpora of 6 mil-
lion words. Results indicate that it works well
for multi-word translations, giving 56-84% ac-
curacy at 19% token coverage and 11% type
coverage.
