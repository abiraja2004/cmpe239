 
In the framework of contextual information 
retrieval in the biomedical domain, this paper 
reports on the automatic detection of disease 
concepts in two genres of biomedical text: 
sentences from the literature and PubMed user 
queries. A statistical model and a Natural 
Language Processing algorithm for disease 
recognition were applied on both corpora. 
While both methods show good performance 
(F=77% vs. F=76%) on the sentence corpus, 
results on the query corpus indicate that the 
statistical model is more robust (F=74% vs. 
F=70%).
