 
This paper 1  presents an empirical ap-
proach to mining parallel corpora. Con-
ventional approaches use a readily 
available collection of comparable, non-
parallel corpora to extract parallel sen-
tences. This paper attempts the much 
more challenging task of directly search-
ing for high-quality sentence pairs from 
the Web. We tackle the problem by 
formulating good search query using 
?Learning to Rank? and by filtering 
noisy document pairs using IBM Model 
1 alignment. End-to-end evaluation 
shows that the proposed approach sig-
nificantly improves the performance of 
statistical machine translation.
