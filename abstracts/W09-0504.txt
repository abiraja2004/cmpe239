 
Being confronted with spontaneous 
speech, our current annotation scheme 
requires alterations that would reflect the 
abundant use of non-sentential fragments 
with clausal meaning tightly connected to 
their context, which do not systematically 
occur in written texts. The purpose of this 
paper is to list the common patterns of 
non-sentential fragments and their con-
texts and to find a smooth resolution of 
their semantic annotation.
