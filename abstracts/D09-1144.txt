This paper presents an approach to au-
tomatic acquisition of the argument-
predicate relations from a semantically
annotated corpus. We use SALSA, a
German newspaper corpus manually an-
notated with role-semantic information
based on frame semantics. Since the rel-
atively small size of SALSA does not al-
low to estimate the semantic relatedness
in the extracted argument-predicate pairs,
we use a larger corpus for ranking. Two
experiments have been performed in or-
der to evaluate the proposed approach.
In the first experiment we compare au-
tomatically extracted argument-predicate
relations with the gold standard formed
from associations provided by human sub-
jects. In the second experiment we cal-
culate correlation between automatic relat-
edness measure and human ranking of the
extracted relations.
