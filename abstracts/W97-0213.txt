 
In this position paper, we make several 
observations about the state of the art in 
automatic word sense disambiguation. Mo- 
tivated by these observations, we offer sev- 
eral specific proposals to the community re- 
garding improved evaluation criteria, com- 
mon training and testing resources, and the 
definition of sense inventories.
