Our system treats coreference resolution as
an integer linear programming (ILP) problem.
Extending Denis and Baldridge (2007) and
Finkel andManning (2008)?s work, we exploit
loose transitivity constraints on coreference
pairs. Instead of enforcing transitivity closure
constraints, which brings O(n3) complexity,
we employ a strategy to reduce the number
of constraints without large performance de-
crease, i.e., eliminating coreference pairs with
probability below a threshold . Experimental
results show that it achieves a better perfor-
mance than pairwise classifiers.
