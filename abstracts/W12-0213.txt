 
The principal goal of this paper is to illustrate various ways in which phylogenetic tools can advantageously be put to use in investigating and visualizing the relationships of creole languages to other languages, both creoles and non-creoles. After introducing a test study on the English-based creoles, the major theories seeking to explain the emergence and development of creoles will be reviewed and assessed. The final part of the paper is concerned with the typological status of creoles, where various samples will be used to show that creoles form a typologically coherent group among the world's languages.
