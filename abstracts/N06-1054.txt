We describe finite-state constraint relaxation, a method for ap-
plying global constraints, expressed as automata, to sequence
model decoding. We present algorithms for both hard con-
straints and binary soft constraints. On the CoNLL-2004 se-
mantic role labeling task, we report a speedup of at least 16x
over a previous method that used integer linear programming.
