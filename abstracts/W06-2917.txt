We present a simple context-free gram-
matical inference algorithm, and prove
that it is capable of learning an inter-
esting subclass of context-free languages.
We also demonstrate that an implementa-
tion of this algorithm is capable of learn-
ing auxiliary fronting in polar interroga-
tives (AFIPI) in English. This has been
one of the most important test cases in
language acquisition over the last few
decades. We demonstrate that learning
can proceed even in the complete absence
of examples of particular constructions,
and thus that debates about the frequency
of occurrence of such constructions are ir-
relevant. We discuss the implications of
this on the type of innate learning biases
that must be hypothesized to explain first
language acquisition.
