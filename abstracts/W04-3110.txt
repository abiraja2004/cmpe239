In this paper we discuss the design, implemen-
tation, and use of Termino, a large scale termi-
nological resource for text processing. Dealing
with terminology is a difficult but unavoidable
task for language processing applications, such
as Information Extraction in technical domains.
Complex, heterogeneous information must be
stored about large numbers of terms. At the
same time term recognition must be performed
in realistic times. Termino attempts to recon-
cile this tension by maintaining a flexible, ex-
tensible relational database for storing termino-
logical information and compiling finite state
machines from this database to do term look-
up. While Termino has been developed for
biomedical applications, its general design al-
lows it to be used for term processing in any
domain.
