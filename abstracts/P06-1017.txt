Shortage of manually labeled data is an
obstacle to supervised relation extraction
methods. In this paper we investigate a
graph based semi-supervised learning al-
gorithm, a label propagation (LP) algo-
rithm, for relation extraction. It represents
labeled and unlabeled examples and their
distances as the nodes and the weights of
edges of a graph, and tries to obtain a la-
beling function to satisfy two constraints:
1) it should be fixed on the labeled nodes,
2) it should be smooth on the whole graph.
Experiment results on the ACE corpus
showed that this LP algorithm achieves
better performance than SVM when only
very few labeled examples are available,
and it also performs better than bootstrap-
ping for the relation extraction task.
