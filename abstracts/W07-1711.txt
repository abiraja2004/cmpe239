We describe a study that evaluates an ap-
proach to Word Sense Discrimination on
three languages with different linguistic
structures, English, Hebrew, and Russian.
The goal of the study is to determine
whether there are significant performance
differences for the languages and to iden-
tify language-specific problems. The algo-
rithm is tested on semantically ambiguous
words using data from Wikipedia, an online
encyclopedia. We evaluate the induced clus-
ters against sense clusters created manually.
The results suggest a correlation between the
algorithm?s performance and morphological
complexity of the language. In particular,
we obtain FScores of 0.68 , 0.66 and 0.61 for
English, Hebrew, and Russian, respectively.
Moreover, we perform an experiment on
Russian, in which the context terms are lem-
matized. The lemma-based approach signif-
icantly improves the results over the word-
based approach, by increasing the FScore by
16%. This result demonstrates the impor-
tance of morphological analysis for the task
for morphologically rich languages like Rus-
sian.
