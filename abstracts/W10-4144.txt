Discriminative parse reranking has been
shown to be an effective technique to im-
prove the generative parsing models. In
this paper, we present a series of exper-
iments on parsing the Tsinghua Chinese
Treebank with hierarchically split-merge
grammars and reranked with a perceptron-
based discriminative model. In addition to
the homogeneous annotation on TCT, we
also incorporate the PCTB-based parsing
result as heterogeneous annotation into
the reranking feature model. The rerank-
ing model achieved 1.12% absolute im-
provement on F1 over the Berkeley parser
on a development set. The head labels in
Task 2.1 are annotated with a sequence
labeling model. The system achieved
80.32 (B+C+H F1) in CIPS-SIGHAN-
2010 Task 2.1 (Open Track) and 76.11
(Overall F1) in Task 2.2 (Open Track)1.
