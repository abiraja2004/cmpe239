We describe an unusual data set of thou-
sands of annotated images with interest-
ing sense phenomena. Natural language
image sense annotation involves increased
semantic complexities compared to dis-
ambiguating word senses when annotating
text. These issues are discussed and illus-
trated, including the distinction between
word senses and iconographic senses.
