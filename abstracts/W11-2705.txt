Linguistic patterns reflect the regularities of
Natural Language and their applicability is
acknowledged in several Natural Language
Processing tasks. Particularly, in the task of
Question Generation, many systems depend
on patterns to generate questions from text.
The approach we follow relies on patterns
that convey lexical, syntactic and semantic in-
formation, automatically learned from large-
scale corpora.
In this paper we discuss the impact of varying
several parameters during pattern learning and
matching in the Question Generation task. In
particular, we introduce semantics (by means
of named entities) in our lexico-syntactic pat-
terns. We evaluate and compare the number
and quality of the learned patterns and the
matched text segments. Also, we detail the
influence of the patterns in the generation of
natural language questions.
