In this paper, we present a new learning
scenario, heterogeneous transfer learn-
ing, which improves learning performance
when the data can be in different feature
spaces and where no correspondence be-
tween data instances in these spaces is pro-
vided. In the past, we have classified Chi-
nese text documents using English train-
ing data under the heterogeneous trans-
fer learning framework. In this paper,
we present image clustering as an exam-
ple to illustrate how unsupervised learning
can be improved by transferring knowl-
edge from auxiliary heterogeneous data
obtained from the social Web. Image
clustering is useful for image sense dis-
ambiguation in query-based image search,
but its quality is often low due to image-
data sparsity problem. We extend PLSA
to help transfer the knowledge from social
Web data, which have mixed feature repre-
sentations. Experiments on image-object
clustering and scene clustering tasks show
that our approach in heterogeneous trans-
fer learning based on the auxiliary data is
indeed effective and promising.
