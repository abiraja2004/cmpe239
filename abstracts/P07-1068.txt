This paper examines whether a learning-
based coreference resolver can be improved
using semantic class knowledge that is au-
tomatically acquired from a version of the
Penn Treebank in which the noun phrases
are labeled with their semantic classes. Ex-
periments on the ACE test data show that a
resolver that employs such induced semantic
class knowledge yields a statistically signif-
icant improvement of 2% in F-measure over
one that exploits heuristically computed se-
mantic class knowledge. In addition, the in-
duced knowledge improves the accuracy of
common noun resolution by 2-6%.
