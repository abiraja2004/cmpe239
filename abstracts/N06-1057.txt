ParaEval is an automated evaluation
method for comparing reference and peer
summaries. It facilitates a tiered-
comparison strategy where recall-oriented
global optimal and local greedy searches
for paraphrase matching are enabled in
the top tiers. We utilize a domain-
independent paraphrase table extracted
from a large bilingual parallel corpus us-
ing methods from Machine Translation
(MT). We show that the quality of ParaE-
val?s evaluations, measured by correlating
with human judgments, closely resembles
that of ROUGE?s.
