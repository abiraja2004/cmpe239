For safety reasons, in-vehicle dialogue
systems should be able to take the cogni-
tive load of the driver into consideration.
However, it is important to distinguish be-
tween two types of cognitive load, namely
if the cognitive load is affecting the driv-
ing behaviour or not. We will present find-
ings from a data collection carried out in
the DICO project1, where the dialogue be-
haviour under high cognitive load is anal-
ysed, and present a novel theory of how
to distinguish between different types of
workload.
