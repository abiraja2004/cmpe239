 
This paper presents a pilot study of the 
use of phrasal Statistical Machine Trans-
lation (SMT) techniques to identify and 
correct writing errors made by learners of 
English as a Second Language (ESL). 
Using examples of mass noun errors 
found in the Chinese Learner Error Cor-
pus (CLEC) to guide creation of an engi-
neered training set, we show that applica-
tion of the SMT paradigm can capture er-
rors not well addressed by widely-used 
proofing tools designed for native speak-
ers. Our system was able to correct 
61.81% of mistakes in a set of naturally-
occurring examples of mass noun errors 
found on the World Wide Web, suggest-
ing that efforts to collect alignable cor-
pora of pre- and post-editing ESL writing 
samples offer can enable the develop-
ment of SMT-based writing assistance 
tools capable of repairing many of the 
complex syntactic and lexical problems 
found in the writing of ESL learners.
