In this article, we present a translation
system which builds translations by glu-
ing together Tree-Phrases, i.e. associ-
ations between simple syntactic depen-
dency treelets in a source language and
their corresponding phrases in a target
language. The Tree-Phrases we use in
this study are syntactically informed and
present the advantage of gathering source
and target material whose words do not
have to be adjacent. We show that the
phrase-based translation engine we imple-
mented benefits from Tree-Phrases.
