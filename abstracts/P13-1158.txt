We study question answering as a ma-
chine learning problem, and induce a func-
tion that maps open-domain questions to
queries over a database of web extrac-
tions. Given a large, community-authored,
question-paraphrase corpus, we demon-
strate that it is possible to learn a se-
mantic lexicon and linear ranking func-
tion without manually annotating ques-
tions. Our approach automatically gener-
alizes a seed lexicon and includes a scal-
able, parallelized perceptron parameter es-
timation scheme. Experiments show that
our approach more than quadruples the re-
call of the seed lexicon, with only an 8%
loss in precision.
