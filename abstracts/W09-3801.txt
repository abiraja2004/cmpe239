We investigate several algorithms related
to the parsing problem for weighted au-
tomata, under the assumption that the in-
put is a string rather than a tree. This
assumption is motivated by several natu-
ral language processing applications. We
provide algorithms for the computation of
parse-forests, best tree probability, inside
probability (called partition function), and
prefix probability. Our algorithms are ob-
tained by extending to weighted tree au-
tomata the Bar-Hillel technique, as defined
for context-free grammars.
