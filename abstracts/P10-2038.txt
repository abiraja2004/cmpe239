Most attempts to train part-of-speech tag-
gers on a mixture of labeled and unlabeled
data have failed. In this work stacked
learning is used to reduce tagging to a
classification task. This simplifies semi-
supervised training considerably. Our
prefered semi-supervised method com-
bines tri-training (Li and Zhou, 2005) and
disagreement-based co-training. On the
Wall Street Journal, we obtain an error re-
duction of 4.2% with SVMTool (Gimenez
and Marquez, 2004).
