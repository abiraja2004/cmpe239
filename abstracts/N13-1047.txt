This paper describes an approach to improve
summaries for a collection of Twitter posts cre-
ated using the Phrase Reinforcement (PR) Al-
gorithm (Sharifi et al, 2010a). The PR algo-
rithm often generates summaries with excess
text and noisy speech. We parse these sum-
maries using a dependency parser and use the
dependencies to eliminate some of the excess
text and build better-formed summaries. We
compare the results to those obtained using the
PR Algorithm.
