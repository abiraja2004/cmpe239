This paper presents a novel deterministic
algorithm for implicit Semantic Role La-
beling. The system exploits a very sim-
ple but relevant discursive property, the ar-
gument coherence over different instances
of a predicate. The algorithm solves the
implicit arguments sequentially, exploit-
ing not only explicit but also the implicit
arguments previously solved. In addition,
we empirically demonstrate that the algo-
rithm obtains very competitive and robust
performances with respect to supervised
approaches that require large amounts of
costly training data.
