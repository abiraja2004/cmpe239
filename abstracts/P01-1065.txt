Multi-processor systems are becom-
ing more commonplace and afford-
able. Based on analyses of ac-
tual parsings, we argue that to ex-
ploit the capabilities of such ma-
chines, unification-based grammar
parsers should distribute work at the
level of individual unification oper-
ations. We present a generic ap-
proach to parallel chart parsing that
meets this requirement, and show
that an implementation of this tech-
nique for LinGO achieves consider-
able speedups.
