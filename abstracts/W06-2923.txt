This paper presents a Constraint Grammar-
inspired machine learner and parser,  Ling?
Pars, that assigns dependencies to morpho?
logically annotated treebanks in a function-
centred way. The system not only bases at?
tachment probabilities for PoS, case, mood, 
lemma on those features' function probabili?
ties, but also uses topological features like 
function/PoS  n-grams,  barrier  tags  and 
daughter-sequences.  In  the  CoNLL shared 
task, performance was below average on at?
tachment  scores,  but  a  relatively  higher 
score for  function tags/deprels  in  isolation 
suggests that the system's strengths were not 
fully exploited in the current architecture.
