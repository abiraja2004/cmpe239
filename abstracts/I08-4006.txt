 
Word sense disambiguation is a basic 
problem in natural language processing. 
This paper proposed an unsupervised word 
sense disambiguation method based 
PageRank and HowNet. In the method, a 
free text is firstly represented as a sememe 
graph with sememes as vertices and 
relatedness of sememes as weighted edges 
based on HowNet. Then UW-PageRank is 
applied on the sememe graph to score the 
importance of sememes. Score of each 
definition of one word can be computed 
from the score of sememes it contains. 
Finally, the highest scored definition is 
assigned to the word. This approach is 
tested on SENSEVAL-3 and the 
experimental results prove practical and 
effective.
