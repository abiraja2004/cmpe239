A Natural Language Generation system
produces text using as input semantic data.
One of its very first tasks is to decide
which pieces of information to convey in
the output. This task, called Content Se-
lection, is quite domain dependent, requir-
ing considerable re-engineering to trans-
port the system from one scenario to an-
other. In this paper, we present a method
to acquire content selection rules automat-
ically from a corpus of text and associated
semantics. Our proposed technique was
evaluated by comparing its output with in-
formation selected by human authors in
unseen texts, where we were able to fil-
ter half the input data set without loss of
recall.
