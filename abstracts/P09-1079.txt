Supervised polarity classification systems
are typically domain-specific. Building
these systems involves the expensive pro-
cess of annotating a large amount of data
for each domain. A potential solution
to this corpus annotation bottleneck is to
build unsupervised polarity classification
systems. However, unsupervised learning
of polarity is difficult, owing in part to the
prevalence of sentimentally ambiguous re-
views, where reviewers discuss both the
positive and negative aspects of a prod-
uct. To address this problem, we pro-
pose a semi-supervised approach to senti-
ment classification where we first mine the
unambiguous reviews using spectral tech-
niques and then exploit them to classify
the ambiguous reviews via a novel com-
bination of active learning, transductive
learning, and ensemble learning.
