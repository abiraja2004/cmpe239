This paper presents a discriminative align-
ment model for extracting abbreviations
and their full forms appearing in actual
text. The task of abbreviation recognition
is formalized as a sequential alignment
problem, which finds the optimal align-
ment (origins of abbreviation letters) be-
tween two strings (abbreviation and full
form). We design a large amount of fine-
grained features that directly express the
events where letters produce or do not pro-
duce abbreviations. We obtain the optimal
combination of features on an aligned ab-
breviation corpus by using the maximum
entropy framework. The experimental re-
sults show the usefulness of the alignment
model and corpus for improving abbrevia-
tion recognition.
