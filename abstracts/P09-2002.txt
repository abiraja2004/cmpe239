Past work on English coordination has fo-
cused on coordination scope disambigua-
tion. In Japanese, detecting whether coor-
dination exists in a sentence is also a prob-
lem, and the state-of-the-art alignment-
based method specialized for scope dis-
ambiguation does not perform well on
Japanese sentences. To take the detection
of coordination into account, this paper in-
troduces a ?bypass? to the alignment graph
used by this method, so as to explicitly
represent the non-existence of coordinate
structures in a sentence. We also present
an effective feature decomposition scheme
based on the distance between words in
conjuncts.
