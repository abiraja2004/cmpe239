This paper presents a system for automati-
cally generating discourse structures from
written text. The system is divided into two
levels: sentence-level and text-level. The
sentence-level discourse parser uses syntactic
information and cue phrases to segment sen-
tences into elementary discourse units and to
generate discourse structures of sentences. At
the text-level, constraints about textual adja-
cency and textual organization are integrated
in a beam search in order to generate best dis-
course structures. The experiments were done
with documents from the RST Discourse
Treebank. It shows promising results in a rea-
sonable search space compared to the dis-
course trees generated by human analysts.
