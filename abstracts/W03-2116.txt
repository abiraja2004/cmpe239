 
This paper reports a tool which assists the 
user in annotating a video corpus and en-
ables the user to search for a semantic or  
pragmatic structure in a GDA tagged cor-
pus. An XQL format is allowed for search 
patterns as well as a plain phrase. This 
tool is capable of generating a GDA time-
stamped corpus from a video file  manu-
ally. It will be publicly available for aca-
demic purposes.
