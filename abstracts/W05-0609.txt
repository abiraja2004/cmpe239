Clustering is an optimization procedure that
partitions a set of elements to optimize some
criteria, based on a fixed distance metric de-
fined between the elements. Clustering ap-
proaches have been widely applied in natural
language processing and it has been shown re-
peatedly that their success depends on defin-
ing a good distance metric, one that is appro-
priate for the task and the clustering algorithm
used. This paper develops a framework in
which clustering is viewed as a learning task,
and proposes a way to train a distance metric
that is appropriate for the chosen clustering al-
gorithm in the context of the given task. Ex-
periments in the context of the entity identifi-
cation problem exhibit significant performance
improvements over state-of-the-art clustering
approaches developed for this problem.
