In this paper, we describe a new methodology
to develop mixed-initiative spoken dialog systems,
which is based on the extensive use of simulations
to accelerate the development process. With the
help of simulations, a system providing informa-
tion about a database of nearly 1000 restaurants in
the Boston area has been developed. The simula-
tor can produce thousands of unique dialogs which
benefit not only dialog development but also pro-
vide data to train the speech recognizer and under-
standing components, in preparation for real user
interactions. Also described is a strategy for creat-
ing cooperative responses to user queries, incorpo-
rating an intelligent language generation capability
that produces content-dependent verbal descriptions
of listed items.
