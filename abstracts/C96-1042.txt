 
This paper describes a system of representation 
of nouns denoting portions, segments and 
relative quantities of entities, in order to 
account for this case of part-whole 
relationship. The semantics of both 
constructions denoting portions aad nouns 
used to build them arc discussed and eventually 
formalised in a unification-based formalism 
(LKB-IA~L) in terms of Pustciovsky's Theory 
of Qualia and Jackendoff's Conceptual 
Semantics.
