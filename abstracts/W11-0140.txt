In this paper we present some features of an architecture for the translation (Italian ? Italian Sign
Language) that performs syntactic analysis, semantic interpretation and generation. Such architec-
ture relies on an ontology that has been used to encode the domain of weather forecasts as well as
information on language as part of the world knowledge. We present some general issues of the
ontological semantic interpretation and discuss the analysis of ordinal numbers.
