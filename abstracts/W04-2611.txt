Abstract 
We explore a semantic abstraction approach 
to automatic summarization in the biomedical 
domain. The approach relies on a semantic 
processor that functions as the source inter-
preter and produces a list of predications. A 
transformation stage then generalizes and 
condenses this list, ultimately generating a 
conceptual condensate for a disorder input 
topic. The final condensate is displayed in 
graphical form. We provide a set of principles 
for the transformation stage and describe the 
application of this approach to multidocument 
input. Finally, we examine the characteristics 
and quality of the condensates produced.
