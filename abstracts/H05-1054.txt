 
This paper proposes a hybrid Chinese 
named entity recognition model based on 
multiple features. It differentiates from 
most of the previous approaches mainly 
as follows. Firstly, the proposed Hybrid 
Model integrates coarse particle feature 
(POS Model) with fine particle feature 
(Word Model), so that it can overcome 
the disadvantages of each other. Secondly, 
in order to reduce the searching space and 
improve the efficiency, we introduce heu-
ristic human knowledge into statistical 
model, which could increase the perform-
ance of NER significantly. Thirdly, we 
use three sub-models to respectively de-
scribe three kinds of transliterated person 
name, that is, Japanese, Russian and 
Euramerican person name, which can im-
prove the performance of PN recognition. 
From the experimental results on People's 
Daily testing data, we can conclude that 
our Hybrid Model is better than the mod-
els which only use one kind of features. 
And the experiments on MET-2 testing 
data also confirm the above conclusion, 
which show that our algorithm has consis-
tence on different testing data.
