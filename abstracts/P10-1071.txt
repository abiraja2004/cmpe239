Automatic processing of metaphor can
be clearly divided into two subtasks:
metaphor recognition (distinguishing be-
tween literal and metaphorical language in
a text) and metaphor interpretation (iden-
tifying the intended literal meaning of a
metaphorical expression). Both of them
have been repeatedly addressed in NLP.
This paper is the first comprehensive and
systematic review of the existing compu-
tational models of metaphor, the issues of
metaphor annotation in corpora and the
available resources.
