We present an approach to automatic se-
mantic role labeling (SRL) carried out in
the context of the Dutch Language Corpus
Initiative (D-Coi) project. Adapting ear-
lier research which has mainly focused on
English to the Dutch situation poses an in-
teresting challenge especially because there
is no semantically annotated Dutch corpus
available that can be used as training data.
Our automatic SRL approach consists of
three steps: bootstrapping from a syntacti-
cally annotated corpus by means of a rule-
based tagger developed for this purpose,
manual correction on the basis of the Prop-
Bank guidelines which have been adapted to
Dutch and training a machine learning sys-
tem on the manually corrected data.
