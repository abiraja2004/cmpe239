Previous work on bilingual lexicon extrac-
tion from comparable corpora aimed at
finding a good representation for the usage
patterns of source and target words and at
comparing these patterns efficiently. In
this paper, we try to work it out in an-
other way: improving the quality of the
comparable corpus from which the bilin-
gual lexicon has to be extracted. To do
so, we propose a measure of comparabil-
ity and a strategy to improve the qual-
ity of a given corpus through an iterative
construction process. Our approach, be-
ing general, can be used with any existing
bilingual lexicon extraction method. We
show here that it leads to a significant im-
provement over standard bilingual lexicon
extraction methods.
