In this paper we introduce a novel use of the
lexicographic semiring and motivate its use
for speech and language processing tasks. We
prove that the semiring allows for exact en-
coding of backoff models with epsilon tran-
sitions. This allows for off-line optimization
of exact models represented as large weighted
finite-state transducers in contrast to implicit
(on-line) failure transition representations. We
present preliminary empirical results demon-
strating that, even in simple intersection sce-
narios amenable to the use of failure transi-
tions, the use of the more powerful lexico-
graphic semiring is competitive in terms of
time of intersection.
