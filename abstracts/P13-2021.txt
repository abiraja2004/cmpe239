We present a model for inducing sen-
tential argument structure, which distin-
guishes arguments from optional modi-
fiers. We use this model to study whether
representing an argument/modifier distinc-
tion helps in learning argument structure,
and whether a linguistically-natural argu-
ment/modifier distinction can be induced
from distributional data alone. Our results
provide evidence for both hypotheses.
