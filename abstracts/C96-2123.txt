 
The objective of this pal)er is to \[brmal- 
ize the intuition al)out l,he comph;xity 
of syntactic structures. We propose a 
definition of structm:al COml)h'xity such 
that sentences ranked by our definition 
as more COml)h;x are gen(;rally more diI'- 
ficult lbr humans to process. We justify 
the definition by showing how it is ahle to 
account for several seemingly unrelated 
phenomena in natural anguages.
