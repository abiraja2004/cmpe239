Semantic role labeling (SRL) not only needs
lexical and syntactic information, but also
needs word sense information. However, be-
cause of the lack of corpus annotated with
both word senses and semantic roles, there is
few research on using word sense for SRL.
The release of OntoNotes provides an oppor-
tunity for us to study how to use word sense
for SRL. In this paper, we present some novel
word sense features for SRL and find that they
can improve the performance significantly.
