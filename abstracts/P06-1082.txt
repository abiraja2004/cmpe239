Word alignment using recency-vector
based approach has recently become pop-
ular. One major advantage of these tech-
niques is that unlike other approaches they
perform well even if the size of the par-
allel corpora is small. This makes these
algorithms worth-studying for languages
where resources are scarce. In this work
we studied the performance of two very
popular recency-vector based approaches,
proposed in (Fung and McKeown, 1994)
and (Somers, 1998), respectively, for word
alignment in English-Hindi parallel cor-
pus. But performance of the above al-
gorithms was not found to be satisfac-
tory. However, subsequent addition of
some new constraints improved the perfor-
mance of the recency-vector based align-
ment technique significantly for the said
corpus. The present paper discusses the
new version of the algorithm and its per-
formance in detail.
