 
This paper presents a Prefix Tree (Trie) 
based model for Generation of Referring 
Expression (GRE). The existing algorithms 
in GRE lie in two extremities. Incremental 
algorithm is simple and speedy but less ex-
pressive in nature whereas others are com-
plex and exhaustive but more expressive in 
nature. Our prefix tree based model not 
only incorporates all relevant features of 
GRE (like describing set, generating Boo-
lean and context sensitive description etc.) 
but also try to attain simplicity and speed 
properties of Incremental algorithm. Thus 
this model provides a simple and linguisti-
cally rich approach to GRE.
