Detailed image annotation necessary for reli-
able image retrieval involves not only annotat-
ing the image as a single artifact, but also an-
notating specific objects or regions within the
image. Such detailed annotation is a costly en-
deavor and the available annotated image data
are quite limited. This paper explores the fea-
sibility of using image captions from scientific
journals for the purpose of automatically an-
notating image regions. Salient image clues,
such as an object location within the image or
an object color, together with the associated
explicit object mention, are extracted and clas-
sified using rule-based and SVM learners.
