 
The web is growing at a rapid speed and it is 
almost impossible for a web crawler to 
download all new pages. Pages reporting 
breaking news should be stored into search 
engine index as soon as they are published, 
while others whose content is not 
time-related can be left for later crawls. We 
collected and analyzed into users? page-view 
data of 75,112,357 pages for 60 days. Using 
this data, we found that a large proportion of 
temporal pages are published by a small 
number of web sites providing news services, 
which should be crawled repeatedly with 
small intervals. Such temporal web sites of 
high freshness requirements can be 
identified by our algorithm based on user 
behavior analysis in page view data. 51.6% 
of all temporal pages can be picked up with 
a small overhead of untemporal pages. With 
this method, web crawlers can focus on 
these web sites and download pages from 
them with high priority.
