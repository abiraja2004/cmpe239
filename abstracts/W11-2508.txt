This paper presents a novel approach for auto-
matic detection of semantic change of words
based on distributional similarity models. We
show that the method obtains good results
with respect to a reference ranking produced
by human raters. The evaluation also analyzes
the performance of frequency-based methods,
comparing them to the similarity method pro-
posed.
