We present an extensive study on the prob-
lem of detecting polarity of words. We
consider the polarity of a word to be ei-
ther positive or negative. For example,
words such as good, beautiful , and won-
derful are considered as positive words;
whereas words such as bad, ugly, and sad
are considered negative words. We treat
polarity detection as a semi-supervised la-
bel propagation problem in a graph. In
the graph, each node represents a word
whose polarity is to be determined. Each
weighted edge encodes a relation that ex-
ists between two words. Each node (word)
can have two labels: positive or negative.
We study this framework in two differ-
ent resource availability scenarios using
WordNet and OpenOffice thesaurus when
WordNet is not available. We report our
results on three different languages: En-
glish, French, and Hindi. Our results in-
dicate that label propagation improves sig-
nificantly over the baseline and other semi-
supervised learning methods like Mincuts
and Randomized Mincuts for this task.
