The simultaneously phonological and syn-
tactic grammar of second position clitics is
an instance of the broader problem of ap-
plying constraints across multiple levels of
linguistic analysis. Syntax frameworks ex-
tended with simple tree transductions can
make efficient use of these necessary ad-
ditional forms of structure. An analysis
of Sahidic Coptic second position clitics
in a context-free grammar extended by a
monadic second-order transduction exem-
plifies this approach.
