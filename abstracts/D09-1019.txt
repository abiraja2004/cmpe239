tional sentences. The aim is to determine 
whether opinions expressed on different topics 
in a conditional sentence are positive, negative 
or neutral. Conditional sentences are one of the 
commonly used language constructs in text. In 
a typical document, there are around 8% of 
such sentences. Due to the condition clause, 
sentiments expressed in a conditional sentence 
can be hard to determine. For example, in the 
sentence, if your Nokia phone is not good, buy 
this great Samsung phone, the author is posi-
tive about ?Samsung phone? but does not ex-
press an opinion on ?Nokia phone? (although 
the owner of the ?Nokia phone? may be nega-
tive about it). However, if the sentence does 
not have ?if?, the first clause is clearly nega-
tive. Although ?if? commonly signifies a con-
ditional sentence, there are many other words 
and constructs that can express conditions. 
This paper first presents a linguistic analysis of 
such sentences, and then builds some super-
vised learning models to determine if senti-
ments expressed on different topics in a condi-
tional sentence are positive, negative or neu-
tral. Experimental results on conditional sen-
tences from 5 diverse domains are given to 
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed 
approach.
