This paper investigates two strategies for im-
proving coreference resolution: (1) training
separate models that specialize in particu-
lar types of mentions (e.g., pronouns versus
proper nouns) and (2) using a ranking loss
function rather than a classification function.
In addition to being conceptually simple, these
modifications of the standard single-model,
classification-based approach also deliver sig-
nificant performance improvements. Specifi-
cally, we show that on the ACE corpus both
strategies produce f -score gains of more than
3% across the three coreference evaluation
metrics (MUC, B3, and CEAF).
