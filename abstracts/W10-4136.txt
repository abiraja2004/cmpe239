 
We participate in the CIPS-SIGHAN-
2010 bake-off task of Chinese word 
segmentation. Unlike the previous 
bakeoff series, the purpose of the 
bakeoff 2010 is to test the cross-
domain performance of Chinese seg-
mentation model. This paper summa-
rizes our approach and our bakeoff re-
sults. We mainly propose to use ?2 sta-
tistics to increase the OOV recall and 
use bootstrapping strategy to increase 
the overall F score. As the results 
shows, the approach proposed in the 
paper does help, both of the OOV re-
call and the overall F score are im-
proved.
