In this paper, we introduce a knowledge-based
method to disambiguate biomedical acronyms
using second-order co-occurrence vectors. We
create these vectors using information about a
long-form obtained from the Unified Medical
Language System and Medline. We evaluate
this method on a dataset of 18 acronyms found
in biomedical text. Our method achieves an
overall accuracy of 89%. The results show
that using second-order features provide a dis-
tinct representation of the long-form and po-
tentially enhances automated disambiguation.
