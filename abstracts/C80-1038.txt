 
This paper describes a newly developed lin- 
guistic error correction system, which can cor- 
rect errors and rejections of Japanese sentences 
by using linguistic knowledge. 
Conventional optical character readers 
(OCR) need human assistance to correct their 
recognition errors and rejections. An operator 
must teach the OCR correct answers whenever an 
illegible character pattern occurs. If this 
error correction operation is mechanized, the 
throughput of the OCR will increase. 
This linguistic error correction system of- 
fers means of automated error correction by an- 
alysing sentences of the OCR outputs linguisti- 
cally. This system grammatically selects legal 
letters from the candidates which can not be 
decided uniquely by pattern recognition only, 
and recommends grammatically and semantically 
meaningful letters for the illegible letter.
