One of the major problems of K-means is
that one must use dense vectors for its cen-
troids, and therefore it is infeasible to store
such huge vectors in memory when the feature
space is high-dimensional. We address this is-
sue by using feature hashing (Weinberger et
al., 2009), a dimension-reduction technique,
which can reduce the size of dense vectors
while retaining sparsity of sparse vectors. Our
analysis gives theoretical motivation and jus-
tification for applying feature hashing to K-
means, by showing how much will the objec-
tive ofK-means be (additively) distorted. Fur-
thermore, to empirically verify our method,
we experimented on a document clustering
task.
