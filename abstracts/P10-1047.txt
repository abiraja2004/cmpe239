We present a novel scheme to apply fac-
tored phrase-based SMT to a language pair
with very disparate morphological struc-
tures. Our approach relies on syntac-
tic analysis on the source side (English)
and then encodes a wide variety of local
and non-local syntactic structures as com-
plex structural tags which appear as ad-
ditional factors in the training data. On
the target side (Turkish), we only per-
form morphological analysis and disam-
biguation but treat the complete complex
morphological tag as a factor, instead of
separating morphemes. We incrementally
explore capturing various syntactic sub-
structures as complex tags on the En-
glish side, and evaluate how our transla-
tions improve in BLEU scores. Our max-
imal set of source and target side trans-
formations, coupled with some additional
techniques, provide an 39% relative im-
provement from a baseline 17.08 to 23.78
BLEU, all averaged over 10 training and
test sets. Now that the syntactic analy-
sis on the English side is available, we
also experiment with more long distance
constituent reordering to bring the English
constituent order close to Turkish, but find
that these transformations do not provide
any additional consistent tangible gains
when averaged over the 10 sets.
