The automatic identification of prosodic
events such as pitch accent in English has long
been a topic of interest to speech researchers,
with applications to a variety of spoken lan-
guage processing tasks. However, much re-
mains to be understood about the best meth-
ods for obtaining high accuracy detection. We
describe experiments examining the optimal
domain for accent analysis. Specifically, we
compare pitch accent identification at the syl-
lable, vowel or word level as domains for anal-
ysis of acoustic indicators of accent. Our re-
sults indicate that a word-based approach is
superior to syllable- or vowel-based detection,
achieving an accuracy of 84.2%.
