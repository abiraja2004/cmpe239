We are currently developing a translation
aid system specially designed for English-
to-Japanese volunteer translators working
mainly online. In this paper we introduce
the stratified reference lookup interface that
has been incorporated into the source text
area of the system, which distinguishes three
user awareness levels depending on the type
and nature of the reference unit. The dif-
ferent awareness levels are assigned to ref-
erence units from a variety of reference
sources, according to the criteria of ?com-
position?, ?difficulty?, ?speciality? and ?re-
source type?.
