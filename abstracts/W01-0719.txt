This paper shows that linguistic tech-
niques along with machine learning
can extract high quality noun phrases
for the purpose of providing the gist
or summary of email messages. We
describe a set of comparative experi-
ments using several machine learning
algorithms for the task of salient noun
phrase extraction. Three main conclu-
sions can be drawn from this study: (i)
the modifiers of a noun phrase can be
semantically as important as the head,
for the task of gisting, (ii) linguistic fil-
tering improves the performance of ma-
chine learning algorithms, (iii) a combi-
nation of classifiers improves accuracy.
