In this paper we present our entry to the
WMT?13 shared task: Quality Estima-
tion (QE) for machine translation (MT).
We participated in the 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3
sub-tasks with our QE system trained on
features from diverse information sources
like MT decoder features, n-best lists,
mono- and bi-lingual corpora and giza
training models. Our system shows com-
petitive results in the workshop shared
task.
