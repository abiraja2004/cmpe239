This paper presents ongoing research in
clinical information extraction. This work
introduces a new genre of text which are
not well-written, noise prone, ungrammat-
ical and with much cryptic content. A cor-
pus of clinical progress notes drawn form
an Intensive Care Service has been manu-
ally annotated with more than 15000 clin-
ical named entities in 11 entity types. This
paper reports on the challenges involved in
creating the annotation schema, and recog-
nising and annotating clinical named enti-
ties. The information extraction task has
initially used two approaches: a rule based
system and a machine learning system
using Conditional Random Fields (CRF).
Different features are investigated to as-
sess the interaction of feature sets and the
supervised learning approaches to estab-
lish the combination best suited to this
data set. The rule based and CRF sys-
tems achieved an F-score of 64.12% and
81.48% respectively.
