This paper describes the CoMeT system, our
contribution to the SemEval 2013 Task 7 chal-
lenge, focusing on the task of automatically
assessing student answers to factual questions.
CoMeT is based on a meta-classifier that uses
the outputs of the sub-systems we developed:
CoMiC, CoSeC, and three shallower bag ap-
proaches. We sketch the functionality of all
sub-systems and evaluate their performance
against the official test set of the challenge.
CoMeT obtained the best result (73.1% accu-
racy) for the 3-way unseen answers in Beetle
among all challenge participants. We also dis-
cuss possible improvements and directions for
future research.
