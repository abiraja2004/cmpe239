Although the ideal length of summaries dif-
fers greatly from topic to topic on Twitter, pre-
vious work has only generated summaries of
a pre-fixed length. In this paper, we propose
an event-graph based method using informa-
tion extraction techniques that is able to cre-
ate summaries of variable length for different
topics. In particular, we extend the Pagerank-
like ranking algorithm from previous work to
partition event graphs and thereby detect fine-
grained aspects of the event to be summarized.
Our preliminary results show that summaries
created by our method are more concise and
news-worthy than SumBasic according to hu-
man judges. We also provide a brief survey of
datasets and evaluation design used in previ-
ous work to highlight the need of developing a
standard evaluation for automatic tweet sum-
marization task.
