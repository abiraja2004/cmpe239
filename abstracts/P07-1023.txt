We show that the problems of parsing and sur-
face realization for grammar formalisms with
?context-free? derivations, coupled with Mon-
tague semantics (under a certain restriction) can
be reduced in a uniform way to Datalog query
evaluation. As well as giving a polynomial-
time algorithm for computing all derivation trees
(in the form of a shared forest) from an in-
put string or input logical form, this reduction
has the following complexity-theoretic conse-
quences for all such formalisms: (i) the de-
cision problem of recognizing grammaticality
(surface realizability) of an input string (logical
form) is in LOGCFL; and (ii) the search prob-
lem of finding one logical form (surface string)
from an input string (logical form) is in func-
tional LOGCFL. Moreover, the generalized sup-
plementary magic-sets rewriting of the Datalog
program resulting from the reduction yields ef-
ficient Earley-style algorithms for both parsing
and generation.
