This paper presents work on the task
of constructing a word-level translation
lexicon purely from unrelated mono-
lingual corpora. We combine vari-
ous clues such as cognates, similar
context, preservation of word similar-
ity, and word frequency. Experimen-
tal results for the construction of a
German-English noun lexicon are re-
ported. Noun translation accuracy of
39% scored against a parallel test cor-
pus could be achieved.
