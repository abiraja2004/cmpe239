Models of the acquisition of word segmen-
tation are typically evaluated using phonem-
ically transcribed corpora. Accordingly, they
implicitly assume that children know how to
undo phonetic variation when they learn to ex-
tract words from speech. Moreover, whereas
models of language acquisition should per-
form similarly across languages, evaluation
is often limited to English samples. Us-
ing child-directed corpora of English, French
and Japanese, we evaluate the performance
of state-of-the-art statistical models given in-
puts where phonetic variation has not been re-
duced. To do so, we measure segmentation
robustness across different levels of segmen-
tal variation, simulating systematic allophonic
variation or errors in phoneme recognition.
We show that these models do not resist an in-
crease in such variations and do not generalize
to typologically different languages. From the
perspective of early language acquisition, the
results strengthen the hypothesis according to
which phonological knowledge is acquired in
large part before the construction of a lexicon.
