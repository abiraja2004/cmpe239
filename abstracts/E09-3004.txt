This paper deals with the task of find-
ing generally applicable substitutions for a
given input term. We show that the output
of a distributional similarity system base-
line can be filtered to obtain terms that are
not simply similar but frequently substi-
tutable. Our filter relies on the fact that
when two terms are in a common entail-
ment relation, it should be possible to sub-
stitute one for the other in their most fre-
quent surface contexts. Using the Google
5-gram corpus to find such characteris-
tic contexts, we show that for the given
task, our filter improves the precision of a
distributional similarity system from 41%
to 56% on a test set comprising common
transitive verbs.
