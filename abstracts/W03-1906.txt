Despite the many initiatives in recent years
aimed at creating Language Engineering
standards, it is often the case that dierent
projects use dierent approaches and often
dene their own standards. Even within the
same project it often happens that dierent
tools will require dierent ways to represent
their linguistic data.
In a recently started EU project focusing
on the integration of Information Extrac-
tion and Data Mining techniques, we aim
at avoiding the problem of incompatibility
among dierent tools by dening a Com-
mon Annotation Scheme internal to the
project. However, when the project was
started (Sep 2002) we were unaware of the
standardization eort of ISO TC37/SC4,
and so we commenced once again trying to
dene our own schema. Fortunately, as this
work is still at an early stage (the project
will last till 2005) it is still possible to redi-
rect it in a way that it will be compati-
ble with the standardization work of ISO.
In this paper we describe the status of the
work in the project and explore possible
synergies with the work in ISO TC37 SC4.
