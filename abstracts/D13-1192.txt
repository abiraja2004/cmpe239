With the rapid growth of social media, Twitter
has become one of the most widely adopted
platforms for people to post short and instant
message. On the one hand, people tweets
about their daily lives, and on the other hand,
when major events happen, people also fol-
low and tweet about them. Moreover, people?s
posting behaviors on events are often closely
tied to their personal interests. In this paper,
we try to model topics, events and users on
Twitter in a unified way. We propose a model
which combines an LDA-like topic model and
the Recurrent Chinese Restaurant Process to
capture topics and events. We further propose
a duration-based regularization component to
find bursty events. We also propose to use
event-topic affinity vectors to model the asso-
ciation between events and topics. Our exper-
iments shows that our model can accurately
identify meaningful events and the event-topic
affinity vectors are effective for event recom-
mendation and grouping events by topics.
