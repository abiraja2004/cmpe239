We propose a method for annotating post-
to-post discourse structure in online user
forum data, in the hopes of improving
troubleshooting-oriented information ac-
cess. We introduce the tasks of: (1) post
classification, based on a novel dialogue
act tag set; and (2) link classification. We
also introduce three feature sets (structural
features, post context features and seman-
tic features) and experiment with three dis-
criminative learners (maximum entropy,
SVM-HMM and CRF).We achieve above-
baseline results for both dialogue act and
link classification, with interesting diver-
gences in which feature sets perform well
over the two sub-tasks, and go on to per-
form preliminary investigation of the inter-
action between post tagging and linking.
