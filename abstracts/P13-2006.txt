We propose a novel entity disambigua-
tion model, based on Deep Neural Net-
work (DNN). Instead of utilizing simple
similarity measures and their disjoint com-
binations, our method directly optimizes
document and entity representations for a
given similarity measure. Stacked Denois-
ing Auto-encoders are first employed to
learn an initial document representation in
an unsupervised pre-training stage. A su-
pervised fine-tuning stage follows to opti-
mize the representation towards the simi-
larity measure. Experiment results show
that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance on two public datasets with-
out any manually designed features, even
beating complex collective approaches.
