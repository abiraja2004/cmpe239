In this paper we describe a novel data
structure for phrase-based statistical ma-
chine translation which allows for the re-
trieval of arbitrarily long phrases while si-
multaneously using less memory than is
required by current decoder implementa-
tions. We detail the computational com-
plexity and average retrieval times for
looking up phrase translations in our suf-
fix array-based data structure. We show
how sampling can be used to reduce the
retrieval time by orders of magnitude with
no loss in translation quality.
