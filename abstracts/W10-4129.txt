We have participated in the open tracks
and closed tracks on four corpora of Chi-
nese word segmentation tasks in CIPS-
SIGHAN-2010 Bake-offs. In our experi-
ments, we used the Chinese inner phonol-
ogy information in all tracks. For open
tracks, we proposed a double hidden lay-
ers? HMM (DHHMM) in which Chinese
inner phonology information was used as
one hidden layer and the BIO tags as an-
other hidden layer. N-best results were
firstly generated by using DHHMM, then
the best one was selected by using a new
lexical statistic measure. For close tracks,
we used CRF model in which the Chinese
inner phonology information was used as
features.
