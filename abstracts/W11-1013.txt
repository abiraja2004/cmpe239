Ontologies and taxonomies are widely used to
organize concepts providing the basis for ac-
tivities such as indexing, and as background
knowledge for NLP tasks. As such, trans-
lation of these resources would prove use-
ful to adapt these systems to new languages.
However, we show that the nature of these
resources is significantly different from the
?free-text? paradigm used to train most sta-
tistical machine translation systems. In par-
ticular, we see significant differences in the
linguistic nature of these resources and such
resources have rich additional semantics. We
demonstrate that as a result of these linguistic
differences, standard SMT methods, in partic-
ular evaluation metrics, can produce poor per-
formance. We then look to the task of leverag-
ing these semantics for translation, which we
approach in three ways: by adapting the trans-
lation system to the domain of the resource;
by examining if semantics can help to predict
the syntactic structure used in translation; and
by evaluating if we can use existing translated
taxonomies to disambiguate translations. We
present some early results from these experi-
ments, which shed light on the degree of suc-
cess we may have with each approach.
