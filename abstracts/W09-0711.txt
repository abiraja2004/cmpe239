In a manuscript William Labov (1987)
states that although linguistics is a field
with a long historical tradition and with
a high degree of consensus on basic cat-
egories, it experiences a fundamental de-
vision concerning the role that quantita-
tive methods should play as part of the
research progress. Linguists differ in the
role they assign to the use of natural lan-
guage examples in linguistic research and
in the publication of its results. In this pa-
per we suggest that the general availabil-
ity of richly annotated, multi-lingual data
directly suited for scientific publications
could have a positive impact on the way
we think about language, and how we ap-
proach linguistics.We encourage the sys-
tematic generation of linguistic data be-
yond what emerges from fieldwork and
other descriptive studies and introduce an
online glossing tool for textual data anno-
tation. We argue that the availability of
such an online tool will facilitate the gen-
eration of in-depth annotated linguistic ex-
amples as part of linguistic research. This
in turn will allow the build-up of linguis-
tic resources which can be used indepen-
dent of the research focus and of the the-
oretical framework applied. The tool we
would like to present is a non-expert-user
system designed in particular for the work
with lesser documented languages. It has
been used for the documentation of several
African languages, and has served for two
projects involving universities in Africa.
