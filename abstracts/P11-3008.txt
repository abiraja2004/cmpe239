 
We present ConsentCanvas, a system 
which structures and ?texturizes? End-User 
License Agreement (EULA) documents to 
be more readable. The system aims to help 
users better understand the terms under 
which they are providing their informed 
consent. ConsentCanvas receives unstruc-
tured text documents as input and uses un-
supervised natural language processing 
methods to embellish the source document 
using a linked stylesheet. Unlike similar 
usable security projects which employ 
summarization techniques, our system pre-
serves the contents of the source document, 
minimizing the cognitive and legal burden 
for both the end user and the licensor. Our 
system does not require a corpus for train-
ing.
