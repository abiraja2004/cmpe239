 
This paper proposes to study the problem of 
identifying intention posts in online discus-
sion forums. For example, in a discussion fo-
rum, a user wrote ?I plan to buy a camera,? 
which indicates a buying intention. This in-
tention can be easily exploited by advertisers. 
To the best of our knowledge, there is still no 
reported study of this problem. Our research 
found that this problem is particularly suited 
to transfer learning because in different do-
mains, people express the same intention in 
similar ways. We then propose a new transfer 
learning method which, unlike a general 
transfer learning algorithm, exploits several 
special characteristics of the problem. Exper-
imental results show that the proposed meth-
od outperforms several strong baselines, 
including supervised learning in the target 
domain and a recent transfer learning meth-
od.
