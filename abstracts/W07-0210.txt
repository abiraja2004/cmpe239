We study the correlations in the connec-
tivity patterns of large scale syntactic de-
pendency networks. These networks are
induced from treebanks: their vertices de-
note word forms which occur as nuclei
of dependency trees. Their edges con-
nect pairs of vertices if at least two in-
stance nuclei of these vertices are linked
in the dependency structure of a sentence.
We examine the syntactic dependency net-
works of seven languages. In all these
cases, we consistently obtain three find-
ings. Firstly, clustering, i.e., the probabil-
ity that two vertices which are linked to
a common vertex are linked on their part,
is much higher than expected by chance.
Secondly, the mean clustering of vertices
decreases with their degree ? this find-
ing suggests the presence of a hierarchical
network organization. Thirdly, the mean
degree of the nearest neighbors of a ver-
tex x tends to decrease as the degree of
x grows ? this finding indicates disassor-
tative mixing in the sense that links tend
to connect vertices of dissimilar degrees.
Our results indicate the existence of com-
mon patterns in the large scale organiza-
tion of syntactic dependency networks.
