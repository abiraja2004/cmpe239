This paper describes SIE (Simple Infor-
mation Extraction), a modular information
extraction system designed with the goal
of being easily and quickly portable across
tasks and domains. SIE is composed by
a general purpose machine learning algo-
rithm (SVM) combined with several cus-
tomizable modules. A crucial role in the
architecture is played by Instance Filter-
ing, which allows to increase efficiency
without reducing effectiveness. The re-
sults obtained by SIE on several standard
data sets, representative of different tasks
and domains, are reported. The experi-
ments show that SIE achieves performance
close to the best systems in all tasks, with-
out using domain-specific knowledge.
