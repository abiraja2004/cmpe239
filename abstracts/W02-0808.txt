This paper describes an experiment that
uses translation equivalents derived from
parallel corpora to determine sense
distinctions that can be used for automatic
sense-tagging and other disambiguation
tasks. Our results show that sense
distinctions derived from cross-lingual
information are at least as reliable as those
made by human annotators. Because our
approach is fully automated through all its
steps, it could provide means to obtain
large samples of ?sense-tagged? data
without the high cost of human
annotation.
