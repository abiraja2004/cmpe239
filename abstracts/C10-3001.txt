 
Honorifics in Japanese plays an incred-
ibly important role in all walks of 
social life. The demand to transform 
regular expressions in Japanese into 
honorifics automatically has increased 
rapidly especially in business situations. 
This paper reviews existing studies and 
proposes a system to fill this demand 
with more practicable functions. The 
experiment shows the effectiveness of 
our strategy.
