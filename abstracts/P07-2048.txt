We present an approach to MT between Tur-
kic languages and present results from an
implementation of a MT system from Turk-
men to Turkish. Our approach relies on am-
biguous lexical and morphological transfer
augmented with target side rule-based re-
pairs and rescoring with statistical language
models.
