 Subject ellipsis is one of the characteris-tics of informal English. The investigation of subject ellipsis in corpora thus reveals an abundance of pragmatic and extra-linguistic information associated with subject ellipsis that enhances natural lan-guage understanding. In essence, the presence of subject ellipsis conveys an ?informal? conversation involving 1) an informal ?Topic? as well as familiar/close ?Participants?, 2) specific ?Connotations? that are different from the corresponding full sentences: interruptive (ending dis-course coherence), polite, intimate, friendly, and less determinate implica-tures. This paper also construes linguistic environments that trigger the use of sub-ject ellipsis and resolve subject ellipsis. 1
