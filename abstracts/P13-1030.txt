We propose a new variant of Tree-
Adjoining Grammar that allows adjunc-
tion of full wrapping trees but still bears
only context-free expressivity. We provide
a transformation to context-free form, and
a further reduction in probabilistic model
size through factorization and pooling of
parameters. This collapsed context-free
form is used to implement efficient gram-
mar estimation and parsing algorithms.
We perform parsing experiments the Penn
Treebank and draw comparisons to Tree-
Substitution Grammars and between dif-
ferent variations in probabilistic model de-
sign. Examination of the most probable
derivations reveals examples of the lin-
guistically relevant structure that our vari-
ant makes possible.
