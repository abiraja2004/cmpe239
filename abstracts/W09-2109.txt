We present an innovative application of dis-
course processing concepts to educational
technology. In our corpus analysis of peer
learning dialogues, we found that initiative
and initiative shifts are indicative of learn-
ing, and of learning-conducive episodes. We
are incorporating this finding in KSC-PaL, the
peer learning agent we have been developing.
KSC-PaL will promote learning by encourag-
ing shifts in task initiative.
