In this paper we describe our participation
to the WMT13 Shared Task on Quality Es-
timation. The main originality of our ap-
proach is to include features originally de-
signed to classify text according to some
author?s style. This implies the use of ref-
erence categories, which are meant to rep-
resent the quality of the MT output.
Preamble
This paper describes the approach followed in the
two systems that we submitted to subtask 1.3 of
the WMT13 Shared Task on Quality Estimation,
identified as TCD-DCU-CNGL 1-3 SVM1 and
TCD-DCU-CNGL 1-3 SVM2. This approach
was also used by the first author in his submissions
to subtask 1.1, identified as TCD-CNGL OPEN
and TCD-CNGL RESTRICTED1. In the remain-
ing of this paper we focus on subtask 1.3, but there
is very little difference in the application of the ap-
proach to task 1.1.
