 
We present a data-driven model for de-
tecting suitable response locations in the 
user?s speech. The model has been 
trained on human?machine dialogue data 
and implemented and tested in a spoken 
dialogue system that can perform the 
Map Task with users. To our knowledge, 
this is the first example of a dialogue sys-
tem that uses automatically extracted 
syntactic, prosodic and contextual fea-
tures for online detection of response lo-
cations. A subjective evaluation of the 
dialogue system suggests that interac-
tions with a system using our trained 
model were perceived significantly better 
than those with a system using a model 
that made decisions at random.
