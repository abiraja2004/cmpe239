This paper proposes a new paradigm for senti-
ment analysis: translation from text documents
to a set of sentiment units. The techniques of
deep language analysis for machine translation
are applicable also to this kind of text mining
task. We developed a high-precision sentiment
analysis system at a low development cost, by
making use of an existing transfer-based ma-
chine translation engine.
