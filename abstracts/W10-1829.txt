We propose in this paper a broad-coverage
approach for multimodal annotation of
conversational data. Large annotation pro-
jects addressing the question of multimo-
dal annotation bring together many dif-
ferent kinds of information from different
domains, with different levels of granula-
rity. We present in this paper the first re-
sults of the OTIM project aiming at deve-
loping conventions and tools for multimo-
dal annotation.
