This paper compares domain-oriented and
linguistically-oriented semantics, based on the
GENIA event corpus and FrameNet. While
the domain-oriented semantic structures are
direct targets of Text Mining (TM), their ex-
traction from text is not straghtforward due
to the diversity of linguistic expressions. The
extraction of linguistically-oriented semactics
is more straghtforward, and has been studied
independentely of specific domains. In or-
der to find a use of the domain-independent
research achievements for TM, we aim at
linking classes of the two types of seman-
tics. The classes were connected by analyz-
ing linguistically-oriented semantics of the ex-
pressions that mention one biological class.
With the obtained relationship between the
classes, we discuss a link between TM and
linguistically-oriented semantics.
