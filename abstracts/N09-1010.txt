We investigate the problem of unsupervised
part-of-speech tagging when raw parallel data
is available in a large number of languages.
Patterns of ambiguity vary greatly across lan-
guages and therefore even unannotated multi-
lingual data can serve as a learning signal. We
propose a non-parametric Bayesian model that
connects related tagging decisions across lan-
guages through the use of multilingual latent
variables. Our experiments show that perfor-
mance improves steadily as the number of lan-
guages increases.
