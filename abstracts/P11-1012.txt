We propose to directly measure the impor-
tance of queries in the source domain to the
target domain where no rank labels of doc-
uments are available, which is referred to
as query weighting. Query weighting is a
key step in ranking model adaptation. As
the learning object of ranking algorithms is
divided by query instances, we argue that
it?s more reasonable to conduct importance
weighting at query level than document level.
We present two query weighting schemes.
The first compresses the query into a query
feature vector, which aggregates all document
instances in the same query, and then con-
ducts query weighting based on the query fea-
ture vector. This method can efficiently esti-
mate query importance by compressing query
data, but the potential risk is information loss
resulted from the compression. The second
measures the similarity between the source
query and each target query, and then com-
bines these fine-grained similarity values for
its importance estimation. Adaptation exper-
iments on LETOR3.0 data set demonstrate
that query weighting significantly outperforms
document instance weighting methods.
