Abstract
OBJECTIVE: The prior knowledge about
the rhetorical structure of scientific abstracts
is useful for various text-mining tasks such
as information extraction, information re-
trieval, and automatic summarization. This
paper presents a novel approach to cate-
gorize sentences in scientific abstracts into
four sections, objective, methods, results,
and conclusions. METHOD: Formalizing
the categorization task as a sequential label-
ing problem, we employ Conditional Ran-
dom Fields (CRFs) to annotate section la-
bels into abstract sentences. The train-
ing corpus is acquired automatically from
Medline abstracts. RESULTS: The pro-
posed method outperformed the previous
approaches, achieving 95.5% per-sentence
accuracy and 68.8% per-abstract accuracy.
CONCLUSION: The experimental results
showed that CRFs could model the rhetor-
ical structure of abstracts more suitably.
