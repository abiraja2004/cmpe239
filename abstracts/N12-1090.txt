To build a coreference resolver for a new
language, the typical approach is to first
coreference-annotate documents from this tar-
get language and then train a resolver on these
annotated documents using supervised learn-
ing techniques. However, the high cost asso-
ciated with manually coreference-annotating
documents needed by a supervised approach
makes it difficult to deploy coreference tech-
nologies across a large number of natural lan-
guages. To alleviate this corpus annotation
bottleneck, we examine a translation-based
projection approach to multilingual corefer-
ence resolution. Experimental results on two
target languages demonstrate the promise of
our approach.
