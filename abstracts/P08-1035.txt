The paper presents a novel sentence trimmer
in Japanese, which combines a non-statistical
yet generic tree generation model and Con-
ditional Random Fields (CRFs), to address
improving the grammaticality of compres-
sion while retaining its relevance. Experi-
ments found that the present approach out-
performs in grammaticality and in relevance
a dependency-centric approach (Oguro et al,
2000; Morooka et al, 2004; Yamagata et al,
2006; Fukutomi et al, 2007)? the only line of
work in prior literature (on Japanese compres-
sion) we are aware of that allows replication
and permits a direct comparison.
