This paper describes a method for learn-
ing the countability preferences of English
nouns from raw text corpora. The method
maps the corpus-attested lexico-syntactic
properties of each noun onto a feature
vector, and uses a suite of memory-based
classifiers to predict membership in 4
countability classes. We were able to as-
sign countability to English nouns with a
precision of 94.6%.
