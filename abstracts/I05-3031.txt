In this paper we present a Two-Phase
LMR-RC Tagging scheme to perform
Chinese word segmentation. In the
Regular Tagging phase, Chinese sen-
tences are processed similar to the orig-
inal LMR Tagging. Tagged sentences
are then passed to the Correctional Tag-
ging phase, in which the sentences are
re-tagged using extra information from
the first round tagging results. Two
training methods, Separated Mode and
Integrated Mode, are proposed to con-
struct the models. Experimental re-
sults show that our scheme in Inte-
grated Mode performs the best in terms
of accuracy, where Separated Mode is
more suitable under limited computa-
tional resources.
