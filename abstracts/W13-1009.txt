While working on valency lexicons for Czech
and English, it was necessary to define treat-
ment of multiword entities (MWEs) with the
verb as the central lexical unit. Morphologi-
cal, syntactic and semantic properties of such
MWEs had to be formally specified in order to
create lexicon entries and use them in treebank
annotation. Such a formal specification has
also been used for automated quality control
of the annotation vs. the lexicon entries. We
present a corpus-based study, concentrating on
multilayer specification of verbal MWEs, their
properties in Czech and English, and a com-
parison between the two languages using the
parallel Czech-English Dependency Treebank
(PCEDT). This comparison revealed interest-
ing differences in the use of verbal MWEs in
translation (discovering that such MWEs are
actually rarely translated as MWEs, at least
between Czech and English) as well as some
inconsistencies in their annotation. Adding
MWE-based checks should thus result in bet-
ter quality control of future treebank/lexicon
annotation. Since Czech and English are typo-
logically different languages, we believe that
our findings will also contribute to a better
understanding of verbal MWEs and possibly
their more unified treatment across languages.
