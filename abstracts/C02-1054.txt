Named Entity (NE) recognition is a task in which
proper nouns and numerical information are ex-
tracted from documents and are classified into cat-
egories such as person, organization, and date. It
is a key technology of Information Extraction and
Open-Domain Question Answering. First, we show
that an NE recognizer based on Support Vector Ma-
chines (SVMs) gives better scores than conventional
systems. However, off-the-shelf SVM classifiers are
too inefficient for this task. Therefore, we present a
method that makes the system substantially faster.
This approach can also be applied to other simi-
lar tasks such as chunking and part-of-speech tag-
ging. We also present an SVM-based feature selec-
tion method and an efficient training method.
