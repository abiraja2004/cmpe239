Extractive methods for multi-document sum-
marization are mainly governed by informa-
tion overlap, coherence, and content con-
straints. We present an unsupervised proba-
bilistic approach to model the hidden abstract
concepts across documents as well as the cor-
relation between these concepts, to generate
topically coherent and non-redundant sum-
maries. Based on human evaluations our mod-
els generate summaries with higher linguistic
quality in terms of coherence, readability, and
redundancy compared to benchmark systems.
Although our system is unsupervised and opti-
mized for topical coherence, we achieve a 44.1
ROUGE on the DUC-07 test set, roughly in the
range of state-of-the-art supervised models.
