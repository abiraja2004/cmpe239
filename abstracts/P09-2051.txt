member, argument with a spouse and loss of a 
job, play an important role in triggering de-
pressive episodes. Therefore, it is worth to de-
velop psychiatric services that can automati-
cally identify such events. In this paper, we 
propose the use of association language pat-
terns, i.e., meaningful combinations of words 
(e.g., <loss, job>), as features to classify sen-
tences with negative life events into prede-
fined categories (e.g., Family, Love, Work). 
The language patterns are discovered using a 
data mining algorithm, called association pat-
tern mining, by incrementally associating fre-
quently co-occurred words in the sentences 
annotated with negative life events. The dis-
covered patterns are then combined with sin-
gle words to train classifiers. Experimental re-
sults show that association language patterns 
are significant features, thus yielding better 
performance than the baseline system using 
single words alone.
