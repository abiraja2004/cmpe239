In this paper, we present a clustering exper-
iment directed at the acquisition of semantic
classes for adjectives in Catalan, using only
shallow distributional features.
We define a broad-coverage classification for
adjectives based on Ontological Semantics. We
classify along two parameters (number of ar-
guments and ontological kind of denotation),
achieving reliable agreement results among hu-
man judges. The clustering procedure achieves
a comparable agreement score for one of the pa-
rameters, and a little lower for the other.
