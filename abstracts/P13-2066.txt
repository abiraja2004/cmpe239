 
Rhetorical structure theory (RST) is widely 
used for discourse understanding, which repre-
sents a discourse as a hierarchically semantic 
structure. In this paper, we propose a novel 
translation framework with the help of RST. In 
our framework, the translation process mainly 
includes three steps: 1) Source RST-tree ac-
quisition: a source sentence is parsed into an 
RST tree; 2) Rule extraction: translation rules 
are extracted from the source tree and the tar-
get string via bilingual word alignment; 3) 
RST-based translation: the source RST-tree 
is translated with translation rules. Experi-
ments on Chinese-to-English show that our 
RST-based approach achieves improvements 
of 2.3/0.77/1.43 BLEU points on 
NIST04/NIST05/CWMT2008 respectively.
