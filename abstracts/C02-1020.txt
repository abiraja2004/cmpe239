This paper proposes a learning and extracting
method of word sequence correspondences from
non-aligned parallel corpora with Support Vector
Machines, which have high ability of the generaliza-
tion, rarely cause over-fit for training samples and
can learn dependencies of features by using a kernel
function. Our method uses features for the trans-
lation model which use the translation dictionary,
the number of words, part-of-speech, constituent
words and neighbor words. Experiment results in
which Japanese and English parallel corpora are
used archived 81.1 % precision rate and 69.0 % re-
call rate of the extracted word sequence correspon-
dences. This demonstrates that our method could
reduce the cost for making translation dictionaries.
