Although research in other languages is in-
creasing, much of the work in subjectivity
analysis has been applied to English data,
mainly due to the large body of electronic re-
sources and tools that are available for this lan-
guage. In this paper, we propose and evalu-
ate methods that can be employed to transfer a
repository of subjectivity resources across lan-
guages. Specifically, we attempt to leverage
on the resources available for English and, by
employing machine translation, generate re-
sources for subjectivity analysis in other lan-
guages. Through comparative evaluations on
two different languages (Romanian and Span-
ish), we show that automatic translation is a
viable alternative for the construction of re-
sources and tools for subjectivity analysis in
a new target language.
