 
     In this paper, we will compare and evaluate the 
effectiveness of different statistical methods in the 
task of cross-document coreference resolution. We 
created entity models for different test sets and 
compare the following disambiguation and 
clustering techniques to cluster the entity models in 
order to create coreference chains: 
Incremental Vector Space  
KL-Divergence 
Agglomerative Vector Space
