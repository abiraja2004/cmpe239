We describe ongoing work aiming at de-
riving a multilingual controlled vocabulary
(German, French, Italian) from the com-
bined subject indices from 22 volumes of
a large-scale critical edition of historical
documents. The controlled vocabulary is
intended to support editors in assigning de-
scriptors to new documents and to support
users in retrieving documents of interest re-
gardless of the spelling or language variety
used in the documents.
