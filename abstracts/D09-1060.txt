This paper presents a simple and effective
approach to improve dependency parsing
by using subtrees from auto-parsed data.
First, we use a baseline parser to parse
large-scale unannotated data. Then we ex-
tract subtrees from dependency parse trees
in the auto-parsed data. Finally, we con-
struct new subtree-based features for pars-
ing algorithms. To demonstrate the ef-
fectiveness of our proposed approach, we
present the experimental results on the En-
glish Penn Treebank and the Chinese Penn
Treebank. These results show that our ap-
proach significantly outperforms baseline
systems. And, it achieves the best accu-
racy for the Chinese data and an accuracy
which is competitive with the best known
systems for the English data.
