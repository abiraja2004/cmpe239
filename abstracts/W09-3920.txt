There is a long history of using logic to
model the interpretation of indirect speech
acts. Classical logical inference, how-
ever, is unable to deal with the combina-
tions of disparate, conflicting, uncertain
evidence that shape such speech acts in
discourse. We propose to address this by
combining logical inference with proba-
bilistic methods. We focus on responses
to polar questions with the following prop-
erty: they are neither yes nor no, but
they convey information that can be used
to infer such an answer with some de-
gree of confidence, though often not with
enough confidence to count as resolving.
We present a novel corpus study and asso-
ciated typology that aims to situate these
responses in the broader class of indirect
question?answer pairs (IQAPs). We then
model the different types of IQAPs using
Markov logic networks, which combine
first-order logic with probabilities, empha-
sizing the ways in which this approach al-
lows us to model inferential uncertainty
about both the context of utterance and in-
tended meanings.
