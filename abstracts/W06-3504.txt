This paper investigates how to extend cov-
erage of a domain independent lexicon tai-
lored for natural language understanding.
We introduce two algorithms for adding
lexical entries from VERBNET to the lexi-
con of the TRIPS spoken dialogue system.
We report results on the efficiency of the
method, discussing in particular precision
versus coverage issues and implications
for mapping to other lexical databases.
