This research studies the text genre of mes-
sage board forums, which contain a mix-
ture of expository sentences that present fac-
tual information and conversational sentences
that include communicative acts between the
writer and readers. Our goal is to create
sentence classifiers that can identify whether
a sentence contains a speech act, and can
recognize sentences containing four different
speech act classes: Commissives, Directives,
Expressives, and Representatives. We con-
duct experiments using a wide variety of fea-
tures, including lexical and syntactic features,
speech act word lists from external resources,
and domain-specific semantic class features.
We evaluate our results on a collection of mes-
sage board posts in the domain of veterinary
medicine.
