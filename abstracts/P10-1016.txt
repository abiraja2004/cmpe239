Machine Translation (PB-SMT) systems starts 
from automatically word aligned parallel cor-
pus. But word appears to be too fine-grained 
in some cases such as non-compositional 
phrasal equivalences, where no clear word 
alignments exist. Using words as inputs to PB-
SMT pipeline has inborn deficiency. This pa-
per proposes pseudo-word as a new start point 
for PB-SMT pipeline. Pseudo-word is a kind 
of basic multi-word expression that character-
izes minimal sequence of consecutive words in 
sense of translation. By casting pseudo-word 
searching problem into a parsing framework, 
we search for pseudo-words in a monolingual 
way and a bilingual synchronous way. Ex-
periments show that pseudo-word significantly 
outperforms word for PB-SMT model in both 
travel translation domain and news translation 
domain.
