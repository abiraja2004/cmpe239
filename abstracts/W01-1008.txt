This paper describes a fully imple-
mented system for fusing related news
stories into a single comprehensive de-
scription of an event. The basic compo-
nents and the underlying algorithm are
explained. The system uses a compu-
tationally feasible and robust notion of
entailment for comparing information
stemming from different documents.
We discuss the issue of evaluating doc-
ument fusion and provide some prelim-
inary results.
