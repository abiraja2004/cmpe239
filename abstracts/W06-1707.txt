 
This paper presents a new approach and a 
software for collecting specialized cor-
pora on the Web. This approach takes 
advantage of a very popular  XML-based 
norm used on the Web for sharing con-
tent among websites: RSS (Really Simple 
Syndication). After a brief introduction to 
RSS, we explain the interest of this type 
of data sources in the framework of cor-
pus development. Finally, we present 
Corporator, an Open Source software 
which was designed for collecting corpus 
from RSS feeds.
