Query expansion consists in extending
user queries with related terms in order
to solve the lexical gap problem in Infor-
mation Retrieval and Question Answer-
ing. The main difficulty lies in identi-
fying relevant expansion terms in order
to prevent query drift. We propose to
use definition clusters built from a com-
bination of English lexical resources for
query expansion. We apply the technique
of pseudo relevance feedback to obtain
expansion terms from definition clusters.
We show that this expansion method out-
performs both local feedback, based on
the document collection, and expansion
with WordNet synonyms, for the task of
document retrieval in Question Answer-
ing.
