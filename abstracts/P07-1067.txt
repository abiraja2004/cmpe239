Semantic relatedness is a very important fac-
tor for the coreference resolution task. To
obtain this semantic information, corpus-
based approaches commonly leverage pat-
terns that can express a specific semantic
relation. The patterns, however, are de-
signed manually and thus are not necessar-
ily the most effective ones in terms of ac-
curacy and breadth. To deal with this prob-
lem, in this paper we propose an approach
that can automatically find the effective pat-
terns for coreference resolution. We explore
how to automatically discover and evaluate
patterns, and how to exploit the patterns to
obtain the semantic relatedness information.
The evaluation on ACE data set shows that
the pattern based semantic information is
helpful for coreference resolution.
