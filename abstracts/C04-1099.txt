We report on the development of a cross lan-
guage information retrieval system, which
translates user queries by categorizing these
queries into terms listed in a controlled vo-
cabulary. Unlike usual automatic text cat-
egorization systems, which rely on data-
intensive models induced from large train-
ing data, our automatic text categorization
tool applies data-independent classifiers: a
vector-space engine and a pattern matcher
are combined to improve ranking of Med-
ical Subject Headings (MeSH). The cate-
gorizer also benefits from the availability
of large thesauri, where variants of MeSH
terms can be found. For evaluation, we use
an English collection of MedLine records:
OHSUMED. French OHSUMED queries -
translated from the original English queries
by domain experts- are mapped into French
MeSH terms; then we use the MeSH con-
trolled vocabulary as interlingua to trans-
late French MeSH terms into English MeSH
terms, which are finally used to query the
OHSUMED document collection. The first
part of the study focuses on the text to
MeSH categorization task. We use a set
of MedLine abstracts as input documents
in order to tune the categorization system.
The second part compares the performance
of a machine translation-based cross lan-
guage information retrieval (CLIR) system
with the categorization-based system: the
former results in a CLIR ratio close to 60%,
while the latter achieves a ratio above 80%.
A final experiment, which combines both
approaches, achieves a result above 90%.
