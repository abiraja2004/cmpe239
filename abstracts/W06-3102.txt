This paper presents some very prelimi-
nary results for and problems in develop-
ing a statistical machine translation sys-
tem from English to Turkish. Starting with
a baseline word model trained from about
20K aligned sentences, we explore various
ways of exploiting morphological struc-
ture to improve upon the baseline sys-
tem. As Turkish is a language with com-
plex agglutinative word structures, we ex-
periment with morphologically segmented
and disambiguated versions of the parallel
texts in order to also uncover relations be-
tween morphemes and function words in
one language with morphemes and func-
tions words in the other, in addition to re-
lations between open class content words.
Morphological segmentation on the Turk-
ish side also conflates the statistics from
allomorphs so that sparseness can be al-
leviated to a certain extent. We find
that this approach coupled with a simple
grouping of most frequent morphemes and
function words on both sides improve the
BLEU score from the baseline of 0.0752
to 0.0913 with the small training data. We
close with a discussion on why one should
not expect distortion parameters to model
word-local morpheme ordering and that a
new approach to handling complex mor-
photactics is needed.
