Previous research has shown that syntactic
features are the most informative features
in automatic verb classification. We exper-
iment with a new, rich feature set, extracted
from a large automatically acquired subcate-
gorisation lexicon for English, which incor-
porates information about arguments as well
as adjuncts. We evaluate this feature set us-
ing a set of supervised classifiers, most of
which are new to the task. The best classi-
fier (based on Maximum Entropy) yields the
promising accuracy of 60.1% in classifying
204 verbs to 17 Levin (1993) classes. We
discuss the impact of this result on the state-
of-art, and propose avenues for future work.
