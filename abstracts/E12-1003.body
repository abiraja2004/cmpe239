We introduce two Bayesian models for un-
supervised semantic role labeling (SRL)
task. The models treat SRL as clustering
of syntactic signatures of arguments with
clusters corresponding to semantic roles.
The first model induces these clusterings
independently for each predicate, exploit-
ing the Chinese Restaurant Process (CRP)
as a prior. In a more refined hierarchical
model, we inject the intuition that the clus-
terings are similar across different predi-
cates, even though they are not necessar-
ily identical. This intuition is encoded as
a distance-dependent CRP with a distance
between two syntactic signatures indicating
how likely they are to correspond to a single
semantic role. These distances are automat-
ically induced within the model and shared
across predicates. Both models achieve
state-of-the-art results when evaluated on
PropBank, with the coupled model consis-
tently outperforming the factored counter-
part in all experimental set-ups.
