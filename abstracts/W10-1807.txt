This article details a series of carefully de-
signed experiments aiming at evaluating
the influence of automatic pre-annotation
on the manual part-of-speech annotation
of a corpus, both from the quality and the
time points of view, with a specific atten-
tion drawn to biases. For this purpose, we
manually annotated parts of the Penn Tree-
bank corpus (Marcus et al, 1993) under
various experimental setups, either from
scratch or using various pre-annotations.
These experiments confirm and detail the
gain in quality observed before (Marcus et
al., 1993; Dandapat et al, 2009; Rehbein
et al, 2009), while showing that biases do
appear and should be taken into account.
They finally demonstrate that even a not
so accurate tagger can help improving an-
notation speed.
