Previous work on statistical language gen-
eration has primarily focused on grammat-
icality and naturalness, scoring generation
possibilities according to a language model
or user feedback. More recent work has
investigated data-driven techniques for con-
trolling linguistic style without overgenera-
tion, by reproducing variation dimensions ex-
tracted from corpora. Another line of work
has produced handcrafted rule-based systems
to control specific stylistic dimensions, such
as politeness and personality. This paper
describes a novel approach that automati-
cally learns to produce recognisable varia-
tion along a meaningful stylistic dimension?
personality?without the computational cost
incurred by overgeneration techniques. We
present the first evaluation of a data-driven
generation method that projects multiple per-
sonality traits simultaneously and on a contin-
uous scale. We compare our performance to a
rule-based generator in the same domain.
