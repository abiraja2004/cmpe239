 
This paper proposes an approach using 
large scale case structures, which are 
automatically constructed from both a 
small tagged corpus and a large raw cor-
pus, to improve Chinese dependency 
parsing. The case structure proposed in 
this paper has two characteristics: (1) it 
relaxes the predicate of a case structure to 
be all types of words which behaves as a 
head; (2) it is not categorized by semantic 
roles but marked by the neighboring 
modifiers attached to a head. Experimen-
tal results based on Penn Chinese Tree-
bank show the proposed approach 
achieved 87.26% on unlabeled attach-
ment score, which significantly outper-
formed the baseline parser without using 
case structures.
