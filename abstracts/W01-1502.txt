This short paper presents some mo-
tivations behind the organization of
the ACL/EACL01 ?Workshop on Shar-
ing Tools and Resources for Research
and Education?, concentrating on the
possible connection of Tools and Re-
sources repositories. Taking some pa-
pers printed in this volume and the ACL
Natural Language Software Registry as
a basis, we outline some of the steps to
be done on the side of NLP tool reposi-
tories in order to achieve this goal.
