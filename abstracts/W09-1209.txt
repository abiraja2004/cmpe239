This paper describes our system about mul-
tilingual syntactic and semantic dependency
parsing for our participation in the joint task
of CoNLL-2009 shared tasks. Our system
uses rich features and incorporates various in-
tegration technologies. The system is evalu-
ated on in-domain and out-of-domain evalu-
ation data of closed challenge of joint task.
For in-domain evaluation, our system ranks
the second for the average macro labeled F1 of
all seven languages, 82.52% (only about 0.1%
worse than the best system), and the first for
English with macro labeled F1 87.69%. And
for out-of-domain evaluation, our system also
achieves the second for average score of all
three languages.
