In this paper, we present a question-
answering system on the Web which aims
at generating intelligent answers to numer-
ical questions. These answers are gener-
ated in a cooperative way: besides a direct
answer, comments are generated to ex-
plain to the user the variation of numerical
data extracted from the Web. We present
the content determination and realisation
tasks. We also present some elements of
evaluation with respect to end-users.
