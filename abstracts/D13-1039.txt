This paper introduces a method for extract-
ing fine-grained class labels (?countries with
double taxation agreements with india?) from
Web search queries. The class labels are more
numerous and more diverse than those pro-
duced by current extraction methods. Also
extracted are representative sets of instances
(singapore, united kingdom) for the class la-
bels.
