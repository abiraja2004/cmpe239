This paper describes a lexicon organized around sys-
tematic polysemy: a set of word senses that are
related in systematic and predictable ways. The
lexicon is derived by a fully automatic extraction
method which utilizes a clustering technique called
tree-cut. We compare our lexicon to WordNet
cousins, and the inter-annotator disagreement ob-
served between WordNet Semcor and DSO corpora.
