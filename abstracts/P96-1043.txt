 
Words unknown to the lexicon present a 
substantial problem to part-of-speech tag- 
ging. In this paper we present a technique 
for fully unsupervised statistical acquisi- 
tion of rules which guess possible parts- 
of-speech for unknown words. Three com- 
plementary sets of word-guessing rules are 
induced from the lexicon and a raw cor- 
pus: prefix morphological rules, suffix mor- 
phological rules and ending-guessing rules. 
The learning was performed on the Brown 
Corpus data and rule-sets, with a highly 
competitive performance, were produced 
and compared with the state-of-the-art.
