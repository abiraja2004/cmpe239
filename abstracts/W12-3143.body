 
This paper describes the PROMT submission 
for the WMT12 shared translation task. We 
participated in two language pairs: English-
French and English-Spanish. The translations 
were made using the PROMT DeepHybrid 
engine, which is the first hybrid version of the 
PROMT system. We report on improvements 
over our baseline RBMT output both in terms 
of automatic evaluation metrics and linguistic 
analysis.
