 
Named Entity Recognition (NER) aims to 
classify each word of a document into prede-
fined target named entity classes and is nowa-
days considered to be fundamental for many 
Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks 
such as information retrieval, machine transla-
tion, information extraction, question answer-
ing systems and others. This paper reports 
about the development of a NER system for 
Bengali using Support Vector Machine 
(SVM). Though this state of the art machine 
learning method has been widely applied to 
NER in several well-studied languages, this is 
our first attempt to use this method to Indian 
languages (ILs) and particularly for Bengali. 
The system makes use of the different contex-
tual information of the words along with the 
variety of features that are helpful in predicting 
the various named entity (NE) classes. A por-
tion of a partially NE tagged Bengali news 
corpus, developed from the archive of a lead-
ing Bengali newspaper available in the web, 
has been used to develop the SVM-based NER 
system. The training set consists of approxi-
mately 150K words and has been manually 
annotated with the sixteen NE tags. Experi-
mental results of the 10-fold cross validation 
test show the effectiveness of the proposed 
SVM based NER system with the overall av-
erage Recall, Precision and F-Score of 94.3%, 
89.4% and 91.8%, respectively. It has been 
shown that this system outperforms other ex-
isting Bengali NER systems.
