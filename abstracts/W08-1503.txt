This paper proposes a novel integrated dialog
simulation technique for evaluating spoken di-
alog systems. Many techniques for simulat-
ing users and errors have been proposed for
use in improving and evaluating spoken dia-
log systems, but most of them are not easily
applied to various dialog systems or domains
because some are limited to specific domains
or others require heuristic rules. In this pa-
per, we propose a highly-portable technique for
simulating user intention, utterance and Au-
tomatic Speech Recognition (ASR) channels.
This technique can be used to rapidly build a
dialog simulation system for evaluating spo-
ken dialog systems. We propose a novel user
intention modeling and generating method that
uses a linear-chain conditional random field, a
data-driven domain specific user utterance sim-
ulation method, and a novel ASR channel sim-
ulation method with adjustable error recogni-
tion rates. Experiments using these techniques
were carried out to evaluate the performance
and behavior of previously developed dialog
systems designed for navigation dialogs, and
it turned out that our approach is easy to set up
and shows the similar tendencies of real users.
