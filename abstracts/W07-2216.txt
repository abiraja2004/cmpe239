In this paper we investigate several non-
projective parsing algorithms for depen-
dency parsing, providing novel polynomial
time solutions under the assumption that
each dependency decision is independent of
all the others, called here the edge-factored
model. We also investigate algorithms for
non-projective parsing that account for non-
local information, and present several hard-
ness results. This suggests that it is unlikely
that exact non-projective dependency pars-
ing is tractable for any model richer than the
edge-factored model.
