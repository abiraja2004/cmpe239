Likey is an unsupervised statistical ap-
proach for keyphrase extraction. The
method is language-independent and the
only language-dependent component is
the reference corpus with which the doc-
uments to be analyzed are compared.
In this study, we have also used an-
other language-dependent component: an
English-specific Porter stemmer as a pre-
processing step. In our experiments
of keyphrase extraction from scientific
articles, the Likey method outperforms
both supervised and unsupervised baseline
methods.
