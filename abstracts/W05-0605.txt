 
Traditionally, word sense disambiguation 
(WSD) involves a different context classifi-
cation model for each individual word. This 
paper presents a weakly supervised learning 
approach to WSD based on learning a word 
independent context pair classification 
model. Statistical models are not trained for 
classifying the word contexts, but for classi-
fying a pair of contexts, i.e. determining if a 
pair of contexts of the same ambiguous word 
refers to the same or different senses. Using 
this approach, annotated corpus of a target 
word A can be explored to disambiguate 
senses of a different word B. Hence, only a 
limited amount of existing annotated corpus 
is required in order to disambiguate the entire 
vocabulary. In this research, maximum en-
tropy modeling is used to train the word in-
dependent context pair classification model. 
Then based on the context pair classification 
results, clustering is performed on word men-
tions extracted from a large raw corpus. The 
resulting context clusters are mapped onto 
the external thesaurus WordNet. This ap-
proach shows great flexibility to efficiently 
integrate heterogeneous knowledge sources, 
e.g. trigger words and parsing structures. 
Based on Senseval-3 Lexical Sample stan-
dards, this approach achieves state-of-the-art 
performance in the unsupervised learning 
category, and performs comparably with the 
supervised Na?ve Bayes system.
