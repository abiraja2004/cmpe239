In this paper, we propose language-
specific methods of sentiment analysis in 
morphologically rich languages. In con-
trast of previous works confined to statis-
tical methods, we make use of various 
linguistic features effectively. In particu-
lar, we make chunk structures by using 
the dependence relations of morpheme 
sequences to restrain semantic scope of 
influence of opinionated terms. In con-
clusion, our linguistic structural methods 
using chunking improve the results of 
sentiment analysis in Korean news cor-
pus. This approach will aid sentiment 
analysis of other morphologically rich 
languages like Japanese and Turkish.
