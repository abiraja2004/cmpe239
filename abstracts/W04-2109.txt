 
In this paper, we present the design of a 
lexical resource focusing on German verb 
phrase idioms. The entry for a given idiom 
combines appropriate corpus examples with 
rich linguistic and lexicographic annotations, 
giving the user access to linguistic information 
coupled with the appropriate attested data and 
laying the groundwork for empirical, 
reproducible research.
