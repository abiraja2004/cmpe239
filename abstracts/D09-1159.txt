In this paper, we present a novel approach
for mining opinions from product reviews,
where it converts opinion mining task to
identify product features, expressions of
opinions and relations between them. By
taking advantage of the observation that a
lot of product features are phrases, a con-
cept of phrase dependency parsing is in-
troduced, which extends traditional depen-
dency parsing to phrase level. This con-
cept is then implemented for extracting re-
lations between product features and ex-
pressions of opinions. Experimental eval-
uations show that the mining task can ben-
efit from phrase dependency parsing.
