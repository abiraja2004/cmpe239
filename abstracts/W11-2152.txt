This paper describes an experiment in which
we try to automatically correct mistakes in
grammatical agreement in English to Czech
MT outputs. We perform several rule-based
corrections on sentences parsed to dependency
trees. We prove that it is possible to improve
the MT quality of majority of the systems par-
ticipating in WMT shared task. We made both
automatic (BLEU) and manual evaluations.
