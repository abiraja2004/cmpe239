A Progressive summary helps a user to moni-
tor changes in evolving news topics over a pe-
riod of time. Detecting novel information is
the essential part of progressive summariza-
tion that differentiates it from normal multi
document summarization. In this work, we
explore the possibility of detecting novelty at
various stages of summarization. New scoring
features, Re-ranking criterions and filtering
strategies are proposed to identify ?relevant
novel? information. We compare these tech-
niques using an automated evaluation frame-
work ROUGE, and determine the best. Over-
all, our summarizer is able to perform on par
with existing prime methods in progressive
summarization.
