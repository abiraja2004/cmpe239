Stemming from distributed representation the-
ories, we investigate the interaction between
distributed structure and distributional mean-
ing. We propose a pure distributed tree (DT)
and distributional distributed tree (DDT). DTs
and DDTs are exploited for defining dis-
tributed tree kernels (DTKs) and distributional
distributed tree kernels (DDTKs). We com-
pare DTKs and DDTKs in two tasks: approx-
imating tree kernels TK (Collins and Duffy,
2002); performing textual entailment recog-
nition (RTE). Results show that DTKs corre-
late with TKs and perform in RTE better than
DDTKs. Then, including distributional vec-
tors in distributed structures is a very difficult
task.
