We describe how paperXML, a logical docu-
ment structure markup for scholarly articles,
is generated on the basis of OCR tool out-
puts. PaperXML has been initially developed
for the ACL Anthology Searchbench. The
main purpose was to robustly provide uni-
form access to sentences in ACL Anthology
papers from the past 46 years, ranging from
scanned, typewriter-written conference and
workshop proceedings papers, up to recent
high-quality typeset, born-digital journal arti-
cles, with varying layouts. PaperXML markup
includes information on page and paragraph
breaks, section headings, footnotes, tables,
captions, boldface and italics character styles
as well as bibliographic and publication meta-
data. The role of paperXML in the ACL Con-
tributed Task Rediscovering 50 Years of Dis-
coveries is to serve as fall-back source (1) for
older, scanned papers (mostly published be-
fore the year 2000), for which born-digital
PDF sources are not available, (2) for born-
digital PDF papers on which the PDFExtract
method failed, (3) for document parts where
PDFExtract does not output useful markup
such as currently for tables. We sketch trans-
formation of paperXML into the ACL Con-
tributed Task?s TEI P5 XML.
