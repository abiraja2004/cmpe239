French researchers are required to fre-
quently translate into French the descrip-
tion of their work published in English. At
the same time, the need for French people
to access articles in English, or to interna-
tional researchers to access theses or pa-
pers in French, is incorrectly resolved via
the use of generic translation tools. We
propose the demonstration of an end-to-end
tool integrated in the HAL open archive for
enabling efficient translation for scientific
texts. This tool can give translation sugges-
tions adapted to the scientific domain, im-
proving by more than 10 points the BLEU
score of a generic system. It also provides
a post-edition service which captures user
post-editing data that can be used to incre-
mentally improve the translations engines.
Thus it is helpful for users which need to
translate or to access scientific texts.
