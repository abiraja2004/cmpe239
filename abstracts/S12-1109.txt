 
This paper describes our participation in the 
task denominated Cross-Lingual Textual En-
tailment (CLTE) for content synchronization. 
We represent an approach to CLTE  using 
machine translation to tackle the problem of 
multilinguality. Our system resides on ma-
chine learning and in the use of WordNet as 
semantic source knowledge. Results are very 
promising always achieving results above 
mean score.
