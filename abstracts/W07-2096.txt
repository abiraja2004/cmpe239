In this paper we are reporting the re-
sults obtained participating in the ?Eval-
uating Word Sense Induction and Dis-
crimination Systems? task of Semeval
2007. Our totally unsupervised system
performed an automatic self-term expan-
sion process by mean of co-ocurrence
terms and, thereafter, it executed the
unsupervised KStar clustering method.
Two ranking tables with different eval-
uation measures were calculated by the
task organizers, every table with two
baselines and six runs submitted by dif-
ferent teams. We were ranked third
place in both ranking tables obtaining a
better performance than three different
baselines, and outperforming the average
score.
