The tagging of biological entities, and in partic-
ular gene and protein names, is an essential step
in the analysis of textual information in Molec-
ular Biology and Biomedicine. The problem is
harder than was originally thought because of
the highly dynamic nature of the research area,
in which new genes and their functions are con-
stantly being discovered, and because of the lack
of commonly accepted standards. An impres-
sive collection of techniques has been used to
detect protein and gene names in the last four-
five years, ranging from typical NLP to purely
bioinformatics approaches. We explore here the
relationship between protein/gene names and
expressions used to characterize protein/gene
function. These expressions are captured in a
collection of patterns derived from an original
set of manually derived expressions, extended
to cover lexical variants and filtered with known
cases of association patterns/ names. Apply-
ing these patterns to a large collection of cu-
rated sentences, we found a significant number
of patterns with a very strong tendency to ap-
pear only in sentences in which a protein/gene
name is simultaneously present. This approach
is part of a larger effort to incorporate contex-
tual information so as to make biological infor-
mation less ambiguous.
