The sense of a preposition is related to the
semantics of its dominating prepositional
phrase. Knowing the sense of a prepo-
sition could help to correctly classify the
semantic role of the dominating preposi-
tional phrase and vice versa. In this pa-
per, we propose a joint probabilistic model
for word sense disambiguation of preposi-
tions and semantic role labeling of prepo-
sitional phrases. Our experiments on the
PropBank corpus show that jointly learn-
ing the word sense and the semantic role
leads to an improvement over state-of-the-
art individual classifier models on the two
tasks.
