This paper presents TIPSem, a system to
extract temporal information from natural
language texts for English and Spanish.
TIPSem, learns CRF models from training
data. Although the used features include
different language analysis levels, the ap-
proach is focused on semantic informa-
tion. For Spanish, TIPSem achieved the
best F1 score in all the tasks. For English,
it obtained the best F1 in tasks B (events)
and D (event-dct links); and was among
the best systems in the rest.
