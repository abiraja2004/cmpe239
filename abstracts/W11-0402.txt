This paper describes the modeling of
the morphosyntactic annotations of the
MULTEXT-East corpora and lexicons as
an OWL/DL ontology. Formalizing anno-
tation schemes in OWL/DL has the advan-
tages of enabling formally specifying in-
terrelationships between the various fea-
tures and making logical inferences based
on the relationships between them. We
show that this approach provides us with
a top-down perspective on a large set of
morphosyntactic specifications for multi-
ple languages, and that this perspective
helps to identify and to resolve concep-
tual problems in the original specifications.
Furthermore, the ontological modeling al-
lows us to link the MULTEXT-East spe-
cifications with repositories of annotation
terminology such as the General Ontol-
ogy of Linguistics Descriptions or the ISO
TC37/SC4 Data Category Registry.
