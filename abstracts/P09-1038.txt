An efficient decoding algorithm is a cru-
cial element of any statistical machine
translation system. Some researchers have
noted certain similarities between SMT
decoding and the famous Traveling Sales-
man Problem; in particular (Knight, 1999)
has shown that any TSP instance can be
mapped to a sub-case of a word-based
SMT model, demonstrating NP-hardness
of the decoding task. In this paper, we fo-
cus on the reverse mapping, showing that
any phrase-based SMT decoding problem
can be directly reformulated as a TSP. The
transformation is very natural, deepens our
understanding of the decoding problem,
and allows direct use of any of the pow-
erful existing TSP solvers for SMT de-
coding. We test our approach on three
datasets, and compare a TSP-based de-
coder to the popular beam-search algo-
rithm. In all cases, our method provides
competitive or better performance.
