We present the situated reference genera-
tion module of a hybrid human-robot in-
teraction system that collaborates with a
human user in assembling target objects
from a wooden toy construction set. The
system contains a sub-symbolic goal in-
ference system which is able to detect the
goals and errors of humans by analysing
their verbal and non-verbal behaviour. The
dialogue manager and reference genera-
tion components then use situated refer-
ences to explain the errors to the human
users and provide solution strategies. We
describe a user study comparing the results
from subjects who heard constant refer-
ences to those who heard references gener-
ated by an adaptive process. There was no
difference in the objective results across
the two groups, but the subjects in the
adaptive condition gave higher subjective
ratings to the robot?s abilities as a conver-
sational partner. An analysis of the objec-
tive and subjective results found that the
main predictors of subjective user satisfac-
tion were the user?s performance at the as-
sembly task and the number of times they
had to ask for instructions to be repeated.
