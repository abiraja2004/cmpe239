In this paper, we describe the state of our work on the possible deriva-
tion of ontological structures from textual analysis. We propose an ap-
proach to semi-automatic generation of domain ontologies from scratch,
on the basis of heuristic rules applied to the result of a multi-layered
processing of textual documents.
