 
In this paper we describe a person clus-
tering system for a given document set 
and report the results we have obtained 
on the test set of Chinese personal name 
(CPN) disambiguation task of CIPS-
SIGHAN 2010. This task consists of 
clustering a set of Xinhua news docu-
ments that mention an ambiguous CPN 
according to named entity in reality. 
Several features including named entities 
(NE) and common nouns generated from 
the documents and a variety of rules are 
employed in our system. This system 
achieves F = 86.36% with B_Cubed 
scoring metrics and F = 90.78% with pu-
rity_based metrics.
