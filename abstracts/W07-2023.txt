 
This system uses a background knowledge 
base to identify semantic relations between 
base noun phrases in English text, as eva-
luated in SemEval 2007, Task 4.  Training 
data for each relation is converted to state-
ments in the Scone Knowledge Representa-
tion Language.  At testing time a new 
Scone statement is created for the sentence 
under scrutiny, and presence or absence of 
a relation is calculated by comparing the 
total semantic distance between the new 
statement and all positive examples to the 
total distance between the new statement 
and all negative examples.
