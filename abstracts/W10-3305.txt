Current approaches of hypernymy ac-
quisition are mostly based on syntactic
or surface representations and extract
hypernymy relations between surface
word forms and not word readings.
In this paper we present a purely se-
mantic approach for hypernymy ex-
traction based on semantic networks
(SNs). This approach employs a set
of patterns
sub0(a1, a2) ? premise where the
premise part of a pattern is given by a
SN. Furthermore this paper describes
how the patterns can be derived by
relational statistical learning following
the Minimum Description Length prin-
ciple (MDL). The evaluation demon-
strates the usefulness of the learned
patterns and also of the entire hyper-
nymy extraction system.
