We address the problem of learning a
morphological automaton directly from
a monolingual text corpus without re-
course to additional resources. Like pre-
vious work in this area, our approach ex-
ploits orthographic regularities in a search
for possible morphological segmentation
points. Instead of affixes, however, we
search for affix transformation rules that
express correspondences between term
clusters induced from the data. This
focuses the system on substrings hav-
ing syntactic function, and yields cluster-
to-cluster transformation rules which en-
able the system to process unknown mor-
phological forms of known words accu-
rately. A stem-weighting algorithm based
on Hubs and Authorities is used to clar-
ify ambiguous segmentation points. We
evaluate our approach using the CELEX
database.
