 
This paper presents a new active learning 
paradigm which considers not only the 
uncertainty of the classifier but also the 
diversity of the corpus. The two measures 
for uncertainty and diversity were com-
bined using the MMR (Maximal Marginal 
Relevance) method to give the sampling 
scores in our active learning strategy. We 
incorporated MMR-based active machine-
learning idea into the biomedical named-
entity recognition system. Our experimen-
tal results indicated that our strategies for 
active-learning based sample selection 
could significantly reduce the human ef-
fort.
