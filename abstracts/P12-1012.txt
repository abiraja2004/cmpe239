Although much work on relation extraction
has aimed at obtaining static facts, many of
the target relations are actually fluents, as their
validity is naturally anchored to a certain time
period. This paper proposes a methodologi-
cal approach to temporally anchored relation
extraction. Our proposal performs distant su-
pervised learning to extract a set of relations
from a natural language corpus, and anchors
each of them to an interval of temporal va-
lidity, aggregating evidence from documents
supporting the relation. We use a rich graph-
based document-level representation to gener-
ate novel features for this task. Results show
that our implementation for temporal anchor-
ing is able to achieve a 69% of the upper
bound performance imposed by the relation
extraction step. Compared to the state of the
art, the overall system achieves the highest
precision reported.
