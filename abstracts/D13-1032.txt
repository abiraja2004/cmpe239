Training higher-order conditional random
fields is prohibitive for huge tag sets. We
present an approximated conditional random
field using coarse-to-fine decoding and early
updating. We show that our implementation
yields fast and accurate morphological taggers
across six languages with different morpho-
logical properties and that across languages
higher-order models give significant improve-
ments over 1st-order models.
