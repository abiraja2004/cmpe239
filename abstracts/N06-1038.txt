In order for relation extraction systems
to obtain human-level performance, they
must be able to incorporate relational pat-
terns inherent in the data (for example,
that one?s sister is likely one?s mother?s
daughter, or that children are likely to
attend the same college as their par-
ents). Hand-coding such knowledge can
be time-consuming and inadequate. Addi-
tionally, there may exist many interesting,
unknown relational patterns that both im-
prove extraction performance and provide
insight into text. We describe a probabilis-
tic extraction model that provides mutual
benefits to both ?top-down? relational pat-
tern discovery and ?bottom-up? relation
extraction.
