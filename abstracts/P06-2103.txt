We describe a generic framework for inte-
grating various stochastic models of dis-
course coherence in a manner that takes
advantage of their individual strengths. An
integral part of this framework are algo-
rithms for searching and training these
stochastic coherence models. We evaluate
the performance of our models and algo-
rithms and show empirically that utility-
trained log-linear coherence models out-
perform each of the individual coherence
models considered.
