In this paper, we describe the UKP Lab sys-
tem participating in the Semeval-2013 task
?Word Sense Induction and Disambiguation
within an End-User Application?. Our ap-
proach uses preprocessing, co-occurrence ex-
traction, graph clustering, and a state-of-the-
art word sense disambiguation system. We
developed a configurable pipeline which can
be used to integrate and evaluate other com-
ponents for the various steps of the complex
task.
