For a robot working in an open environment,
a task-oriented language capability will not
be sufficient. In order to adapt to the en-
vironment, such a robot will have to learn
language dynamically. We developed a Sys-
tem for Noun Concepts Acquisition from ut-
terances about Images, SINCA in short. It is
a language acquisition system without knowl-
edge of grammar and vocabulary, which learns
noun concepts from user utterances. We
recorded a video of a child?s daily life to
collect dialogue data that was spoken to and
around him. The child is a member of a fam-
ily consisting of the parents and his sister. We
evaluated the performance of SINCA using
the collected data. In this paper, we describe
the algorithms of SINCA and an evaluation
experiment. We work on Japanese language
acquisition, however our method can easily be
adapted to other languages.
