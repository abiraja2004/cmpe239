This paper computes the semantic rep-
resentation of while as the pragmati-
cally most relevant one which speak-
ers select from a variety of grammatical
constructions in which while may occur
in current English. The semantic repre-
sentation of while provides the condi-
tion for translating it into the adequate
German equivalent. This computation
is implemented in a unification?based
formalism and may thus be applied in a
machine translation system.
