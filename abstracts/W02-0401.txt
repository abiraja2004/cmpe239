A maximum entropy classier can be used
to extract sentences from documents. Ex-
periments using technical documents show
that such a classier tends to treat features
in a categorical manner. This results in per-
formance that is worse than when extract-
ing sentences using a naive Bayes classier.
Addition of an optimised prior to the max-
imum entropy classier improves perfor-
mance over and above that of naive Bayes
(even when naive Bayes is also extended
with a similar prior). Further experiments
show that, should we have at our disposal
extremely informative features, then max-
imum entropy is able to yield excellent re-
sults. Naive Bayes, in contrast, cannot ex-
ploit these features and so fundamentally
limits sentence extraction performance.
