 
We present a system that extracts knowledge 
from the textual content of documents.  
The acquired knowledge is represented through 
an associative network, that is dynamically 
updated by the integration of a contextualized 
structure representing the content of the new 
analysed document. 
Grounded on the basis of ?long term working 
memory? theory by W. Kintsch and K.A. Ericsson, 
our system makes use of a scale free graph model 
to update the final knowledge representation. 
This knowledge acquisition system has been 
validated by first experimental results.
