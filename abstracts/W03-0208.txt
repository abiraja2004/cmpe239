Latent semantic analysis (LSA) has been used
in several intelligent tutoring systems(ITS?s)
for assessing students? learning by evaluat-
ing their answers to questions in the tutoring
domain. It is based on word-document co-
occurrence statistics in the training corpus and
a dimensionality reduction technique. How-
ever, it doesn?t consider the word-order or
syntactic information, which can improve the
knowledge representation and therefore lead to
better performance of an ITS. We present here
an approach called Syntactically Enhanced
LSA (SELSA) which generalizes LSA by con-
sidering a word along with its syntactic neigh-
borhood given by the part-of-speech tag of its
preceding word, as a unit of knowledge repre-
sentation. The experimental results on Auto-
Tutor task to evaluate students? answers to ba-
sic computer science questions by SELSA and
its comparison with LSA are presented in terms
of several cognitive measures. SELSA is able
to correctly evaluate a few more answers than
LSA but is having less correlation with human
evaluators than LSA has. It also provides bet-
ter discrimination of syntactic-semantic knowl-
edge representation than LSA.
