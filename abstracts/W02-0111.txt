This paper presents a simple and ver-
satile tree-rewriting lexicalized grammar
formalism, TAGLET, that provides an ef-
fective scaffold for introducing advanced
topics in a survey course on natural lan-
guage processing (NLP). Students who
implement a strong competence TAGLET
parser and generator simultaneously get
experience with central computer science
ideas and develop an effective starting
point for their own subsequent projects in
data-intensive and interactive NLP.
