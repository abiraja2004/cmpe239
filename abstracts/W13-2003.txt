We participate in the BioNLP 2013 Shared
Task with Turku Event Extraction System
(TEES) version 2.1. TEES is a support
vector machine (SVM) based text mining
system for the extraction of events and re-
lations from natural language texts. In ver-
sion 2.1 we introduce an automated an-
notation scheme learning system, which
derives task-specific event rules and con-
straints from the training data, and uses
these to automatically adapt the system
for new corpora with no additional pro-
gramming required. TEES 2.1 is shown to
have good generalizability and good per-
formance across the BioNLP 2013 task
corpora, achieving first place in four out
of eight tasks.
