Question answering systems have been de-
veloped for many languages, but most re-
sources were created for English, which
can be a problem when developing a sys-
tem in another language such as French.
In particular, for question classification,
no labeled question corpus is available for
French, so this paper studies the possi-
bility to use existing English corpora and
transfer a classification by translating the
question and their labels. By translating
the training corpus, we obtain results close
to a monolingual setting.
