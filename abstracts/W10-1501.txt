In this paper we introduce the first version
of noWaC, a large web-based corpus of Bok-
m?l Norwegian currently containing about
700 million tokens. The corpus has been
built by crawling, downloading and process-
ing web documents in the .no top-level in-
ternet domain. The procedure used to col-
lect the noWaC corpus is largely based on
the techniques described by Ferraresi et al
(2008). In brief, first a set of ?seed? URLs
containing documents in the target language
is collected by sending queries to commer-
cial search engines (Google and Yahoo). The
obtained seeds (overall 6900 URLs) are then
used to start a crawling job using the Heritrix
web-crawler limited to the .no domain. The
downloaded documents are then processed in
various ways in order to build a linguistic cor-
pus (e.g. filtering by document size, language
identification, duplicate and near duplicate de-
tection, etc.).
