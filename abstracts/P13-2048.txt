We present IndoNet, a multilingual lexi-
cal knowledge base for Indian languages.
It is a linked structure of wordnets of
18 different Indian languages, Universal
Word dictionary and the Suggested Up-
per Merged Ontology (SUMO). We dis-
cuss various benefits of the network and
challenges involved in the development.
The system is encoded in Lexical Markup
Framework (LMF) and we propose mod-
ifications in LMF to accommodate Uni-
versal Word Dictionary and SUMO. This
standardized version of lexical knowledge
base of Indian Languages can now easily
be linked to similar global resources.
