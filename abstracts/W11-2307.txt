This paper describes the integration of com-
monly used screen readers, namely, NVDA
[NVDA 2011] and ORCA [ORCA 2011] with
Text to Speech (TTS) systems for Indian lan-
guages. A participatory design approach was
followed in the development of the integrated
system to ensure that the expectations of vi-
sually challenged people are met. Given that
India is a multilingual country (22 official lan-
guages), a uniform framework for an inte-
grated text-to-speech synthesis systems with
screen readers across six Indian languages are
developed, which can be easily extended to
other languages as well. Since Indian lan-
guages are syllable centred, syllable-based
concatenative speech synthesizers are built.
This paper describes the development and
evaluation of syllable-based Indian lan-
guage Text-To-Speech (TTS) synthesis sys-
tem (around festival TTS) with ORCA and
NVDA, for Linux and Windows environments
respectively. TTS systems for six Indian Lan-
guages, namely, Hindi, Tamil, Marathi, Ben-
gali, Malayalam and Telugu were built. Us-
ability studies of the screen readers were per-
formed. The system usability was evaluated
by a group of visually challenged people based
on a questionnaire provided to them. And
a Mean Opinion Score(MoS) of 62.27% was
achieved.
