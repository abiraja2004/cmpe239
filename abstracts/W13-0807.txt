Deciding whether a synchronous grammar
formalism generates a given word alignment
(the alignment coverage problem) depends on
finding an adequate instance grammar and
then using it to parse the word alignment. But
what does it mean to parse a word align-
ment by a synchronous grammar? This is for-
mally undefined until we define an unambigu-
ous mapping between grammatical deriva-
tions and word-level alignments. This pa-
per proposes an initial, formal characteriza-
tion of alignment coverage as intersecting two
partially ordered sets (graphs) of translation
equivalence units, one derived by a gram-
mar instance and another defined by the word
alignment. As a first sanity check, we report
extensive coverage results for ITG on auto-
matic and manual alignments. Even for the
ITG formalism, our formal characterization
makes explicit many algorithmic choices of-
ten left underspecified in earlier work.
