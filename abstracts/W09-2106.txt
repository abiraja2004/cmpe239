We present an application of Latent Semantic
Analysis to word sense discrimination within
a tutor for English vocabulary learning. We
attempt to match the meaning of a word in a
document with the meaning of the same word
in a fill-in-the-blank question. We compare
the performance of the Lesk algorithm to La-
tent Semantic Analysis. We also compare the
performance of Latent Semantic Analysis on a
set of words with several unrelated meanings
and on a set of words having both related and
unrelated meanings.
