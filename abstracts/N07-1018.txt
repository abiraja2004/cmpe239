This paper presents two Markov chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms for
Bayesian inference of probabilistic con-
text free grammars (PCFGs) from ter-
minal strings, providing an alternative
to maximum-likelihood estimation using
the Inside-Outside algorithm. We illus-
trate these methods by estimating a sparse
grammar describing the morphology of
the Bantu language Sesotho, demonstrat-
ing that with suitable priors Bayesian
techniques can infer linguistic structure
in situations where maximum likelihood
methods such as the Inside-Outside algo-
rithm only produce a trivial grammar.
