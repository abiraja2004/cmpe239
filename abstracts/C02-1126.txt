Many recent statistical parsers rely on a preprocess-
ing step which uses hand-written, corpus-specific
rules to augment the training data with extra infor-
mation. For example, head-finding rules are used
to augment node labels with lexical heads. In this
paper, we provide machinery to reduce the amount
of human effort needed to adapt existing models to
new corpora: first, we propose a flexible notation for
specifying these rules that would allow them to be
shared by different models; second, we report on an
experiment to see whether we can use Expectation-
Maximization to automatically fine-tune a set of
hand-written rules to a particular corpus.
