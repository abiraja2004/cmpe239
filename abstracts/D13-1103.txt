Passage retrieval is a crucial first step of au-
tomatic Question Answering (QA). While ex-
isting passage retrieval algorithms are effec-
tive at selecting document passages most sim-
ilar to the question, or those that contain
the expected answer types, they do not take
into account which parts of the document the
searchers actually found useful. We propose,
to the best of our knowledge, the first success-
ful attempt to incorporate searcher examina-
tion data into passage retrieval for question an-
swering. Specifically, we exploit detailed ex-
amination data, such as mouse cursor move-
ments and scrolling, to infer the parts of the
document the searcher found interesting, and
then incorporate this signal into passage re-
trieval for QA. Our extensive experiments and
analysis demonstrate that our method signif-
icantly improves passage retrieval, compared
to using textual features alone. As an addi-
tional contribution, we make available to the
research community the code and the search
behavior data used in this study, with the hope
of encouraging further research in this area.
