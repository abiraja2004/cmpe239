 
Main approaches to corpus-based seman-
tic class mining include distributional 
similarity (DS) and pattern-based (PB). 
In this paper, we perform an empirical 
comparison of them, based on a publicly 
available dataset containing 500 million 
web pages, using various categories of 
queries. We further propose a frequency-
based rule to select appropriate approach-
es for different types of terms.
