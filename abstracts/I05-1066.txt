. In this paper, we describe a method of automatically gener-
ating summary slides from a text. The slides are generated by itemizing
topic/non-topic parts that are extracted from the text based on syntac-
tic/case analysis. The indentations of the items are controlled according
to the discourse structure, which is detected by cue phrases, identifica-
tion of word chain and similarity between two sentences. Our experiments
demonstrates generated slides are far easier to read in comparison with
original texts.
