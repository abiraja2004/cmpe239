 
This paper presents a novel metric-based 
framework for the task of automatic taxonomy 
induction. The framework incrementally clus-
ters terms based on ontology metric, a score 
indicating semantic distance; and transforms 
the task into a multi-criteria optimization 
based on minimization of taxonomy structures 
and modeling of term abstractness. It com-
bines the strengths of both lexico-syntactic 
patterns and clustering through incorporating 
heterogeneous features. The flexible design of 
the framework allows a further study on which 
features are the best for the task under various 
conditions. The experiments not only show 
that our system achieves higher F1-measure 
than other state-of-the-art systems, but also re-
veal the interaction between features and vari-
ous types of relations, as well as the interac-
tion between features and term abstractness.
