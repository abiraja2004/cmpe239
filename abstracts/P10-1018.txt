Texts and dialogues often express infor-
mation indirectly. For instance, speak-
ers? answers to yes/no questions do not
always straightforwardly convey a ?yes?
or ?no? answer. The intended reply is
clear in some cases (Was it good? It was
great!) but uncertain in others (Was it
acceptable? It was unprecedented.). In
this paper, we present methods for inter-
preting the answers to questions like these
which involve scalar modifiers. We show
how to ground scalar modifier meaning
based on data collected from the Web. We
learn scales between modifiers and infer
the extent to which a given answer conveys
?yes? or ?no?. To evaluate the methods,
we collected examples of question?answer
pairs involving scalar modifiers from CNN
transcripts and the Dialog Act corpus and
use response distributions from Mechani-
cal Turk workers to assess the degree to
which each answer conveys ?yes? or ?no?.
Our experimental results closely match the
Turkers? response data, demonstrating that
meanings can be learned from Web data
and that such meanings can drive prag-
matic inference.
