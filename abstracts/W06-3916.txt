Mathematical understanding can be measured by a cognitive agent?s ability to ex-
plain itself, i.e., answer relevant questions about its mathematical activities. Two
inference techniques, rule-based inference and path-based inference, are applied
to an implemented computational cognitive agent using the SNePS knowledge-
representation, reasoning, and acting system.
