Graph-based methods that are en vogue
in the social network analysis area, such
as centrality models, have been recently
applied to linguistic knowledge bases, in-
cluding unsupervised Word Sense Disam-
biguation. Although the achievable accu-
racy is rather high, the main drawback of
these methods is the high computational
demanding whenever applied to the large
scale sense repositories. In this paper
an adaptation of the PageRank algorithm
recently proposed for Word Sense Dis-
ambiguation is presented that preserves
the reachable accuracy while significantly
reducing the requested processing time.
Experimental analysis over well-known
benchmarks will be presented in the paper
and the results confirm our hypothesis.
