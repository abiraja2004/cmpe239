 
This paper presents our systems for the 
participation of Chinese Personal Name 
Disambiguation task in the CIPS-
SIGHAN 2010. We submitted two dif-
ferent systems for this task, and both of 
them all achieve the best performance. 
This paper introduces the multi-stage 
clustering framework and some key 
techniques used in our systems, and 
demonstrates experimental results on 
evaluation data. Finally, we further dis-
cuss some interesting issues found dur-
ing the development of the system.
