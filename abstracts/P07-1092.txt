Current phrase-based SMT systems perform
poorly when using small training sets. This
is a consequence of unreliable translation es-
timates and low coverage over source and
target phrases. This paper presents a method
which alleviates this problem by exploit-
ing multiple translations of the same source
phrase. Central to our approach is triangula-
tion, the process of translating from a source
to a target language via an intermediate third
language. This allows the use of a much
wider range of parallel corpora for train-
ing, and can be combined with a standard
phrase-table using conventional smoothing
methods. Experimental results demonstrate
BLEU improvements for triangulated mod-
els over a standard phrase-based system.
