Textual records of business-oriented conver-
sations between customers and agents need
to be analyzed properly to acquire useful
business insights that improve productivity.
For such an analysis, it is critical to iden-
tify appropriate textual segments and ex-
pressions to focus on, especially when the
textual data consists of complete transcripts,
which are often lengthy and redundant. In
this paper, we propose a method to iden-
tify important segments from the conversa-
tions by looking for changes in the accuracy
of a categorizer designed to separate differ-
ent business outcomes. We extract effective
expressions from the important segments to
define various viewpoints. In text mining a
viewpoint defines the important associations
between key entities and it is crucial that the
correct viewpoints are identified. We show
the effectiveness of the method by using real
datasets from a car rental service center.
