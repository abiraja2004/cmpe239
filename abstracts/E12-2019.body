Data-driven approaches in computational
semantics are not common because there
are only few semantically annotated re-
sources available. We are building a
large corpus of public-domain English texts
and annotate them semi-automatically with
syntactic structures (derivations in Com-
binatory Categorial Grammar) and seman-
tic representations (Discourse Representa-
tion Structures), including events, thematic
roles, named entities, anaphora, scope, and
rhetorical structure. We have created a
wiki-like Web-based platform on which a
crowd of expert annotators (i.e. linguists)
can log in and adjust linguistic analyses in
real time, at various levels of analysis, such
as boundaries (tokens, sentences) and tags
(part of speech, lexical categories). The
demo will illustrate the different features of
the platform, including navigation, visual-
ization and editing.
