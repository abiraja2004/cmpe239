We present a system for deciding whether
a given sentence can be inferred from
text. Each sentence is represented as a
directed graph (extracted from a depen-
dency parser) in which the nodes repre-
sent words or phrases, and the links repre-
sent syntactic and semantic relationships.
We develop a learned graph matching ap-
proach to approximate entailment using
the amount of the sentence?s semantic
content which is contained in the text. We
present results on the Recognizing Textual
Entailment dataset (Dagan et al, 2005),
and show that our approach outperforms
Bag-Of-Words and TF-IDF models. In ad-
dition, we explore common sources of er-
rors in our approach and how to remedy
them.
