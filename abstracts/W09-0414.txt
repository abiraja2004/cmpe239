This study presents the TALP-UPC sub-
mission to the EACL Fourth Worskhop
on Statistical Machine Translation 2009
evaluation campaign. It outlines the ar-
chitecture and configuration of the 2009
phrase-based statistical machine transla-
tion (SMT) system, putting emphasis on
the major novelty of this year: combina-
tion of SMT systems implementing differ-
ent word reordering algorithms.
Traditionally, we have concentrated on
the Spanish-to-English and English-to-
Spanish News Commentary translation
tasks.
