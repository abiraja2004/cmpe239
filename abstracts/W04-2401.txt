Given a collection of discrete random variables
representing outcomes of learned local predic-
tors in natural language, e.g., named entities
and relations, we seek an optimal global as-
signment to the variables in the presence of
general (non-sequential) constraints. Examples
of these constraints include the type of argu-
ments a relation can take, and the mutual activ-
ity of different relations, etc. We develop a lin-
ear programming formulation for this problem
and evaluate it in the context of simultaneously
learning named entities and relations. Our ap-
proach allows us to efficiently incorporate do-
main and task specific constraints at decision
time, resulting in significant improvements in
the accuracy and the ?human-like? quality of
the inferences.
