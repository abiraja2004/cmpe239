Previous work on classifying information sta-
tus (Nissim, 2006; Rahman and Ng, 2011)
is restricted to coarse-grained classification
and focuses on conversational dialogue. We
here introduce the task of classifying fine-
grained information status and work on writ-
ten text. We add a fine-grained information
status layer to the Wall Street Journal portion
of the OntoNotes corpus. We claim that the
information status of a mention depends not
only on the mention itself but also on other
mentions in the vicinity and solve the task by
collectively classifying the information status
of all mentions. Our approach strongly outper-
forms reimplementations of previous work.
