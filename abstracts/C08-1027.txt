We present a novel approach to word
reordering which successfully integrates
syntactic structural knowledge with
phrase-based SMT. This is done by con-
structing a lattice of alternatives based
on automatically learned probabilistic
syntactic rules. In decoding, the alter-
natives are scored based on the output
word order, not the order of the input.
Unlike previous approaches, this makes it
possible to successfully integrate syntactic
reordering with phrase-based SMT. On
an English-Danish task, we achieve an
absolute improvement in translation qual-
ity of 1.1 % BLEU. Manual evaluation
supports the claim that the present ap-
proach is significantly superior to previous
approaches.
