Given the growing complexity of tasks
that spoken dialogue systems are trying to
handle, Reinforcement Learning (RL) has
been increasingly used as a way of au-
tomatically learning the best policy for a
system to make. While most work has
focused on generating better policies for
a dialogue manager, very little work has
been done in using RL to construct a better
dialogue state. This paper presents a RL
approach for determining what dialogue
features are important to a spoken dia-
logue tutoring system. Our experiments
show that incorporating dialogue factors
such as dialogue acts, emotion, repeated
concepts and performance play a signifi-
cant role in tutoring and should be taken
into account when designing dialogue sys-
tems.
