In word sense disambiguation, choosing
the most frequent sense for an ambigu-
ous word is a powerful heuristic. However,
its usefulness is restricted by the availabil-
ity of sense-annotated data. In this paper,
we propose an information retrieval-based
method for sense ranking that does not re-
quire annotated data. The method queries
an information retrieval engine to estimate
the degree of association between a word
and its sense descriptions. Experiments on
the Senseval test materials yield state-of-
the-art performance.We also show that the
estimated sense frequencies correlate reli-
ably with native speakers? intuitions.
