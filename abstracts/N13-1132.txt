Non-expert annotation services like Amazon?s
Mechanical Turk (AMT) are cheap and fast
ways to evaluate systems and provide categor-
ical annotations for training data. Unfortu-
nately, some annotators choose bad labels in
order to maximize their pay. Manual iden-
tification is tedious, so we experiment with
an item-response model. It learns in an un-
supervised fashion to a) identify which an-
notators are trustworthy and b) predict the
correct underlying labels. We match perfor-
mance of more complex state-of-the-art sys-
tems and perform well even under adversarial
conditions. We show considerable improve-
ments over standard baselines, both for pre-
dicted label accuracy and trustworthiness es-
timates. The latter can be further improved
by introducing a prior on model parameters
and using Variational Bayes inference. Ad-
ditionally, we can achieve even higher accu-
racy by focusing on the instances our model is
most confident in (trading in some recall), and
by incorporating annotated control instances.
Our system, MACE (Multi-Annotator Compe-
tence Estimation), is available for download1.
