In this paper, we describe our sys-
tem for Chinese personal name dis-
ambiguation task in the first CIPS-
SIGHAN joint conference on Chinese
Language Processing(CLP2010). We
use a pipeline approach, in which pre-
processing, unrelated documents dis-
carding, Chinese personal name exten-
sion and document clustering are per-
formed separately. Chinese personal
name extension is the most important
part of the system. It uses two addi-
tional dictionaries to extract full per-
sonal names in Chinese text. And then
document clustering is performed un-
der different personal names. Exper-
imental results show that our system
can achieve good performances.
