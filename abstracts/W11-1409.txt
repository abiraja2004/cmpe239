 
Research has shown that a number of 
factors, such as maturational constraints, 
previous language background, and 
attention, can have an effect on L2 
acquisition. One related issue that remains 
to be explored is what factors make an 
individual word more easily learned. In 
this study we propose that word 
complexity, on both the phonetic and 
semantic levels, affect L2 vocabulary 
learning. Two studies showed that words 
with simple grapheme-to-phoneme ratios 
were easier to learn than more 
phonetically complex words, and that 
words with two or fewer word senses 
were easier to learn that those with three 
or more.
