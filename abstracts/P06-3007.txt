 
We investigate independent and relevant 
event-based extractive mutli-document 
summarization approaches. In this paper, 
events are defined as event terms and as-
sociated event elements. With independ-
ent approach, we identify important con-
tents by frequency of events. With rele-
vant approach, we identify important 
contents by PageRank algorithm on the 
event map constructed from documents. 
Experimental results are encouraging.
