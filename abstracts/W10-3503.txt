This paper describes an on-going annota-
tion effort which aims at adding a man-
ual annotation layer connecting an exist-
ing annotated corpus such as the English
ACE-2005 Corpus to Wikipedia. The an-
notation layer is intended for the evalua-
tion of accuracy of linking to Wikipedia in
the framework of a coreference resolution
system.
