This paper introduces a graph-based algo-
rithm for sequence data labeling, using ran-
dom walks on graphs encoding label de-
pendencies. The algorithm is illustrated
and tested in the context of an unsuper-
vised word sense disambiguation problem,
and shown to significantly outperform the
accuracy achieved through individual label
assignment, as measured on standard sense-
annotated data sets.
