Pipeline computation, in which a task is
decomposed into several stages that are
solved sequentially, is a common compu-
tational strategy in natural language pro-
cessing. The key problem of this model
is that it results in error accumulation and
suffers from its inability to correct mis-
takes in previous stages. We develop
a framework for decisions made via in
pipeline models, which addresses these
difficulties, and presents and evaluates it
in the context of bottom up dependency
parsing for English. We show improve-
ments in the accuracy of the inferred trees
relative to existing models. Interestingly,
the proposed algorithm shines especially
when evaluated globally, at a sentence
level, where our results are significantly
better than those of existing approaches.
