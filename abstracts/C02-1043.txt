  
The relative logical scope of multiple 
modifiers within NP is often semantically 
significant.  This paper proposes a structurally 
based method for computing the relative scope 
of such modifiers, based on their order, type, 
and syntactic complexity.  The algorithm is 
language-neutral, in that it works with 
minimal errors for a wide range of languages 
without language-specific stipulations.
