This document overviews the strategy, ef-
fort and aftermath of the MultiLing 2013
multilingual summarization data collec-
tion. We describe how the Data Contrib-
utors of MultiLing collected and gener-
ated a multilingual multi-document sum-
marization corpus on 10 different lan-
guages: Arabic, Chinese, Czech, English,
French, Greek, Hebrew, Hindi, Romanian
and Spanish. We discuss the rationale be-
hind the main decisions of the collection,
the methodology used to generate the mul-
tilingual corpus, as well as challenges and
problems faced per language. This paper
overviews the work on Arabic, Chinese,
English, Greek, and Romanian languages.
A second part, covering the remaining lan-
guages, is available as a distinct paper in
the MultiLing 2013 proceedings.
