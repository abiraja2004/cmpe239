 
In this paper we demonstrate that it is 
possible to parse dependency structures 
deterministically in linear time using 
syntactic heuristic choices. We in'st prove 
theoretically that deterministic, linear 
parsing of dependency structures i possible 
under certain conditions. We then discuss a 
fully implemented parser and argue that 
those conditions hold for at least one natural 
language. Empirical data demonstrates that 
the parsing time is indeed linear. The present 
quality of the parser in terms of finding the 
right dependency structure for sentences i
about 85%.
