In this demonstration, we will showcase 
BBN?s Speech-to-Speech (S2S) transla-
tion system that employs novel interac-
tion strategies to resolve errors through 
user-friendly dialog with the speaker. 
The system performs a series of analysis 
on input utterances to detect out-of-
vocabulary (OOV) named-entities and 
terms, sense ambiguities, homophones, 
idioms and ill-formed inputs. This analy-
sis is used to identify potential errors and 
select an appropriate resolution strategy. 
Our evaluation shows a 34% (absolute) 
improvement in cross-lingual transfer of 
erroneous concepts in our English to Ira-
qi-Arabic S2S system.
