We investigate the problem of summarizing
text documents that contain errors as a result of
optical character recognition. Each stage in the
process is tested, the error effects analyzed, and
possible solutions suggested. Our experimental
results show that current approaches, which are
developed to deal with clean text, suffer signif-
icant degradation even with slight increases in
the noise level of a document. We conclude by
proposing possible ways of improving the per-
formance of noisy document summarization.
