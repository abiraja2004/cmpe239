The most critical issue in generating and
recognizing paraphrases is development
of wide-coverage paraphrase knowledge.
Previous work on paraphrase acquisition
has collected lexicalized pairs of expres-
sions; however, the results do not ensure
full coverage of the various paraphrase
phenomena. This paper focuses on pro-
ductive paraphrases realized by general
transformation patterns, and addresses the
issues in generating instances of phrasal
paraphrases with those patterns. Our prob-
abilistic model computes how two phrases
are likely to be correct paraphrases. The
model consists of two components: (i) a
structured N -gram language model that
ensures grammaticality and (ii) a distribu-
tional similarity measure for estimating se-
mantic equivalence and substitutability.
