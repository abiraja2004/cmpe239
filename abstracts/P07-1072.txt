This paper addresses the automatic classifi-
cation of semantic relations in noun phrases
based on cross-linguistic evidence from a
set of five Romance languages. A set
of novel semantic and contextual English?
Romance NP features is derived based on
empirical observations on the distribution
of the syntax and meaning of noun phrases
on two corpora of different genre (Europarl
and CLUVI). The features were employed
in a Support Vector Machines algorithm
which achieved an accuracy of 77.9% (Eu-
roparl) and 74.31% (CLUVI), an improve-
ment compared with two state-of-the-art
models reported in the literature.
