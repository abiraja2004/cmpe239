We describe a syntax-based algorithm that au-
tomatically builds Finite State Automata (word
lattices) from semantically equivalent transla-
tion sets. These FSAs are good representa-
tions of paraphrases. They can be used to ex-
tract lexical and syntactic paraphrase pairs and
to generate new, unseen sentences that express
the same meaning as the sentences in the input
sets. Our FSAs can also predict the correctness
of alternative semantic renderings, which may
be used to evaluate the quality of translations.
