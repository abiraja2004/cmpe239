In this paper, we propose forest-to-string
rules to enhance the expressive power of
tree-to-string translation models. A forest-
to-string rule is capable of capturing non-
syntactic phrase pairs by describing the cor-
respondence between multiple parse trees
and one string. To integrate these rules
into tree-to-string translation models, auxil-
iary rules are introduced to provide a gen-
eralization level. Experimental results show
that, on the NIST 2005 Chinese-English test
set, the tree-to-string model augmented with
forest-to-string rules achieves a relative im-
provement of 4.3% in terms of BLEU score
over the original model which allows tree-
to-string rules only.
