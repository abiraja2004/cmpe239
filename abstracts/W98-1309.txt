. We describe aconstraint-based morphological disambiguation system in which 
individual constraint rules vote on matching morphological parses followed by its im- 
plementation using finite state transducers. Voting constraint rules have a number of 
desirable properties: The outcome of the disambiguation is independent of the order of 
application of the local contextual constraint rules. Thus the rule developer is relieved 
from worrying about conflicting rule sequencing. The approach can also combine statis- 
tically and manually obtained constraints, and incorporate negative constraints hat rule 
out certain patterns. The transducer implementation has a number of desirable proper- 
ties compared to other finite state tagging and light parsing approaches, implemented 
with automata intersection. The most important of these is that since constraints do 
not remove parses there is no risk of an overzealous constraint "killing a sentence ~ by 
removing all parses of a token during intersection. After a description of our approach 
we present preliminary results from tagging the Wall Street Journal Corpus with this 
approach. With about 400 statistically derived constraints and about 570 manual con- 
straints, we can attain an accuracy of 97.82% on the training corpus and 97.29% on the 
test corpus. We then describe a finite state implementation f our approach and discuss 
various related issues.
