New Event Detection (NED) involves
monitoring chronologically-ordered news
streams to automatically detect the stories
that report on new events. We compare
two stories by finding three cosine simi-
larities based on names, topics and the full
text. These additional comparisons sug-
gest treating the NED problem as a bi-
nary classification problem with the com-
parison scores serving as features. The
classifier models we learned show statis-
tically significant improvement over the
baseline vector space model system on all
the collections we tested, including the lat-
est TDT5 collection.
The presence of automatic speech recog-
nizer (ASR) output of broadcast news in
news streams can reduce performance and
render our named entity recognition based
approaches ineffective. We provide a so-
lution to this problem achieving statisti-
cally significant improvements.
