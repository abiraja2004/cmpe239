A drug-drug interaction (DDI) occurs when
one drug affects the level or activity of another
drug. Semeval 2013 DDI Extraction challenge
is going to be held with the aim of identify-
ing the state of the art relation extraction algo-
rithms. In this paper we firstly review some of
the existing approaches in relation extraction
generally and biomedical relations especially.
And secondly we will explain our SVM based
approaches that use lexical, morphosyntactic
and parse tree features. Our combination of
sequence and tree kernels have shown promis-
ing performance with a best result of 0.54 F1
macroaverage on the test dataset.
