 
We describe a segmentation component that 
utilizes minimal syntactic knowledge to produce a
lattice of word candidates for a broad coverage 
Japanese NL parser. The segmenter is a finite 
state morphological nalyzer and text normalizer 
designed to handle the orthographic variations 
characteristic of written Japanese, including 
alternate spellings, script variation, vowel 
extensions and word-internal parenthetical 
material. This architecture differs from con- 
ventional Japanese wordbreakers in that it does 
not attempt to simultaneously attack the problems 
of identifying segmentation candidates and 
choosing the most probable analysis. To minimize 
duplication of effort between components and to 
give the segmenter greater fi'eedom to address 
orthography issues, the task of choosing the best 
analysis is handled by the parser, which has access 
to a much richer set of linguistic information. By 
maximizing recall in the segmenter and allowing a 
precision of 34.7%, our parser currently achieves a
breaking accuracy of ~97% over a wide variety of 
corpora.
