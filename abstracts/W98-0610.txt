 
This paper discusses 'head clustering', a novel, 
linguistically-motivated method for representing 
the aboutness of a document. First, a list of 
candidate significant topics consisting all simplex 
NPs is extracted from the document. Next, these 
NPs are clustered by head. Finally, a significance 
measure is obtained by ranking frequency of 
heads: those NPs with heads that occur with 
greater frequency in the document are more 
significant than NPs whose head occurs less 
frequently. An important strength of this technique 
is that it is  in principle domain-general. 
Furthermore, the output can be filtered in a variety 
of ways, both for automatic processing and for 
presentation tousers. 
In order to evaluate the head clustering 
method, an experiment was conducted in which 
judges were asked to rate three lists as to whether 
they conveyed a sense of the content of the article. 
The judges agreed that the list of simplex NPs 
with repeated heads was more helpful in 
representing the content of the full document than 
a list of keywords with a frequency of greater than 
one or than a list of repeated word sequences.
