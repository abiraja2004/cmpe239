Accurate phenotype mapping will play an im-
portant role in facilitating Phenome-Wide As-
sociation Studies (PheWAS), and potentially
in other phenomics based studies. The Phe-
WAS approach investigates the association be-
tween genetic variation and an extensive range
of phenotypes in a high-throughput manner to
better understand the impact of genetic varia-
tions on multiple phenotypes. Herein we de-
fine the phenotype mapping problem posed
by PheWAS analyses, discuss the challenges,
and present a machine-learning solution. Our
key ideas include the use of weighted Jaccard
features and term augmentation by dictionary
lookup. When compared to string similarity
metric-based features, our approach improves
the F-score from 0.59 to 0.73. With augmenta-
tion we show further improvement in F-score
to 0.89. For terms not covered by the dictio-
nary, we use transitive closure inference and
reach an F-score of 0.91, close to a level suffi-
cient for practical use. We also show that our
model generalizes well to phenotypes not used
in our training dataset.
