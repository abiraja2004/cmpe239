In this paper, a new method for automatic
cognate detection in multilingual wordlists
will be presented. The main idea behind the
method is to combine different approaches to
sequence comparison in historical linguistics
and evolutionary biology into a new frame-
work which closely models the most impor-
tant aspects of the comparative method. The
method is implemented as a Python program
and provides a convenient tool which is pub-
licly available, easily applicable, and open
for further testing and improvement. Testing
the method on a large gold standard of IPA-
encoded wordlists showed that its results are
highly consistent and outperform previous
methods.
