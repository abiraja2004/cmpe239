Natural-Language Generation from flat
semantics is an NP-complete problem.
This makes it necessary to develop al-
gorithms that run with reasonable effi-
ciency in practice despite the high worst-
case complexity. We show how to con-
vert TAG generation problems into de-
pendency parsing problems, which is use-
ful because optimizations in recent de-
pendency parsers based on constraint pro-
gramming tackle exactly the combina-
torics that make generation hard. Indeed,
initial experiments display promising run-
times.
