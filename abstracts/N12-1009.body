A citing sentence is one that appears in a sci-
entific article and cites previous work. Cit-
ing sentences have been studied and used in
many applications. For example, they have
been used in scientific paper summarization,
automatic survey generation, paraphrase iden-
tification, and citation function classification.
Citing sentences that cite multiple papers are
common in scientific writing. This observa-
tion should be taken into consideration when
using citing sentences in applications. For in-
stance, when a citing sentence is used in a
summary of a scientific paper, only the frag-
ments of the sentence that are relevant to the
summarized paper should be included in the
summary. In this paper, we present and com-
pare three different approaches for identifying
the fragments of a citing sentence that are re-
lated to a given target reference. Our methods
are: word classification, sequence labeling,
and segment classification. Our experiments
show that segment classification achieves the
best results.
