 
In this paper we propose a novel approach for 
ontology alignment and domain ontology extraction 
from the existing knowledge bases, WordNet and 
HowNet. These two knowledge bases are aligned to 
construct a bilingual ontology based on the co-
occurrence of the words in the sentence pairs of a 
parallel corpus. The bilingual ontology has the merit 
that it contains more structural and semantic 
information coverage from these two 
complementary knowledge bases. For domain-
specific applications, the domain specific ontology 
is further extracted from the bilingual ontology by 
the island-driven algorithm and the domain-specific 
corpus.  Finally, the domain-dependent 
terminologies and some axioms between domain 
terminologies are integrated into the ontology. For 
ontology evaluation, experiments were conducted 
by comparing the benchmark constructed by the 
ontology engineers or experts. The experimental 
results show that the proposed approach can extract 
an aligned bilingual domain-specific ontology.
