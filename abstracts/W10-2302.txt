The work described here aims to create
a wordnet automatically from a semantic
network based on terms. So, a cluster-
ing procedure is ran over a synonymy net-
work, in order to obtain synsets. Then, the
term arguments of each relational triple
are assigned to the latter, originating a
wordnet. Experiments towards our goal
are reported and their results validated.
