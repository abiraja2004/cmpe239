To summarize, the section has shown how conceptual level interpretation can 
be given the semantic structures proposed earlier in the paper. Any system that 
uses the semantic structures can also use the interpretations. Of course, the 
interpretations are baaed on one way of structuring plade objects. Since there 
are other ways, other interpretations are possible. 
X. Limitation, Summary, and Conclusions 
There are definite limits to the claims we wish to make. In this concluding 
section, we point out several half-solved and unsolved problems, one area where 
we could conceivably expand our claims, and then end with a summary and final 
defense. 
Metaphorical usages are i~lportant but difficult subjects for semantic 
representation. Things like "climbing the ladder of success" are far enough away 
from spatial reference to be ignorable. However, some SR phenomena appear to be 
metaphors: 
20.1 John yelled his greetings to John. 
In the above, an imaginary object, "his greetings", seems to be sent through 
space. In the.following, a hypothetical journey is referenced: 
10.2 The bridge goes from New York to New Jersey. 
Any direct representation of these phenomena using the definitions from the lasf 
section is unlikely since a non-instantaneous time interval must be present, 
while these sentences are basically instantaneous. My best suggestion is to 
represent these using the motional structures but to indicate by a function or 
operation applied to every appropriate f o a  that the actual sense is meta- 
phorical. Unfortunately, this leads to odious complexity. It is probably better 
to say our claims stop at this point. 
Many adverbial8 qan apply to modify SR'S or show spatial-like properties of 
events and states. We have no definite analyses for these, either. An 
incomplete study indicates that these may be analyzable within our model. For 
example, some forms can be shown as modifiers of a prepositional concept, such as 
in the following: 
-3 I put the ball completely under the car. 
Some seem to predicate place objects directly: 
10.4 I walked two miles. 
Others seem t o  coordinate with  SR's: 
10.5  Go s t r a i g h t  i n t o  t h e  house.  
Here " s t r a i g h t "  c a n  be shown a a  p r e d i c a t i n g  t h e  p a r t  of t h e  journey up t o  t h e  
t i m e  t h e  house was e n t e r e d .  However, I do no t  know how many o t h e r  terms remain t o  
be cons ide red .  
Two problems remain complete ly  unsolved.  The f i r s t  i nvo lves  r e l a t i ve  
motion.  
10.6 The a n t  walked over  t h e  r i s i n g  p i l e  of  dough.

In suampry, this paper has ahown how the .emantic rtructure of 8pati.l 
reference8 can be shown as locating events and states of affairs. within a 
semantic net, this has the form of showing a location ae an attribute of 
event/state nodes. In line with this, the concept of a place object, showing 
where events and states of affairs held at instances of time, was developed. 
Several functions were developed for use in predicating locations. Inferencing 
of spatial facts, the use of prepositional-like concepts for showing spatial 
relatibnships, and the overall semantic structure of utterances was also dis- 
cussed. 
Throughout the paper, the main jus tif ication has been that the analysis 
handles phenomena that other analyses do not. However, there are other j u r t i f i -  
cations. Only one source for space simplifies the modeling of spatial phenomena. 
Using only static forms simplifies the interpretation of spatial terms. Also, 
the use of static forms fits in with proposals for state-based semantic represen- 
tations (~ercone and Schubert, 1975). Finally, we can see that the analysis of 
)I semantic structures, in general, fits in with deeper" analyses of semantic 
structure such as Schank (1973) and Norman and Rumelhart (1975). In sum, there 
appears to be a strong case for the analysis.
