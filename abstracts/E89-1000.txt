Tutorial Abstracts 
Machine Translation 
Jun-ichi Tsujii (UMIST) 
MT systems developed so far are surveyed, and the basic characteristics 
of MT which distinguish it from other NLP applications are discussed. New trends in 
research such as telephone dialogue translation, knowledge-based MT etc. are also 
discussed. 
Discourse 
Bonnie Lynn Webber (U Penn) 
Discourse places two demands on a communicative agent: (1) the need to comprehend 
and produce multiple utterances, each being interpreted in the context of those 
preceding it, and (2) the need to treat utterances as intentional behavior. Both 
processes eem to be inherently computational. That is, to model changes in context 
and attention requires consideration of the side effects of understanding and producing 
utterances. Similarly, interpreting and responding to utterances as intentional behavior 
requires support for planning and plan inference. This tutorial explores emerging 
computational models and methods for both contextual and intentional aspects of 
discourse. 
Combinatory Categorial Grammars 
Mark Steedman (U Penn) 
The session will discuss a generalisation f Categorial Grammar based on the inclusion 
of a few syntactic operations related to "combinators", such as functional composition. 
The theory implies a radical revision of accepted notions of surface structure and 
constituency, with interesting implications for theories of the production and 
comprehension f spoken and written language. 
The theory will be presented in the first instance as a theory of syntactic ompetence, 
with particular attention to constructions involving coordination and unbounded 
dependency. Attention will be paid to certain universal properties of such 
constructions across languages. The discussion will then be widened to consider the 
implications of this theory of syntax for selected problems in prosody and intonation, 
incremental semantic interpretation, and processing.

The lexicon 
Bran Boguraev (Cambridge Computer Lab & IBM Yorktown Heights) 
Knowledge of and about words underlies all natural anguage processing tasks. This 
tutorial will focus on the complementary questions of content and format(s) of 
computational lexicons, after looking in some detail at the specific lexical requirements 
of natural language processing systems. 
In particular, we will study some recent developments in theories of grammar and 
lexical semantics, and observe the implications in the way they handle lexical 
information for the organization of computational lexicons. We will trace, through a 
number of illustrative examples, issues like formalization of lexical information, 
flexibility and extendability of lexicon formats, scaling up prototype lexical systems, 
and acquisition of lexical knowledge, and observe how these inter-relate during the 
process of designing lexical components for realistic natural language processing 
systems.

Current Issues in Computational Lexical Semantics 
James Pustejovsky 
Brandeis University 
Waltham, MA. USA 
Abstract 
In this talk I would like to address ome issues of major importance in lexical semantics. In particular, I
will discuss four topics relating to current research in the field: methodology, descriptive coverage, 
adequacy of the representation, and the computational usefulness of representations. In addressing these 
issues, I will discuss what I think are some of the central problems facing the lexical semantics 
community, and suggest ways of best approaching these issues. Finally, I outline a theory of lexical 
semantics embodying a richer notion of compositionality, termed cocomposition, which aims to spread 
the semantic load more evenly throughout the lexicon.
