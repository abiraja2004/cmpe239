We present a technique for refining a base-
line segmentation and generating a plausible
underlying morpheme segmentation by inte-
grating hand-written rewrite rules into an ex-
isting state-of-the-art unsupervised morpho-
logical induction procedure. Performance on
measures which consider surface-boundary
accuracy and underlying morpheme consis-
tency indicates this technique leads to im-
provements over baseline segmentations for
English and Turkish word lists.
