We describe QUEST, an open source
framework for machine translation quality
estimation. The framework allows the ex-
traction of several quality indicators from
source segments, their translations, exter-
nal resources (corpora, language models,
topic models, etc.), as well as language
tools (parsers, part-of-speech tags, etc.). It
also provides machine learning algorithms
to build quality estimation models. We
benchmark the framework on a number of
datasets and discuss the efficacy of fea-
tures and algorithms.
