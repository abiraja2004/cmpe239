 
Thai language text presents challenges 
for integration into large-scale multi-
language statistical machine translation 
(SMT) systems, largely stemming from 
the nominal lack of punctuation and in-
ter-word space. For Thai sentence break-
ing, we describe a monolingual maxi-
mum entropy classifier with features that 
may be applicable to other languages 
such as Arabic, Khmer and Lao. We ap-
ply this sentence breaker to our large-
vocabulary, general-purpose, bidirec-
tional Thai-English SMT system, and 
achieve BLEU scores of around 0.20, 
reaching our threshold of releasing it as a 
free online service.
