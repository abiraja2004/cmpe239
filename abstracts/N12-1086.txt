We present novel methods to construct com-
pact natural language lexicons within a graph-
based semi-supervised learning framework,
an attractive platform suited for propagating
soft labels onto new natural language types
from seed data. To achieve compactness,
we induce sparse measures at graph vertices
by incorporating sparsity-inducing penalties
in Gaussian and entropic pairwise Markov
networks constructed from labeled and unla-
beled data. Sparse measures are desirable for
high-dimensional multi-class learning prob-
lems such as the induction of labels on natu-
ral language types, which typically associate
with only a few labels. Compared to standard
graph-based learning methods, for two lexicon
expansion problems, our approach produces
significantly smaller lexicons and obtains bet-
ter predictive performance.
