 
This paper describes a new task to extract and 
align information networks from comparable 
corpora. As a case study we demonstrate the 
effectiveness of this task on automatically 
mining name translation pairs. Starting from a 
small set of seeds, we design a novel approach 
to acquire name translation pairs in a boot-
strapping framework. The experimental results 
show this approach can generate highly accu-
rate name translation pairs for persons, geo-
political and organization entities.
