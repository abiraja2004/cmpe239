We propose an open-domain question an-
swering system using Thai Wikipedia as
the knowledge base. Two types of in-
formation are used for answering a ques-
tion: (1) structured information extracted
and stored in the form of Resource De-
scription Framework (RDF), and (2) un-
structured texts stored as a search index.
For the structured information, SPARQL
transformed query is applied to retrieve a
short answer from the RDF base. For the
unstructured information, keyword-based
query is used to retrieve the shortest text
span containing the questions?s key terms.
From the experimental results, the system
which integrates both approaches could
achieve an average MRR of 0.47 based on
215 test questions.
