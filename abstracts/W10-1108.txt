 
We present a comparative study of Finnish and Swedish free-text nursing narratives from intensive care. Although the two languages are linguistically very dissimilar, our hypothe-sis is that there are similarities that are impor-tant and interesting from a language technology point of view. This may have im-plications when building tools to support pro-ducing and using health care documentation. We perform a comparative qualitative analysis based on structure and content, as well as a comparative quantitative analysis on Finnish and Swedish Intensive Care Unit (ICU) nurs-ing narratives. Our findings are that ICU nurs-ing narratives in Finland and Sweden have many properties in common, but that many of these are challenging when it comes to devel-oping language technology tools.
