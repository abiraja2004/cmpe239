We present the first system developed for auto-
mated grading of high school essays written in
Swedish. The system uses standard text qual-
ity indicators and is able to compare vocabu-
lary and grammar to large reference corpora of
blog posts and newspaper articles. The system
is evaluated on a corpus of 1 702 essays, each
graded independently by the student?s own
teacher and also in a blind re-grading process
by another teacher. We show that our system?s
performance is fair, given the low agreement
between the two human graders, and further-
more show how it could improve efficiency in
a practical setting where one seeks to identify
incorrectly graded essays.
