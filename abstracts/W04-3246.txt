The morphology of Semitic languages is unique in
the sense that the major word-formation mechanism
is an inherently non-concatenative process of inter-
digitation, whereby two morphemes, a root and a
pattern, are interwoven. Identifying the root of a
given word in a Semitic language is an important
task, in some cases a crucial part of morphological
analysis. It is also a non-trivial task, which many
humans find challenging. We present a machine
learning approach to the problem of extracting roots
of Hebrew words. Given the large number of po-
tential roots (thousands), we address the problem as
one of combining several classifiers, each predict-
ing the value of one of the root?s consonants. We
show that when these predictors are combined by
enforcing some fairly simple linguistics constraints,
high accuracy, which compares favorably with hu-
man performance on this task, can be achieved.
