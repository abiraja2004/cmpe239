The past decade has witnessed exciting work
in the field of Statistical Machine Translation
(SMT). However, accurate evaluation of its po-
tential in real-life contexts is still a questionable
issue.
In this study, we investigate the behavior of
an SMT engine faced with a corpus far differ-
ent from the one it has been trained on. We
show that terminological databases are obvious
resources that should be used to boost the per-
formance of a statistical engine. We propose
and evaluate a way of integrating terminology
into a SMT engine which yields a significant re-
duction in word error rate.
