Extracting tree transducer rules for syntac-
tic MT systems can be hindered by word
alignment errors that violate syntactic corre-
spondences. We propose a novel model for
unsupervised word alignment which explic-
itly takes into account target language con-
stituent structure, while retaining the robust-
ness and efficiency of the HMM alignment
model. Our model?s predictions improve the
yield of a tree transducer extraction system,
without sacrificing alignment quality. We
also discuss the impact of various posterior-
based methods of reconciling bidirectional
alignments.
