In this paper we tackle the problem of au-
tomatic caption generation for news im-
ages. Our approach leverages the vast re-
source of pictures available on the web
and the fact that many of them are cap-
tioned. Inspired by recent work in sum-
marization, we propose extractive and ab-
stractive caption generation models. They
both operate over the output of a proba-
bilistic image annotation model that pre-
processes the pictures and suggests key-
words to describe their content. Exper-
imental results show that an abstractive
model defined over phrases is superior to
extractive methods.
