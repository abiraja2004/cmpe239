 
It is well documented that people with severe speech and physical impairments (SSPI) often experience literacy difficulties, which hinder them from effectively using orthographic-based AAC systems for communication. To address this problem, phoneme-based AAC systems have been proposed, which enable users to access a set of spoken phonemes and combine phonemes into speech output. In this paper we investigate how prediction tech-niques can be applied to improve user perfor-mance of such systems. We have developed a phoneme-based prediction system, which sup-ports single phoneme prediction and pho-neme-based word prediction using statistical language models generated using a crowdsourced AAC-like corpus. We incorpo-rated our prediction system into a hypothetical 12-key reduced phoneme keyboard. A compu-tational experiment showed that our prediction system led to 56.3% average keystroke sav-ings. 1
