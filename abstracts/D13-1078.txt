We present an approach to time normalization
(e.g. the day before yesterday?2013-04-12)
based on a synchronous context free grammar.
Synchronous rules map the source language
to formally defined operators for manipulat-
ing times (FINDENCLOSED, STARTATENDOF,
etc.). Time expressions are then parsed using
an extended CYK+ algorithm, and converted
to a normalized form by applying the opera-
tors recursively. For evaluation, a small set
of synchronous rules for English time expres-
sions were developed. Our model outperforms
HeidelTime, the best time normalization sys-
tem in TempEval 2013, on four different time
normalization corpora.
