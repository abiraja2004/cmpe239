One of the central challenges in sentiment-
based text categorization is that not ev-
ery portion of a document is equally in-
formative for inferring the overall senti-
ment of the document. Previous research
has shown that enriching the sentiment la-
bels with human annotators? ?rationales?
can produce substantial improvements in
categorization performance (Zaidan et al,
2007). We explore methods to auto-
matically generate annotator rationales for
document-level sentiment classification.
Rather unexpectedly, we find the automat-
ically generated rationales just as helpful
as human rationales.
