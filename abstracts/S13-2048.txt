Our system combines text similarity measures
with a textual entailment system. In the main
task, we focused on the influence of lexical-
ized versus unlexicalized features, and how
they affect performance on unseen questions
and domains. We also participated in the pi-
lot partial entailment task, where our system
significantly outperforms a strong baseline.
