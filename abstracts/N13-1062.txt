Word sense disambiguation aims to identify
which meaning of a word is present in a given
usage. Gathering word sense annotations is a
laborious and difficult task. Several methods
have been proposed to gather sense annota-
tions using large numbers of untrained anno-
tators, with mixed results. We propose three
new annotation methodologies for gathering
word senses where untrained annotators are
allowed to use multiple labels and weight the
senses. Our findings show that given the ap-
propriate annotation task, untrained workers
can obtain at least as high agreement as anno-
tators in a controlled setting, and in aggregate
generate equally as good of a sense labeling.
