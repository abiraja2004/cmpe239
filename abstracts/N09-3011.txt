In machine transliteration we transcribe a
name across languages while maintaining its
phonetic information. In this paper, we
present a novel sequence transduction algo-
rithm for the problem of machine transliter-
ation. Our model is discriminatively trained
by the MIRA algorithm, which improves the
traditional Perceptron training in three ways:
(1) It allows us to consider k-best translitera-
tions instead of the best one. (2) It is trained
based on the ranking of these transliterations
according to user-specified loss function (Lev-
enshtein edit distance). (3) It enables the user
to tune a built-in parameter to cope with noisy
non-separable data during training. On an
Arabic-English name transliteration task, our
model achieves a relative error reduction of
2.2% over a perceptron-based model with sim-
ilar features, and an error reduction of 7.2%
over a statistical machine translation model
with more complex features.
