 
We use robust and fast Finite-State Machines 
(FSMs) to solve scriptural translation prob-
lems. We describe a phonetico-morphotactic 
pivot UIT (universal intermediate transcrip-
tion), based on the common phonetic reposito-
ry of Indo-Pak languages. It is also extendable 
to other language groups. We describe a finite-
state scriptural translation model based on fi-
nite-state transducers and UIT. We report its 
performance on Hindi, Urdu, Punjabi and Se-
raiki corpora. For evaluation, we design two 
classification scales based on the word and 
sentence accuracies for translation system 
classifications. We also show that subjective 
evaluations are vital for real life usage of a 
translation system in addition to objective 
evaluations.
