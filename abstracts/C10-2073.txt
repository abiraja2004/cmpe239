 
In this paper, we present an unsuper-
vised hybrid model which combines sta-
tistical, lexical, linguistic, contextual, 
and temporal features in a generic EM-
based framework to harvest bilingual 
terminology from comparable corpora 
through comparable document align-
ment constraint. The model is configur-
able for any language and is extensible 
for additional features. In overall, it pro-
duces considerable improvement in per-
formance over the baseline method. On 
top of that, our model has shown prom-
ising capability to discover new bilin-
gual terminology with limited usage of 
dictionaries.
