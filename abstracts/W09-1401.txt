The paper presents the design and implemen-
tation of the BioNLP?09 Shared Task, and
reports the final results with analysis. The
shared task consists of three sub-tasks, each of
which addresses bio-molecular event extrac-
tion at a different level of specificity. The data
was developed based on the GENIA event cor-
pus. The shared task was run over 12 weeks,
drawing initial interest from 42 teams. Of
these teams, 24 submitted final results. The
evaluation results are encouraging, indicating
that state-of-the-art performance is approach-
ing a practically applicable level and revealing
some remaining challenges.
