Hedge cues were detected using a super-
vised Conditional Random Field (CRF)
classifier exploiting features from the
RASP parser. The CRF?s predictions were
filtered using known cues and unseen in-
stances were removed, increasing preci-
sion while retaining recall. Rules for scope
detection, based on the grammatical re-
lations of the sentence and the part-of-
speech tag of the cue, were manually-
developed. However, another supervised
CRF classifier was used to refine these pre-
dictions. As a final step, scopes were con-
structed from the classifier output using a
small set of post-processing rules. Devel-
opment of the system revealed a number of
issues with the annotation scheme adopted
by the organisers.
