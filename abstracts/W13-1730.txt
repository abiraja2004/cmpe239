Our goal is to predict the first language (L1)
of English essays?s authors with the help of
the TOEFL11 corpus where L1, prompts (top-
ics) and proficiency levels are provided. Thus
we approach this task as a classification task
employing machine learning methods. Out
of key concepts of machine learning, we fo-
cus on feature engineering. We design fea-
tures across all the L1 languages not making
use of knowledge of prompt and proficiency
level. During system development, we experi-
mented with various techniques for feature fil-
tering and combination optimized with respect
to the notion of mutual information and infor-
mation gain. We trained four different SVM
models and combined them through majority
voting achieving accuracy 72.5%.
