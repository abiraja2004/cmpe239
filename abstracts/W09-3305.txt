Wikipedia?s article contents and its cate-
gory hierarchy are widely used to produce
semantic resources which improve perfor-
mance on tasks like text classification and
keyword extraction. The reverse ? using
text classification methods for predicting
the categories of Wikipedia articles ? has
attracted less attention so far. We propose
to ?return the favor? and use text classi-
fiers to improve Wikipedia. This could
support the emergence of a virtuous circle
between the wisdom of the crowds and ma-
chine learning/NLP methods.
We define the categorization of Wikipedia
articles as a multi-label classification task,
describe two solutions to the task, and per-
form experiments that show that our ap-
proach is feasible despite the high number
of labels.
