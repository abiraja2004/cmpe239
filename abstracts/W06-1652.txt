Lexical features are key to many ap-
proaches to sentiment analysis and opin-
ion detection. A variety of representations
have been used, including single words,
multi-word Ngrams, phrases, and lexico-
syntactic patterns. In this paper, we use a
subsumption hierarchy to formally define
different types of lexical features and their
relationship to one another, both in terms
of representational coverage and perfor-
mance. We use the subsumption hierar-
chy in two ways: (1) as an analytic tool
to automatically identify complex features
that outperform simpler features, and (2)
to reduce a feature set by removing un-
necessary features. We show that reduc-
ing the feature set improves performance
on three opinion classification tasks, espe-
cially when combined with traditional fea-
ture selection.
