We extend the popular entity grid representa-
tion for local coherence modeling. The grid
abstracts away information about the entities it
models; we add discourse prominence, named
entity type and coreference features to distin-
guish between important and unimportant en-
tities. We improve the best result for WSJ doc-
ument discrimination by 6%.
