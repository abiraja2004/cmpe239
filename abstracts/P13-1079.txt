Typical statistical machine translation sys-
tems are batch trained with a given train-
ing data and their performances are large-
ly influenced by the amount of data. With
the growth of the available data across
different domains, it is computationally
demanding to perform batch training ev-
ery time when new data comes. In face
of the problem, we propose an efficient
phrase table combination method. In par-
ticular, we train a Bayesian phrasal inver-
sion transduction grammars for each do-
main separately. The learned phrase ta-
bles are hierarchically combined as if they
are drawn from a hierarchical Pitman-Yor
process. The performance measured by
BLEU is at least as comparable to the tra-
ditional batch training method. Further-
more, each phrase table is trained sepa-
rately in each domain, and while compu-
tational overhead is significantly reduced
by training them in parallel.
