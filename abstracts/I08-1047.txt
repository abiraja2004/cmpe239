 
We propose a method for learning semantic 
categories of words with minimal supervi-
sion from web search query logs. Our me-
thod is based on the Espresso algorithm 
(Pantel and Pennacchiotti, 2006) for ex-
tracting binary lexical relations, but makes 
important modifications to handle query 
log data for the task of acquiring semantic 
categories. We present experimental results 
comparing our method with two state-of-
the-art minimally supervised lexical know-
ledge extraction systems using Japanese 
query log data, and show that our method 
achieves higher precision than the pre-
viously proposed methods. We also show 
that the proposed method offers an addi-
tional advantage for knowledge acquisition 
in an Asian language for which word seg-
mentation is an issue, as the method utiliz-
es no prior knowledge of word segmenta-
tion, and is able to harvest new terms with 
correct word segmentation.
