Complex questions that require inferencing
and synthesizing information from multiple
documents can be seen as a kind of topic-
oriented, informative multi-document summa-
rization. In this paper, we have experimented
with one empirical and two unsupervised
statistical machine learning techniques: k-
means and Expectation Maximization (EM),
for computing relative importance of the sen-
tences. However, the performance of these ap-
proaches depends entirely on the feature set
used and the weighting of these features. We
extracted different kinds of features (i.e. lex-
ical, lexical semantic, cosine similarity, ba-
sic element, tree kernel based syntactic and
shallow-semantic) for each of the document
sentences in order to measure its importance
and relevancy to the user query. We used a
local search technique to learn the weights of
the features. For all our methods of generating
summaries, we have shown the effects of syn-
tactic and shallow-semantic features over the
bag of words (BOW) features.
