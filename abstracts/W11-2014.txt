Conventional speech recognition ap-
proaches usually wait until the user
has finished talking before returning a
recognition hypothesis. This results in
spoken dialogue systems that are unable
to react while the user is still speaking.
Incremental Speech Recognition (ISR),
where partial phrase results are returned
during user speech, has been used to
create more reactive systems. However,
ISR output is unstable and so prone to
revision as more speech is decoded. This
paper tackles the problem of stability
in ISR. We first present a method that
increases the stability and accuracy of
ISR output, without adding delay. Given
that some revisions are unavoidable,
we next present a pair of methods for
predicting the stability and accuracy of
ISR results. Taken together, we believe
these approaches give ISR more utility for
real spoken dialogue systems.
