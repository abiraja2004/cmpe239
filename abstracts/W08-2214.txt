Idiom processing and reference resolution are two complex aspects of text
processing that are commonly treated in isolation. However, closer study
of the reference needs of some idioms suggests that these two phenom-
ena will need to be treated together to support high-endNLP applications.
Using evidence from Russian and English, this article describes a num-
ber of classes of idioms according to their reference needs and suggests a
method of lexical encoding which, supplemented by procedural semantic
routines, can adequately support the full semantic and referential inter-
pretation of these idioms.
