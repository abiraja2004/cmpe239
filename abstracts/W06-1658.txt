Entity annotation involves attaching a la-
bel such as ?name? or ?organization? to a
sequence of tokens in a document. All the
current rule-based and machine learning-
based approaches for this task operate at
the document level. We present a new
and generic approach to entity annotation
which uses the inverse index typically cre-
ated for rapid key-word based searching
of a document collection. We define a set
of operations on the inverse index that al-
lows us to create annotations defined by
cascading regular expressions. The entity
annotations for an entire document cor-
pus can be created purely of the index
with no need to access the original docu-
ments. Experiments on two publicly avail-
able data sets show very significant perfor-
mance improvements over the document-
based annotators.
