In the context of a hybrid French-to-
English SMT system for translating on-
line forum posts, we present two meth-
ods for addressing the common problem
of homophone confusions in colloquial
written language. The first is based on
hand-coded rules; the second on weighted
graphs derived from a large-scale pro-
nunciation resource, with weights trained
from a small bicorpus of domain language.
With automatic evaluation, the weighted
graph method yields an improvement of
about +0.63 BLEU points, while the rule-
based method scores about the same as the
baseline. On contrastive manual evalua-
tion, both methods give highly significant
improvements (p < 0.0001) and score
about equally when compared against each
other.
