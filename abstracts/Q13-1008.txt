Supervised learning methods and LDA based topic
model have been successfully applied in the field of
multi-document summarization. In this paper, we
propose a novel supervised approach that can in-
corporate rich sentence features into Bayesian topic
models in a principled way, thus taking advantages of
both topic model and feature based supervised learn-
ing methods. Experimental results on DUC2007,
TAC2008 and TAC2009 demonstrate the effective-
ness of our approach.
