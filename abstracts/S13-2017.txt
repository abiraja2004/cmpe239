In this paper we present our system for the
SemEval 2013 Task 5a on semantic similar-
ity of words and compositional phrases. Our
system uses a dependency-based vector space
model, in combination with a technique called
latent vector weighting. The system computes
the similarity between a particular noun in-
stance and the head noun of a particular noun
phrase, which was weighted according to the
semantics of the modifier. The system is en-
tirely unsupervised; one single parameter, the
similarity threshold, was tuned using the train-
ing data.
