 
 
News articles have always been a 
prominent force in the formation of a 
company?s financial image in the minds 
of the general public, especially the 
investors. Given the large amount of 
news being generated these days through 
various websites, it is possible to mine the 
general sentiment of a particular company 
being portrayed by media agencies over a 
period of time, which can be utilized to 
gauge the long term impact on the 
investment potential of the company. 
However, given such a vast amount of 
news data, we need to first separate 
corporate news from other kinds namely, 
sports, entertainment, science & 
technology, etc. We propose a system 
which takes news as, checks whether it is 
of corporate nature, and then identifies 
the polarity of the sentiment expressed in 
the news. The system is also capable of 
distinguishing the company/organization 
which is the subject of the news from 
other organizations which find mention, 
and this is used to pair the sentiment 
polarity with the identified company.
