A crucial step toward the goal of au-
tomatic extraction of propositional in-
formation from natural language text is
the identification of semantic relations
between constituents in sentences. We
examine the problem of distinguishing
among seven relation types that can oc-
cur between the entities ?treatment? and
?disease? in bioscience text, and the
problem of identifying such entities. We
compare five generative graphical mod-
els and a neural network, using lexical,
syntactic, and semantic features, finding
that the latter help achieve high classifi-
cation accuracy.
