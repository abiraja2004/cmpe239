 
We describe an extension to the technique 
for the automatic identification and label-
ing of sentiment terms described in Tur-
ney (2002) and Turney and Littman 
(2002). Their basic assumption is that 
sentiment terms of similar orientation 
tend to co-occur at the document level. 
We add a second assumption, namely that 
sentiment terms of opposite orientation 
tend not to co-occur at the sentence level. 
This additional assumption allows us to 
identify sentiment-bearing terms very re-
liably. We then use these newly identified 
terms in various scenarios for the senti-
ment classification of sentences. We show 
that our approach outperforms Turney?s 
original approach. Combining our ap-
proach with a Naive Bayes bootstrapping 
method yields a further small improve-
ment of classifier performance. We finally 
compare our results to precision and recall 
figures that can be obtained on the same 
data set with labeled data.
