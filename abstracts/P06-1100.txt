 
Many algorithms have been developed 
to harvest lexical semantic resources, 
however few have linked the mined 
knowledge into formal knowledge re-
positories. In this paper, we propose two 
algorithms for automatically ontologiz-
ing (attaching) semantic relations into 
WordNet. We present an empirical 
evaluation on the task of attaching part-
of and causation relations, showing an 
improvement on F-score over a baseline 
model.
