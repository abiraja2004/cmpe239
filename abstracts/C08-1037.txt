The paper offers a new type of approach
to the semantic phenomenon of adverbial
aspect shift within the framework of finite-
state temporal semantics. The heart of the
proposal is a supervaluational concept of
underspecification, and the idea of treat-
ing the meanings of temporal prepositions
as dynamic presuppositions. The simple
shifting algorithm used in the present ap-
proach derives the correct set of possible
readings on the basis of lexical semantic
input only, and, furthermore, may claim
cognitive plausibility.
