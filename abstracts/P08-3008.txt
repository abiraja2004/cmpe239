Even though collaboration in peer learning has
been shown to have a positive impact for stu-
dents, there has been little research into col-
laborative peer learning dialogues. We ana-
lyze such dialogues in order to derive a model
of knowledge co-construction that incorpo-
rates initiative and the balance of initiative.
This model will be embedded in an artificial
agent that will collaborate with students.
