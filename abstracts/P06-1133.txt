In this paper we investigate how to auto-
matically determine if two document col-
lections are written from different per-
spectives. By perspectives we mean a
point of view, for example, from the per-
spective of Democrats or Republicans. We
propose a test of different perspectives
based on distribution divergence between
the statistical models of two collections.
Experimental results show that the test can
successfully distinguish document collec-
tions of different perspectives from other
types of collections.
