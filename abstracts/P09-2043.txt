ty for a more effective aspect-based sentiment 
summary, and describe linguistic and ontolog-
ical clues that may affect such fine-grained po-
larity. We argue that relevance for satisfaction, 
contrastive weight clues, and certain adver-
bials work to affect the polarity, as evidenced 
by the statistical analysis.
