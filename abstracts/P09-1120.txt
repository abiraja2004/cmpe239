We consider the language identification
problem for search engine queries. First,
we propose a method to automatically
generate a data set, which uses click-
through logs of the Yahoo! Search En-
gine to derive the language of a query indi-
rectly from the language of the documents
clicked by the users. Next, we use this
data set to train two decision tree classi-
fiers; one that only uses linguistic features
and is aimed for textual language identi-
fication, and one that additionally uses a
non-linguistic feature, and is geared to-
wards the identification of the language
intended by the users of the search en-
gine. Our results show that our method
produces a highly reliable data set very ef-
ficiently, and our decision tree classifier
outperforms some of the best methods that
have been proposed for the task of written
language identification on the domain of
search engine queries.
