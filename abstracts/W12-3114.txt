We present the approach we took for our par-
ticipation to the WMT12 Quality Estimation
Shared Task: our main goal is to achieve rea-
sonably good results without appeal to super-
vised learning. We have used various simi-
larity measures and also an external resource
(Google N -grams). Details of results clarify
the interest of such an approach.
