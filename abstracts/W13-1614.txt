We describe TWITA, the first corpus of Italian
tweets, which is created via a completely au-
tomatic procedure, portable to any other lan-
guage. We experiment with sentiment anal-
ysis on two datasets from TWITA: a generic
collection and a topic-specific collection. The
only resource we use is a polarity lexicon,
which we obtain by automatically matching
three existing resources thereby creating the
first polarity database for Italian. We observe
that albeit shallow, our simple system captures
polarity distinctions matching reasonably well
the classification done by human judges, with
differences in performance across polarity val-
ues and on the two sets.
