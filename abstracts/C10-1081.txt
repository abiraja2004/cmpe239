We propose semantic role features for a
Tree-to-String transducer to model the re-
ordering/deletion of source-side semantic
roles. These semantic features, as well as
the Tree-to-String templates, are trained
based on a conditional log-linear model
and are shown to significantly outperform
systems trained based on Max-Likelihood
and EM. We also show significant im-
provement in sentence fluency by using
the semantic role features in the log-linear
model, based on manual evaluation.
