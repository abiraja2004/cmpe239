 
Predicate-argument structure (PAS) has been 
demonstrated to be very effective in improving 
SMT performance. However, since a source-
side PAS might correspond to multiple differ-
ent target-side PASs, there usually exist many 
PAS ambiguities during translation. In this pa-
per, we group PAS ambiguities into two types: 
role ambiguity and gap ambiguity. Then we 
propose two novel methods to handle the two 
PAS ambiguities for SMT accordingly: 1) in-
side context integration; 2) a novel maximum 
entropy PAS disambiguation (MEPD) model. 
In this way, we incorporate rich context in-
formation of PAS for disambiguation. Then 
we integrate the two methods into a PAS-
based translation framework. Experiments 
show that our approach helps to achieve sig-
nificant improvements on translation quality.
