Entrainment is the phenomenon of the speech
of conversational partners becoming more
similar to each other. This thesis proposal
presents a comprehensive look at entrainment
in human conversations and how entrainment
may be incorporated into the design of spo-
ken dialogue systems in order to improve sys-
tem performance and user satisfaction. We
compare different kinds of entrainment in both
classic and novel dimensions, provide exper-
imental results on the utility of entrainment,
and show that entrainment can be used to im-
prove a system?s ASR performance and turn-
taking decisions.
