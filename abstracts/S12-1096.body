This paper describes Stanford University?s
submission to SemEval 2012 Semantic Tex-
tual Similarity (STS) shared evaluation task.
Our proposed metric computes probabilistic
edit distance as predictions of semantic sim-
ilarity. We learn weighted edit distance in
a probabilistic finite state machine (pFSM)
model, where state transitions correspond to
edit operations. While standard edit dis-
tance models cannot capture long-distance
word swapping or cross alignments, we rectify
these shortcomings using a novel pushdown
automaton extension of the pFSM model. Our
models are trained in a regression framework,
and can easily incorporate a rich set of lin-
guistic features. The performance of our edit
distance based models is contrasted with an
adaptation of the Stanford textual entailment
system to the STS task. Our results show that
the most advanced edit distance model, pPDA,
outperforms our entailment system on all but
one of the genres included in the STS task.
