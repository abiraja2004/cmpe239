This paper describes the joint submis-
sion of the QUAERO project for the
German?English translation task of the
ACL 2013 Eighth Workshop on Statisti-
cal Machine Translation (WMT 2013).
The submission was a system combina-
tion of the output of four different transla-
tion systems provided by RWTH Aachen
University, Karlsruhe Institute of Technol-
ogy (KIT), LIMSI-CNRS and SYSTRAN
Software, Inc. The translations were
joined using the RWTH?s system com-
bination approach. Experimental results
show improvements of up to 1.2 points in
BLEU and 1.2 points in TER compared to
the best single translation.
