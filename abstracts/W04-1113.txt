 
A challenging task in Chinese collocation 
extraction is to improve both the precision and 
recall rate. Most lexical statistical methods 
including Xtract face the problem of unable to 
extract  collocations with lower frequencies than 
a given threshold. This paper presents a method 
where HowNet is used to find synonyms using a 
similarity function. Based on such synonym 
information, we have successfully extracted 
synonymous collocations which normally cannot 
be extracted using the lexical statistical 
approach. We applied synonyms mapping to 
each headword to extract more synonymous 
word bi-grams. Our evaluation over 60MB 
tagged corpus shows that we can extract 
synonymous collocations that occur with very 
low frequency, sometimes even for collocations 
that occur only once in the training set. 
Comparing to a collocation extraction system 
based on Xtract, we have reached the precision 
rate of 43% on word bi-grams for a set of 9 
headwords, almost 50% improvement from 
precision rate of 30% in the Xtract system. 
Furthermore, it  improves the recall rate of word 
bi-gram collocation extraction by 30%.
