Using natural language processing, we
carried out a trend survey on Japanese
natural language processing studies that
have been done over the last ten years.
We determined the changes in the num-
ber of papers published for each re-
search organization and on each re-
search area as well as the relationship
between research organizations and re-
search areas. This paper is useful
for both recognizing trends in Japanese
NLP and constructing a method of sup-
porting trend surveys using NLP.
