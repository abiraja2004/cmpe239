Discourse in formal domains, such as mathemat-
ics, is characterized by a mixture of telegraphic nat-
ural language and embedded (semi-)formal sym-
bolic mathematical expressions. We present lan-
guage phenomena observed in a corpus of dialogs
with a simulated tutorial system for proving theo-
rems as evidence for the need for deep syntactic and
semantic analysis. We propose an approach to input
understanding in this setting. Our goal is a uniform
analysis of inputs of different degree of verbaliza-
tion: ranging from symbolic alone to fully worded
mathematical expressions.
