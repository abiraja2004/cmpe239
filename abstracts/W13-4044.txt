In this paper, we propose a novel approach
to infer dialogue acts using the notion of
tacit contracts. We describe the interper-
sonal linguistic features that our analysis
grammar can identify in uttered texts and
present an inference procedure that strictly
separates the semantic and pragmatic steps
of utterance understanding, thereby meet-
ing a higher degree of modularity, a pre-
requisite for extending robot functionality.
