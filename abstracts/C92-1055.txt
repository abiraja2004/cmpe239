 
In this paper, a discrimination and robusmess 
oriented adaptive learning procedure is proposed to 
deal with the task of syntactic ambiguity resolution. 
Owing to the problem of insufficient training data 
and approximation error introduced by the language 
model, traditional statistical approaches, which re- 
solve ambiguities by indirectly and implicitly using 
maximum likelihood method, fail to achieve high 
performance in real applications. The proposed 
method remedies these problems by adjusting the 
parameters to maximize the accuracy rate directly. 
To make the proposed algorithm robust, the possi- 
ble variations between the training corpus and the 
real tasks are als0 taken into consideration by en- 
larging the separation margin between the correct 
candidate and its competing members. Significant 
improvement has been observed in the test. The 
accuracy rate of syntactic disambiguation is raised 
from 46.0% to 60.62% by using this novel approach.
