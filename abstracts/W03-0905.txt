This paper describes the creation of a script in
the framework of ontological semantics as the
formal representation of the complex event
BANKRUPTCY. This script for BANKRUPTCY
serves as the exemplary basis for a discussion
of the general motivations for including
scripts in NLP, as well as the discovery proc-
ess for, and format of, scripts for the purposes
of processing coreference and inferencing
which are required, for example, in high-end
Q&A and IE applications.
