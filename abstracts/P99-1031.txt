 
In an effort to develop measures of discourse 
level management strategies, this study examines 
a measure of the degree to which decision- 
making interactions consist of sequences of
utterance functions that are linked in a decision- 
making routine. The measure isapplied to 100 
dyadic interactions elicited in both face-to-face 
and computer-mediated nvironments with 
systematic variation of task complexity and 
message-window size. Every utterance inthe 
interactions is coded according to a system that 
identifies decision-makmg functions and other 
routine functions of utterances. Markov 
analyses of the coded utterances make it possible 
to measure the relative fi'equencies with which 
sequences of 2 and 3 utterances trace a path in 
a Markov model of the decision routine. These 
proportions uggest hat interactions in all 
conditions adhere to the model, although we find 
greater conformity in the computer-mediated 
environments, which is probably due to 
increased processing and attmfional demands for 
greater efficiency, The results suggest that 
measures based on Markov analyses of coded 
interactions can provide useful measures for 
comparing discourse level properties, for 
correlating discourse f atures with other textual 
features, and for analyses of discourse 
management strategies.
