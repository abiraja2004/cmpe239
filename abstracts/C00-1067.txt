  
We propose a new inference system which oper- 
ales on underspecified semantic representations 
of scope and anaphora. This system exploits 
anaphoric accessibility conditions from dynamic 
selnantics to disambiguate scope ambiguities if
possible. The main feature of the system is 
that it deals with underspecified descriptions di- 
rectly, i.e. without enumeratlng readings.
