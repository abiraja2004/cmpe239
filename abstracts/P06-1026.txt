Data-driven techniques have been used
for many computational linguistics tasks.
Models derived from data are generally
more robust than hand-crafted systems
since they better reflect the distribution
of the phenomena being modeled. With
the availability of large corpora of spo-
ken dialog, dialog management is now
reaping the benefits of data-driven tech-
niques. In this paper, we compare two ap-
proaches to modeling subtask structure in
dialog: a chunk-based model of subdialog
sequences, and a parse-based, or hierarchi-
cal, model. We evaluate these models us-
ing customer agent dialogs from a catalog
service domain.
