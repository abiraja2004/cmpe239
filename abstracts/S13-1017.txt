This paper reports our submissions to the
Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) task in
?SEM Shared Task 2013. We submitted three
Support Vector Regression (SVR) systems in
core task, using 6 types of similarity mea-
sures, i.e., string similarity, number similar-
ity, knowledge-based similarity, corpus-based
similarity, syntactic dependency similarity and
machine translation similarity. Our third sys-
tem with different training data and different
feature sets for each test data set performs the
best and ranks 35 out of 90 runs. We also sub-
mitted two systems in typed task using string
based measure and Named Entity based mea-
sure. Our best system ranks 5 out of 15 runs.
