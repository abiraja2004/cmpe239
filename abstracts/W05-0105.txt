We have built web interfaces to a number
of Natural Language Processing technolo-
gies. These interfaces allow students to
experiment with different inputs and view
corresponding output and inner workings
of the systems. When possible, the in-
terfaces also enable the student to mod-
ify the knowledge bases of the systems
and view the resulting change in behav-
ior. Such interfaces are important because
they allow students without computer sci-
ence background to learn by doing. Web
interfaces also sidestep issues of platform
dependency in software packages, avail-
able computer lab times, etc. We discuss
our basic approach and lessons learned.
