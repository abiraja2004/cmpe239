In this paper, we propose the use of metadata
contained in documents to improve corefer-
ence resolution. Specifically, we quantify the
impact of speaker and turn information on the
performance of our coreference system, and
show that the metadata can be effectively en-
coded as features of a statistical resolution sys-
tem, which leads to a statistically significant
improvement in performance.
