We discuss and analyze the problem of find-
ing a distribution that minimizes the relative
entropy to a prior distribution while satisfying
max-norm constraints with respect to an ob-
served distribution. This setting generalizes
the classical maximum entropy problems as
it relaxes the standard constraints on the ob-
served values. We tackle the problem by in-
troducing a re-parametrization in which the
unknown distribution is distilled to a single
scalar. We then describe a homotopy between
the relaxation parameter and the distribution
characterizing parameter. The homotopy also
reveals an aesthetic symmetry between the
prior distribution and the observed distribu-
tion. We then use the reformulated problem to
describe a space and time efficient algorithm
for tracking the entire relaxation path. Our
derivations are based on a compact geomet-
ric view of the relaxation path as a piecewise
linear function in a two dimensional space
of the relaxation-characterization parameters.
We demonstrate the usability of our approach
by applying the problem to Zipfian distribu-
tions over a large alphabet.
