This paper proposes a uniform frame-
work for the development of parsing and
translation algorithms for weighted ex-
tended (top-down) tree transducers and in-
put strings. The asymptotic time complex-
ity of these algorithms can be improved
in practice by exploiting an algorithm for
rule factorization in the above transducers.
