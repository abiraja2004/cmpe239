We present a complete system that gen-
erates Japanese stand-up comedy. Differ-
ent modules generating different types of
jokes are tied together into a performance
where all jokes are connected in some way
to the other jokes. The script is converted
to speech and two robots perform the com-
edy routine. Evaluations show that the per-
formances are perceived as funny by many,
almost half the evaluation scores for the to-
tal impression were 4 or 5 (top score).
