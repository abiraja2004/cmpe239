 
How similar are two corpora? A measure of corpus similarity would be very useful for 
lexicography and language engineering. Word frequency lists are cheap and easy to generate 
so a measure based on them would be of use as a quick guide in many circumstances; for 
example, to judge how a newly available corpus related to existing resources, or how easy it 
might be to port an NLP  system designed to work with one text type to work with another. 
We show that corpus similarity can only be interpreted in the light of corpus homogeneity. 
The paper presents a measure, based on the XX 2 statistic, for measuring both corpus imilarity 
and corpus homogeneity. The measure is compared with a rank-based measure and shown 
to outperform it. Some results are presented. A method for evaluating the accuracy of the 
measure is introduced and some results of using the measure are presented.
