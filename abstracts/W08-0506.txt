It is a widely accepted belief in natural lan-
guage processing research that naturally oc-
curring data is the best (and perhaps the only
appropriate) data for testing text mining sys-
tems. This paper compares code coverage us-
ing a suite of functional tests and using a large
corpus and finds that higher class, line, and
branch coverage is achieved with structured
tests than with even a very large corpus.
