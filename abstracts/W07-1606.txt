In this work we report on the results of a 
preliminary corpus study of Italian on the 
semantics of temporal prepositions, which 
is part of a wider project on the automatic 
recognition of temporal relations. The cor-
pus data collected supports our hypothesis 
that each temporal preposition can be asso-
ciated with one prototypical temporal rela-
tion, and that deviations from the prototype 
can be explained as determined by the oc-
currence of different semantic patterns. The 
motivation behind this approach is to im-
prove methods for temporal annotation of 
texts for content based access to informa-
tion. The corpus study described in this pa-
per led to the development of a preliminary 
set of heuristics for automatic annotation of
temporal relations in text/discourse.
