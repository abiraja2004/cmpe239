The ability to compress sentences while
preserving their grammaticality and most
of their meaning has recently received
much attention. Our work views sentence
compression as an optimisation problem.
We develop an integer programming for-
mulation and infer globally optimal com-
pressions in the face of linguistically moti-
vated constraints. We show that such a for-
mulation allows for relatively simple and
knowledge-lean compression models that
do not require parallel corpora or large-
scale resources. The proposed approach
yields results comparable and in some
cases superior to state-of-the-art.
