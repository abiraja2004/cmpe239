Most current machine transliteration sys-
tems employ a corpus of known source-
target word pairs to train their system, and
typically evaluate their systems on a similar
corpus. In this paper we explore the perfor-
mance of transliteration systems on corpora
that are varied in a controlled way. In partic-
ular, we control the number, and prior lan-
guage knowledge of human transliterators
used to construct the corpora, and the origin
of the source words that make up the cor-
pora. We find that the word accuracy of au-
tomated transliteration systems can vary by
up to 30% (in absolute terms) depending on
the corpus on which they are run. We con-
clude that at least four human transliterators
should be used to construct corpora for eval-
uating automated transliteration systems;
and that although absolute word accuracy
metrics may not translate across corpora, the
relative rankings of system performance re-
mains stable across differing corpora.
