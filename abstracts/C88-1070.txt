 
The schema method is a framework for correcting 
grammatically ill-formed input. In a natural language 
processing system ill-formed input cannot be overlooked. A
computer assisted instruction (CAD system, in particular, 
needs to show the user's errors. This framework diagnoses 
ill-formed input, corrects it and explains the error, if an 
input is ill-~'ormed. The framework recognizes a sentence at 
two steps: first parses weak grammar, and then strongly 
filters the parsed sentence. When it is known what 
sentences are passed by the filter, it can be used even if it is 
imperfect. As the strong filter, a new method is used: an 
interpretation schema and an interpretation rule. An 
interpretation schema collects input information schemata 
and then an interpretation rule judges whether the 
collected schemata re correct or incorrect. This approach 
overcomes the problem of relaxation control, the major 
drawback of the previous yntactically-oriented methods, 
and is also more efficient.
