We describe a set of supervised ma-
chine learning experiments centering
on the construction of statistical mod-
els of WH-questions. These models,
which are built from shallow linguis-
tic features of questions, are employed
to predict target variables which repre-
sent a user?s informational goals. We
report on different aspects of the pre-
dictive performance of our models, in-
cluding the influence of various training
and testing factors on predictive perfor-
mance, and examine the relationships
among the target variables.
