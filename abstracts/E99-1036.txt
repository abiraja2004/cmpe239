 
This paper presents a framework for the 
definition of monotonic repair rules on 
chart items and Lexicalized Tree Gram- 
mars. We exploit island representations 
and a new level of granularity for the 
linearization of a tree called connected 
routes. It allows to take into account he 
topology of the tree in order to trigger 
additional rules. These local rules cover 
ellipsis and common extra-grammatical 
phenomena such as self-repairs. First re- 
sults with a spoken language corpora re 
presented.
