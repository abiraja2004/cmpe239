 
This paper proposes a novel hierarchical learn-
ing strategy to deal with the data sparseness 
problem in relation extraction by modeling the 
commonality among related classes. For each 
class in the hierarchy either manually prede-
fined or automatically clustered, a linear dis-
criminative function is determined in a top-
down way using a perceptron algorithm with 
the lower-level weight vector derived from the 
upper-level weight vector. As the upper-level 
class normally has much more positive train-
ing examples than the lower-level class, the 
corresponding linear discriminative function 
can be determined more reliably. The upper-
level discriminative function then can effec-
tively guide the discriminative function learn-
ing in the lower-level, which otherwise might 
suffer from limited training data. Evaluation 
on the ACE RDC 2003 corpus shows that the 
hierarchical strategy much improves the per-
formance by 5.6 and 5.1 in F-measure on 
least- and medium- frequent relations respec-
tively. It also shows that our system outper-
forms the previous best-reported system by 2.7 
in F-measure on the 24 subtypes using the 
same feature set.
