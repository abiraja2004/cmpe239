We propose a new phrase-based translation
model and decoding algorithm that enables
us to evaluate and compare several, previ-
ously proposed phrase-based translation mod-
els. Within our framework, we carry out a
large number of experiments to understand bet-
ter and explain why phrase-based models out-
perform word-based models. Our empirical re-
sults, which hold for all examined language
pairs, suggest that the highest levels of perfor-
mance can be obtained through relatively sim-
ple means: heuristic learning of phrase trans-
lations from word-based alignments and lexi-
cal weighting of phrase translations. Surpris-
ingly, learning phrases longer than three words
and learning phrases from high-accuracy word-
level alignment models does not have a strong
impact on performance. Learning only syntac-
tically motivated phrases degrades the perfor-
mance of our systems.
