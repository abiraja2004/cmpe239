Developing sophisticated NLP pipelines
composed of multiple processing tools
and components available through differ-
ent providers may pose a challenge in
terms of their interoperability. The Un-
structured Information Management Ar-
chitecture (UIMA) is an industry stan-
dard whose aim is to ensure such in-
teroperability by defining common data
structures and interfaces. The architec-
ture has been gaining attention from in-
dustry and academia alike, resulting in a
large volume of UIMA-compliant process-
ing components. In this paper, we demon-
strate Argo, a Web-based workbench for
the development and processing of NLP
pipelines/workflows. The workbench is
based upon UIMA, and thus has the poten-
tial of using many of the existing UIMA
resources. We present features, and show
examples, of facilitating the distributed de-
velopment of components and the analysis
of processing results. The latter includes
annotation visualisers and editors, as well
as serialisation to RDF format, which en-
ables flexible querying in addition to data
manipulation thanks to the semantic query
language SPARQL. The distributed devel-
opment feature allows users to seamlessly
connect their tools to workflows running
in Argo, and thus take advantage of both
the available library of components (with-
out the need of installing them locally) and
the analytical tools.
