English-Thai MT systems are nowadays re-
stricted by incomplete vocabularies and trans-
lation knowledge. Users must consequently ac-
cept only one translation result that is some-
times semantically divergent or ungrammatical.
With the according reason, we propose novel
Internet-based translation assistant software in
order to facilitate document translation from
English to Thai. In this project, we utilize
the structural transfer model as the mechanism.
This project differs from current English-Thai
MT systems in the aspects that it empowers the
users to manually select the most appropriate
translation from every possibility and to manu-
ally train new translation rules to the system if
it is necessary. With the applied model, we over-
come four translation problems?lexicon rear-
rangement, structural ambiguity, phrase trans-
lation, and classifier generation. Finally, we
started the system evaluation with 322 ran-
domly selected sentences on the Future Mag-
azine bilingual corpus and the system yielded
59.87% and 83.08% translation accuracy for the
best case and the worse case based on 90.1%
average precision of the parser.
