 
This paper addresses the problem of 
automatically retrieving answers for 
how-to questions, focusing on those that 
inquire about the procedure for 
achieving a specific goal. For such 
questions, typical information retrieval 
methods, based on key word matching, 
are better suited to detecting the content 
of the goal (e.g., ?installing a Windows 
XP server?) than the general nature of the 
desired information (i.e., procedural, a 
series of steps for achieving this goal). 
We suggest dividing the process of 
retrieving answers for such questions 
into two stages, with each stage focusing 
on modeling one aspect of a how-to 
question. We compare the two-stage 
approach with two alternative 
approaches: a baseline approach that 
only uses the content of the goal to 
retrieve relevant documents and another 
approach that explores the potential of 
automatic query expansion. The result of 
the experiment shows that the two-stage 
approach significantly outperforms the 
baseline but achieves similar result with 
the systems using automatic query 
expansion techniques. We analyze the 
reason and also present some future work.
