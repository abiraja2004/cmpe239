Both coarse-to-fine and A? parsing use simple
grammars to guide search in complex ones.
We compare the two approaches in a com-
mon, agenda-based framework, demonstrat-
ing the tradeoffs and relative strengths of each
method. Overall, coarse-to-fine is much faster
for moderate levels of search errors, but be-
low a certain threshold A? is superior. In addi-
tion, we present the first experiments on hier-
archical A? parsing, in which computation of
heuristics is itself guided by meta-heuristics.
Multi-level hierarchies are helpful in both ap-
proaches, but are more effective in the coarse-
to-fine case because of accumulated slack in
A? heuristics.
