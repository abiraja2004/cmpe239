Most of previous approaches to automatic
prosodic event detection are based on su-
pervised learning, relying on the avail-
ability of a corpus that is annotated with
the prosodic labels of interest in order to
train the classification models. However,
creating such resources is an expensive
and time-consuming task. In this paper,
we exploit semi-supervised learning with
the co-training algorithm for automatic de-
tection of coarse level representation of
prosodic events such as pitch accents, in-
tonational phrase boundaries, and break
indices. We propose a confidence-based
method to assign labels to unlabeled data
and demonstrate improved results using
this method compared to the widely used
agreement-based method. In addition, we
examine various informative sample selec-
tion methods. In our experiments on the
Boston University radio news corpus, us-
ing only a small amount of the labeled data
as the initial training set, our proposed la-
beling method combined with most confi-
dence sample selection can effectively use
unlabeled data to improve performance
and finally reach performance closer to
that of the supervised method using all the
training data.
