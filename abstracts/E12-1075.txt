A fundamental problem in text generation
is word ordering. Word ordering is a com-
putationally difficult problem, which can
be constrained to some extent for particu-
lar applications, for example by using syn-
chronous grammars for statistical machine
translation. There have been some recent
attempts at the unconstrained problem of
generating a sentence from a multi-set of
input words (Wan et al 2009; Zhang and
Clark, 2011). By using CCG and learn-
ing guided search, Zhang and Clark re-
ported the highest scores on this task. One
limitation of their system is the absence
of an N-gram language model, which has
been used by text generation systems to
improve fluency. We take the Zhang and
Clark system as the baseline, and incor-
porate an N-gram model by applying on-
line large-margin training. Our system sig-
nificantly improved on the baseline by 3.7
BLEU points.
