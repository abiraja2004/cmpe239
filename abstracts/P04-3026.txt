 
Recent studies in word sense induction are 
based on clustering global co-occurrence vec-
tors, i.e. vectors that reflect the overall be-
havior of a word in a corpus. If a word is se-
mantically ambiguous, this means that these 
vectors are mixtures of all its senses. Inducing 
a word?s senses therefore involves the difficult 
problem of recovering the sense vectors from 
the mixtures. In this paper we argue that the 
demixing problem can be avoided since the 
contextual behavior of the senses is directly 
observable in the form of the local contexts of 
a word. From human disambiguation perform-
ance we know that the context of a word is 
usually sufficient to determine its sense. Based 
on this observation we describe an algorithm 
that discovers the different senses of an am-
biguous word by clustering its contexts. The 
main difficulty with this approach, namely the 
problem of data sparseness, could be mini-
mized by looking at only the three main di-
mensions of the context matrices.
