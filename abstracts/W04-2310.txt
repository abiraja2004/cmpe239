Anaphora resolution for dialogues is a difficult
problem because of the several kinds of com-
plex anaphoric references generally present in
dialogic discourses. It is nevertheless a criti-
cal first step in the processing of any such dis-
course. In this paper, we describe a system for
anaphora resolution in multi-person dialogues.
This system aims to bring together a wide array
syntactic, semantic and world knowledge based
techniques used for anaphora resolution. In
this system, the performance of the heuristics is
optimized for specific dialogues using genetic
algorithms, which relieves the programmer of
hand-crafting the weights of these heuristics. In
our system, we propose a new technique based
on the use of anaphora chains to enable reso-
lution of a large variety of anaphors, including
plural anaphora and cataphora.
