We demonstrate TextRank ? a system for
unsupervised extractive summarization that
relies on the application of iterative graph-
based ranking algorithms to graphs encod-
ing the cohesive structure of a text. An im-
portant characteristic of the system is that
it does not rely on any language-specific
knowledge resources or any manually con-
structed training data, and thus it is highly
portable to new languages or domains.
