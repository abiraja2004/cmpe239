In this paper, we describe the research 
using  machine  learning  techniques  to 
build a comma checker to be integrated 
in a grammar checker for Basque. After 
several experiments, and trained with a 
little corpus of 100,000 words, the sys?
tem guesses correctly not placing com?
mas with a precision of 96% and a re?
call of 98%. It also gets a precision of 
70% and a recall of 49% in the task of 
placing  commas.  Finally,  we  have 
shown  that  these  results  can  be  im?
proved using a bigger and a more ho?
mogeneous  corpus  to  train,  that  is,  a 
bigger corpus written by one unique au?
thor.
