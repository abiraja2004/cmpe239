This paper proposes a semi-supervised 
approach for WSD in Word-Class 
based selectional preferences. The 
approach exploits syntagmatic and 
paradigmatic semantic redundancy in 
the semantic system and uses 
association computation and minimum 
description length for the task of WSD. 
Experiments on Predicate-Object 
collocations and Subject-Predicate 
collocations with polysemous 
predicates in Chinese show that the 
proposed approach achieves a precision 
which is 8% higher than the semantic-
association based baseline. The semi-
supervised nature of the approach 
makes it promising for constructing 
large scale selectional preference 
knowledge base.
