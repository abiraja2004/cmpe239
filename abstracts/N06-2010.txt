Coreference resolution, like many problems
in natural language processing, has most of-
ten been explored using datasets of written
text. While spontaneous spoken language
poses well-known challenges, it also offers ad-
ditional modalities that may help disambiguate
some of the inherent disfluency. We explore
features of hand gesture that are correlated
with coreference. Combining these features
with a traditional textual model yields a statis-
tically significant improvement in overall per-
formance.
