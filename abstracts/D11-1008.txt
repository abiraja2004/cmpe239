We present a novel approach to Data-Oriented
Parsing (DOP). Like other DOP models, our
parser utilizes syntactic fragments of arbitrary
size from a treebank to analyze new sentences,
but, crucially, it uses only those which are
encountered at least twice. This criterion al-
lows us to work with a relatively small but
representative set of fragments, which can be
employed as the symbolic backbone of sev-
eral probabilistic generative models. For pars-
ing we define a transform-backtransform ap-
proach that allows us to use standard PCFG
technology, making our results easily replica-
ble. According to standard Parseval metrics,
our best model is on par with many state-of-
the-art parsers, while offering some comple-
mentary benefits: a simple generative proba-
bility model, and an explicit representation of
the larger units of grammar.
