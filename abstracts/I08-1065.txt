Aiming at acquiring semantic relations be-
tween events from a large corpus, this paper
proposes several extensions to a state-of-the-
art method originally designed for entity re-
lation extraction, reporting on the present re-
sults of our experiments on a Japanese Web
corpus. The results show that (a) there are
indeed specific cooccurrence patterns use-
ful for event relation acquisition, (b) the
use of cooccurrence samples involving ver-
bal nouns has positive impacts on both re-
call and precision, and (c) over five thou-
sand relation instances are acquired from a
500M-sentence Web corpus with a precision
of about 66% for action-effect relations.
