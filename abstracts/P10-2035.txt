Nivre?s method was improved by en-
hancing deterministic dependency parsing
through application of a tree-based model.
The model considers all words necessary
for selection of parsing actions by includ-
ing words in the form of trees. It chooses
the most probable head candidate from
among the trees and uses this candidate to
select a parsing action.
In an evaluation experiment using the
Penn Treebank (WSJ section), the pro-
posed model achieved higher accuracy
than did previous deterministic models.
Although the proposed model?s worst-case
time complexity is O(n2), the experimen-
tal results demonstrated an average pars-
ing time not much slower than O(n).
