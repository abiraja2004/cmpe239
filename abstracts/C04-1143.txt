 
Email summarisation presents a unique set of 
requirements that are different from general 
text summarisation. This work describes the 
implementation of an email summarisation 
system for use in a voice-based Virtual Per-
sonal Assistant developed for the EU FASiL 
Project. Evaluation results from the first inte-
grated version of the project are presented.
