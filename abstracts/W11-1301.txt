In this paper, we present a first attempt to
characterize the semantic deviance of com-
posite expressions in distributional seman-
tics. Specifically, we look for properties of
adjective-noun combinations within a vector-
based semantic space that might cue their lack
of meaning. We evaluate four different com-
positionality models shown to have various
levels of success in representing the mean-
ing of AN pairs: the simple additive and
multiplicative models of Mitchell and Lap-
ata (2008), and the linear-map-based models
of Guevara (2010) and Baroni and Zamparelli
(2010). For each model, we generate com-
posite vectors for a set of AN combinations
unattested in the source corpus and which
have been deemed either acceptable or seman-
tically deviant. We then compute measures
that might cue semantic anomaly, and com-
pare each model?s results for the two classes of
ANs. Our study shows that simple, unsuper-
vised cues can indeed significantly tell unat-
tested but acceptable ANs apart from impos-
sible, or deviant, ANs, and that the simple ad-
ditive and multiplicative models are the most
effective in this task.
