We introduce a word segmentation ap-
proach to languages where word bound-
aries are not orthographically marked,
with application to Phrase-Based Statis-
tical Machine Translation (PB-SMT). In-
stead of using manually segmented mono-
lingual domain-specific corpora to train
segmenters, we make use of bilingual cor-
pora and statistical word alignment tech-
niques. First of all, our approach is
adapted for the specific translation task at
hand by taking the corresponding source
(target) language into account. Secondly,
this approach does not rely on manu-
ally segmented training data so that it
can be automatically adapted for differ-
ent domains. We evaluate the perfor-
mance of our segmentation approach on
PB-SMT tasks from two domains and
demonstrate that our approach scores con-
sistently among the best results across dif-
ferent data conditions.
