This paper presents new Information Extrac-
tion scenarios which are linguistically and struc-
turally more challenging than the traditional
MUC scenarios. Traditional views on event
structure and template design are not adequate
for the more complex scenarios.
The focus of this paper is to show the com-
plexity of the scenarios, and propose a way to
recover the structure of the event. First we
identify two structural factors that contribute
to the complexity of scenarios: the scattering
of events in text, and inclusion relationships
between events. These factors cause di?culty
in representing the facts in an unambiguous
way. Then we propose a modular, hierarchi-
cal representation where the information is split
in atomic units represented by templates, and
where the inclusion relationships between the
units are indicated by links. Lastly, we discuss
how we may recover this representation from
text, with the help of linguistic cues linking the
events.
