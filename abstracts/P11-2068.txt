In interactive machine translation (IMT), a hu-
man expert is integrated into the core of a ma-
chine translation (MT) system. The human ex-
pert interacts with the IMT system by partially
correcting the errors of the system?s output.
Then, the system proposes a new solution.
This process is repeated until the output meets
the desired quality. In this scenario, the in-
teraction is typically performed using the key-
board and the mouse. In this work, we present
an alternative modality to interact within IMT
systems by writing on a tactile display or us-
ing an electronic pen. An on-line handwrit-
ten text recognition (HTR) system has been
specifically designed to operate with IMT sys-
tems. Our HTR system improves previous ap-
proaches in two main aspects. First, HTR de-
coding is tightly coupled with the IMT sys-
tem. Second, the language models proposed
are context aware, in the sense that they take
into account the partial corrections and the
source sentence by using a combination of n-
grams and word-based IBM models. The pro-
posed system achieves an important boost in
performance with respect to previous work.
