Measuring term informativeness is a funda-
mental NLP task. Existing methods, mostly
based on statistical information in corpora, do
not actually measure informativeness of a term
with regard to its semantic context. This pa-
per proposes a new lightweight feature-free
approach to encode term informativeness in
context by leveraging web knowledge. Given
a term and its context, we model context-
aware term informativeness based on semantic
similarity between the context and the term?s
most featured context in a knowledge base,
Wikipedia. We apply our method to three ap-
plications: core term extraction from snippets
(text segment), scientific keywords extraction
(paper), and back-of-the-book index genera-
tion (book). The performance is state-of-the-
art or close to it for each application, demon-
strating its effectiveness and generality.
