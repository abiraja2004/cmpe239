This paper presents an unsupervised batch
learner for the quantity-insensitive stress
systems described in Gordon (2002). Un-
like previous stress learning models, the
learner presented here is neither cue based
(Dresher and Kaye, 1990), nor reliant on
a priori Optimality-theoretic constraints
(Tesar, 1998). Instead our learner ex-
ploits a property called neighborhood-
distinctness, which is shared by all of the
target patterns. Some consequences of this
approach include a natural explanation
for the occurrence of binary and ternary
rhythmic patterns, the lack of higher n-ary
rhythms, and the fact that, in these sys-
tems, stress always falls within a certain
window of word edges.
