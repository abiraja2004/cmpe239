Grice characterized communication in terms
of the cooperative principle, which enjoins
speakers to make only contributions that serve
the evolving conversational goals. We show
that the cooperative principle and the associ-
ated maxims of relevance, quality, and quan-
tity emerge from multi-agent decision theory.
We utilize the Decentralized Partially Observ-
able Markov Decision Process (Dec-POMDP)
model of multi-agent decision making which
relies only on basic definitions of rationality
and the ability of agents to reason about each
other?s beliefs in maximizing joint utility. Our
model uses cognitively-inspired heuristics to
simplify the otherwise intractable task of rea-
soning jointly about actions, the environment,
and the nested beliefs of other actors. Our
experiments on a cooperative language task
show that reasoning about others? belief states,
and the resulting emergent Gricean commu-
nicative behavior, leads to significantly im-
proved task performance.
