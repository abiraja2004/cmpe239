Verb classes which integrate a wide range
of linguistic properties (Levin, 1993) have
proved useful for natural language pro-
cessing (NLP) applications. However,
the real-world use of these classes has
been limited because for most languages,
no resources similar to VerbNet (Kipper-
Schuler, 2005) are available. We apply
a verb clustering approach developed for
English to French ? a language for which
no such experiment has been conducted
yet. Our investigation shows that not only
the general methodology but also the best
performing features are transferable be-
tween the languages, making it possible
to learn useful VerbNet style classes for
French automatically without language-
specific tuning.
