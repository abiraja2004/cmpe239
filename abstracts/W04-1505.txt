We present and evaluate an implemented sta-
tistical minimal parsing strategy exploiting DG
charateristics to permit fast, robust, deep-
linguistic analysis of unrestricted text, and com-
pare its probability model to (Collins, 1999) and
an adaptation, (Dubey and Keller, 2003). We
show that DG allows for the expression of the
majority of English LDDs in a context-free way
and oers simple yet powerful statistical mod-
els.
