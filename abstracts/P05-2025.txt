This paper describes adaptations of unsu-
pervised word sense discrimination tech-
niques to the problem of name discrimina-
tion. These methods cluster the contexts
containing an ambiguous name, such that
each cluster refers to a unique underlying
person or place. We also present new tech-
niques to assign meaningful labels to the
discovered clusters.
