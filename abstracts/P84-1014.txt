 
This paper describes a general approach to the 
design of natural language interfaces that has 
evolved during the development of DATALOG, an Eng- 
lish database query system based on Cascaded ATN 
grammar. By providing separate representation 
schemes for linguistic knowledge, general world 
knowledge, and application domain knowledge, 
DATALOG achieves a high degree of portability and 
extendability.
