This paper explores several unsupervised ap-
proaches to automatic keyword extraction
using meeting transcripts. In the TFIDF
(term frequency, inverse document frequency)
weighting framework, we incorporated part-
of-speech (POS) information, word clustering,
and sentence salience score. We also evalu-
ated a graph-based approach that measures the
importance of a word based on its connection
with other sentences or words. The system
performance is evaluated in different ways, in-
cluding comparison to human annotated key-
words using F-measure and a weighted score
relative to the oracle system performance, as
well as a novel alternative human evaluation.
Our results have shown that the simple un-
supervised TFIDF approach performs reason-
ably well, and the additional information from
POS and sentence score helps keyword ex-
traction. However, the graph method is less
effective for this domain. Experiments were
also performed using speech recognition out-
put and we observed degradation and different
patterns compared to human transcripts.
