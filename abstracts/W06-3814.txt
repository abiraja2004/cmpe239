Ve?ronis (2004) has recently proposed
an innovative unsupervised algorithm for
word sense disambiguation based on
small-world graphs called HyperLex. This
paper explores two sides of the algorithm.
First, we extend Ve?ronis? work by opti-
mizing the free parameters (on a set of
words which is different to the target set).
Second, given that the empirical compar-
ison among unsupervised systems (and
with respect to supervised systems) is sel-
dom made, we used hand-tagged corpora
to map the induced senses to a standard
lexicon (WordNet) and a publicly avail-
able gold standard (Senseval 3 English
Lexical Sample). Our results for nouns
show that thanks to the optimization of
parameters and the mapping method, Hy-
perLex obtains results close to supervised
systems using the same kind of bag-of-
words features. Given the information
loss inherent in any mapping step and the
fact that the parameters were tuned for an-
other set of words, these are very interest-
ing results.
