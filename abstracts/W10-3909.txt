The combination of large corpora and ?deep? analysis procedures has made it possible to acquire a range of semantic informa-tion and apply it to this task. In this pa-per, we generate two statistically-based semantic features from a large corpus and measure their influence on pronoun coreference. One is contextual compati-bility, which decides if the antecedent can be used in the anaphor?s context; the other is role pair, which decides if the ac-tions asserted of the antecedent and the anaphor are likely to apply to the same entity. We apply a semantic labeling sys-tem and a baseline coreference system to a large corpus to generate semantic pat-terns and convert them into features in a MaxEnt model. These features produce an absolute gain of 1.5% to 1.7% in reso-lution accuracy (a 6% reduction in er-rors). To understand the limitations of these features, we also extract patterns from the test corpus, use these patterns to train a coreference model, and examine some of the cases where coreference still fails. We also compare the performance of patterns extracted from semantic role labeling and syntax. 1
