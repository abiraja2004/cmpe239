In this paper, we examine user adaptation to
the system?s lexical and syntactic choices in
the context of the deployed Let?s Go! dialog
system. We show that in deployed dialog sys-
tems with real users, as in laboratory experi-
ments, users adapt to the system?s lexical and
syntactic choices. We also show that the sys-
tem?s lexical and syntactic choices, and con-
sequent user adaptation, can have an impact
on recognition of task-related concepts. This
means that system prompt formulation, even
in flexible input dialog systems, can be used
to guide users into producing utterances con-
ducive to task success.
