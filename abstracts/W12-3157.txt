In statistical machine translation, word lattices
are used to represent the ambiguities in the
preprocessing of the source sentence, such as
word segmentation for Chinese or morpholog-
ical analysis for German. Several approaches
have been proposed to define the probability
of different paths through the lattice with ex-
ternal tools like word segmenters, or by apply-
ing indicator features. We introduce a novel
lattice design, which explicitly distinguishes
between different preprocessing alternatives
for the source sentence. It allows us to make
use of specific features for each preprocess-
ing type and to lexicalize the choice of lattice
path directly in the phrase translation model.
We argue that forced alignment training can
be used to learn lattice path and phrase trans-
lation model simultaneously. On the news-
commentary portion of the German?English
WMT 2011 task we can show moderate im-
provements of up to 0.6% BLEU over a state-
of-the-art baseline system.
