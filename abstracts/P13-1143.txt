We propose a joint inference algorithm for
grammatical error correction. Different
from most previous work where different
error types are corrected independently,
our proposed inference process considers
all possible errors in a unied framework.
We use integer linear programming (ILP)
to model the inference process, which can
easily incorporate both the power of exist-
ing error classiers and prior knowledge
on grammatical error correction. Exper-
imental results on the Helping Our Own
shared task show that our method is com-
petitive with state-of-the-art systems.
