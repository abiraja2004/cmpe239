We propose a spatio-temporal markup for
the annotation of motion predicates in text,
informed by a lexical semantic classifica-
tion of these verbs. We incorporate this
classification within a spatial event struc-
ture, based on Generative Lexicon Theory.
We discuss how the spatial event structure
suggests changes to annotation systems de-
signed solely for temporal or spatial phe-
nomena, resulting in spatio-temporal an-
notation.
