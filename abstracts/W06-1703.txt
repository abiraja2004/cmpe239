This paper studies issues related to the
compilation of a bilingual lexicon for tech-
nical terms. In the task of estimating bilin-
gual term correspondences of technical
terms, it is usually rather difficult to find
an existing corpus for the domain of such
technical terms. In this paper, we adopt
an approach of collecting a corpus for the
domain of such technical terms from the
Web. As a method of translation esti-
mation for technical terms, we employ a
compositional translation estimation tech-
nique. This paper focuses on quantita-
tively comparing variations of the compo-
nents in the scoring functions of composi-
tional translation estimation. Through ex-
perimental evaluation, we show that the
domain/topic-specific corpus contributes
toward improving the performance of the
compositional translation estimation.
