Knowledge-based parsers are now accu-
rate, fast and robust enough to be used to
obtain syntactic annotations for very large
corpora fully automatically. We argue that
such parsed corpora are an interesting new
resource for linguists. The argument is
illustrated by means of a number of re-
cent results which were established with
the help of parsed corpora.
