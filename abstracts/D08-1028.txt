Compared to the telephone, email based cus-
tomer care is increasingly becoming the pre-
ferred channel of communication for corpora-
tions and customers. Most email-based cus-
tomer care management systems provide a
method to include template texts in order to re-
duce the handling time for a customer?s email.
The text in a template is suitably modified
into a response by a customer care agent. In
this paper, we present two techniques to im-
prove the effectiveness of a template by pro-
viding tools for the template authors. First,
we present a tool to track and visualize the ed-
its made by agents to a template which serves
as a vital feedback to the template authors.
Second, we present a novel method that au-
tomatically extracts potential templates from
responses authored by agents. These meth-
ods are investigated in the context of an email
customer care analysis tool that handles over a
million emails a year.
