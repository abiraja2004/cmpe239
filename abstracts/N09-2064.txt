Combining the 1-best output of multiple
parsers via parse selection or parse hybridiza-
tion improves f-score over the best indi-
vidual parser (Henderson and Brill, 1999;
Sagae and Lavie, 2006). We propose three
ways to improve upon existing methods for
parser combination. First, we propose a
method of parse hybridization that recom-
bines context-free productions instead of con-
stituents, thereby preserving the structure of
the output of the individual parsers to a greater
extent. Second, we propose an efficient linear-
time algorithm for computing expected f-score
using Minimum Bayes Risk parse selection.
Third, we extend these parser combination
methods from multiple 1-best outputs to mul-
tiple n-best outputs. We present results on
WSJ section 23 and also on the English side
of a Chinese-English parallel corpus.
