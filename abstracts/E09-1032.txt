We explore the problem of resolving the
second person English pronoun you in
multi-party dialogue, using a combination
of linguistic and visual features. First, we
distinguish generic and referential uses,
then we classify the referential uses as ei-
ther plural or singular, and finally, for the
latter cases, we identify the addressee. In
our first set of experiments, the linguistic
and visual features are derived from man-
ual transcriptions and annotations, but in
the second set, they are generated through
entirely automatic means. Results show
that a multimodal system is often prefer-
able to a unimodal one.
