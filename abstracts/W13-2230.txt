We present 5 systems of the Munich-
Edinburgh-Stuttgart1 joint submissions to
the 2013 SMT Shared Task: FR-EN, EN-
FR, RU-EN, DE-EN and EN-DE. The
first three systems employ inflectional gen-
eralization, while the latter two employ
parser-based reordering, and DE-EN per-
forms compound splitting. For our ex-
periments, we use standard phrase-based
Moses systems and operation sequence
models (OSM).
