We present a mixed initiative conversational
dialogue system designed to address primar-
ily mental health care concerns related to
military deployment. It is supported by a
new information-state based dialogue man-
ager, FLoReS (Forward-Looking, Reward
Seeking dialogue manager), that allows both
advanced, flexible, mixed initiative interac-
tion, and efficient policy creation by domain
experts. To easily reach its target population
this dialogue system is accessible as a web ap-
plication.
