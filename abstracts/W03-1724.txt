This paper presents our recent work
for participation in the First Interna-
tional Chinese Word Segmentation Bake-
off (ICWSB-1). It is based on a general-
purpose ngram model for word segmen-
tation and a case-based learning approach
to disambiguation. This system excels
in identifying in-vocabulary (IV) words,
achieving a recall of around 96-98%.
Here we present our strategies for lan-
guage model training and disambiguation
rule learning, analyze the system?s perfor-
mance, and discuss areas for further im-
provement, e.g., out-of-vocabulary (OOV)
word discovery.
