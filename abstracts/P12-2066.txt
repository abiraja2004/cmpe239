Convolution kernels support the modeling of
complex syntactic information in machine-
learning tasks. However, such models are
highly sensitive to the type and size of syntac-
tic structure used. It is therefore an importan-
t challenge to automatically identify high im-
pact sub-structures relevant to a given task. In
this paper we present a systematic study inves-
tigating (combinations of) sequence and con-
volution kernels using different types of sub-
structures in document-level sentiment classi-
fication. We show that minimal sub-structures
extracted from constituency and dependency
trees guided by a polarity lexicon show 1.45
point absolute improvement in accuracy over a
bag-of-words classifier on a widely used sen-
timent corpus.
