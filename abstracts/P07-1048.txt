 
In order to effectively access the rapidly 
increasing range of media content available 
in the home, new kinds of more natural in-
terfaces are needed.  In this paper, we ex-
plore the application of multimodal inter-
face technologies to searching and brows-
ing a database of movies.  The resulting 
system allows users to access movies using 
speech, pen, remote control, and dynamic 
combinations of these modalities. An ex-
perimental evaluation, with more than 40 
users, is presented contrasting two variants 
of the system: one combining speech with 
traditional remote control input and a sec-
ond where the user has a tablet display 
supporting speech and pen input.
