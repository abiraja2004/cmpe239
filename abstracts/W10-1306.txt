 
Today, the technology used for voting does not fully address the issues that disabled vot-ers are confronted with during elections.  Vot-ers, including those with most disabilities, should be able to vote and verify his or her ballot during elections without the assistance of others.  In order for this to happen, a uni-versal design should be incorporated into the development of all voting systems.  The re-search presented here embraces the needs of those who are disabled.  The primary objec-tive of this research was to develop a system in which a person, can efficiently, anony-mously, and independently write-in a candi-date?s name during an election.  The method presented here uses speech interaction and name prediction to allow voters to privately spell the name of the candidate they intend to write-in.  A study was performed to determine the effectiveness and efficiency of the system.  The results of the study showed that spelling a name using the predictive method developed is an effective and efficient solution to the aforementioned issues. 1
