Statistical measures of word similarity have ap-
plication in many areas of natural language pro-
cessing, such as language modeling and in-
formation retrieval. We report a comparative
study of two methods for estimating word co-
occurrence frequencies required by word sim-
ilarity measures. Our frequency estimates are
generated from a terabyte-sized corpus of Web
data, and we study the impact of corpus size
on the effectiveness of the measures. We base
the evaluation on one TOEFL question set and
two practice questions sets, each consisting of
a number of multiple choice questions seek-
ing the best synonym for a given target word.
For two question sets, a context for the target
word is provided, and we examine a number of
word similarity measures that exploit this con-
text. Our best combination of similarity mea-
sure and frequency estimation method answers
6-8% more questions than the best results pre-
viously reported for the same question sets.
