. This paper presents an empirical study on four techniques of lan-
guage model adaptation, including a maximum a posteriori (MAP) method and 
three discriminative training models, in the application of Japanese Kana-Kanji 
conversion. We compare the performance of these methods from various angles 
by adapting the baseline model to four adaptation domains. In particular, we at-
tempt to interpret the results given in terms of the character error rate (CER) by 
correlating them with the characteristics of the adaptation domain measured us-
ing the information-theoretic notion of cross entropy. We show that such a met-
ric correlates well with the CER performance of the adaptation methods, and 
also show that the discriminative methods are not only superior to a MAP-based 
method in terms of achieving larger CER reduction, but are also more robust 
against the similarity of background and adaptation domains.
