This paper investigates the combined use of
pause duration and pitch reset for automatic
story segmentation in Mandarin broadcast
news. Analysis shows that story boundaries
cannot be clearly discriminated from utterance
boundaries by speaker-normalized pitch reset
due to its large variations across different syl-
lable tone pairs. Instead, speaker- and tone-
normalized pitch reset can provide a clear sep-
aration between utterance and story bound-
aries. Experiments using decision trees for
story boundary detection reinforce that raw and
speaker-normalized pitch resets are not effec-
tive for Mandarin Chinese story segmentation.
Speaker- and tone-normalized pitch reset is a
good story boundary indicator. When it is com-
bined with pause duration, a high F-measure
of 86.7% is achieved. Analysis of the decision
tree uncovered four major heuristics that show
how speakers jointly utilize pause duration and
pitch reset to separate speech into stories.
