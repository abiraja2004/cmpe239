This paper describes the joint submission of
Universitat Polite`cnica de Catalunya and Uni-
versitat de Barcelona to the Metrics MaTr
2010 evaluation challenge, in collaboration with
ELDA/ELRA. Our work is aimed at widening the
scope of current automatic evaluation measures
from sentence to document level. Preliminary ex-
periments, based on an extension of the metrics by
Gime?nez and Ma`rquez (2009) operating over dis-
course representations, are presented.
