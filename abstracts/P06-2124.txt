We propose a novel bilingual topical ad-
mixture (BiTAM) formalism for word
alignment in statistical machine transla-
tion. Under this formalism, the paral-
lel sentence-pairs within a document-pair
are assumed to constitute a mixture of
hidden topics; each word-pair follows a
topic-specific bilingual translation model.
Three BiTAM models are proposed to cap-
ture topic sharing at different levels of lin-
guistic granularity (i.e., at the sentence or
word levels). These models enable word-
alignment process to leverage topical con-
tents of document-pairs. Efficient vari-
ational approximation algorithms are de-
signed for inference and parameter esti-
mation. With the inferred latent topics,
BiTAM models facilitate coherent pairing
of bilingual linguistic entities that share
common topical aspects. Our preliminary
experiments show that the proposed mod-
els improve word alignment accuracy, and
lead to better translation quality.
