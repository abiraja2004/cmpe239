Several sets of explanatory variables ? in-
cluding shallow, language modeling, POS,
syntactic, and discourse features ? are com-
pared and evaluated in terms of their im-
pact on predicting the grade level of read-
ing material for primary school students.
We find that features based on in-domain
language models have the highest predic-
tive power. Entity-density (a discourse fea-
ture) and POS-features, in particular nouns,
are individually very useful but highly cor-
related. Average sentence length (a shal-
low feature) is more useful ? and less ex-
pensive to compute ? than individual syn-
tactic features. A judicious combination
of features examined here results in a sig-
nificant improvement over the state of the
art.
