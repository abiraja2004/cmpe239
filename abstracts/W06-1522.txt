In this paper, we introduce a generic ap-
proach to elliptic coordination modeling
through the parsing of Ltag grammars. We
show that erased lexical items can be re-
placed during parsing by informations ga-
thered in the other member of the coordi-
nate structure and used as a guide at the
derivation level. Moreover, we show how
this approach can be indeed implemented
as a light extension of the LTAG formalism
throuh a so-called ?fusion? operation and
by the use of tree schemata during parsing
in order to obtain a dependency graph.
