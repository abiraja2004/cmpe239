This paper introduces a supervised ap-
proach for performing sentence level di-
alect identification between Modern Stan-
dard Arabic and Egyptian Dialectal Ara-
bic. We use token level labels to de-
rive sentence-level features. These fea-
tures are then used with other core and
meta features to train a generative clas-
sifier that predicts the correct label for
each sentence in the given input text. The
system achieves an accuracy of 85.5%
on an Arabic online-commentary dataset
outperforming a previously proposed ap-
proach achieving 80.9% and reflecting a
significant gain over a majority baseline of
51.9% and two strong baseline systems of
78.5% and 80.4%, respectively.
