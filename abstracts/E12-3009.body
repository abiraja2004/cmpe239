This paper is focused on one aspect of SO-
PMI, an unsupervised approach to senti-
ment vocabulary acquisition proposed by
Turney (Turney and Littman, 2003). The
method, originally applied and evaluated
for English, is often used in bootstrap-
ping sentiment lexicons for European lan-
guages where no such resources typically
exist. In general, SO-PMI values are com-
puted from word co-occurrence frequencies
in the neighbourhoods of two small sets of
paradigm words. The goal of this work is
to investigate how lexeme selection affects
the quality of obtained sentiment estima-
tions. This has been achieved by compar-
ing ad hoc random lexeme selection with
two alternative heuristics, based on clus-
tering and SVD decomposition of a word
co-occurrence matrix, demonstrating supe-
riority of the latter methods. The work can
be also interpreted as sensitivity analysis on
SO-PMI with regard to paradigm word se-
lection. The experiments were carried out
for Polish.
