In the investigation for Chinese named
entity (NE) recognition, we are con-
fronted with two principal challenges.
One is how to ensure the quality of word
segmentation and Part-of-Speech (POS)
tagging, because its consequence has an
adverse impact on the performance of NE
recognition. Another is how to flexibly,
reliably and accurately recognize NEs. In
order to cope with the challenges, we pro-
pose a system architecture which is di-
vided into two phases. In the first phase,
we should reduce word segmentation and
POS tagging errors leading to the second
phase as much as possible. For this pur-
pose, we utilize machine learning tech-
niques to repair such errors. In the second
phase, we design Finite State Cascades
(FSC) which can be automatically con-
structed depending on the recognition rule
sets as a shallow parser for the recogni-
tion of NEs. The advantages of that are
reliable, accurate and easy to do mainte-
nance for FSC. Additionally, to recognize
special NEs, we work out the correspond-
ing strategies to enhance the correctness
of the recognition. The experimental
evaluation of the system has shown that
the total average recall and precision for
six types of NEs are 83% and 85% re-
spectively. Therefore, the system architec-
ture is reasonable and effective.
