Generalized Vector Space Models
(GVSM) extend the standard Vector
Space Model (VSM) by embedding addi-
tional types of information, besides terms,
in the representation of documents. An
interesting type of information that can
be used in such models is semantic infor-
mation from word thesauri like WordNet.
Previous attempts to construct GVSM
reported contradicting results. The most
challenging problem is to incorporate the
semantic information in a theoretically
sound and rigorous manner and to modify
the standard interpretation of the VSM.
In this paper we present a new GVSM
model that exploits WordNet?s semantic
information. The model is based on a new
measure of semantic relatedness between
terms. Experimental study conducted
in three TREC collections reveals that
semantic information can boost text
retrieval performance with the use of the
proposed GVSM.
