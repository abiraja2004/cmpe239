Post-editing performed by translators is an
increasingly common use of machine trans-
lated texts. While high quality MT may in-
crease productivity, post-editing poor transla-
tions can be a frustrating task which requires
more effort than translating from scratch. For
this reason, estimating whether machine trans-
lations are of sufficient quality to be used
for post-editing and finding means to reduce
post-editing effort are an important field of
study. Post-editing effort consists of different
aspects, of which temporal effort, or the time
spent on post-editing, is the most visible and
involves not only the technical effort needed
to perform the editing, but also the cognitive
effort required to detect and plan necessary
corrections. Cognitive effort is difficult to ex-
amine directly, but ways to reduce the cogni-
tive effort in particular may prove valuable in
reducing the frustration associated with post-
editing work. In this paper, we describe an
experiment aimed at studying the relationship
between technical post-editing effort and cog-
nitive post-editing effort by comparing cases
where the edit distance and a manual score re-
flecting perceived effort differ. We present re-
sults of an error analysis performed on such
sentences and discuss the clues they may pro-
vide about edits requiring great cognitive ef-
fort compared to the technical effort, on one
hand, or little cognitive effort, on the other.
