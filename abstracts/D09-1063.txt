Sentiment analysis often relies on a se-
mantic orientation lexicon of positive and
negative words. A number of approaches
have been proposed for creating such lex-
icons, but they tend to be computation-
ally expensive, and usually rely on signifi-
cant manual annotation and large corpora.
Most of these methods use WordNet. In
contrast, we propose a simple approach to
generate a high-coverage semantic orien-
tation lexicon, which includes both indi-
vidual words and multi-word expressions,
using only a Roget-like thesaurus and a
handful of affixes. Further, the lexicon
has properties that support the Polyanna
Hypothesis. Using the General Inquirer
as gold standard, we show that our lexi-
con has 14 percentage points more correct
entries than the leading WordNet-based
high-coverage lexicon (SentiWordNet). In
an extrinsic evaluation, we obtain signifi-
cantly higher performance in determining
phrase polarity using our thesaurus-based
lexicon than with any other. Additionally,
we explore the use of visualization tech-
niques to gain insight into the our algo-
rithm beyond the evaluations mentioned
above.
