Update summarization is a new challenge
in multi-document summarization focusing
on summarizing a set of recent documents
relatively to another set of earlier docu-
ments. We present an unsupervised proba-
bilistic approach to model novelty in a doc-
ument collection and apply it to the genera-
tion of update summaries. The new model,
called DUALSUM, results in the second or
third position in terms of the ROUGE met-
rics when tuned for previous TAC competi-
tions and tested on TAC-2011, being statis-
tically indistinguishable from the winning
system. A manual evaluation of the gen-
erated summaries shows state-of-the art re-
sults for DUALSUM with respect to focus,
coherence and overall responsiveness.
