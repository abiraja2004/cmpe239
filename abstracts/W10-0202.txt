Prompt and knowledgeable responses to cus-
tomers? emails are critical in maximizing cus-
tomer satisfaction. Such emails often con-
tain complaints about unfair treatment due to
negligence, incompetence, rigid protocols, un-
friendly systems, and unresponsive personnel.
In this paper, we refer to these emails as emo-
tional emails. They provide valuable feedback
to improve contact center processes and cus-
tomer care, as well as, to enhance customer re-
tention. This paper describes a method for ex-
tracting salient features and identifying emo-
tional emails in customer care. Salient fea-
tures reflect customer frustration, dissatisfac-
tion with the business, and threats to either
leave, take legal action and/or report to au-
thorities. Compared to a baseline system us-
ing word ngrams, our proposed approach with
salient features resulted in a 20% absolute F-
measure improvement.
