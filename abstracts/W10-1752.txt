We present the MT-NCD and MT-mNCD
machine translation evaluation metrics
as submission to the machine transla-
tion evaluation shared task (MetricsMATR
2010). The metrics are based on nor-
malized compression distance (NCD), a
general information theoretic measure of
string similarity, and evaluated against hu-
man judgments from the WMT08 shared
task. The experiments show that 1)
our metric improves correlation to hu-
man judgments by using flexible match-
ing, 2) segment replication is effective,
and 3) our NCD-inspired method for mul-
tiple references indicates improved results.
Generally, the proposed MT-NCD and
MT-mNCD methods correlate competi-
tively with human judgments compared to
commonly used machine translations eval-
uation metrics, for instance, BLEU.
