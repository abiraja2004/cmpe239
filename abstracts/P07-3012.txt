 
I propose a computational treatment of su-
perlatives, starting with superlative con-
structions and the main challenges in 
automatically recognising and extracting 
their components. Initial experimental evi-
dence is provided for the value of the pro-
posed work for Question Answering. I also 
briefly discuss its potential value for Sen-
timent Detection and Opinion Extraction.
