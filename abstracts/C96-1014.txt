 
We describe a number of experiments 
that demonstrate the usefulness of 
prosodic information for a processing 
module which parses spoken utterances 
with a feature-based grammar employing 
empty categories. We show that by re- 
quiring certain prosodic properties from 
those positions in the input, where the 
presence of an empty category has to be 
hypothesized, a derivation can be accom- 
plished more efficiently. The approach 
has been implemented in the machine 
translation project VEItBMOBII, and re- 
sults in a significant reduction of the 
work-load for the parser t.
