In this paper we develop an automatic
classifier for a very large set of labels, the
WordNet synsets. We employ Conditional
Random Fields (CRFs) because of their
flexibility to include a wide variety of non-
independent features. Training CRFs on a
big number of labels proved a problem be-
cause of the large training cost. By tak-
ing into account the hypernym/hyponym
relation between synsets in WordNet, we
reduced the complexity of training from
O(TM2NG) to O(T (logM)2NG) with
only a limited loss in accuracy.
