 
With a keyboard and supporting 
system developed at Cornell Univer- 
sity, input methods used to identify 
ideographs are adaptations of well- 
known schemes; innovation is in the 
addition of automatic machine selec- 
tion of ambiguously identified char- 
acters. 
The unique feature of the Cornell 
design is that a certain amount of 
intelligence has been built into the 
machine. This allows an operator to 
take advantage of the fact that about 
60% of Chinese characters in text 
are paired with other characters to 
form two-syllable compounds or phrase 
words. In speech and writing these 
pairings eliminate about 95% of the 
ambiguities created by ambiguously 
identified syllables.
