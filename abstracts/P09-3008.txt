been used in many different domains for dec-
ades and has also been applied to information 
retrieval (IR) recently.  Documents retrieved 
using this approach are ranked according 
their probability of generating the given 
query. In this paper, we present a novel ap-
proach that employs the generalized Expecta-
tion Maximization (EM) algorithm to im-
prove language models by representing their 
parameters as observation probabilities of 
Hidden Markov Models (HMM). In the expe-
riments, we demonstrate that our method out-
performs standard SLM-based and tf.idf-
based methods on TREC 2005 HARD Track 
data.
