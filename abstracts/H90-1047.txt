 
This paper presents recent natural language work on HARC, 
the BBN Spoken Language System. The HARC system in- 
corporates the Byblos system \[6\] as its speech recognition 
component and the natural anguage system Delphi, which 
consists of a bottom-up arser paired with an integrated syn- 
tax/semantics unification grammar, a discourse module, and 
a database question-answering backend. The paper focuses 
on the syntactic and semantic analyses made in the grammar.
