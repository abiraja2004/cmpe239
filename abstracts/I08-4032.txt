 
This paper introduces the system of Word 
Segmentation and analyzes its evaluation 
results in the Fourth SIGHAN Bakeoff1 . A 
novel method has been used in the system, 
which main idea is: firstly, the main 
problems of WS have been classified, and 
then a cascaded model has been used to 
gradually optimize the system.  The core of 
this WS system is the segmentation of 
ambiguous words and the internal 
information extraction of unknown words. 
The experiments show that the performance 
is satisfying, with the RIV-measure 96.8% 
in NCC open test in the SIGHAN bakeoff 
2007.
