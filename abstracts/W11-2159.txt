We report results on translation of SMS mes-
sages from Haitian Creole to English. We
show improvements by applying spell check-
ing techniques to unknown words and creating
a lattice with the best known spelling equiva-
lents. We also used a small cleaned corpus to
train a cleaning model that we applied to the
noisy corpora.
