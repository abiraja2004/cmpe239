Experiments are reported that investi-
gate the effect of various source docu-
ment representations on the accuracy of
the sentence extraction phase of a multi-
document summarisation task. A novel
representation is introduced based on
generic relation extraction (GRE), which
aims to build systems for relation iden-
tification and characterisation that can be
transferred across domains and tasks with-
out modification of model parameters. Re-
sults demonstrate performance that is sig-
nificantly higher than a non-trivial base-
line that uses tf*idf -weighted words and at
least as good as a comparable but less gen-
eral approach from the literature. Anal-
ysis shows that the representations com-
pared are complementary, suggesting that
extraction performance could be further
improved through system combination.
