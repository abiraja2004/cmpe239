Although much work in NLP has focused
on simply determining what a document
means, we also must know whether or not
to believe it. Fact-finding algorithms at-
tempt to identify the ?truth? among com-
peting claims in a corpus, but fail to
take advantage of the user?s prior knowl-
edge and presume that truth itself is uni-
versal and objective rather than subjec-
tive. We introduce a framework for incor-
porating prior knowledge into any fact-
finding algorithm, expressing both gen-
eral ?common-sense? reasoning and spe-
cific facts already known to the user as
first-order logic and translating this into
a tractable linear program. As our results
show, this approach scales well to even
large problems, both reducing error and
allowing the system to determine truth re-
spective to the user rather than the major-
ity. Additionally, we introduce three new
fact-finding algorithms capable of outper-
forming existing fact-finders in many of
our experiments.
