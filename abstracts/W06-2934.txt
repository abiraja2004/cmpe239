Our approach to dependency parsing is
based on the linear model of McDonald
et al(McDonald et al, 2005b). Instead of
solving the linear model using the Max-
imum Spanning Tree algorithm we pro-
pose an incremental Integer Linear Pro-
gramming formulation of the problem that
allows us to enforce linguistic constraints.
Our results show only marginal improve-
ments over the non-constrained parser. In
addition to the fact that many parses did
not violate any constraints in the first place
this can be attributed to three reasons: 1)
the next best solution that fulfils the con-
straints yields equal or less accuracy, 2)
noisy POS tags and 3) occasionally our
inference algorithm was too slow and de-
coding timed out.
