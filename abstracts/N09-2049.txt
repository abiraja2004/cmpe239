We analyze the recognition errors made by
a morph-based continuous speech recognition
system, which practically allows an unlim-
ited vocabulary. Examining the role of the
acoustic and language models in erroneous
regions shows how speaker adaptive training
(SAT) and discriminative training with mini-
mum phone frame error (MPFE) criterion de-
crease errors in different error classes. An-
alyzing the errors with respect to word fre-
quencies and manually classified error types
reveals the most potential areas for improving
the system.
