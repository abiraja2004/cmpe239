The quality of a statistical machine transla-
tion (SMT) system is heavily dependent upon
the amount of parallel sentences used in train-
ing. In recent years, there have been several
approaches developed for obtaining parallel
sentences from non-parallel, or comparable
data, such as news articles published within
the same time period (Munteanu and Marcu,
2005), or web pages with a similar structure
(Resnik and Smith, 2003). One resource not
yet thoroughly explored is Wikipedia, an on-
line encyclopedia containing linked articles
in many languages. We advance the state
of the art in parallel sentence extraction by
modeling the document level alignment, mo-
tivated by the observation that parallel sen-
tence pairs are often found in close proximity.
We also include features which make use of
the additional annotation given by Wikipedia,
and features using an automatically induced
lexicon model. Results for both accuracy
in sentence extraction and downstream im-
provement in an SMT system are presented.
