Van der Sandt?s algorithm for handling
presupposition is based on a ?presuppo-
sition as anaphora? paradigm and is ex-
pressed in the realm of Kamp?s DRT. In
recent years, we have proposed a type-
theoretic rebuilding of DRT that allows
Montague?s semantics to be combined
with discourse dynamics. Here we ex-
plore van der Sandt?s theory along the
line of this formal framework. It then re-
sults that presupposition handling may be
expressed in a purely Montagovian set-
ting, and that presupposition accommoda-
tion amounts to exception handling.
