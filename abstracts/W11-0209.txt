Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) plays a key
role in many NLP applications. The develop-
ment of SRL systems for the biomedical do-
main is frustrated by the lack of large domain-
specific corpora that are labeled with seman-
tic roles. Corpus development has been very
expensive and time-consuming. In this paper
we propose a method for building frame-based
corpus on the basis of domain knowledge pro-
vided by ontologies. We believe that ontolo-
gies, as a structured and semantic represen-
tation of domain knowledge, can instruct and
ease the tasks in building the corpora. In the
paper we present a corpus built by using the
method. We compared it to BioFrameNet, and
examined the gaps between the semantic clas-
sification of the target words in the domain-
specific corpus and in FrameNet and Prop-
Bank/VerbNet.
