We present a simple architecture for parsing
transcribed speech in which an edited-word de-
tector rst removes such words from the sen-
tence string, and then a standard statistical
parser trained on transcribed speech parses the
remaining words. The edit detector achieves a
misclassication rate on edited words of 2.2%.
(The NULL-model, which marks everything as
not edited, has an error rate of 5.9%.) To evalu-
ate our parsing results we introduce a new eval-
uation metric, the purpose of which is to make
evaluation of a parse tree relatively indierent
to the exact tree position of EDITED nodes. By
this metric the parser achieves 85.3% precision
and 86.5% recall.
