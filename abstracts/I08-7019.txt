 
The aim of this paper is to present a basic 
framework to build a test collection for a 
Vietnamese text categorization. The pre-
sented content includes our evaluations of 
some popular text categorization test col-
lections, our researches on the require-
ments, the proposed model and the tech-
niques to build the BKTexts - test collec-
tion for a Vietnamese text categorization. 
The XML specification of both text and 
metadata of Vietnamese documents in the 
BKTexts also is presented. Our BKTexts 
test collection is built with the XML speci-
fication and currently has more than 17100 
Vietnamese text documents collected from 
e-newspapers.
