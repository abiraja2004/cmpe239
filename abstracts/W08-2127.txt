This paper describes our system to carry
out the joint parsing of syntactic and se-
mantic dependencies for our participation
in the shared task of CoNLL-2008. We il-
lustrate that both syntactic parsing and se-
mantic parsing can be transformed into a
word-pair classification problem and im-
plemented as a single-stage system with
the aid of maximum entropy modeling.
Our system ranks the fourth in the closed
track for the task with the following per-
formance on the WSJ+Brown test set:
81.44% labeled macro F1 for the overall
task, 86.66% labeled attachment for syn-
tactic dependencies, and 76.16% labeled
F1 for semantic dependencies.
