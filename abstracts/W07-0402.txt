We present a proposal for the structure
of noun phrases in Synchronous Tree-
Adjoining Grammar (STAG) syntax and
semantics that permits an elegant and uni-
form analysis of a variety of phenom-
ena, including quantifier scope and ex-
traction phenomena such as wh-questions
with both moved and in-place wh-words,
pied-piping, stranding of prepositions, and
topicalization. The tight coupling be-
tween syntax and semantics enforced by
the STAG helps to illuminate the critical
relationships and filter out analyses that
may be appealing for either syntax or se-
mantics alone but do not allow for a mean-
ingful relationship between them.
