This paper presents an unsupervised re-
lation extraction algorithm, which in-
duces relations between entity pairs by
grouping them into a ?natural? num-
ber of clusters based on the similarity
of their contexts. Stability-based crite-
rion is used to automatically estimate
the number of clusters. For removing
noisy feature words in clustering proce-
dure, feature selection is conducted by
optimizing a trace based criterion sub-
ject to some constraint in an unsuper-
vised manner. After relation clustering
procedure, we employ a discriminative
category matching (DCM) to find typi-
cal and discriminative words to repre-
sent different relations. Experimental
results show the effectiveness of our al-
gorithm.
