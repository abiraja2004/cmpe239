This paper outlines a measure of lan-
guage similarity based on structural
similarity of surface syntactic depen-
dency trees. Unlike the more tradi-
tional string-based measures, this mea-
sure tries to reflect ?deeper? correspon-
dences among languages. The develop-
ment of this measure has been inspired
by the experience from MT of syntac-
tically similar languages. This experi-
ence shows that the lexical similarity is
less important than syntactic similar-
ity. This claim is supported by a num-
ber of examples illustrating the prob-
lems which may arise when a measure
of language similarity relies too much
on a simple similarity of texts in differ-
ent languages.
