 
This paper presents a hybrid model for 
restoring an elided entry word for en-
cyclopedia QA system. In Korean en-
cyclopedia, an entry word is frequently 
omitted in a sentence. If the QA system 
uses a sentence without an entry word, 
it cannot provide a right answer. For 
resolving this problem, we combine a 
rule-based approach with Maximum 
Entropy model to use the merit of each 
approach. A rule-based approach uses 
caseframes and sense classes. The re-
sult shows that combined approach 
gives a 20% increase over our baseline.
