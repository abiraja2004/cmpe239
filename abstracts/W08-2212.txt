Assigning arguments of verbs to different semantic classes (?semantic
typing?), or alternatively, checking the ?selectional restrictions? of predi-
cates, is a fundamental component of many natural language processing
tasks. However, a common experience has been that general purpose se-
mantic classes, such as those encoded in resources like WordNet, or hand-
crafted subject-specific ontologies, are seldom quite right when it comes
to analysing texts from a particular domain. In this paper we describe a
method of automatically deriving fine-grained, domain-specific semantic
classes of arguments while simultaneously clustering verbs into semanti-
cally meaningful groups: the first step in verb sense induction. We show
that in a small pilot study on new examples from the same domain we are
able to achieve almost perfect recall and reasonably high precision in the
semantic typing of verb arguments in these texts.
