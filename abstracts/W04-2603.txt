 
In natural language, the meaning of a lexeme 
often varies due to the specific surrounding 
context. Computational approaches to natural 
language processing can benefit from a reli-
able, long-range-context-dependent represen-
tation of the meaning of each lexeme that 
appears in a given sentence. We have devel-
oped a general new technique that produces a 
context-dependent ?meaning? representation 
for a lexeme in a specific surrounding context. 
The ?meaning? of a lexeme in a specific con-
text is represented by a list of semantically re-
placeable elements the members of which are 
other lexemes from our experimental lexicon. 
We have performed experiments with a lexi-
con composed of individual English words 
and also with a lexicon of individual words 
and selected phrases. The resulting lists can be 
used to compare the ?meaning? of conceptual 
units (individual words or frequently-
occurring phrases) in different contexts and 
also can serve as features for machine learning 
approaches to classify semantic roles and rela-
tionships.
