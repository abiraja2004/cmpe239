 
This paper presents a Chinese Word 
Segmentation system for the closed track 
of CIPS-SIGHAN Word Segmentation 
Bakeoff 2010. This system adopts a 
character-based joint approach, which 
combines a character-based generative 
model and a character-based discrimina-
tive model. To further improve the cross-
domain performance, we use an addi-
tional semi-supervised learning proce-
dure to incorporate the unlabeled corpus. 
The final performance on the closed 
track for the simplified-character text 
shows that our system achieves compa-
rable results with other state-of-the-art 
systems.
