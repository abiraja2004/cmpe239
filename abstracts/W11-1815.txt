Bacteria, geo-graphical locations and host entities were processed by a pattern-based approach and domain lexical resources. For the extraction of environment locations, we propose a framework based on semantic analysis sup-ported by an ontology of the biotope do-main. Domain-specific rules were devel-oped for dealing with Bacteria anaphora. Official results show that our Alvis system achieves the best performance of participat-ing systems.
