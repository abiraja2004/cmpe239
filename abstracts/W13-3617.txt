This paper describes an English grammat-
ical error correction system for CoNLL-
2013 shared task. Error types covered by
our system are article/determiner, prepo-
sition, and noun number agreement. This
work is our first attempt on grammatical
error correction research. In this work,
we only focus on reimplementing the tech-
niques presented before and optimizing
the performance. As a result of the imple-
mentation, our system?s final F1-score by
m2 scorer is 0.1282 in our internal test set.
