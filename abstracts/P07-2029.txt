Live closed-captions for deaf and hard of
hearing audiences are currently produced
by stenographers, or by voice writers us-
ing speech recognition. Both techniques can
produce captions with errors. We are cur-
rently developing a correction module that
allows a user to intercept the real-time cap-
tion stream and correct it before it is broad-
cast. We report results of preliminary ex-
periments on correction rate and actual user
performance using a prototype correction
module connected to the output of a speech
recognition captioning system.
