 
This paper describes the basic philosophy 
and implementation of MPLUS (M+), a 
robust medical text analysis tool that uses a 
semantic model based on Bayesian 
Networks (BNs).  BNs provide a concise 
and useful formalism for representing 
semantic patterns in medical text, and for 
recognizing and reasoning over those 
patterns. BNs are noise-tolerant, and 
facilitate the training of M+.
