Given a movie comment, does it contain
a spoiler? A spoiler is a comment that,
when disclosed, would ruin a surprise or
reveal an important plot detail. We study
automatic methods to detect comments
and reviews that contain spoilers and ap-
ply them to reviews from the IMDB (Inter-
net Movie Database) website. We develop
topic models, based on Latent Dirichlet
Allocation (LDA), but using linguistic de-
pendency information in place of simple
features from bag of words (BOW) repre-
sentations. Experimental results demon-
strate the effectiveness of our technique
over four movie-comment datasets of dif-
ferent scales.
