Word-level morphosyntactic descrip-
tions, such as ?Ncmsn? designating a
common masculine singular noun in
the nominative, have been developed
for all Slavic languages, yet there have
been few attempts to arrive at a pro-
posal that would be harmonised across
the languages. Standardisation adds
to the interchange potential of the re-
sources, making it easier to develop
multilingual applications or to evaluate
language technology tools across sev-
eral languages. The process of the
harmonisation of morphosyntactic cat-
egories, esp. for morphologically rich
Slavic languages is also interesting from
a language-typological perspective. The
EU MULTEXT-East project developed
corpora, lexica and tools for seven
languages, with the focus being on
morphosyntactic data, including formal,
EAGLES-based specifications for lexi-
cal morphosyntactic descriptions. The
specifications were later extended, so
that they currently cover nine languages,
five from the Slavic family: Bulgarian,
Croatian, Czech, Serbian and Slovene.
The paper presents these morphosyn-
tactic specifications, giving their back-
ground and structure, including the en-
coding of the tables as TEI feature struc-
tures. The five Slavic language specifi-
cations are discussed in more depth.
