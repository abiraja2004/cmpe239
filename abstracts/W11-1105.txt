A graph-based distance between Wikipedia ar-
ticles is defined using a random walk model,
which estimates visiting probability (VP) be-
tween articles using two types of links: hy-
perlinks and lexical similarity relations. The
VP to and from a set of articles is then com-
puted, and approximations are proposed to
make tractable the computation of semantic
relatedness between every two texts in a large
data set. The model is applied to document
clustering on the 20 Newsgroups data set. Pre-
cision and recall are improved in comparison
with previous textual distance algorithms.
