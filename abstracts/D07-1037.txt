We present a domain-independent unsuper-
vised topic segmentation approach based on
hybrid document indexing. Lexical chains
have been successfully employed to evalu-
ate lexical cohesion of text segments and to
predict topic boundaries. Our approach is
based in the notion of semantic cohesion. It
uses spectral embedding to estimate seman-
tic association between content nouns over a
span of multiple text segments. Our method
significantly outperforms the baseline on the
topic segmentation task and achieves perfor-
mance comparable to state-of-the-art meth-
ods that incorporate domain specific infor-
mation.
