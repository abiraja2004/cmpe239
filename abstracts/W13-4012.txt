 
In this paper, we describe novel methods for 
topic segmentation based on patterns of dis-
course organization. Using a corpus of news 
texts, our results show that it is possible to use 
discourse features (based on Rhetorical Struc-
ture Theory) for topic segmentation and that 
we outperform some well-known methods.
