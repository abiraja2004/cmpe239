This paper develops a compositional
vector-based semantics of relative pro-
nouns within a categorical framework.
Frobenius algebras are used to formalise
the operations required to model the se-
mantics of relative pronouns, including
passing information between the relative
clause and the modified noun phrase, as
well as copying, combining, and discard-
ing parts of the relative clause. We de-
velop two instantiations of the abstract se-
mantics, one based on a truth-theoretic ap-
proach and one based on corpus statistics.
