Traditionally, coreference resolution is done
by mining the reference relationships be-
tween NP pairs. However, an individual NP
usually lacks adequate description informa-
tion of its referred entity. In this paper,
we propose a supervised learning-based ap-
proach which does coreference resolution by
exploring the relationships between NPs and
coreferential clusters. Compared with indi-
vidual NPs, coreferential clusters could pro-
vide richer information of the entities for bet-
ter rules learning and reference determina-
tion. The evaluation done on MEDLINE
data set shows that our approach outper-
forms the baseline NP-NP based approach
in both recall and precision.
