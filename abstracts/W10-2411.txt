NEWS 2010 Shared Task on Transliteration 
Generation held as part of ACL 2010. One 
standard run and two non-standard runs were 
submitted for English to Hindi and Bengali 
transliteration while one standard and one non-
standard run were submitted for Kannada and 
Tamil. The transliteration systems are based 
on Orthographic rules and Phoneme based 
technology. The system has been trained on 
the NEWS 2010 Shared Task on Translitera-
tion Generation datasets. For the standard run, 
the system demonstrated mean F-Score values 
of 0.818 for Bengali, 0.714 for Hindi, 0.663 
for Kannada and 0.563 for Tamil. The reported 
mean F-Score values of non-standard runs are 
0.845 and 0.875 for Bengali non-standard run-
1 and 2, 0.752 and 0.739 for Hindi non-
standard run-1 and 2, 0.662 for Kannada non-
standard run-1 and 0.760 for Tamil non-
standard run-1. Non-Standard Run-2 for Ben-
gali has achieved the highest score among all 
the submitted runs. Hindi Non-Standard Run-1 
and Run-2 runs are ranked as the 5th and 6th 
among all submitted Runs.
