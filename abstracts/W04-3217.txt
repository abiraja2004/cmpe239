A method for automatic plot analysis of narrative
texts that uses components of both traditional sym-
bolic analysis of natural language and statistical
machine-learning is presented for the story rewrit-
ing task. In the story rewriting task, an exemplar
story is read to the pupils and the pupils rewrite the
story in their own words. This allows them to prac-
tice language skills such as spelling, diction, and
grammar without being stymied by content creation.
Often the pupil improperly recalls the story. Our
method of automatic plot analysis enables the tu-
toring system to automatically analyze the student?s
story for both general coherence and specific miss-
ing events.
