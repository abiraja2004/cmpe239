 
This paper investigates the use of machine 
learning algorithms to label modifier-noun 
compounds with a semantic relation. The 
attributes used as input to the learning algo-
rithms are the web frequencies for phrases 
containing the modifier, noun, and a prepo-
sitional joining term. We compare and 
evaluate different algorithms and different 
joining phrases on Nastase and Szpako-
wicz?s (2003) dataset of 600 modifier-noun 
compounds. We find that by using a Sup-
port Vector Machine classifier we can ob-
tain better performance on this dataset than 
a current state-of-the-art system; even with 
a relatively small set of prepositional join-
ing terms.
