This article presents a compression-based adap-
tive algorithm for Chinese Pinyin input. There
are many different input methods for Chinese
character text and the phonetic Pinyin in-
put method is the one most commonly used.
Compression by Partial Match (PPM) is an
adaptive statistical modelling technique that
is widely used in the field of text compres-
sion. Compression-based approaches are able to
build models very efficiently and incrementally.
Experiments show that adaptive compression-
based approach for Pinyin input outperforms
modified Kneser-Ney smoothing method im-
plemented by SRILM language tools (Stolcke,
2002).
