Handling terminology is an important
matter in a translation workflow. However,
current Machine Translation (MT) sys-
tems do not yet propose anything proactive
upon tools which assist in managing termi-
nological databases. In this work, we in-
vestigate several enhancements to analog-
ical learning and test our implementation
on translating medical terms. We show
that the analogical engine works equally
well when translating from and into a mor-
phologically rich language, or when deal-
ing with language pairs written in differ-
ent scripts. Combining it with a phrase-
based statistical engine leads to significant
improvements.
