We describe for dependency parsing an an-
notation adaptation strategy, which can au-
tomatically transfer the knowledge from
a source corpus with a different annota-
tion standard to the desired target parser,
with the supervision by a target corpus an-
notated in the desired standard. Further-
more, instead of a hand-annotated one, a
projected treebank derived from a bilin-
gual corpus is used as the source cor-
pus. This benefits the resource-scarce
languages which haven?t different hand-
annotated treebanks. Experiments show
that the target parser gains significant im-
provement over the baseline parser trained
on the target corpus only, when the target
corpus is smaller.
