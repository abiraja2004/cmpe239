In morphologically rich languages, should morphological and
syntactic disambiguation be treated sequentially or as a sin-
gle problem? We describe several efficient, probabilistically-
interpretable ways to apply joint inference to morphological
and syntactic disambiguation using lattice parsing. Joint infer-
ence is shown to compare favorably to pipeline parsing methods
across a variety of component models. State-of-the-art perfor-
mance on Hebrew Treebank parsing is demonstrated using the
new method. The benefits of joint inference are modest with
the current component models, but appear to increase as com-
ponents themselves improve.
