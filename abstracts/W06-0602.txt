 
In this paper, we present a semi-
automatic approach for annotating se-
mantic information in biomedical texts. 
The information is used to construct  
a biomedical proposition bank called 
BioProp. Like PropBank in the newswire 
domain, BioProp contains annotations of 
predicate argument structures and seman-
tic roles in a treebank schema. To con-
struct BioProp, a semantic role labeling 
(SRL) system trained on PropBank is 
used to annotate BioProp. Incorrect tag-
ging results are then corrected by human 
annotators. To suit the needs in the bio-
medical domain, we modify the Prop-
Bank annotation guidelines and charac-
terize semantic roles as components of 
biological events. The method can sub-
stantially reduce annotation efforts, and 
we introduce a measure of an upper 
bound for the saving of annotation efforts. 
Thus far, the method has been applied 
experimentally to a 4,389-sentence tree-
bank corpus for the construction of Bio-
Prop. Inter-annotator agreement meas-
ured by kappa statistic reaches .95 for 
combined decision of role identification 
and classification when all argument la-
bels are considered. In addition, we show 
that, when trained on BioProp, our bio-
medical SRL system called BIOSMILE 
achieves an F-score of 87%.
