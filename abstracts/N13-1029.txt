We present a new variant of the Syntax-
Augmented Machine Translation (SAMT) for-
malism with a category-coarsening algorithm
originally developed for tree-to-tree gram-
mars. We induce bilingual labels into the
SAMT grammar, use them for category coars-
ening, then project back to monolingual la-
beling as in standard SAMT. The result is a
?collapsed? grammar with the same expres-
sive power and format as the original, but
many fewer nonterminal labels. We show that
the smaller label set provides improved trans-
lation scores by 1.14 BLEU on two Chinese?
English test sets while reducing the occur-
rence of sparsity and ambiguity problems
common to large label sets.
