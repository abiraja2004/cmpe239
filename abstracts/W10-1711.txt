In this paper we describe the statisti-
cal machine translation system of the
RWTH Aachen University developed for
the translation task of the Fifth Workshop
on Statistical Machine Translation. State-
of-the-art phrase-based and hierarchical
statistical MT systems are augmented
with appropriate morpho-syntactic en-
hancements, as well as alternative phrase
training methods and extended lexicon
models. For some tasks, a system combi-
nation of the best systems was used to gen-
erate a final hypothesis. We participated
in the constrained condition of German-
English and French-English in each trans-
lation direction.
