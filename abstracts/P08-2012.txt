A desirable quality of a coreference resolution
system is the ability to handle transitivity con-
straints, such that even if it places high like-
lihood on a particular mention being corefer-
ent with each of two other mentions, it will
also consider the likelihood of those two men-
tions being coreferent when making a final as-
signment. This is exactly the kind of con-
straint that integer linear programming (ILP)
is ideal for, but, surprisingly, previous work
applying ILP to coreference resolution has not
encoded this type of constraint. We train a
coreference classifier over pairs of mentions,
and show how to encode this type of constraint
on top of the probabilities output from our
pairwise classifier to extract the most probable
legal entity assignments. We present results
on two commonly used datasets which show
that enforcement of transitive closure consis-
tently improves performance, including im-
provements of up to 3.6% using the b3 scorer,
and up to 16.5% using cluster f-measure.
