This paper describes Meteor 1.3, our submis-
sion to the 2011 EMNLP Workshop on Sta-
tistical Machine Translation automatic evalua-
tion metric tasks. New metric features include
improved text normalization, higher-precision
paraphrase matching, and discrimination be-
tween content and function words. We include
Ranking and Adequacy versions of the metric
shown to have high correlation with human
judgments of translation quality as well as a
more balanced Tuning version shown to out-
perform BLEU in minimum error rate training
for a phrase-based Urdu-English system.
