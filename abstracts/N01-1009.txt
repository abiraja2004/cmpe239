In this paper we investigate polysemous adjectives whose
meaning varies depending on the nouns they modify
(e.g., fast). We acquire the meanings of these adjectives
from a large corpus and propose a probabilistic model
which provides a ranking on the set of possible interpre-
tations. We identify lexical semantic information auto-
matically by exploiting the consistent correspondences
between surface syntactic cues and lexical meaning.
We evaluate our results against paraphrase judgments
elicited experimentally from humans and show that the
model?s ranking of meanings correlates reliably with hu-
man intuitions: meanings that are found highly probable
by the model are also rated as plausible by the subjects.
