 
This paper gives a formal theory of presupposition using 
situation semantics developed by Barwise and Perry, We will 
slightly modify Barwise and Perry's original theory of situation 
semantics so that we can deal with non-monotonic reasonings 
which are very important for the formalization of presupposi- 
tion in natural language. This aspect is closely related to the 
formalization of incomplete knowledge in art i f ic ia l  intelligence,
