We propose to model multiword expres-
sions as dependency subgraphs, and re-
alize this idea in the grammar formal-
ism of Extensible Dependency Gram-
mar (XDG). We extend XDG to lexi-
calize dependency subgraphs, and show
how to compile them into simple lexical
entries, amenable to parsing and gener-
ation with the existing XDG constraint
solver.
