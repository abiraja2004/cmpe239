In this paper we describe LIHLA, a lexical
aligner which uses bilingual probabilis-
tic lexicons generated by a freely availa-
ble set of tools (NATools) and language-
independent heuristics to find links be-
tween single words and multiword units
in sentence-aligned parallel texts. The
method has achieved an alignment error
rate of 22.72% and 44.49% on English?
Inuktitut and Romanian?English parallel
sentences, respectively.
