This is a description of the submissions made
by the pattern recognition and human lan-
guage technology group (PRHLT) of the Uni-
versitat Polite`cnica de Vale`ncia to the qual-
ity estimation task of the seventh workshop
on statistical machine translation (WMT12).
We focus on two different issues: how to ef-
fectively combine subsequence-level features
into sentence-level features, and how to select
the most adequate subset of features. Results
showed that an adequate selection of a subset
of highly discriminative features can improve
efficiency and performance of the quality esti-
mation system.
