 
We present a system to determine 
content similarity of documents. 
Our goal is to identify pairs of book 
chapters that are translations of the 
same original chapter.  Achieving 
this goal requires identification of 
not only the different topics in the 
documents but also of the particular 
flow of these topics.   
Our approach to content 
similarity evaluation employs n-
grams of lexical chains and 
measures similarity using the 
cosine of vectors of n-grams of 
lexical chains, vectors of tf*idf-
weighted keywords, and vectors of 
unweighted lexical chains 
(unigrams of lexical chains).  Our 
results show that n-grams of 
unordered lexical chains of length 
four or more are particularly useful 
for the recognition of content 
similarity.
