Text categorization is a crucial and well-
proven method for organizing the collec-
tion of large scale documents. In this pa-
per, we propose a hierarchical multi-class
text categorization method with global
margin maximization. We not only max-
imize the margins among leaf categories,
but also maximize the margins among
their ancestors. Experiments show that the
performance of our algorithm is competi-
tive with the recently proposed hierarchi-
cal multi-class classification algorithms.
