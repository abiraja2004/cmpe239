Logical metonymies (The student finished
the beer) represent a challenge to composi-
tionality since they involve semantic content
not overtly realized in the sentence (covert
events ? drinking the beer). We present a
contrastive study of two classes of computa-
tional models for logical metonymy in German,
namely a probabilistic and a distributional,
similarity-based model. These are built using
the SDEWAC corpus and evaluated against a
dataset from a self-paced reading and a probe
recognition study for their sensitivity to the-
matic fit effects via their accuracy in predicting
the correct covert event in a metonymical con-
text. The similarity-based models allow for
better coverage while maintaining the accuracy
of the probabilistic models.
