One of the most neglected areas of biomed-
ical Text Mining (TM) is the development
of systems based on carefully assessed user
needs. We investigate the needs of an im-
portant task yet to be tackled by TM ? Can-
cer Risk Assessment (CRA) ? and take the
first step towards the development of TM for
the task: identifying and organizing the sci-
entific evidence required for CRA in a taxon-
omy. The taxonomy is based on expert annota-
tion of 1297 MEDLINE abstracts. We report
promising results with inter-annotator agree-
ment tests and automatic classification experi-
ments, and a user test which demonstrates that
the resources we have built are well-defined,
accurate, and applicable to a real-world CRA
scenario. We discuss extending and refining
the taxonomy further via manual and machine
learning approaches, and the subsequent steps
required to develop TM for the needs of CRA.
