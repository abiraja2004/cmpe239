  
This paper proposes a new method for 
automatic acquisition of Chinese bracketing 
knowledge from English-Chinese sentence- 
aligned bilingual corpora. Bilingual sentence 
pairs are first aligned in syntactic structure by 
combining English parse trees with a 
statistical bilingual language model. Chinese 
bracketing knowledge is then extracted 
automatically. The preliminary experiments 
show automatically learned knowledge 
accords well with manually annotated 
brackets. The proposed method is 
particularly useful to acquire bracketing 
knowledge for a less studied language that 
lacks tools and resources found in a second 
language more studied. Although this paper 
discusses experiments with Chinese and 
English, the method is also applicable to 
other language pairs.
