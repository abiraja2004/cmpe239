This  paper presents a current  status of 
Thai resources and tools for CG  devel-
opment.  We also  proposed  a  Thai  cat-
egorial dependency grammar (CDG), an 
extended version of CG which includes 
dependency  analysis  into  CG notation. 
Beside, an idea of how to group a word 
that has the same functions are presen-
ted to gain a certain type of category per 
word. We also discuss about a difficulty 
of  building  treebank  and  mention  a 
toolkit for assisting on a Thai CGs tree 
building  and  a  tree  format  representa-
tions. In this paper, we also give a sum-
mary  of  applications  related  to  Thai 
CGs.
