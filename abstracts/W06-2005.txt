We describe a knowledge and resource
light system for an automatic morpholog-
ical analysis and tagging of Brazilian Por-
tuguese.1 We avoid the use of labor in-
tensive resources; particularly, large anno-
tated corpora and lexicons. Instead, we
use (i) an annotated corpus of Peninsular
Spanish, a language related to Portuguese,
(ii) an unannotated corpus of Portuguese,
(iii) a description of Portuguese morphol-
ogy on the level of a basic grammar book.
We extend the similar work that we have
done (Hana et al, 2004; Feldman et al,
2006) by proposing an alternative algo-
rithm for cognate transfer that effectively
projects the Spanish emission probabili-
ties into Portuguese. Our experiments use
minimal new human effort and show 21%
error reduction over even emissions on a
fine-grained tagset.
