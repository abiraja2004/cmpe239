The concept classifier has been used as a
translation unit in speech-to-speech trans-
lation systems. However, the sparsity of
the training data is the bottle neck of its
effectiveness. Here, a new method based
on using a statistical machine translation
system has been introduced to mitigate the
effects of data sparsity for training classi-
fiers. Also, the effects of the background
model which is necessary to compensate
the above problem, is investigated. Exper-
imental evaluation in the context of cross-
lingual doctor-patient interaction applica-
tion show the superiority of the proposed
method.
