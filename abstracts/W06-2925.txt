We describe an online learning depen-
dency parser for the CoNLL-X Shared
Task, based on the bottom-up projective
algorithm of Eisner (2000). We experi-
ment with a large feature set that mod-
els: the tokens involved in dependencies
and their immediate context, the surface-
text distance between tokens, and the syn-
tactic context dominated by each depen-
dency. In experiments, the treatment of
multilingual information was totally blind.
