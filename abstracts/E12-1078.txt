We compare the impact of sentence-
internal vs. sentence-external features on
word order prediction in two generation
settings: starting out from a discrimina-
tive surface realisation ranking model for
an LFG grammar of German, we enrich
the feature set with lexical chain features
from the discourse context which can be
robustly detected and reflect rough gram-
matical correlates of notions from theoreti-
cal approaches to discourse coherence. In a
more controlled setting, we develop a con-
stituent ordering classifier that is trained
on a German treebank with gold corefer-
ence annotation. Surprisingly, in both set-
tings, the sentence-external features per-
form poorly compared to the sentence-
internal ones, and do not improve over
a baseline model capturing the syntactic
functions of the constituents.
