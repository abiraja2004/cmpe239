 
There is a growing research interest in opinion 
retrieval as on-line users? opinions are becom-
ing more and more popular in business, social 
networks, etc. Practically speaking, the goal of 
opinion retrieval is to retrieve documents, 
which entail opinions or comments, relevant to 
a target subject specified by the user?s query. A 
fundamental challenge in opinion retrieval is 
information representation. Existing research 
focuses on document-based approaches and 
documents are represented by bag-of-word. 
However, due to loss of contextual information, 
this representation fails to capture the associa-
tive information between an opinion and its 
corresponding target. It cannot distinguish dif-
ferent degrees of a sentiment word when asso-
ciated with different targets. This in turn se-
riously affects opinion retrieval performance. 
In this paper, we propose a sentence-based ap-
proach based on a new information representa-
tion, namely topic-sentiment word pair, to cap-
ture intra-sentence contextual information be-
tween an opinion and its target. Additionally, 
we consider inter-sentence information to cap-
ture the relationships among the opinions on 
the same topic. Finally, the two types of infor-
mation are combined in a unified graph-based 
model, which can effectively rank the docu-
ments. Compared with existing approaches, 
experimental results on the COAE08 dataset 
showed that our graph-based model achieved 
significant improvement.
