Multivariate analysis allows decoding of sin-
gle trial data in individual subjects. Since dif-
ferent models are obtained for each subject it
becomes hard to perform an analysis on the
group level. We introduce a new algorithm for
Bayesian multi-task learning which imposes a
coupling between single-subject models. Us-
ing the CMU fMRI dataset it is shown that the
algorithm can be used for concept classifica-
tion based on the average activation of regions
in the AAL atlas. Concepts which were most
easily classified correspond to the categories
shelter, manipulation and eating, which is in
accordance with the literature. The multi-task
learning algorithm is shown to find regions of
interest that are common to all subjects which
therefore facilitates interpretation of the ob-
tained models.
