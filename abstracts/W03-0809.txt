The paper presents a system architecture for
the automatic generation of interface specifica-
tions from ontologies.1 The ensuing interfaces
(XML schema definitions) preserve a signifi-
cant amount of the knowledge originally en-
coded in the ontology. The approach is rele-
vant for the engineering of large-scale language
technology systems. It has been successfully
deployed in a complex multi-modal dialogue
system SMARTKOM.
