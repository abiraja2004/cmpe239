It is remarkable if any relationship at all
persists between computational linguists
(CL) and that part of general linguis-
tics comprising the mainstream of MIT
transformational-generative (TG) theoreti-
cal syntax. If the lines are still open, it rep-
resents something of a tribute to CL prac-
titioners? tolerance ? a triumph of hope
and goodwill over the experience of abuse
? because the TG community has shown
considerable hostility toward CL and ev-
erything it stands for over the past fifty
years. I offer some brief historical notes,
and hint at prospects for a better basis for
collaboration in the future.
