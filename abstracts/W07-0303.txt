 
The multimodal presentation dashboard al-
lows users to control and browse presenta-
tion content such as slides and diagrams 
through a multimodal interface that sup-
ports speech and pen input. In addition to 
control commands (e.g. ?take me to slide 
10?), the system allows multimodal search 
over content collections. For example, if 
the user says ?get me a slide about internet 
telephony,? the system will present a 
ranked series of candidate slides that they 
can then select among using voice, pen, or 
a wireless remote. As presentations are 
loaded, their content is analyzed and lan-
guage and understanding models are built 
dynamically. This approach frees the user 
from the constraints of linear order allow-
ing for a more dynamic and responsive 
presentation style.
