This paper compares different measures of
graphemic similarity applied to the task
of bilingual lexicon induction between a
Swiss German dialect and Standard Ger-
man. The measures have been adapted
to this particular language pair by training
stochastic transducers with the Expectation-
Maximisation algorithm or by using hand-
made transduction rules. These adaptive
metrics show up to 11% F-measure improve-
ment over a static metric like Levenshtein
distance.
