 
In this paper a version of LFG will be developed, which has only 
one level of representation and is equivalent o the modified 
version of \[2\], presented in \[3\]. The structures of this mono- 
stratal version are f-structures, augmented by additional infor- 
mation about the derived symbols and their linear order. For these 
structures it is possible to define an adequate concept of direct 
derivability by which the derivation proeess becomes more 
efficient, as the f-description solution algorithm is directly 
simulated during the derivation of these structures, instead of 
being postponed. Apart from this it follows from tiffs redueability 
that LFG as a theory in its present form does not make use of the 
c-structure information that goes beyond the mere linear order of 
the derived symbols.
