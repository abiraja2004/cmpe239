The use of figurative language is ubiqui-
tous in natural language texts and it is a
serious bottleneck in automatic text un-
derstanding. We address the problem of
interpretation of logical metonymy, using
a statistical method. Our approach origi-
nates from that of Lapata and Lascarides
(2003), which generates a list of non-
disambiguated interpretations with their
likelihood derived from a corpus. We pro-
pose a novel sense-based representation
of the interpretation of logical metonymy
and a more thorough evaluation method
than that of Lapata and Lascarides (2003).
By carrying out a human experiment we
prove that such a representation is intu-
itive to human subjects. We derive a rank-
ing scheme for verb senses using an unan-
notated corpus, WordNet sense numbering
and glosses. We also provide an account
of the requirements that different aspec-
tual verbs impose onto the interpretation
of logical metonymy. We tested our sys-
tem on verb-object metonymic phrases. It
identifies and ranks metonymic interpreta-
tions with the mean average precision of
0.83 as compared to the gold standard.
