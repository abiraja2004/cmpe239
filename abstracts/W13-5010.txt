Entity Resolution is the task of identifying which
records in a database refer to the same entity. A
standard machine learning pipeline for the entity res-
olution problem consists of three major components:
blocking, pairwise linkage, and clustering. The
blocking step groups records by shared properties to
determine which pairs of records should be exam-
ined by the pairwise linker as potential duplicates.
Next, the linkage step assigns a probability score to
pairs of records inside each block. If a pair scores
above a user-defined threshold, the records are pre-
sumed to represent the same entity. Finally, the clus-
tering step turns the input records into clusters of
records (or profiles), where each cluster is uniquely
associated with a single real-world entity. This paper
describes the blocking and clustering strategies used
to deploy a massive database of organization entities
to power a major commercial People Search Engine.
We demonstrate the viability of these algorithms for
large data sets on a 50-node hadoop cluster.
