 
A crucial test for any MT system is its power to 
solve lexical ambiluities. The size of the lexicon, 
its structural principles and the availability of 
extra-lin_~istic knowled~q are the most important 
aspects in this respect. This paper outlines the 
experimental development of the SWESIL system: a 
structured lexicon-based word expert system designed 
to play a pivotal role in the process of Distributed 
~an_~ay ~ Translation (DLT) which is being developed 
in the Netherlands. It presents SWESIL's organizing 
principles, gives a short description of the present 
experimental set-up and shows how SWESIL is being 
tested at this moment.
