This paper introduces the problem of predict-
ing semantic relations expressed by preposi-
tions and develops statistical learning models
for predicting the relations, their arguments
and the semantic types of the arguments. We
define an inventory of 32 relations, build-
ing on the word sense disambiguation task
for prepositions and collapsing related senses
across prepositions. Given a preposition in
a sentence, our computational task to jointly
model the preposition relation and its argu-
ments along with their semantic types, as a
way to support the relation prediction. The an-
notated data, however, only provides labels for
the relation label, and not the arguments and
types. We address this by presenting two mod-
els for preposition relation labeling. Our gen-
eralization of latent structure SVM gives close
to 90% accuracy on relation labeling. Further,
by jointly predicting the relation, arguments,
and their types along with preposition sense,
we show that we can not only improve the re-
lation accuracy, but also significantly improve
sense prediction accuracy.
