The identification of genes in biomedi-
cal text typically consists of two stages:
identifying gene mentions and normaliza-
tion of gene names. We have created an
automated process that takes the output
of named entity recognition (NER) sys-
tems designed to identify genes and nor-
malizes them to standard referents. The
system identifies human gene synonyms
from online databases to generate an ex-
tensive synonym lexicon. The lexicon is
then compared to a list of candidate gene
mentions using various string transforma-
tions that can be applied and chained in
a flexible order, followed by exact string
matching or approximate string matching.
Using a gold standard of MEDLINE ab-
stracts manually tagged and normalized
for mentions of human genes, a com-
bined tagging and normalization system
achieved 0.669 F-measure (0.718 preci-
sion and 0.626 recall) at the mention level,
and 0.901 F-measure (0.957 precision and
0.857 recall) at the document level for
documents used for tagger training.
