 
Scope detection is a key task in information ex-
traction. This paper proposes a new approach for 
tree kernel-based scope detection by using the 
structured syntactic parse information. In addi-
tion, we have explored the way of selecting 
compatible features for different part-of-speech 
cues. Experiments on the BioScope corpus show 
that both constituent and dependency structured 
syntactic parse features have the advantage in 
capturing the potential relationships between 
cues and their scopes. Compared with the state 
of the art scope detection systems, our system 
achieves substantial improvement.*
