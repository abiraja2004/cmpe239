The Appraisal framework is a theory of the
language of evaluation, developed within the
tradition of systemic functional linguistics.
The framework describes a taxonomy of the
types of language used to convey evaluation
and position oneself with respect to the eval-
uations of other people. Accurate automatic
recognition of these types of language can
inform an analysis of document sentiment.
This paper describes the preparation of test
data for algorithms for automatic Appraisal
analysis. The difficulty of the task is as-
sessed by way of an inter-annotator agree-
ment study, based on measures analogous to
those used in the MUC-7 evaluation.
