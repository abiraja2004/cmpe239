As the smallest meaning-bearing ele-
ments of the languages which have rich
morphology information, morphemes
are often integrated into state-of-the-art
statistical machine translation to improve
translation quality. The paper proposes
an approach which novelly uses mor-
phemes as pivot language in a chained
machine translation system. A machine
translation based method is used therein
to find the mapping relations between
morphemes and words. Experiments
show the effectiveness of our approach,
achieving 18.6 percent increase in BLEU
score over the baseline phrase-based ma-
chine translation system.
