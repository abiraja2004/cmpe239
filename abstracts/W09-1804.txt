We develop a new objective function for word
alignment that measures the size of the bilin-
gual dictionary induced by an alignment. A
word alignment that results in a small dictio-
nary is preferred over one that results in a large
dictionary. In order to search for the align-
ment that minimizes this objective, we cast the
problem as an integer linear program. We then
extend our objective function to align corpora
at the sub-word level, which we demonstrate
on a small Turkish-English corpus.
