 
This paper presents a novel feature-
based semantic role labeling (SRL) 
method which uses both constituent 
and dependency syntactic views. Com-
paring to the traditional SRL method 
relying on only one syntactic view, the 
method has a much richer set of syn-
tactic features. First we select several 
important constituent-based and de-
pendency-based features from existing 
studies as basic features. Then, we pro-
pose a statistical method to select dis-
criminative combined features which 
are composed by the basic features. 
SRL is achieved by using the SVM 
classifier with both the basic features 
and the combined features. Experimen-
tal results on Chinese Proposition Bank 
(CPB) show that the method outper-
forms the traditional constituent-based 
or dependency-based SRL methods.
