We present a brief overview of the main
challenges in understanding the semantics of
noun compounds and consider some known
methods. We introduce a new task to be
part of SemEval-2010: the interpretation of
noun compounds using paraphrasing verbs
and prepositions. The task is meant to provide
a standard testbed for future research on noun
compound semantics. It should also promote
paraphrase-based approaches to the problem,
which can benefit many NLP applications.
