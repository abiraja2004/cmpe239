State-of-the-art story link detection systems,
that is, systems that determine whether two sto-
ries are about the same event or linked, are usu-
ally based on the cosine-similarity measured
between two stories. This paper presents a
method for improving the performance of a link
detection system by using a variety of simi-
larity measures and using source-pair specific
statistical information. The utility of a num-
ber of different similarity measures, including
cosine, Hellinger, Tanimoto, and clarity, both
alone and in combination, was investigated.
We also compared several machine learning
techniques for combining the different types
of information. The techniques investigated
were SVMs, voting, and decision trees, each
of which makes use of similarity and statisti-
cal information differently. Our experimental
results indicate that the combination of similar-
ity measures and source-pair specific statistical
information using an SVM provides the largest
improvement in estimating whether two stories
are linked; the resulting system was the best-
performing link detection system at TDT-2002.
