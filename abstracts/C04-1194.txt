 
Lexico-semantic networks such as WordNet 
have been criticized about the nature of the 
senses they distinguish as well as on the way 
they define these senses. In this article, we pre-
sent a possible solution to overcome these lim-
its by defining the sense of words from the way 
they are used. More precisely, we propose to 
differentiate the senses of a word from a net-
work of lexical cooccurrences built from a 
large corpus. This method was tested both for 
French and English and was evaluated for Eng-
lish by comparing its results with WordNet.
