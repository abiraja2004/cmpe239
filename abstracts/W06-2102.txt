Polish select different aspects of a spatial 
situation to express coincidence or prox-
imity. Spatial relations verbalized by dif-
ferent senses of at in English are re-
flected primarily by means of w, na, przy 
and u in Polish. First, at is presented as 
conceptualizing the relation of coinci-
dence or proximity with the whole 
Landmark (LM) when it is conceived as a 
point. Then, the Polish prepositions are 
investigated ? how they differ with re-
spect to the specific part of the LM that is 
involved in a topological relation. Al-
though the prepositions are available to 
the speakers of the respective languages 
to render different types of relations, their 
senses overlap in a complex way.
