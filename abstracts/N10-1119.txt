We examine the viability of building large
polarity lexicons semi-automatically from the
web. We begin by describing a graph propa-
gation framework inspired by previous work
on constructing polarity lexicons from lexi-
cal graphs (Kim and Hovy, 2004; Hu and
Liu, 2004; Esuli and Sabastiani, 2009; Blair-
Goldensohn et al, 2008; Rao and Ravichan-
dran, 2009). We then apply this technique
to build an English lexicon that is signifi-
cantly larger than those previously studied.
Crucially, this web-derived lexicon does not
require WordNet, part-of-speech taggers, or
other language-dependent resources typical of
sentiment analysis systems. As a result, the
lexicon is not limited to specific word classes
? e.g., adjectives that occur in WordNet ?
and in fact contains slang, misspellings, multi-
word expressions, etc. We evaluate a lexicon
derived from English documents, both qual-
itatively and quantitatively, and show that it
provides superior performance to previously
studied lexicons, including one derived from
WordNet.
