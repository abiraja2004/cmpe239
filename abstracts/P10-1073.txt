 
Syntactic knowledge is important for dis-
course relation recognition. Yet only heu-
ristically selected flat paths and 2-level 
production rules have been used to incor-
porate such information so far. In this 
paper we propose using tree kernel based 
approach to automatically mine the syn-
tactic information from the parse trees for 
discourse analysis, applying kernel func-
tion to the tree structures directly. These 
structural syntactic features, together 
with other normal flat features are incor-
porated into our composite kernel to cap-
ture diverse knowledge for simultaneous 
discourse identification and classification 
for both explicit and implicit relations. 
The experiment shows tree kernel ap-
proach is able to give statistical signifi-
cant improvements over flat syntactic 
path feature. We also illustrate that tree 
kernel approach covers more structure in-
formation than the production rules, 
which allows tree kernel to further incor-
porate information from a higher dimen-
sion space for possible better discrimina-
tion. Besides, we further propose to leve-
rage on temporal ordering information to 
constrain the interpretation of discourse 
relation, which also demonstrate statistic-
al significant improvements for discourse 
relation recognition on PDTB 2.0 for 
both explicit and implicit as well.
