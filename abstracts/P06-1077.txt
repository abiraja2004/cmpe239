We present a novel translation model
based on tree-to-string alignment template
(TAT) which describes the alignment be-
tween a source parse tree and a target
string. A TAT is capable of generating
both terminals and non-terminals and per-
forming reordering at both low and high
levels. The model is linguistically syntax-
based because TATs are extracted auto-
matically from word-aligned, source side
parsed parallel texts. To translate a source
sentence, we first employ a parser to pro-
duce a source parse tree and then ap-
ply TATs to transform the tree into a tar-
get string. Our experiments show that
the TAT-based model significantly outper-
forms Pharaoh, a state-of-the-art decoder
for phrase-based models.
