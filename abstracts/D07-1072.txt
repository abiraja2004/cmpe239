We present a nonparametric Bayesian model
of tree structures based on the hierarchical
Dirichlet process (HDP). Our HDP-PCFG
model allows the complexity of the grammar
to grow as more training data is available.
In addition to presenting a fully Bayesian
model for the PCFG, we also develop an ef-
ficient variational inference procedure. On
synthetic data, we recover the correct gram-
mar without having to specify its complex-
ity in advance. We also show that our tech-
niques can be applied to full-scale parsing
applications by demonstrating its effective-
ness in learning state-split grammars.
