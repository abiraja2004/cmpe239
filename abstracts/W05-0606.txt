We present a system for computing sim-
ilarity between pairs of words. Our sys-
tem is based on Pair Hidden Markov Mod-
els, a variation on Hidden Markov Mod-
els that has been used successfully for the
alignment of biological sequences. The
parameters of the model are automatically
learned from training data that consists
of word pairs known to be similar. Our
tests focus on the identification of cog-
nates ? words of common origin in re-
lated languages. The results show that our
system outperforms previously proposed
techniques.
