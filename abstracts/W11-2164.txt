In this paper, we propose that MT is an im-
portant technology in crisis events, something
that can and should be an integral part of a
rapid-response infrastructure. By integrating
MT services directly into a messaging infras-
tructure (whatever the type of messages being
serviced, e.g., text messages, Twitter feeds,
blog postings, etc.), MT can be used to pro-
vide first pass translations into a majority lan-
guage, which can be more effectively triaged
and then routed to the appropriate aid agen-
cies. If done right, MT can dramatically in-
crease the speed by which relief can be pro-
vided. To ensure that MT is a standard tool
in the arsenal of tools needed in crisis events,
we propose a preliminary Crisis Cookbook,
the contents of which could be translated into
the relevant language(s) by volunteers imme-
diately after a crisis event occurs. The result-
ing data could then be made available to relief
groups on the ground, as well as to providers
of MT services. We also note that there
are significant contributions that our commu-
nity can make to relief efforts through con-
tinued work on our research, especially that
research which makes MT more viable for
under-resourced languages.
