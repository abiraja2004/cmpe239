This paper proposes a multi-objective opti-
mization framework which supports heteroge-
neous information sources to improve align-
ment in machine translation system combi-
nation techniques. In this area, most of
techniques usually utilize confusion networks
(CN) as their central data structure to com-
pact an exponential number of an potential hy-
potheses, and because better hypothesis align-
ment may benefit constructing better quality
confusion networks, it is natural to add more
useful information to improve alignment re-
sults. However, these information may be het-
erogeneous, so the widely-used Viterbi algo-
rithm for searching the best alignment may
not apply here. In the multi-objective opti-
mization framework, each information source
is viewed as an independent objective, and
a new goal of improving all objectives can
be searched by mature algorithms. The so-
lutions from this framework, termed Pareto
optimal solutions, are then combined to con-
struct confusion networks. Experiments on
two Chinese-to-English translation datasets
show significant improvements, 0.97 and 1.06
BLEU points over a strong Indirected Hidden
Markov Model-based (IHMM) system, and
4.75 and 3.53 points over the best single ma-
chine translation systems.
