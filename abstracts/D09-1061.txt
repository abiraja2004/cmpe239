While traditional work on text clustering
has largely focused on grouping docu-
ments by topic, it is conceivable that a user
may want to cluster documents along other
dimensions, such as the author?s mood,
gender, age, or sentiment. Without know-
ing the user?s intention, a clustering al-
gorithm will only group documents along
the most prominent dimension, which may
not be the one the user desires. To ad-
dress this problem, we propose a novel
way of incorporating user feedback into
a clustering algorithm, which allows a
user to easily specify the dimension along
which she wants the data points to be clus-
tered via inspecting only a small number
of words. This distinguishes our method
from existing ones, which typically re-
quire a large amount of effort on the part
of humans in the form of document an-
notation or interactive construction of the
feature space. We demonstrate the viabil-
ity of our method on several challenging
sentiment datasets.
