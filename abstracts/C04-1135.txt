This paper describes a method to acquire hy-
ponyms for given hypernyms from HTML doc-
uments on the WWW. We assume that a head-
ing (or explanation) of an itemization (or list-
ing) in an HTML document is likely to contain
a hypernym of the items in the itemization, and
we try to acquire hyponymy relations based on
this assumption. Our method is obtained by ex-
tending Shinzato?s method (Shinzato and Tori-
sawa, 2004) where a common hypernym for ex-
pressions in itemizations in HTML documents is
obtained by using statistical measures. By us-
ing Japanese HTML documents, we empirically
show that our proposed method can obtain a sig-
nificant number of hyponymy relations which
would otherwise be missed by alternative meth-
ods.
