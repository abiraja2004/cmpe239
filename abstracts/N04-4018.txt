We extend existing methods for automatic sen-
tence boundary detection by leveraging multi-
ple recognizer hypotheses in order to provide
robustness to speech recognition errors. For
each hypothesized word sequence, an HMM
is used to estimate the posterior probability of
a sentence boundary at each word boundary.
The hypotheses are combined using confusion
networks to determine the overall most likely
events. Experiments show improved detec-
tion of sentences for conversational telephone
speech, though results are mixed for broadcast
news.
