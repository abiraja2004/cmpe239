. We propose a method of acquiring attribute words for a wide
range of objects from Japanese Web documents. The method is a simple
unsupervised method that utilizes the statistics of words, lexico-syntactic
patterns, and HTML tags. To evaluate the attribute words, we also es-
tablish criteria and a procedure based on question-answerability about
the candidate word.
