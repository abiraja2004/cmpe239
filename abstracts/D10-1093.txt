 
Electronic dictionaries covering all natural 
language levels are very relevant for the hu-
man use as well as for the automatic 
processing use, namely those constructed 
with respect to international standards. Such 
dictionaries are characterized by a complex 
structure and an important access time when 
using a querying system. However, the need 
of a user is generally limited to a part of such 
a dictionary according to his domain and ex-
pertise level which corresponds to a specia-
lized dictionary. Given the importance of 
managing a unified dictionary and consider-
ing the personalized needs of users, we pro-
pose an approach for generating personalized 
views starting from a normalized dictionary 
with respect to Lexical Markup Framework 
LMF-ISO 24613 norm. This approach pro-
vides the re-use of already defined views for 
a community of users by managing their pro-
files information and promoting the materia-
lization of the generated views. It is com-
posed of four main steps: (i) the projection of 
data categories controlled by a set of con-
straints (related to the user?s profiles), (ii) the 
selection of values with consistency check-
ing, (iii) the automatic generation of the 
query?s model and finally, (iv) the refinement 
of the view. The proposed approach was con-
solidated by carrying out an experiment on an 
LMF normalized Arabic dictionary.
