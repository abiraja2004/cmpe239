We address the problem of formatting the out-
put of an automatic speech recognition (ASR)
system for readability, while preserving word-
level timing information of the transcript. Our
system enriches the ASR transcript with punc-
tuation, capitalization and properly written
dates, times and other numeric entities, and
our approach can be applied to other format-
ting tasks. The method we describe combines
hand-crafted grammars with a class-based lan-
guage model trained on written text and relies
on Weighted Finite State Transducers (WF-
STs) for the preservation of start and end time
of each word.
