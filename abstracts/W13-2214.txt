We present the system we developed to
provide efficient large-scale feature-rich
discriminative training for machine trans-
lation. We describe how we integrate with
MapReduce using Hadoop streaming to
allow arbitrarily scaling the tuning set and
utilizing a sparse feature set. We report our
findings on German-English and Russian-
English translation, and discuss benefits,
as well as obstacles, to tuning on larger
development sets drawn from the parallel
training data.
