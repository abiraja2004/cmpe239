 
Srinivas (97) enriches traditional 
morpho-syntactic POS tagging with 
syntactic information by introducing 
Supertags. Unfortunately, words are 
assigned on average a much higher number 
of Supertags than traditional POS. In this 
paper, we develop the notion of Hypertag, 
first introduced in Kinyon (00a) and in 
Kinyon (00b), which allows to factor the 
information contained in ~everal Supertags 
into a single structure and to encode 
flmctional information in a systematic 
lnanner. We show why other possible 
solutions based on mathematical properties 
of trees are unsatisfactory and also discuss 
the practical usefulness of this approach.
