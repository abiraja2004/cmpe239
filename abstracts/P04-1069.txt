We present new results on the relation between
context-free parsing strategies and their probabilis-
tic counter-parts. We provide a necessary condition
and a sufficient condition for the probabilistic exten-
sion of parsing strategies. These results generalize
existing results in the literature that were obtained
by considering parsing strategies in isolation.
