We describe the new release of the RASP
(robust accurate statistical parsing) sys-
tem, designed for syntactic annotation of
free text. The new version includes a
revised and more semantically-motivated
output representation, an enhanced gram-
mar and part-of-speech tagger lexicon, and
a more flexible and semi-supervised train-
ing method for the structural parse ranking
model. We evaluate the released version
on the WSJ using a relational evaluation
scheme, and describe how the new release
allows users to enhance performance using
(in-domain) lexical information.
