 
This paper discusses a text extraction approach to multi- 
document summarization that builds on single-document 
summarization methods by using additional, available in-, 
formation about the document set as a whole and the 
relationships between the documents. Multi-document 
summarization differs from single in that the issues 
of compression, speed, redundancy and passage selec- 
tion are critical in the formation of useful summaries. 
Our approach addresses these issues by using domain- 
independent techniques based mainly on fast, statistical 
processing, a metric for reducing redundancy and maxi- 
mizing diversity in the selected passages, and a modular 
framework to allow easy parameterization for different 
genres, corpora characteristics and user requirements.
