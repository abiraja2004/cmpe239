We consider a logicist approach to nat-
ural language understanding based on the
translation of a quasi-logical form into a
temporal logic, explicitly constructed for
the representation of action and change,
and the subsequent reasoning about this
semantic structure in the context of a back-
ground knowledge theory using automated
theorem proving techniques. The ap-
proach is substantiated through a proof-of-
concept question answering system imple-
mentation that uses a head-driven phrase
structure grammar developed in the Lin-
guistic Knowledge Builder to construct
minimal recursion semantics structures
which are translated into a Temporal Ac-
tion Logic where both the SNARK au-
tomated theorem prover and the Allegro
Prolog logic programming environment
can be used for reasoning through an in-
terchangeable compilation into first-order
logic or logic programs respectively.
