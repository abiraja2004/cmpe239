This paper describes the information
extraction techniques developed in the
framework of the participation of IRISA-
TexMex to the following BioNLP-ST13
tasks: Bacterial Biotope subtasks 1 and
2, and Graph Regulation Network. The
approaches developed are general-purpose
ones and do not rely on specialized pre-
processing, nor specialized external data,
and they are expected to work indepen-
dently of the domain of the texts pro-
cessed. They are classically based on ma-
chine learning techniques, but we put the
emphasis on the use of similarity mea-
sures inherited from the information re-
trieval domain (Okapi-BM25 (Robertson
et al, 1998), language modeling (Hiem-
stra, 1998)). Through the good results ob-
tained for these tasks, we show that these
simple settings are competitive provided
that the representation and similarity cho-
sen are well suited for the task.
