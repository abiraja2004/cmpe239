 
Gene and protein named-entity recognition (NER) and 
normalization is often treated as a two-step process. 
While the first step, NER, has received considerable 
attention over the last few years, normalization has 
received much less attention. We have built a dictionary 
based gene and protein NER and normalization system 
that requires no supervised training and no human 
intervention to build the dictionaries from online 
genomics resources. We have tested our system on the 
Genia corpus and the BioCreative Task 1B mouse and 
yeast corpora and achieved a level of performance 
comparable to state-of-the-art systems that require 
supervised learning and manual dictionary creation. Our 
technique should also work for organisms following 
similar naming conventions as mouse, such as human. 
Further evaluation and improvement of gene/protein 
NER and normalization systems is somewhat hampered 
by the lack of larger test collections and collections for 
additional organisms, such as human.
