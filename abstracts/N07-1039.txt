Sentiment analysis seeks to characterize
opinionated or evaluative aspects of nat-
ural language text. We suggest here that
appraisal expression extraction should be
viewed as a fundamental task in sentiment
analysis. An appraisal expression is a tex-
tual unit expressing an evaluative stance
towards some target. The task is to find
and characterize the evaluative attributes
of such elements. This paper describes a
system for effectively extracting and dis-
ambiguating adjectival appraisal expres-
sions in English outputting a generic rep-
resentation in terms of their evaluative
function in the text. Data mining on ap-
praisal expressions gives meaningful and
non-obvious insights.
