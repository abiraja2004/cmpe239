Building on technical advances from the
BioNLP 2009 Shared Task Challenge, the
2011 challenge sets forth to generalize tech-
niques to other complex biological event ex-
traction tasks. In this paper, we present the
implementation and evaluation of a signature-
based machine-learning technique to predict
events from full texts of infectious disease
documents. Specifically, our approach uses
novel signatures composed of traditional lin-
guistic features and semantic knowledge to
predict event triggers and their candidate argu-
ments. Using a leave-one out analysis, we re-
port the contribution of linguistic and shallow
semantic features in the trigger prediction and
candidate argument extraction. Lastly, we ex-
amine evaluations and posit causes for errors
in our complex biological event extraction.
