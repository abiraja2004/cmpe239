 
We analyse Hindi complex predicates 
and propose linguistic tests for their de-
tection. This analysis enables us to iden-
tify a category of V+V complex predi-
cates called lexical compound verbs 
(LCpdVs) which need to be stored in the 
dictionary. Based on the linguistic analy-
sis, a simple automatic method has been 
devised for extracting LCpdVs from cor-
pora. We achieve an accuracy of around 
98% in this task. The LCpdVs thus ex-
tracted may be used to automatically 
augment lexical resources like wordnets, 
an otherwise time consuming and labour-
intensive process
