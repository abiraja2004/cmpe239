Many Semantic Role Labeling (SRL)
combination strategies have been pro-
posed and tested on English SRL task.
But little is known about how much Chi-
nese SRL can benefit from system combi-
nation. And existing combination strate-
gies trust each individual system?s output
with the same confidence when merging
them into a pool of candidates. In our ap-
proach, we assign different weights to dif-
ferent system outputs, and add a weighted
merging stage to the conventional SRL
combination architecture. We also pro-
pose a method to obtain an appropriate
weight for each system?s output by min-
imizing some error function on the devel-
opment set. We have evaluated our strat-
egy on Chinese Proposition Bank data set.
With our minimum error weighting strat-
egy, the F1 score of the combined result
achieves 80.45%, which is 1.12% higher
than baseline combination method?s re-
sult, and 4.90% higher than the best in-
dividual system?s result.
