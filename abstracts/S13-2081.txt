We evaluate a naive machine learning ap-
proach to sentiment classification focused
on Twitter in the context of the sentiment
analysis task of SemEval-2013. We employ
a classifier based on the Random Forests al-
gorithm to determine whether a tweet ex-
presses overall positive, negative or neu-
tral sentiment. The classifier was trained
only with the provided dataset and uses as
main features word vectors and lexicon word
counts. Our average F-score for all three
classes on the Twitter evaluation dataset
was 51.55%. The average F-score of both
positive and negative classes was 45.01%.
For the optional SMS evaluation dataset our
overall average F-score was 58.82%. The
average between positive and negative F-
scores was 50.11%.
