In a new approach to large-scale extrac-
tion of facts from unstructured text, dis-
tributional similarities become an integral
part of both the iterative acquisition of
high-coverage contextual extraction pat-
terns, and the validation and ranking of
candidate facts. The evaluation mea-
sures the quality and coverage of facts
extracted from one hundred million Web
documents, starting from ten seed facts
and using no additional knowledge, lexi-
cons or complex tools.
