Word alignment is an important preprocessing step
for machine translation. The project aims at incorpo-
rating manual alignments from Amazon Mechanical
Turk (MTurk) to help improve word alignment qual-
ity. As a global crowdsourcing service, MTurk can
provide flexible and abundant labor force and there-
fore reduce the cost of obtaining labels. An easy-
to-use interface is developed to simplify the labeling
process. We compare the alignment results by Turk-
ers to that by experts, and incorporate the alignments
in a semi-supervised word alignment tool to improve
the quality of the labels. We also compared two pric-
ing strategies for word alignment task. Experimental
results show high precision of the alignments pro-
vided by Turkers and the semi-supervised approach
achieved 0.5% absolute reduction on alignment error
rate.
