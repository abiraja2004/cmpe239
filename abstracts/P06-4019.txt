We present Outilex, a generalist linguis-
tic platform for text processing. The plat-
form includes several modules implement-
ing the main operations for text processing
and is designed to use large-coverage Lan-
guage Resources. These resources (dictio-
naries, grammars, annotated texts) are for-
matted into XML, in accordance with cur-
rent standards. Evaluations on efficiency
are given.
