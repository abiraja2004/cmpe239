This paper describes the incremental hy-
pothesis alignment algorithm used in the
BBN submissions to the WMT09 system
combination task. The alignment algo-
rithm used a sentence specific alignment
order, flexible matching, and new shift
heuristics. These refinements yield more
compact confusion networks compared to
using the pair-wise or incremental TER
alignment algorithms. This should reduce
the number of spurious insertions in the
system combination output and the sys-
tem combination weight tuning converges
faster. System combination experiments
on the WMT09 test sets from five source
languages to English are presented. The
best BLEU scores were achieved by comb-
ing the English outputs of three systems
from all five source languages.
