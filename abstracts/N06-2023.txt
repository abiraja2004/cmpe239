We present a method for summarizing
speech documents without using any type
of transcript/text in a Hidden Markov
Model framework. The hidden variables
or states in the model represent whether
a sentence is to be included in a sum-
mary or not, and the acoustic/prosodic fea-
tures are the observation vectors. The
model predicts the optimal sequence of
segments that best summarize the docu-
ment. We evaluate our method by compar-
ing the predicted summary with one gen-
erated by a human summarizer. Our re-
sults indicate that we can generate ?good?
summaries even when using only acous-
tic/prosodic information, which points to-
ward the possibility of text-independent
summarization for spoken documents.
