In this paper, we address the problem of
discovering coreference relations between
formulas and the surrounding text. The
task is different from traditional coref-
erence resolution because of the unique
structure of the formulas. In this paper, we
present an approach, which we call ?CDF
(Concept Description Formula)?, for min-
ing coreference relations between formu-
las and the concepts that refer to them.
Using Wikipedia articles as a target cor-
pus, our approach is based on surface level
text matching between formulas and text,
as well as patterns that represent relation-
ships between them. The results showed
the potential of our approach for formulas
and text coreference mining.
