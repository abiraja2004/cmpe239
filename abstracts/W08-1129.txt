In this paper we describe our machine learning
approach to the generation of referring expres-
sions. As our algorithm we use memory-based
learning. Our results show that in case of pre-
dicting the TYPE of the expression, having one
general classifier gives the best results. On the
contrary, when predicting the full set of prop-
erties of an expression, a combined set of spe-
cialized classifiers for each subdomain gives
the best performance.
