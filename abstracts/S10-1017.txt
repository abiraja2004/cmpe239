This paper describes the participation
of RelaxCor in the Semeval-2010 task
number 1: ?Coreference Resolution in
Multiple Languages?. RelaxCor is a
constraint-based graph partitioning ap-
proach to coreference resolution solved by
relaxation labeling. The approach com-
bines the strengths of groupwise classifiers
