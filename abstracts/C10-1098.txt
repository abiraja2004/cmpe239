 
Text summarization solves the problem 
of extracting important information from 
huge amount of text data. There are vari-
ous methods in the literature that aim to 
find out well-formed summaries. One of 
the most commonly used methods is the 
Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA). In this 
paper, different LSA based summariza-
tion algorithms are explained and two 
new LSA based summarization algo-
rithms are proposed. The algorithms are 
evaluated on Turkish documents, and 
their performances are compared using 
their ROUGE-L scores. One of our algo-
rithms produces the best scores.
