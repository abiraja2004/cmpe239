Syntactic knowledge is important for pro-
noun resolution. Traditionally, the syntac-
tic information for pronoun resolution is
represented in terms of features that have
to be selected and defined heuristically.
In the paper, we propose a kernel-based
method that can automatically mine the
syntactic information from the parse trees
for pronoun resolution. Specifically, we
utilize the parse trees directly as a struc-
tured feature and apply kernel functions to
this feature, as well as other normal fea-
tures, to learn the resolution classifier. In
this way, our approach avoids the efforts
of decoding the parse trees into the set of
flat syntactic features. The experimental
results show that our approach can bring
significant performance improvement and
is reliably effective for the pronoun reso-
lution task.
