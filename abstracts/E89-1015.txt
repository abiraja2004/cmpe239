 
In this paper we discuss an algorithm 
for the assignment of pitch accent positions 
in text-to-speech conversion. The algorithm is 
closely modeled on current linoulstic accounts 
of accent placement, and assumes a surface 
syntactic analysis of the input. It comprises a 
small number of heuristic rules for determining 
which phrases of a sentence are to be focussed 
upon; the exact location of a pitch accent 
within a focussed phrase is determined m~inly 
on the basis of the syntactic relations holding 
between the elements of the phrase. A 
perceptual evaluation experiment showed that 
the algorithm proposed here leads to improved 
subjective speech quality as compared to a 
naive algorithm which accents all and only 
content words.
