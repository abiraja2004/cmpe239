 
This paper presents an unsupervised method for 
choosing the correct translation of a word in con- 
text. It learns disambiguation information from non- 
parallel bilinguM corpora (preferably in the same do- 
main) free from tagging. 
Our method combines two existing unsupervised 
disambiguation algorithms: a word sense disam- 
biguation algorithm based on distributional cluster- 
ing and a translation disambiguation algorithm us- 
ing target language corpora. 
For the given word in context, the former algo- 
rithm identifies its meaning as one of a number of 
predefined usage classes derived by clustering a large 
amount of usages in the source language corpus. The 
latter algorithm is responsible for associating each 
usage class (i.e., cluster) with a target word that is 
most relevant o the usage. 
This paper also shows preliminary results of trans- 
lation experiments.
