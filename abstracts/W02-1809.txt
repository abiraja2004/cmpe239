 
For readers of English text who know some 
Chinese, Pinyin codes that spell out Chinese 
names are often ambiguous as to their 
original Chinese character representations if 
the names are new or not well known.  For 
English-Chinese cross language retrieval, 
failure to accurately translate Pinyin names 
in a query to Chinese characters can lead to 
dismal retrieval effectiveness. This paper 
presents an approach of extracting Pinyin 
names from English text, suggesting 
translations to these Pinyin using a database 
of names and their characters with usage 
probabilities, followed with IR techniques 
with a corpus as a disambiguation tool to 
resolve the translation candidates.
