 
We present an approach for deriving syntactic word clusters from parsed text, grouping words according to their unlexicalized syntac-tic contexts.  We then explore the use of these syntactic clusters in leveraging a large corpus of trees generated by a high-accuracy parser to improve the accuracy of another parser based on a different formalism for representing a dif-ferent level of sentence structure.  In our ex-periments, we use phrase-structure trees to produce syntactic word clusters that are used by a predicate-argument dependency parser, significantly improving its accuracy. 1
