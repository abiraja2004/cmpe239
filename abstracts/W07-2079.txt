 
This paper describes a system designed to 
disambiguate person names in a set of Web 
pages. In our approach Web documents are 
represented as different sets of features or 
terms of different types (bag of words, 
URLs, names and numbers). We apply Ag-
glomerative Vector Space clustering that 
uses the similarity between pairs of analo-
gous feature sets. This system achieved a 
value of 66% for F?=0.2 and a value of 48% 
for F?=0.5 in the Web People Search Task at 
SemEval-2007 (Artiles et al, 2007).
