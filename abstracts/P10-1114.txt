We present a new approach to cross-
language text classification that builds on
structural correspondence learning, a re-
cently proposed theory for domain adap-
tation. The approach uses unlabeled doc-
uments, along with a simple word trans-
lation oracle, in order to induce task-
specific, cross-lingual word correspon-
dences. We report on analyses that reveal
quantitative insights about the use of un-
labeled data and the complexity of inter-
language correspondence modeling.
We conduct experiments in the field
of cross-language sentiment classification,
employing English as source language,
and German, French, and Japanese as tar-
get languages. The results are convincing;
they demonstrate both the robustness and
the competitiveness of the presented ideas.
