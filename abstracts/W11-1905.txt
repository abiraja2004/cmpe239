In this paper, we describe a coreference solver
based on the extensive use of lexical fea-
tures and features extracted from dependency
graphs of the sentences. The solver uses Soon
et al (2001)?s classical resolution algorithm
based on a pairwise classification of the men-
tions.
We applied this solver to the closed track of
the CoNLL 2011 shared task (Pradhan et al,
2011). We carried out a systematic optimiza-
tion of the feature set using cross-validation
that led us to retain 24 features. Using this set,
we reached a MUC score of 58.61 on the test
set of the shared task. We analyzed the impact
of the features on the development set and we
show the importance of lexicalization as well
as of properties related to dependency links in
coreference resolution.
