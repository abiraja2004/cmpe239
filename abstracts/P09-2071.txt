This paper presents an efficient inference algo-
rithm of conditional random fields (CRFs) for
large-scale data. Our key idea is to decompose
the output label state into an active set and an
inactive set in which most unsupported tran-
sitions become a constant. Our method uni-
fies two previous methods for efficient infer-
ence of CRFs, and also derives a simple but
robust special case that performs faster than
exact inference when the active sets are suffi-
ciently small. We demonstrate that our method
achieves dramatic speedup on six standard nat-
ural language processing problems.
