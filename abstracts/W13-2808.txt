Phrase-based statistical machine transla-
tion systems can generate translations of
reasonable quality in the case of language
pairs with similar structure and word or-
der. However, if the languages are more
distant from a grammatical point of view,
the quality of translations is much behind
the expectations, since the baseline trans-
lation system cannot cope with long dis-
tance reordering of words and the mapping
of word internal grammatical structures.
In our paper, we present a method that tries
to overcome these problems in the case of
English-Hungarian translation by apply-
ing reordering rules prior to the translation
process and by creating morpheme-based
and factored models. Although automatic
evaluation scores do not reliably reflect the
improvement in all cases, human evalua-
tion of our systems shows that readabil-
ity and accuracy of the translations were
improved both by reordering and applying
richer models.
