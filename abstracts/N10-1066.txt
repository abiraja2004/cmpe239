This paper proposes a general learning frame-
work for a class of problems that require learn-
ing over latent intermediate representations.
Many natural language processing (NLP) de-
cision problems are defined over an expressive
intermediate representation that is not explicit
in the input, leaving the algorithm with both
the task of recovering a good intermediate rep-
resentation and learning to classify correctly.
Most current systems separate the learning
problem into two stages by solving the first
step of recovering the intermediate representa-
tion heuristically and using it to learn the final
classifier. This paper develops a novel joint
learning algorithm for both tasks, that uses the
final prediction to guide the selection of the
best intermediate representation. We evalu-
ate our algorithm on three different NLP tasks
? transliteration, paraphrase identification and
textual entailment ? and show that our joint
method significantly improves performance.
