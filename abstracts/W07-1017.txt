Code assignment is important for handling
large amounts of electronic medical data in
the modern hospital. However, only expert
annotators with extensive training can as-
sign codes. We present a system for the
assignment of ICD-9-CM clinical codes to
free text radiology reports. Our system as-
signs a code configuration, predicting one or
more codes for each document. We com-
bine three coding systems into a single learn-
ing system for higher accuracy. We compare
our system on a real world medical dataset
with both human annotators and other auto-
mated systems, achieving nearly the maxi-
mum score on the Computational Medicine
Center?s challenge.
