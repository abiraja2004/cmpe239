Part-of-speech (POS) is an indispensable fea-
ture in dependency parsing. Current research
usually models POS tagging and dependency
parsing independently. This may suffer from
error propagation problem. Our experiments
show that parsing accuracy drops by about
6% when using automatic POS tags instead
of gold ones. To solve this issue, this pa-
per proposes a solution by jointly optimiz-
ing POS tagging and dependency parsing in a
unique model. We design several joint models
and their corresponding decoding algorithms
to incorporate different feature sets. We fur-
ther present an effective pruning strategy to re-
duce the search space of candidate POS tags,
leading to significant improvement of parsing
speed. Experimental results on Chinese Penn
Treebank 5 show that our joint models sig-
nificantly improve the state-of-the-art parsing
accuracy by about 1.5%. Detailed analysis
shows that the joint method is able to choose
such POS tags that are more helpful and dis-
criminative from parsing viewpoint. This is
the fundamental reason of parsing accuracy
improvement.
