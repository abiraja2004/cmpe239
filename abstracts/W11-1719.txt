In recent years microblogs have taken on an
important role in the marketing sphere, in
which they have been used for sharing opin-
ions and/or experiences about a product or ser-
vice. Companies and researchers have become
interested in analysing the content generated
over the most popular of these, the Twitter
platform, to harvest information critical for
their online reputation management (ORM).
Critical to this task is the efficient and accurate
identification of tweets which refer to a com-
pany distinguishing them from those which do
not. The aim of this work is to present and
compare two different approaches to achieve
this. The obtained results are promising while
at the same time highlighting the difficulty of
this task.
