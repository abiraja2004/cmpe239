LTAG-spinal is a novel variant of tradi-
tional Lexicalized Tree Adjoining Gram-
mar (LTAG) introduced by (Shen, 2006).
The LTAG-spinal Treebank (Shen et al,
2008) combines elementary trees ex-
tracted from the Penn Treebank with Prop-
bank annotation. In this paper, we present
a semantic role labeling (SRL) system
based on this new resource and provide an
experimental comparison with CCGBank
and a state-of-the-art SRL system based
on Treebank phrase-structure trees. Deep
linguistic information such as predicate-
argument relationships that are either im-
plicit or absent from the original Penn
Treebank are made explicit and accessible
in the LTAG-spinal Treebank, which we
show to be a useful resource for semantic
role labeling.
