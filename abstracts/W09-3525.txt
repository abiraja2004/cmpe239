Everyday the newswire introduce events from all over 
the world, highlighting new names of persons, loca-
tions and organizations with different origins. These 
names appear as Out of Vocabulary (OOV) words for 
Machine translation, cross lingual information retriev-
al, and many other NLP applications. One way to deal 
with OOV words is to transliterate the unknown 
words, that is, to render them in the orthography of 
the second language.
We introduce a statistical approach for transliteration 
only using the bilingual resources released in the 
shared task and without any previous knowledge of 
the target languages. Mapping the Transliteration 
problem to the Machine Translation problem, we 
make use of the phrase based SMT approach and ap-
ply it on substrings of names. In the English to Russi-
an task, we report ACC (Accuracy in top-1) of 0.545, 
Mean F-score of 0.917, and MRR (Mean Reciprocal  
Rank) of 0.596.
Due to time constraints, we made a single experiment 
in the English to Chinese task, reporting ACC, Mean 
F-score, and MRR of 0.411, 0.737, and 0.464 respect-
ively.
Finally, it is worth mentioning that the system is 
language independent since the author is not aware of 
either languages used in the experiments.
