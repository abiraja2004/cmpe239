 
The performance of a corpus-based language and 
speech processing system depends heavily on the 
quantity and quality of the training corpora. Although 
several famous Chinese corpora have been developed, 
most of them are mainly written text. Even for some 
existing corpora that contain spoken data, the quantity 
is insufficient and the domain is limited. In this paper, 
we describe the development of Chinese conversational 
annotated textual corpora currently being used in the 
NICT/ATR speech-to-speech translation system. A total 
of 510K manually checked utterances provide 3.5M 
words of Chinese corpora. As far as we know, this is 
the largest conversational textual corpora in the 
domain of travel. A set of three parallel corpora is 
obtained with the corresponding pairs of Japanese and 
English words from which the Chinese words are 
translated. Evaluation experiments on these corpora 
were conducted by comparing the parameters of the 
language models, perplexities of test sets, and speech 
recognition performance with Japanese and English. 
The characteristics of the Chinese corpora, their 
limitations, and solutions to these limitations are 
analyzed and discussed.
