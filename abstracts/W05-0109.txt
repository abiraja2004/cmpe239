The lack of persons trained in computa-
tional linguistic methods is a severe obsta-
cle to making the Internet and computers
accessible to people all over the world in
their own languages. The paper discusses
the experiences of designing and teach-
ing an introductory course in Natural Lan-
guage Processing to graduate computer
science students at Addis Ababa Univer-
sity, Ethiopia, in order to initiate the ed-
ucation of computational linguists in the
Horn of Africa region.
