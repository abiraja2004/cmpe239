We describe our submission to the domain
adaptation track of the CoNLL07 shared
task in the open class for systems using ex-
ternal resources. Our main finding was that
it was very difficult to map from the annota-
tion scheme used to prepare training and de-
velopment data to one that could be used to
effectively train and adapt the RASP system
unlexicalized parse ranking model. Never-
theless, we were able to demonstrate a sig-
nificant improvement in performance utiliz-
ing bootstrapping over the PBIOTB data.
