We present first results of our project on
the generation of contextually adequate
greeting exchanges in video role playing
games. To make greeting exchanges com-
putable, an analysis of the factors influ-
encing greeting behavior as well as the
factors influencing greeting exchanges is
given. Based on the politeness model pro-
posed by Brown & Levinson (1987) we
develop a simple algorithm for the gener-
ation of greeting exchanges. An evalua-
tion, comparing dialog from the video role
playing game Skyrim to dialog determined
by our algorithm, shows that our algorithm
is able to generate greeting exchanges that
are contextually more adequate than those
featured by Skyrim.
