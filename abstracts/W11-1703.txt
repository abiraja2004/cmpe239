 
This article reports on the methodology and 
the development of a complementary 
information source for the meaning of the 
synsets of Princeton WordNet 3.0. This 
encoded information was built following 
the principles of the Osgoodian differential 
semantics theory and consists of numerical 
values which represent the scaling of the 
connotative meanings along the multiple 
dimensions defined by pairs of antonyms 
(factors). Depending on the selected 
factors, various facets of connotative 
meanings come under scrutiny and 
different types of textual subjective 
analysis may be conducted (opinion 
mining, sentiment analysis).
