This paper describes the creation
of Language and Computers, a new
course at the Ohio State University de-
signed to be a broad overview of topics
in computational linguistics, focusing
on applications which have the most
immediate relevance to students. This
course satisfies the mathematical and
logical analysis requirement at Ohio
State by using natural language sys-
tems to motivate students to exercise
and develop a range of basic skills in
formal and computational analysis. In
this paper we discuss the design of the
course, focusing on the success we have
had in offering it, as well as some of the
difficulties we have faced.
