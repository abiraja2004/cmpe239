Antelogue is a pronoun resolution prototype de-
signed to be released as off-the-shelf software to
be used autonomously or integrated with larger
anaphora resolution or other NLP systems. It has
modules to handle pronouns in both text and dia-
logue. In Antelogue, the problem of pronoun reso-
lution is addressed as a two-step process: a) acquir-
ing information about properties of words and the
entities they represent and b) determining an algo-
rithm that utilizes these features to make resolution
decisions. A hybrid approach is implemented that
combines known statistical and machine learning
techniques for feature acquisition and a symbolic
algorithm for resolution.
