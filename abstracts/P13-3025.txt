Deepfix is a statistical post-editing sys-
tem for improving the quality of statis-
tical machine translation outputs. It at-
tempts to correct errors in verb-noun va-
lency using deep syntactic analysis and a
simple probabilistic model of valency. On
the English-to-Czech translation pair, we
show that statistical post-editing of statis-
tical machine translation leads to an im-
provement of the translation quality when
helped by deep linguistic knowledge.
