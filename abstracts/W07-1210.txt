We discuss semantic composition in Mini-
mal Recursion Semantics (MRS) and Robust
Minimal Recursion Semantics (RMRS). We
demonstrate that a previously defined for-
mal algebra applies to grammar engineering
across a much greater range of frameworks
than was originally envisaged. We show
how this algebra can be adapted to compo-
sition in grammar frameworks where a lex-
icon is not assumed, and how this underlies
a practical implementation of semantic con-
struction for the RASP system.
