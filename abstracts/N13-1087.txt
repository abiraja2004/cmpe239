One way to improve the accuracy of auto-
matic speech recognition (ASR) is to use dis-
criminative language modeling (DLM), which
enhances discrimination by learning where
the ASR hypotheses deviate from the uttered
sentences. However, DLM requires large
amounts of ASR output to train. Instead,
we can simulate the output of an ASR sys-
tem, in which case the training becomes semi-
supervised. The advantage of using simu-
lated hypotheses is that we can generate as
many hypotheses as we want provided that we
have enough text material. In typical scenar-
ios, transcribed in-domain data is limited but
large amounts of out-of-domain (OOD) data
is available. In this study, we investigate how
semi-supervised training performs with OOD
data. We find out that OOD data can yield im-
provements comparable to in-domain data.
