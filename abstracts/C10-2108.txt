The aim of this study is to use the
word-space model to measure the seman-
tic loads of single verbs, profile verbal
lexicon acquisition, and explore the se-
mantic information on Chinese resulta-
tive verb compounds (RVCs). A distri-
butional model based on Academia Sinica
Balanced Corpus (ASBC) with Latent Se-
mantic Analysis (LSA) is built to investi-
gate the semantic space variation depend-
ing on the semantic loads/specificity. The
between group comparison of age-related
changes in verb style is then conducted
to suggest the influence of semantic space
on verbal acquisition. Finally, it demon-
strates how meaning exploring on RVCs
is done with semantic space.
