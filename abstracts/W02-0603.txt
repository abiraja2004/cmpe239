We present two methods for unsupervised
segmentation of words into morpheme-
like units. The model utilized is espe-
cially suited for languages with a rich
morphology, such as Finnish. The first
method is based on the Minimum Descrip-
tion Length (MDL) principle and works
online. In the second method, Max-
imum Likelihood (ML) optimization is
used. The quality of the segmentations is
measured using an evaluation method that
compares the segmentations produced to
an existing morphological analysis. Ex-
periments on both Finnish and English
corpora show that the presented methods
perform well compared to a current state-
of-the-art system.
