This paper describes DUALIST, an active
learning annotation paradigm which solicits
and learns from labels on both features (e.g.,
words) and instances (e.g., documents). We
present a novel semi-supervised training al-
gorithm developed for this setting, which is
(1) fast enough to support real-time interac-
tive speeds, and (2) at least as accurate as pre-
existing methods for learning with mixed fea-
ture and instance labels. Human annotators in
user studies were able to produce near-state-
of-the-art classifiers?on several corpora in a
variety of application domains?with only a
few minutes of effort.
