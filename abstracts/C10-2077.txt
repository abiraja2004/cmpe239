 
As one of the important tasks of 
SemEval Evaluation, Frame Semantic 
Structure Extraction based on the Fra-
meNet has received much more atten-
tion in NLP field. This task is often di-
vided into three sub-tasks: recognizing 
target words which are word expres-
sions that evoke semantic frames, as-
signing the correct frame to them, name-
ly, Frame Identification (FI), and for 
each target word, detecting and labeling 
the corresponding frame elements prop-
erly. Frame identification is the founda-
tion of this task. Since the existence of 
links between frame semantics and syn-
tactic features, we attempt to study FI on 
the basis of dependency syntax. There-
fore, we adopt a tree-structured condi-
tional random field (T-CRF) model to 
solve Chinese frame identification based 
on Dependency Parsing. 7 typical lexi-
cal units which belong to more than one 
frame in Chinese FrameNet were se-
lected to be researched. 940 human an-
notated sentences serve as the training 
data, and evaluation on 128 test data 
achieved 81.46% precision. Compared 
with previous works, our result shows 
obvious improvement.
