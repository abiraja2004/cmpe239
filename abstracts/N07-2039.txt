This paper describes a new grapheme-to-
phoneme framework, based on a combi-
nation of formal linguistic and statisti-
cal methods. A context-free grammar is
used to parse words into their underly-
ing syllable structure, and a set of sub-
word ?spellneme? units encoding both
phonemic and graphemic information can
be automatically derived from the parsed
words. A statistical  -gram model can
then be trained on a large lexicon of words
represented in terms of these linguistically
motivated subword units. The frame-
work has potential applications in mod-
eling unknown words and in linking spo-
ken spellings with spoken pronunciations
for fully automatic new-word acquisition
via dialogue interaction. Results are re-
ported on sound-to-letter experiments for
the nouns in the Phonebook corpus.
