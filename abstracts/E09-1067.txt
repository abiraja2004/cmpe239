Recent research has shown that language
and the socio-cognitive phenomena asso-
ciated with it can be aptly modeled and
visualized through networks of linguistic
entities. However, most of the existing
works on linguistic networks focus only
on the local properties of the networks.
This study is an attempt to analyze the
structure of languages via a purely struc-
tural technique, namely spectral analysis,
which is ideally suited for discovering the
global correlations in a network. Appli-
cation of this technique to PhoNet, the
co-occurrence network of consonants, not
only reveals several natural linguistic prin-
ciples governing the structure of the con-
sonant inventories, but is also able to quan-
tify their relative importance. We believe
that this powerful technique can be suc-
cessfully applied, in general, to study the
structure of natural languages.
