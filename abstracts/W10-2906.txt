This work shows how to improve state-of-the-art
monolingual natural language processing models
using unannotated bilingual text. We build a mul-
tiview learning objective that enforces agreement
between monolingual and bilingual models. In
our method the first, monolingual view consists of
supervised predictors learned separately for each
language. The second, bilingual view consists of
log-linear predictors learned over both languages
on bilingual text. Our training procedure estimates
the parameters of the bilingual model using the
output of the monolingual model, and we show how
to combine the two models to account for depen-
dence between views. For the task of named entity
recognition, using bilingual predictors increases F1
by 16.1% absolute over a supervised monolingual
model, and retraining on bilingual predictions
increases monolingual model F1 by 14.6%. For
syntactic parsing, our bilingual predictor increases
F1 by 2.1% absolute, and retraining a monolingual
model on its output gives an improvement of 2.0%.
