The goal of this article is to present our work
about a combination of several syntactic
parsers to produce a more robust parser. We
have built a platform which allows us to
compare syntactic parsers for a given language
by splitting their results in elementary pieces,
normalizing them, and comparing them with
reference results. The same platform is used to
combine several parsers to produce a
dependency parser that has larger coverage
and is more robust than its component parsers.
In the future, it should be possible to
?compile? the knowledge extracted from
several analyzers into an autonomous
dependency parser.
