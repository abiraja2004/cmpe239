Though much research has been conducted
on Subjectivity and Sentiment Analysis (SSA)
during the last decade, little work has fo-
cused on Arabic. In this work, we focus on
SSA for both Modern Standard Arabic (MSA)
news articles and dialectal Arabic microblogs
from Twitter. We showcase some of the chal-
lenges associated with SSA on microblogs.
We adopted a random graph walk approach to
extend the Arabic SSA lexicon using Arabic-
English phrase tables, leading to improve-
ments for SSA on Arabic microblogs. We
used different features for both subjectivity
and sentiment classification including stem-
ming, part-of-speech tagging, as well as tweet
specific features. Our classification features
yield results that surpass Arabic SSA results
in the literature.
