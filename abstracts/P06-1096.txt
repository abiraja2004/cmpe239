We present a perceptron-style discriminative ap-
proach to machine translation in which large feature
sets can be exploited. Unlike discriminative rerank-
ing approaches, our system can take advantage of
learned features in all stages of decoding. We first
discuss several challenges to error-driven discrim-
inative approaches. In particular, we explore dif-
ferent ways of updating parameters given a training
example. We find that making frequent but smaller
updates is preferable to making fewer but larger up-
dates. Then, we discuss an array of features and
show both how they quantitatively increase BLEU
score and how they qualitatively interact on spe-
cific examples. One particular feature we investi-
gate is a novel way to introduce learning into the
initial phrase extraction process, which has previ-
ously been entirely heuristic.
