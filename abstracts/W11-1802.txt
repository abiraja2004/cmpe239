The Genia event task, a bio-molecular event
extraction task, is arranged as one of the main
tasks of BioNLP Shared Task 2011. As its sec-
ond time to be arranged for community-wide
focused efforts, it aimed to measure the ad-
vance of the community since 2009, and to
evaluate generalization of the technology to
full text papers. After a 3-month system de-
velopment period, 15 teams submitted their
performance results on test cases. The re-
sults show the community has made a sig-
nificant advancement in terms of both perfor-
mance improvement and generalization.
