We present a phonological probabilistic context-
free grammar, which describes the word and syl-
lable structure of German words. The grammar
is trained on a large corpus by a simple super-
vised method, and evaluated on a syllabification
task achieving 96.88% word accuracy on word to-
kens, and 90.33% on word types. We added rules
for English phonemes to the grammar, and trained
the enriched grammar on an English corpus. Both
grammars are evaluated qualitatively showing that
probabilistic context-free grammars can contribute
linguistic knowledge to phonology. Our formal ap-
proach is multilingual, while the training data is
language-dependent.
