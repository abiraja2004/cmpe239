This paper revisits optimal decoding for statis-
tical machine translation using IBM Model 4.
We show that exact/optimal inference using
Integer Linear Programming is more practical
than previously suggested when used in con-
junction with the Cutting-Plane Algorithm. In
our experiments we see that exact inference
can provide a gain of up to one BLEU point
for sentences of length up to 30 tokens.
