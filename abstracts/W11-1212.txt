While several recent works on dealing with
large bilingual collections of texts, e.g. (Smith
et al, 2010), seek for extracting parallel sen-
tences from comparable corpora, we present
PARADOCS, a system designed to recognize
pairs of parallel documents in a (large) bilin-
gual collection of texts. We show that this
system outperforms a fair baseline (Enright
and Kondrak, 2007) in a number of con-
trolled tasks. We applied it on the French-
English cross-language linked article pairs of
Wikipedia in order see whether parallel ar-
ticles in this resource are available, and if
our system is able to locate them. Accord-
ing to some manual evaluation we conducted,
a fourth of the article pairs in Wikipedia are
indeed in translation relation, and PARADOCS
identifies parallel or noisy parallel article pairs
with a precision of 80%.
