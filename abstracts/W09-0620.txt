In a corpus study we found that authors
vary both mathematical form and preci-
sion1 when expressing numerical quanti-
ties. Indeed, within the same document,
a quantity is often described vaguely in
some places and more accurately in others.
Vague descriptions tend to occur early in a
document and to be expressed in simpler
mathematical forms (e.g., fractions or ra-
tios), whereas more accurate descriptions
of the same proportions tend to occur later,
often expressed in more complex forms
(e.g., decimal percentages). Our results
can be used in Natural Language Gener-
ation (1) to generate repeat descriptions
within the same document, and (2) to gen-
erate descriptions of numerical quantities
for different audiences according to math-
ematical ability.
