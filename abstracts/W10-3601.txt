Automatic  word  segmentation  errors, 
for  languages  having  a  writing  system 
without word boundaries, negatively af-
fect the performance of language mod-
els.  As a solution, the use of  multiple, 
instead of unique, segmentation has re-
cently  been  proposed.  This  approach 
boosts  N-gram  counts  and  generates 
new  N-grams.  However,  it  also  pro-
duces bad N-grams that  affect the lan-
guage models' performance. In this pa-
per, we study more deeply the contribu-
tion  of  our  multiple  segmentation  ap-
proach  and experiment on an efficient 
solution to minimize the effect of adding 
bad N-grams.
