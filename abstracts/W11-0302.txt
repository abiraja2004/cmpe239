 
We use an automatic pipeline of word 
tokenization, stemming, POS tagging, and 
vocalization to perform real-world Arabic 
dependency parsing. In spite of the high 
accuracy on the modules, the very few errors in 
tokenization, which reaches an accuracy of 
99.34%, lead to a drop of more than 10% in 
parsing, indicating that no high quality 
dependency parsing of Arabic, and possibly 
other morphologically rich languages, can be 
reached without (semi-)perfect tokenization. The 
other module components, stemming, 
vocalization, and part of speech tagging, do not 
have the same profound effect on the 
dependency parsing process.
