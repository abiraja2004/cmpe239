 
In this paper we investigate the task of text 
simplification for Brazilian Portuguese. Our 
purpose is three-fold: to introduce a 
simplification tool for such language and its 
underlying development methodology, to 
present an on-line authoring system of 
simplified text based on the previous tool, and 
finally to discuss the potentialities of such 
technology for education. The resources and 
tools we present are new for Portuguese and 
innovative in many aspects with respect to 
previous initiatives for other languages.
