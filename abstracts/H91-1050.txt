 
This paper eports recent efforts to improve the performance 
of CMU's robust vocabulary-independent (VI) speech recog- 
nition systems on the DARPA speaker-independent r source 
management task. The improvements are evaluated on 320 
sentences that randomly selected from the DARPA June 88, 
February 89 and October 89 test sets. Our first improvement 
involves more detailed acoustic modeling. We incorporated 
more dynamic features computed from the LPC cepstra nd 
reduced error by 15% over the baseline system. Our second 
improvement comes from a larger training database. With 
more training data, our third improvement comes from a more 
detailed subword modeling. We incorporated the word bound- 
ary context into our VI subword modeling and it resulted in a 
30% error eduction. Finally, we used decision-tree allophone 
clustering to find more suitable models for the subword units 
not covered in the training set and further educed error by 
17%. All the techniques combined reduced the VI error rate 
on the resource management task from 11.1% to 5.4% (and 
from 15.4% to 7.4% when training and testing were under dif- 
ferent recording environment). This vocabulary-independent 
performance has exceeded our vocabulary-dependent p rfor- 
mance.
