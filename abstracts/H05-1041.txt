We present a practically unsupervised
learning method to produce single-snippet
answers to definition questions in ques-
tion answering systems that supplement
Web search engines. The method exploits
on-line encyclopedias and dictionaries to
generate automatically an arbitrarily large
number of positive and negative definition
examples, which are then used to train an
SVM to separate the two classes. We show
experimentally that the proposed method
is viable, that it outperforms the alterna-
tive of training the system on questions
and news articles from TREC, and that it
helps the search engine handle definition
questions significantly better.
