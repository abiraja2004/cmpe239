Fluent dialogue requires that speak-
ers successfully negotiate and signal
turn-taking. While many cues to turn
change have been proposed, especially
in multi-modal frameworks, here we fo-
cus on the use of prosodic cues to these
functions. In particular, we consider
the use of prosodic cues in a tone lan-
guage, Mandarin Chinese, where varia-
tions in pitch height and slope addition-
ally serve to determine word meaning.
Within a corpus of spontaneous Chi-
nese dialogues, we find that turn-unit fi-
nal syllables are significantly lower in
average pitch and intensity than turn-
unit initial syllables in both smooth
turn changes and segments ended by
speaker overlap. Interruptions are char-
acterized by significant prosodic dif-
ferences from smooth turn initiations.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that these
contrasts correspond to an overall low-
ering across all tones in final posi-
tion, which largely preserves the rela-
tive heights of the lexical tones. In clas-
sification tasks, we contrast the use of
text and prosodic features. Finally, we
demonstrate that, on balanced training
and test sets, we can distinguish turn-
unit final words from other words at
? 93% accuracy and interruptions from
smooth turn unit initiations at 62% ac-
curacy.
