Statistical parsing of noun phrase (NP) struc-
ture has been hampered by a lack of gold-
standard data. This is a significant problem for
CCGbank, where binary branching NP deriva-
tions are often incorrect, a result of the auto-
matic conversion from the Penn Treebank.
We correct these errors in CCGbank using a
gold-standard corpus of NP structure, result-
ing in a much more accurate corpus. We also
implement novel NER features that generalise
the lexical information needed to parse NPs
and provide important semantic information.
Finally, evaluating against DepBank demon-
strates the effectiveness of our modified cor-
pus and novel features, with an increase in
parser performance of 1.51%.
