Determining the correct structure of coordi-
nating conjunctions and the syntactic con-
stituents that they coordinate is a difficult task.
This subtask of syntactic parsing is explored
here for biomedical scientific literature. In
particular, the intuition that sentences contain-
ing coordinating conjunctions can often be
rephrased as two or more smaller sentences
derived from the coordination structure is ex-
ploited. Generating candidate sentences cor-
responding to different possible coordination
structures and comparing them with a lan-
guage model is employed to help determine
which coordination structure is best. This
strategy is used to augment a simple baseline
system for coordination resolution which out-
performs both the baseline system and a con-
stituent parser on the same task.
