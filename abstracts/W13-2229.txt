We describe the Uppsala University sys-
tem for WMT13, for English-to-German
translation. We use the Docent decoder,
a local search decoder that translates at
the document level. We add tunable dis-
tortion limits, that is, soft constraints on
the maximum distortion allowed, to Do-
cent. We also investigate cleaning of the
noisy Common Crawl corpus. We show
that we can use alignment-based filtering
for cleaning with good results. Finally we
investigate effects of corpus selection for
recasing.
