This work presents a Text Segmentation al-
gorithm called TopicTiling. This algorithm
is based on the well-known TextTiling algo-
rithm, and segments documents using the La-
tent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic model.
We show that using the mode topic ID as-
signed during the inference method of LDA,
used to annotate unseen documents, improves
performance by stabilizing the obtained top-
ics. We show significant improvements over
state of the art segmentation algorithms on two
standard datasets. As an additional benefit,
TopicTiling performs the segmentation in lin-
ear time and thus is computationally less ex-
pensive than other LDA-based segmentation
methods.
