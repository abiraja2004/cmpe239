This paper describes a system for construct-
ing conceptual graph representation of text by
using a combination of existing linguistic re-
sources (VerbNet and WordNet). We use a two-
step approach, by firstly identifying the seman-
tic roles in a sentence, and then using these
roles, together with semi-automatically com-
piled domain-specific knowledge to construct
the conceptual graph representation.
