This paper presents the experimental results of
our attemps to reduce the size of the param-
eter space in word alignment algorithm. We
use IBM Model 4 as a baseline. In order to
reduce the parameter space, we pre-processed
the training corpus using a word lemmatizer
and a bilingual term extraction algorithm. Us-
ing these additional components, we obtained
an improvement in the alignment error rate.
