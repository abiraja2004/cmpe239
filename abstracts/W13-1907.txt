 
While interest in biomedical question answer-
ing has been growing, research in consumer 
health question answering remains relatively 
sparse. In this paper, we focus on the task of 
consumer health question understanding. We 
present a rule-based methodology that relies 
on lexical and syntactic information as well as 
anaphora/ellipsis resolution to construct struc-
tured representations of questions (frames). 
Our results indicate the viability of our ap-
proach and demonstrate the important role 
played by anaphora and ellipsis in interpreting 
consumer health questions.
