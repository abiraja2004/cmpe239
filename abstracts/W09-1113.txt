We propose a novel machine learning task that
consists in learning to predict which words in
a text are fixated by a reader. In a first pilot
experiment, we show that it is possible to out-
perform a majority baseline using a transition-
based model with a logistic regression classi-
fier and a very limited set of features. We also
show that the model is capable of capturing
frequency effects on eye movements observed
in human readers.
