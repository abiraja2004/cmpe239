 
In this paper we present first results from 
a comparative study. Its aim is to test 
the feasibility of different inductive learn- 
ing techniques to perform the automatic 
acquisition of linguistic knowledge within a 
natural anguage database interface. In our 
interface architecture the machine learn- 
ing module replaces an elaborate semantic 
analysis component. The learning module 
learns the correct mapping of a user's input 
to the corresponding database command 
based on a collection of past input data. 
We use an existing interface to a produc- 
tion planning and control system as evalu- 
ation and compare the results achieved by 
different instance-based and model-based 
learning algorithms.
