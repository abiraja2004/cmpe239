 
One of the claimed benefits of Tree Ad- 
joining Grammars is that they have an 
extended omain of locality (EDOL). We 
consider how this can be exploited to 
limit the need for feature structure uni- 
fication during parsing. We compare 
two wide-coverage l xicalized grammars 
of English, LEXSYS and XTAG, finding 
that the two grammars exploit EDOL in 
different ways.
