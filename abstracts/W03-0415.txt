In this paper we demonstrate methods of im-
proving both the recall and the precision of au-
tomatic methods for extraction of hyponymy
(IS A) relations from free text. By applying la-
tent semantic analysis (LSA) to filter extracted
hyponymy relations we reduce the rate of er-
ror of our initial pattern-based hyponymy ex-
traction by 30%, achieving precision of 58%.
Applying a graph-based model of noun-noun
similarity learned automatically from coordi-
nation patterns to previously extracted correct
hyponymy relations, we achieve roughly a five-
fold increase in the number of correct hy-
ponymy relations extracted.
