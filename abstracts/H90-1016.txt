 
We describe the methods and hardware that we are using 
to produce a real-time demonstration f an integrated Spo- 
ken Language System. We describe algorithms that greatly 
reduce the computation needed to compute the N-Best sen- 
tence hypotheses. To avoid grammar coverage problems we 
use a fully-connected first-order statistical class grammar. 
The speech-search algorithm is implemented ona board with 
a single Intel i860 chip, which provides afactor of 5 speedup 
over a SUN 4 for straight C code. The board plugs directly 
into the VME bus of the SUN4, which controls the system 
and contains the natural anguage system and application 
back end.
