This paper describes Japanese-English-Chinese
aligned parallel treebank corpora of newspaper
articles. They have been constructed by trans-
lating each sentence in the Penn Treebank and
the Kyoto University text corpus into a cor-
responding natural sentence in a target lan-
guage. Each sentence is translated so as to
reflect its contextual information and is anno-
tated with morphological and syntactic struc-
tures and phrasal alignment. This paper also
describes the possible applications of the par-
allel corpus and proposes a new framework to
aid in translation. In this framework, paral-
lel translations whose source language sentence
is similar to a given sentence can be semi-
automatically generated. In this paper we show
that the framework can be achieved by using
our aligned parallel treebank corpus.
