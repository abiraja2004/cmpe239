In this paper, we start with the existing idea of
taking reordering rules automatically derived
from syntactic representations, and applying
them in a preprocessing step before translation
to make the source sentence structurally more
like the target; and we propose a new approach
to hierarchically extracting these rules. We
evaluate this, combined with a lattice-based
decoding, and show improvements over state-
of-the-art distortion models.
