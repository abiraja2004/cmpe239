Error mining is a useful technique for
identifying forms that cause incomplete
parses of sentences. We extend the iter-
ative method of Sagot and de la Clerg-
erie (2006) to treat n-grams of an arbi-
trary length. An inherent problem of in-
corporating longer n-grams is data sparse-
ness. Our new method takes sparseness
into account, producing n-grams that are
as long as necessary to identify problem-
atic forms, but not longer.
Not every cause for parsing errors can be
captured effectively by looking at word
n-grams. We report on an algorithm for
building more general patterns for min-
ing, consisting of words and part of speech
tags.
It is not easy to evaluate the various er-
ror mining techniques. We propose a new
evaluation metric which will enable us to
compare different error miners.
