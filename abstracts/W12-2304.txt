Languages are constantly evolving through
their users due to the need to communicate
more efficiently. Under this hypothesis, we
formulate unsupervised word segmentation as
a regularized compression process. We re-
duce this process to an optimization problem,
and propose a greedy inclusion solution. Pre-
liminary test results on the Bernstein-Ratner
corpus and Bakeoff-2005 show that the our
method is comparable to the state-of-the-art in
terms of effectiveness and efficiency.
