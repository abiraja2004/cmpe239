In this paper we propose a method to exploit ana-
lytical definitions extracted from Spanish corpora, 
in order to build a lexical network based on the hy-
ponymy/hyperonymy,  part/whole  and  attribution 
relations.  Our  method  considers  the  following 
steps: (a) the recognition and extraction of defini-
tional contexts from specialized documents, (b) the 
identification of analytical definitions on these def-
initional contexts, using verbal predications, (c) the 
syntactic and probabilistic analysis of the associa-
tion observed between verbal predication and ana-
lytical definitions, (d) the identification of the hy-
ponymy/hyperonymy,  part/whole  and  attribution 
relations  based on the lexical information that lies 
between  predications  and  definitions  and  other 
types of phrases, in particular prepositional phrases 
mapped by the preposition de (Eng. of/from).
