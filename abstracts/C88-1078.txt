 
A brief survey is conducted of the inheritance principle - the 
conveyance of properties between components within a hierarch- 
ical relational structure. The standard form of inheritance is con- 
sidered, using the subset (is-a) relation and highlighted as an 
example of downward inheritance. Downward inheritance is 
extended to specialisation of actions, and cases are presented in 
which the rule fails. 
sider them on tile same plane of generality and abstractness a
the standard hierarchical inheritance rules. Upward inheritance, 
on the other hand, is formally on the same plane as the more 
common downward form. Our analysis shows that the explana- 
tion for this powerful tool resides in one semantical aspect of a 
large class of very common relations. 
2. Downward inheritance 
An alternative and less well-known form of inheritance is intro- 
duced - upward inheritance. Several examples in which upward 
inheritance is valid and others in which it is not valid are given, 
in a treatment highlighting the analogy with downward inheri- 
tance. The validity of the rule, in those case in which it 
operates, is underlined, to distinguish it from induction. 
A brief acconnt is given of tile search for the underlying reasons 
for the validity of inheritance rules and these are then given. 
The solution turns out to be due to a hidden or implicit 
quantifier within the relations that are used. The semantical 
nature of the problem and of its solution are stressed, emphasis- 
ing the impossibility of a purely syntactic analysis and solution to 
the problem. Various points of interest arising from the analysis 
,are listed and discussed.
