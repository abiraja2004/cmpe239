 
An effective procedure for automatically acquiring 
a new set of disambiguation rules for an existing 
deterministic parser on the basis of tagged text is 
presented. Performance of the automatically ac- 
quired rules is much better than the existing hand- 
written disambiguation rules. The success of the 
acquired rules depends on using the linguistic in- 
formation encoded in the parser; enhancements to 
various components of the parser improves the ac- 
quired rule set. This work suggests a path toward 
more robust and comprehensive syntactic analyz- 
ers.
