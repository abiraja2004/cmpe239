The growing need for Chinese natural
language processing (NLP) is largely
in a range of research and commer-
cial applications. However, most of
the currently Chinese NLP tools or
components still have a wide range
of issues need to be further improved
and developed. FudanNLP is an open
source toolkit for Chinese natural lan-
guage processing (NLP), which uses
statistics-based and rule-based meth-
ods to deal with Chinese NLP tasks,
such as word segmentation, part-of-
speech tagging, named entity recogni-
tion, dependency parsing, time phrase
recognition, anaphora resolution and so
on.
