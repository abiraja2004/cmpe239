Using comparable corpora to find new word
translations is a promising approach for ex-
tending bilingual dictionaries (semi-) auto-
matically. The basic idea is based on the
assumption that similar words have similar
contexts across languages. The context of
a word is often summarized by using the
bag-of-words in the sentence, or by using
the words which are in a certain dependency
position, e.g. the predecessors and succes-
sors. These different context positions are
then combined into one context vector and
compared across languages. However, previ-
ous research makes the (implicit) assumption
that these different context positions should be
weighted as equally important. Furthermore,
only the same context positions are compared
with each other, for example the successor po-
sition in Spanish is compared with the suc-
cessor position in English. However, this is
not necessarily always appropriate for lan-
guages like Japanese and English. To over-
come these limitations, we suggest to perform
a linear transformation of the context vec-
tors, which is defined by a matrix. We de-
fine the optimal transformation matrix by us-
ing a Bayesian probabilistic model, and show
that it is feasible to find an approximate solu-
tion using Markov chain Monte Carlo meth-
ods. Our experiments demonstrate that our
proposed method constantly improves transla-
tion accuracy.
