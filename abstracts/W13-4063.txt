Barge-in enables the user to provide input
during system speech, facilitating a more
natural and efficient interaction. Stan-
dard methods generally focus on single-
stage barge-in detection, applying the di-
alogue policy irrespective of the barge-in
context. Unfortunately, this approach per-
forms poorly when used in challenging
environments. We propose and evaluate
a barge-in processing method that uses a
prediction strategy to continuously decide
whether to pause, continue, or resume the
prompt. This model has greater task suc-
cess and efficiency than the standard ap-
proach when evaluated in a public spoken
dialogue system.
