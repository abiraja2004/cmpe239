This paper investigates the problems facing mod-
elling agents? beliefs in Discourse Representation
Theory (DRT) and presents a viable solution in the
form of a dialogue-based DRT representation of
beliefs. Integrating modelling dialogue interaction
into DRT allows modelling agents? beliefs, inten-
tions and mutual beliefs. Furthermore, it is one of
the aims of the paper to account for the important
notion of agents? varying degrees of belief in differ-
ent contexts.1
