In this paper we investigate the manner in
which the human language comprehension
system adapts to shifts in probability dis-
tributions over syntactic structures, given
experimentally controlled experience with
those structures. We replicate a classic
reading experiment, and present a model
of the behavioral data that implements a
form of Bayesian belief update over the
course of the experiment.
