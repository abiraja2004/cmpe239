 
The BA Language Technology program 
was recently introduced at the North-West 
University and is, to date, the only of its 
kind in South Africa. This paper gives an 
overview of the program, which consists 
of computational linguistic subjects as 
well as subjects from languages, computer 
science, mathematics, and statistics. A 
brief discussion of the content of the pro-
gram and specifically the computational 
linguistics subjects, illustrates that the BA 
Language Technology program is a voca-
tionally directed, future oriented teaching 
program, preparing students for both fu-
ture graduate studies and a career in lan-
guage technology. By means of an 
example, it is then illustrated how stu-
dents and researchers alike benefit from 
working side by side on research and de-
velopment projects by using a problem-
based, project-organized approach to cur-
riculum design and teaching.
