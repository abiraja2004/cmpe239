Translating compounds is an important prob-
lem in machine translation. Since many com-
pounds have not been observed during train-
ing, they pose a challenge for translation sys-
tems. Previous decompounding methods have
often been restricted to a small set of lan-
guages as they cannot deal with more complex
compound forming processes. We present a
novel and unsupervised method to learn the
compound parts and morphological operations
needed to split compounds into their com-
pound parts. The method uses a bilingual
corpus to learn the morphological operations
required to split a compound into its parts.
Furthermore, monolingual corpora are used to
learn and filter the set of compound part can-
didates. We evaluate our method within a ma-
chine translation task and show significant im-
provements for various languages to show the
versatility of the approach.
