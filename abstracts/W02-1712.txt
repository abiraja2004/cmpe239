The basic mechanism of CLaRK for linguistic pro-
cessing of text corpora is the cascade regular gram-
mar processor. The main challenge to the grammars
in question is how to apply them on XML encoding
of the linguistic information. The system oers a so-
lution using an XPath language for constructing the
input word to the grammar and an XML encoding
of the categories of the recognized words.
