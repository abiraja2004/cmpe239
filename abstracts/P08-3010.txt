This paper presents a system capable of auto-
matically acquiring subcategorization frames
(SCFs) for French verbs from the analysis of
large corpora. We applied the system to a large
newspaper corpus (consisting of 10 years of
the French newspaper ?Le Monde?) and ac-
quired subcategorization information for 3267
verbs. The system learned 286 SCF types for
these verbs. From the analysis of 25 represen-
tative verbs, we obtained 0.82 precision, 0.59
recall and 0.69 F-measure. These results are
comparable with those reported in recent re-
lated work.
