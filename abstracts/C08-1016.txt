 
This paper proposes an other-anaphora 
resolution approach in bio-medical texts. 
It utilizes automatically mined patterns to 
discover the semantic relation between an 
anaphor and a candidate antecedent. The 
knowledge from lexical patterns is incor-
porated in a machine learning framework 
to perform anaphora resolution. The ex-
periments show that machine learning 
approach combined with the auto-mined 
knowledge is effective for other-
anaphora resolution in the biomedical 
domain. Our system with auto-mined pat-
terns gives an accuracy of 56.5%., yield-
ing 16.2% improvement against the base-
line system without pattern features, and 
9% improvement against the system us-
ing manually designed patterns.
