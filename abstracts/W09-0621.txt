For developing a data-driven text rewriting
algorithm for paraphrasing, it is essential
to have a monolingual corpus of aligned
paraphrased sentences. News article head-
lines are a rich source of paraphrases; they
tend to describe the same event in vari-
ous different ways, and can easily be ob-
tained from the web. We compare two
methods of aligning headlines to construct
such an aligned corpus of paraphrases, one
based on clustering, and the other on pair-
wise similarity-based matching. We show
that the latter performs best on the task of
aligning paraphrastic headlines.
