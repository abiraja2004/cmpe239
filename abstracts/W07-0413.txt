Machine translation of a source language
sentence involves selecting appropriate
target language words and ordering the se-
lected words to form a well-formed tar-
get language sentence. Most of the pre-
vious work on statistical machine transla-
tion relies on (local) associations of target
words/phrases with source words/phrases
for lexical selection. In contrast, in this
paper, we present a novel approach to lex-
ical selection where the target words are
associated with the entire source sentence
(global) without the need for local asso-
ciations. This technique is used by three
models (Bag?of?words model, sequential
model and hierarchical model) which pre-
dict the target language words given a
source sentence and then order the words
appropriately. We show that a hierarchi-
cal model performs best when compared
to the other two models.
