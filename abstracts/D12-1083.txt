We propose a complete probabilistic discrim-
inative framework for performing sentence-
level discourse analysis. Our framework com-
prises a discourse segmenter, based on a bi-
nary classifier, and a discourse parser, which
applies an optimal CKY-like parsing algo-
rithm to probabilities inferred from a Dynamic
Conditional Random Field. We show on two
corpora that our approach outperforms the
state-of-the-art, often by a wide margin.
