 
We present some Language Technology 
applications that have proven to be effec-
tive tools to promote the use of Basque, a 
European less privileged language. We also 
present the strategy we have followed for 
almost twenty years to develop those appli-
cations as the top of an integrated environ-
ment of language resources, language 
foundations, language tools and other ap-
plications. When we have faced a difficult 
task such as Machine Translation to 
Basque, our strategy has worked well. We 
have had good results in a short time just 
reusing previous works for Basque, reusing 
other open-source tools, and developing 
just a few new modules in collaboration 
with other groups. In addition, new reus-
able tools and formats have been produced.
