Recent work has developed supervised meth-
ods for detecting deceptive opinion spam?
fake reviews written to sound authentic and
deliberately mislead readers. And whereas
past work has focused on identifying individ-
ual fake reviews, this paper aims to identify
offerings (e.g., hotels) that contain fake re-
views. We introduce a semi-supervised man-
ifold ranking algorithm for this task, which
relies on a small set of labeled individual re-
views for training. Then, in the absence of
gold standard labels (at an offering level),
we introduce a novel evaluation procedure
that ranks artificial instances of real offer-
ings, where each artificial offering contains a
known number of injected deceptive reviews.
Experiments on a novel dataset of hotel re-
views show that the proposed method outper-
forms state-of-art learning baselines.
