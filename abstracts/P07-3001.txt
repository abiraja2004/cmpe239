Recent work by Nerbonne and Wiersma
(2006) has provided a foundation for mea-
suring syntactic differences between cor-
pora. It uses part-of-speech trigrams as an
approximation to syntactic structure, com-
paring the trigrams of two corpora for sta-
tistically significant differences.
This paper extends the method and its appli-
cation. It extends the method by using leaf-
path ancestors of Sampson (2000) instead
of trigrams, which capture internal syntactic
structure?every leaf in a parse tree records
the path back to the root.
The corpus used for testing is the Interna-
tional Corpus of English, Great Britain (Nel-
son et al, 2002), which contains syntacti-
cally annotated speech of Great Britain. The
speakers are grouped into geographical re-
gions based on place of birth. This is dif-
ferent in both nature and number than pre-
vious experiments, which found differences
between two groups of Norwegian L2 learn-
ers of English. We show that dialectal varia-
tion in eleven British regions from the ICE-
GB is detectable by our algorithm, using
both leaf-ancestor paths and trigrams.
