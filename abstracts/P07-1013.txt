Grapheme-to-phoneme conversion (g2p) is a
core component of any text-to-speech sys-
tem. We show that adding simple syllab-
ification and stress assignment constraints,
namely ?one nucleus per syllable? and ?one
main stress per word?, to a joint n-gram
model for g2p conversion leads to a dramatic
improvement in conversion accuracy.
Secondly, we assessed morphological pre-
processing for g2p conversion. While mor-
phological information has been incorpo-
rated in some past systems, its contribution
has never been quantitatively assessed for
German. We compare the relevance of mor-
phological preprocessing with respect to the
morphological segmentation method, train-
ing set size, the g2p conversion algorithm,
and two languages, English and German.
