We examine the problem of content selection
in statistical novel sentence generation. Our
approach models the processes performed by
professional editors when incorporating ma-
terial from additional sentences to support
some initially chosen key summary sentence,
a process we refer to as Sentence Augmen-
tation. We propose and evaluate a method
called ?Seed and Grow? for selecting such
auxiliary information. Additionally, we argue
that this can be performed using schemata, as
represented by word-pair co-occurrences, and
demonstrate its use in statistical summary sen-
tence generation. Evaluation results are sup-
portive, indicating that a schemata model sig-
nificantly improves over the baseline.
