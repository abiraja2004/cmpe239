Unsupervised methods of semantic relations
extraction rely on a similarity measure be-
tween lexical units. Similarity measures differ
both in kinds of information they use and in
the ways how this information is transformed
into a similarity score. This paper is making
a step further in the evaluation of the avail-
able similarity measures within the context
of semantic relation extraction. We compare
21 baseline measures ? 8 knowledge-based, 4
corpus-based, and 9 web-based metrics with
the BLESS dataset. Our results show that
existing similarity measures provide signifi-
cantly different results, both in general per-
formances and in relation distributions. We
conclude that the results suggest developing a
combined similarity measure.
