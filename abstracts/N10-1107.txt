We address a key problem in grapheme-to-
phoneme conversion: the ambiguity in map-
ping grapheme units to phonemes. Rather than
using single letters and phonemes as units, we
propose learning chunks, or subwords, to re-
duce ambiguity. This can be interpreted as
learning a lexicon of subwords that has min-
imum description length. We implement an
algorithm to build such a lexicon, as well as a
simple decoder that uses these subwords.
