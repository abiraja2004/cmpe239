This paper describes a framework for multilingual /bEd/ 
inheritance-based l xical representation which al- rib 
lows sharing of information across languages at /rib/ 
all levels of linguistic description. The paper fo- hand 
cuses on phonology. It explores the possibility /h{nd/ 
of establishing a phoneme inventory for a group cat 
of languages in which language-specific phonemes /k{t/ 
function as "allophones" of newly defined recta- 
phonemes. Dutch, English, and German were taken 
as a test bed and their vowel phoneme inventories 
were studied. The results of the cross-linguistic 
analysis are presented in this paper. The paper con- 
cludes by showing how these metaphonelnes can be 
incorporated in a multilingual lexicon.
