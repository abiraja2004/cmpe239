We explore how virtual examples (artifi-
cially created examples) improve perfor-
mance of text classification with Support
Vector Machines (SVMs). We propose
techniques to create virtual examples for
text classification based on the assump-
tion that the category of a document is un-
changed even if a small number of words
are added or deleted. We evaluate the pro-
posed methods by Reuters-21758 test set
collection. Experimental results show vir-
tual examples improve the performance of
text classification with SVMs, especially
for small training sets.
