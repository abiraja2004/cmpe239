We present a method for performing machine
transliteration without any parallel resources.
We frame the transliteration task as a deci-
pherment problem and show that it is possi-
ble to learn cross-language phoneme mapping
tables using only monolingual resources. We
compare various methods and evaluate their
accuracies on a standard name transliteration
task.
