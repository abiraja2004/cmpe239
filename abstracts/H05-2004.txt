Abstract
Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) is the task
of performing a shallow semantic analy-
sis of text (i.e., Who did What to Whom,
When, Where, How). This is a cru-
cial step toward deeper understanding of
text and has many immediate applications.
Preprocessed information on text, mostly
syntactic, has been shown to be impor-
tant for SRL. Current research focuses on
improving the performance assuming that
this lower level information is given with-
out any attention to the overall efficiency
of the final system, although minimizing
execution time is a necessity in order to
support real world applications. The goal
of our demonstration is to present an inter-
active SRL system that can be used both
as a research and an educational tool. Its
architecture is based on the state-of-the-
art system (the top system in the 2005
CoNLL shared task), modified to process
raw text through the addition of lower
level processors, while achieving effective
real time performance.
