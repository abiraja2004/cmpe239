This paper describes a novel technique for in-
corporating syntactic knowledge into phrase-
based machine translation through incremen-
tal syntactic parsing. Bottom-up and top-
down parsers typically require a completed
string as input. This requirement makes it dif-
ficult to incorporate them into phrase-based
translation, which generates partial hypothe-
sized translations from left-to-right. Incre-
mental syntactic language models score sen-
tences in a similar left-to-right fashion, and are
therefore a good mechanism for incorporat-
ing syntax into phrase-based translation. We
give a formal definition of one such linear-
time syntactic language model, detail its re-
lation to phrase-based decoding, and integrate
the model with the Moses phrase-based trans-
lation system. We present empirical results
on a constrained Urdu-English translation task
that demonstrate a significant BLEU score im-
provement and a large decrease in perplexity.
