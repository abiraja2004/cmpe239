We describe the first tractable Gibbs sam-
pling procedure for estimating phrase pair
frequencies under a probabilistic model of
phrase alignment. We propose and evalu-
ate two nonparametric priors that successfully
avoid the degenerate behavior noted in previ-
ous work, where overly large phrases mem-
orize the training data. Phrase table weights
learned under our model yield an increase in
BLEU score over the word-alignment based
heuristic estimates used regularly in phrase-
based translation systems.
