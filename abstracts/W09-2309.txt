This paper presents a reordering model us-
ing syntactic information of a source tree for
phrase-based statistical machine translation.
The proposed model is an extension of IST-
ITG (imposing source tree on inversion trans-
duction grammar) constraints. In the pro-
posed method, the target-side word order is
obtained by rotating nodes of the source-side
parse-tree. We modeled the node rotation,
monotone or swap, using word alignments
based on a training parallel corpus and source-
side parse-trees. The model efficiently sup-
presses erroneous target word orderings, espe-
cially global orderings. Furthermore, the pro-
posed method conducts a probabilistic evalu-
ation of target word reorderings. In English-
to-Japanese and English-to-Chinese transla-
tion experiments, the proposed method re-
sulted in a 0.49-point improvement (29.31 to
29.80) and a 0.33-point improvement (18.60
to 18.93) in word BLEU-4 compared with
IST-ITG constraints, respectively. This indi-
cates the validity of the proposed reordering
model.
