In this paper we present a taxonomy of di-
alogue moves which describe the actions
that students and tutors perform in tutorial
dialogue. We are motivated by the need for
a categorisation of such actions in order to
develop computational models for tutorial
dialogue. As such, we build both on exist-
ing work on dialogue move categorisation
for tutorial dialogue as well as dialogue
taxonomies for general dialogue. Our tax-
onomy has been prepared by analysing a
corpus of tutorial dialogues on mathemati-
cal theorem proving. We also detail an an-
notation experiment in which we apply the
taxonomy and discuss idiosyncrasies in the
data which influence the decisions in the
dialogue move classification.
