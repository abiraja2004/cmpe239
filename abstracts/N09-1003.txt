This paper presents and compares WordNet-
based and distributional similarity approaches.
The strengths and weaknesses of each ap-
proach regarding similarity and relatedness
tasks are discussed, and a combination is pre-
sented. Each of our methods independently
provide the best results in their class on the
RG and WordSim353 datasets, and a super-
vised combination of them yields the best pub-
lished results on all datasets. Finally, we pio-
neer cross-lingual similarity, showing that our
methods are easily adapted for a cross-lingual
task with minor losses.
