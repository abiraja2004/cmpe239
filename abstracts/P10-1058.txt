In this paper we present a joint con-
tent selection and compression model
for single-document summarization. The
model operates over a phrase-based rep-
resentation of the source document which
we obtain by merging information from
PCFG parse trees and dependency graphs.
Using an integer linear programming for-
mulation, the model learns to select and
combine phrases subject to length, cover-
age and grammar constraints. We evalu-
ate the approach on the task of generat-
ing ?story highlights??a small number of
brief, self-contained sentences that allow
readers to quickly gather information on
news stories. Experimental results show
that the model?s output is comparable to
human-written highlights in terms of both
grammaticality and content.
