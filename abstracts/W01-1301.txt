This paper describes a prototype system
to visualize and animate 3D scenes from
car accident reports, written in French.
The problem of generating such a 3D
simulation can be divided into two sub-
tasks: the linguistic analysis and the vir-
tual scene generation. As a means of
communication between these two mod-
ules, we first designed a template for-
malism to represent a written accident
report. The CarSim system first pro-
cesses written reports, gathers relevant
information, and converts it into a for-
mal description. Then, it creates the cor-
responding 3D scene and animates the
vehicles.
