This paper presents an approach to depen-
dency parsing which can utilize any stan-
dard machine learning (classification) al-
gorithm. A decision list learner was used
in this work. The training data provided
in the form of a treebank is converted to a
format in which each instance represents
information about one word pair, and the
classification indicates the existence, di-
rection, and type of the link between the
words of the pair. Several distinct mod-
els are built to identify the links between
word pairs at different distances. These
models are applied sequentially to give the
dependency parse of a sentence, favoring
shorter links. An analysis of the errors,
attribute selection, and comparison of dif-
ferent languages is presented.
