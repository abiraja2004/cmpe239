To support vocabulary acquisition and read-
ing comprehension in a second language, we
have developed a system to display sense-
appropriate examples to learners for difficult
words. We describe the construction of the
system, incorporating word sense disambigua-
tion, and an experiment we conducted testing
it on a group of 60 learners of English as a
second language (ESL). We show that sense-
specific information in an intelligent reading
system helps learners in their vocabulary ac-
quisition, even if the sense information con-
tains some noise from automatic processing.
We also show that it helps learners, to some
extent, with their reading comprehension.
