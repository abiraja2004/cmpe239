This paper presents a novel method for
aligning etymological data, which mod-
els context-sensitive rules governing sound
change, and utilizes phonetic features of the
sounds. The goal is, for a given corpus of
cognate sets, to find the best alignment at
the sound level. We introduce an imputa-
tion procedure to compare the goodness of
the resulting models, as well as the good-
ness of the data sets. We present evalu-
ations to demonstrate that the new model
yields improvements in performance, com-
pared to previously reported models.
