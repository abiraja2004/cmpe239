. This article presents a method of extracting bilingual lexica
composed of single-word terms (SWTs) and multi-word terms (MWTs)
from comparable corpora of a technical domain. First, this method ex-
tracts MWTs in each language, and then uses statistical methods to
align single words and MWTs by exploiting the term contexts. After ex-
plaining the difficulties involved in aligning MWTs and specifying our
approach, we show the adopted process for bilingual terminology ex-
traction and the resources used in our experiments. Finally, we evaluate
our approach and demonstrate its significance, particularly in relation to
non-compositional MWT alignment.
