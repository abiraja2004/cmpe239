BBN submitted system combination outputs
for Czech-English, German-English, Spanish-
English, and French-English language pairs.
All combinations were based on confusion
network decoding. The confusion networks
were built using incremental hypothesis align-
ment algorithm with flexible matching. A
novel bi-gram count feature, which can penal-
ize bi-grams not present in the input hypothe-
ses corresponding to a source sentence, was
introduced in addition to the usual decoder
features. The system combination weights
were tuned using a graph based expected
BLEU as the objective function while incre-
mentally expanding the networks to bi-gram
and 5-gram contexts. The expected BLEU
tuning described in this paper naturally gen-
eralizes to hypergraphs and can be used to
optimize thousands of weights. The com-
bination gained about 0.5-4.0 BLEU points
over the best individual systems on the official
WMT11 language pairs. A 39 system multi-
source combination achieved an 11.1 BLEU
point gain.
