We present  several  ways of measuring 
the inter-annotator agreement in the on-
going annotation of semantic inter-sen-
tential discourse relations in the Prague 
Dependency  Treebank  (PDT).  Two 
ways have been employed to overcome 
limitations of measuring the agreement 
on  the  exact  location  of  the  start/end 
points of the relations. Both methods ? 
skipping one tree  level  in the start/end 
nodes,  and  the  connective-based  mea-
sure ? are focused on a recognition of 
the existence and of the type of the rela-
tions, rather than on fixing the exact po-
sitions of the start/end points of the con-
necting arrows.
