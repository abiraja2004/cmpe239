We present a system for the semantic role la-
beling task. The system combines a machine
learning technique with an inference procedure
based on integer linear programming that sup-
ports the incorporation of linguistic and struc-
tural constraints into the decision process. The
system is tested on the data provided in CoNLL-
2004 shared task on semantic role labeling and
achieves very competitive results.
