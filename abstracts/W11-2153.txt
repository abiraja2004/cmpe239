Accuracy of dependency parsers is one of the
key factors limiting the quality of dependency-
based machine translation. This paper deals
with the influence of various dependency pars-
ing approaches (and also different training
data size) on the overall performance of an
English-to-Czech dependency-based statisti-
cal translation system implemented in the
Treex framework. We also study the relation-
ship between parsing accuracy in terms of un-
labeled attachment score and machine transla-
tion quality in terms of BLEU.
