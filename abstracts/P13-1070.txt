We describe a novel approach for automat-
ically predicting the hidden demographic
properties of social media users. Building
on prior work in common-sense knowl-
edge acquisition from third-person text,
we first learn the distinguishing attributes
of certain classes of people. For exam-
ple, we learn that people in the Female
class tend to have maiden names and en-
gagement rings. We then show that this
knowledge can be used in the analysis of
first-person communication; knowledge of
distinguishing attributes allows us to both
classify users and to bootstrap new train-
ing examples. Our novel approach enables
substantial improvements on the widely-
studied task of user gender prediction, ob-
taining a 20% relative error reduction over
the current state-of-the-art.
