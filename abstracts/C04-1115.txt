The paper comparatively studies methods of
feature weighting in application to the task of
cooccurrence-based classification of words
according to their meaning. We explore parameter
optimization of several weighting methods
frequently used for similar problems such as text
classification. We find that successful application
of all the methods crucially depends on a number
of parameters; only a carefully chosen weighting
procedure allows to obtain consistent improvement
on a classifier learned from non-weighted data.
