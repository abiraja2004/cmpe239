This paper describes a rule-based semantic parser
that relies on a frame dataset (FrameNet), and a
semantic network (WordNet), to identify seman-
tic relations between words in open text, as well
as shallow semantic features associated with con-
cepts in the text. Parsing semantic structures al-
lows semantic units and constituents to be ac-
cessed and processed in a more meaningful way
than syntactic parsing, moving the automation of
understanding natural language text to a higher
level.
