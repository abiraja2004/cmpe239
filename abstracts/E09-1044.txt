We describe refinements to hierarchical
translation search procedures intended to
reduce both search errors and memory us-
age through modifications to hypothesis
expansion in cube pruning and reductions
in the size of the rule sets used in transla-
tion. Rules are put into syntactic classes
based on the number of non-terminals and
the pattern, and various filtering strate-
gies are then applied to assess the impact
on translation speed and quality. Results
are reported on the 2008 NIST Arabic-to-
English evaluation task.
