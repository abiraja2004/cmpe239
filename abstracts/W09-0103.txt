This paper discusses some of the ways that
the ?statistical revolution? has changed
and continues to change the relationship
between linguistics and computational lin-
guistics. I claim that it is more useful in
parsing to make an open world assumption
about possible linguistic structures, rather
than the closed world assumption usu-
ally made in grammar-based approaches to
parsing, and I sketch two different ways in
which grammar-based approaches might
be modified to achieve this. I also de-
scribe some of the ways in which proba-
bilistic models are starting to have a sig-
nificant impact on psycholinguistics and
language acquisition. In language acqui-
sition Bayesian techniques may let us em-
pirically evaluate the role of putative uni-
versals in universal grammar.
