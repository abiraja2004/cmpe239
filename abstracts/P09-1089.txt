This paper addresses the task of handling
unknown terms in SMT. We propose us-
ing source-language monolingual models
and resources to paraphrase the source text
prior to translation. We further present a
conceptual extension to prior work by al-
lowing translations of entailed texts rather
than paraphrases only. A method for
performing this process efficiently is pre-
sented and applied to some 2500 sentences
with unknown terms. Our experiments
show that the proposed approach substan-
tially increases the number of properly
translated texts.
