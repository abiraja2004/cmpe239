We present a discourse-level Tree Adjoin-
ing Grammar which tightly integrates syn-
tax and discourse levels, including a repre-
sentation for discourse entities. We show
that this technique makes it possible to
extend an optimisation algorithm used in
natural language generation (polarity fil-
tering) to the discourse level. We imple-
mented the grammar in a surface realizer
and show that this technique can be used
to reduce the search space by filtering out
referentially incoherent solutions.
