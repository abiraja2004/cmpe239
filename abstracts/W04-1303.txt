This paper proposes a formulation of grammar
learning in which meaning plays a fundamental
role. We present a computational model that aims
to satisfy convergent constraints from cognitive lin-
guistics and crosslinguistic developmental evidence
within a statistically driven framework. The target
grammar, input data and goal of learning are all de-
signed to allow a tight coupling between language
learning and comprehension that drives the acqui-
sition of new constructions. The model is applied
to learn lexically specific multi-word constructions
from annotated child-directed transcript data.
