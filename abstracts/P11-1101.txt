This paper addresses a data-driven surface
realisation model based on a large-scale re-
versible grammar of German. We investigate
the relationship between the surface realisa-
tion performance and the character of the in-
put to generation, i.e. its degree of underspec-
ification. We extend a syntactic surface reali-
sation system, which can be trained to choose
among word order variants, such that the can-
didate set includes active and passive variants.
This allows us to study the interaction of voice
and word order alternations in realistic Ger-
man corpus data. We show that with an ap-
propriately underspecified input, a linguisti-
cally informed realisation model trained to re-
generate strings from the underlying semantic
representation achieves 91.5% accuracy (over
a baseline of 82.5%) in the prediction of the
original voice.
