 
We present a novel approach to the word 
sense disambiguation problem which 
makes use of corpus-based evidence com-
bined with background knowledge. Em-
ploying an inductive logic programming 
algorithm, the approach generates expres-
sive disambiguation rules which exploit 
several knowledge sources and can also 
model relations between them. The ap-
proach is evaluated in two tasks: identifica-
tion of the correct translation for a set of 
highly ambiguous verbs in English-
Portuguese translation and disambiguation 
of verbs from the Senseval-3 lexical sam-
ple task. The average accuracy obtained for 
the multilingual task outperforms the other 
machine learning techniques investigated. 
In the monolingual task, the approach per-
forms as well as the state-of-the-art sys-
tems which reported results for the same 
set of verbs.
