 
We report on the results of a series of experiments with 
a prototype text retrieval system which uses relatively 
advanced natural language processing techniques in 
order to enhance the effectiveness of statistical docu- 
ment retrieval. In this paper we show that large-scale 
natural anguage processing (hundreds of millions of 
words and more) is not only required for a better 
retrieval, but it is also doable, given appropriate 
resources. In particular, we demonstrate hat the use of 
syntactic ompounds in the representation f database 
documents as well as in the user queries, coupled with 
an appropriate term weighting strategy, can consider- 
ably improve the effectiveness of retrospective s arch. 
The experiments reported here were conducted on TIP- 
STER database in connection with the Text REtrieval 
Conference series (TREC). 1
