Paraphrase generation can be regarded as ma-
chine translation where source and target lan-
guage are the same. We use the Moses statisti-
cal machine translation toolkit for paraphras-
ing, comparing phrase-based to syntax-based
approaches. Data is derived from a recently
released, large scale (2.1M tokens) paraphrase
corpus for Dutch. Preliminary results indicate
that the phrase-based approach performs bet-
ter in terms of NIST scores and produces para-
phrases at a greater distance from the source.
