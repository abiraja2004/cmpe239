This paper evaluates two semi-supervised
techniques for the adaptation of a parse selec-
tion model to Wikipedia domains. The tech-
niques examined are Structural Correspon-
dence Learning (SCL) (Blitzer et al, 2006)
and Self-training (Abney, 2007; McClosky et
al., 2006). A preliminary evaluation favors the
use of SCL over the simpler self-training tech-
niques.
