This paper presents a domain-assisted ap-
proach to organize various aspects of a prod-
uct into a hierarchy by integrating domain
knowledge (e.g., the product specifications),
as well as consumer reviews. Based on the
derived hierarchy, we generate a hierarchical
organization of consumer reviews on various
product aspects and aggregate consumer opin-
ions on these aspects. With such organiza-
tion, user can easily grasp the overview of
consumer reviews. Furthermore, we apply the
hierarchy to the task of implicit aspect identi-
fication which aims to infer implicit aspects of
the reviews that do not explicitly express those
aspects but actually comment on them. The
experimental results on 11 popular products in
four domains demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach.
