In this paper we present BabelNet ? a
very large, wide-coverage multilingual se-
mantic network. The resource is automat-
ically constructed by means of a method-
ology that integrates lexicographic and en-
cyclopedic knowledge from WordNet and
Wikipedia. In addition Machine Transla-
tion is also applied to enrich the resource
with lexical information for all languages.
We conduct experiments on new and ex-
isting gold-standard datasets to show the
high quality and coverage of the resource.
