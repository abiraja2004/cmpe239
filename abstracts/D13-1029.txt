Many errors in coreference resolution come
from semantic mismatches due to inadequate
world knowledge. Errors in named-entity
linking (NEL), on the other hand, are of-
ten caused by superficial modeling of entity
context. This paper demonstrates that these
two tasks are complementary. We introduce
NECO, a new model for named entity linking
and coreference resolution, which solves both
problems jointly, reducing the errors made on
each. NECO extends the Stanford determinis-
tic coreference system by automatically link-
ing mentions to Wikipedia and introducing
new NEL-informed mention-merging sieves.
Linking improves mention-detection and en-
ables new semantic attributes to be incorpo-
rated from Freebase, while coreference pro-
vides better context modeling by propagat-
ing named-entity links within mention clus-
ters. Experiments show consistent improve-
ments across a number of datasets and ex-
perimental conditions, including over 11% re-
duction in MUC coreference error and nearly
21% reduction in F1 NEL error on ACE 2004
newswire data.
