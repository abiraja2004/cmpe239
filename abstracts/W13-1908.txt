Text mining methods for the biomedical
domain have matured substantially and
are currently being applied on a large
scale to support a variety of applica-
tions in systems biology, pathway cura-
tion, data integration and gene summa-
rization. Community-wide challenges in
the BioNLP research field provide gold-
standard datasets and rigorous evaluation
criteria, allowing for a meaningful com-
parison between techniques as well as
measuring progress within the field. How-
ever, such evaluations are typically con-
ducted on relatively small training and
test datasets. On a larger scale, sys-
tematic erratic behaviour may occur that
severely influences hundreds of thousands
of predictions. In this work, we per-
form a critical assessment of a large-scale
text mining resource, identifying system-
atic errors and determining their underly-
ing causes through semi-automated analy-
ses and manual evaluations1.
