Existing graph-based ranking methods for
keyphrase extraction compute a single impor-
tance score for each word via a single ran-
dom walk. Motivated by the fact that both
documents and words can be represented by
a mixture of semantic topics, we propose to
decompose traditional random walk into mul-
tiple random walks specific to various topics.
We thus build a Topical PageRank (TPR) on
word graph to measure word importance with
respect to different topics. After that, given
the topic distribution of the document, we fur-
ther calculate the ranking scores of words and
extract the top ranked ones as keyphrases. Ex-
perimental results show that TPR outperforms
state-of-the-art keyphrase extraction methods
on two datasets under various evaluation met-
rics.
