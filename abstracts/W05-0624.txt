We present an application of Sparse
Bayesian Learning to the task of semantic
role labeling, and we demonstrate that this
method produces smaller classifiers than
the popular Support Vector approach.
We describe the classification strategy and
the features used by the classifier. In par-
ticular, the contribution of six parse tree
path features is investigated.
