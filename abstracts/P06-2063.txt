 
In this paper, we present a system that 
automatically extracts the pros and cons 
from online reviews. Although many ap-
proaches have been developed for ex-
tracting opinions from text, our focus 
here is on extracting the reasons of the 
opinions, which may themselves be in the 
form of either fact or opinion. Leveraging 
online review sites with author-generated 
pros and cons, we propose a system for 
aligning the pros and cons to their sen-
tences in review texts. A maximum en-
tropy model is then trained on the result-
ing labeled set to subsequently extract 
pros and cons from online review sites 
that do not explicitly provide them. Our 
experimental results show that our result-
ing system identifies pros and cons with 
66% precision and 76% recall.
