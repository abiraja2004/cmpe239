In this paper, we focus on the impressions that
people gain from reading articles in Japanese
newspapers, and we propose a method for
extracting and quantifying these impressions
in real numbers. The target impressions are
limited to those represented by three bipo-
lar scales, ?Happy ? Sad,? ?Glad ? Angry,?
and ?Peaceful ? Strained,? and the strength of
each impression is computed as a real num-
ber between 1 and 7. First, we implement a
method for computing impression values of
articles using an impression lexicon. This
lexicon represents a correlation between the
words appearing in articles and the influence
of these words on the readers? impressions,
and is created from a newspaper database us-
ing a word co-occurrence based method. We
considered that some gaps would occur be-
tween values computed by such an unsuper-
vised method and those judged by the readers,
and we conducted experiments with 900 sub-
jects to identify what gaps actually occurred.
Consequently, we propose a new approach
that uses regression equations to correct im-
pression values computed by the method. Our
investigation shows that accuracy is improved
by a range of 23.2% to 42.7% by using regres-
sion equations.
