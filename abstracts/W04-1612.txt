Automatic recognition of Arabic dialectal speech is
a challenging task because Arabic dialects are es-
sentially spoken varieties. Only few dialectal re-
sources are available to date; moreover, most avail-
able acoustic data collections are transcribed with-
out diacritics. Such a transcription omits essen-
tial pronunciation information about a word, such
as short vowels. In this paper we investigate var-
ious procedures that enable us to use such train-
ing data by automatically inserting the missing dia-
critics into the transcription. These procedures use
acoustic information in combination with different
levels of morphological and contextual constraints.
We evaluate their performance against manually dia-
critized transcriptions. In addition, we demonstrate
the effect of their accuracy on the recognition perfor-
mance of acoustic models trained on automatically
diacritized training data.
