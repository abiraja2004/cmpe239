Subjectivity and meaning are both impor-
tant properties of language. This paper ex-
plores their interaction, and brings empir-
ical evidence in support of the hypotheses
that (1) subjectivity is a property that can
be associated with word senses, and (2)
word sense disambiguation can directly
benefit from subjectivity annotations.
