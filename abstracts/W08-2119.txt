Though phrase-based SMT has achieved high
translation quality, it still lacks of generaliza-
tion ability to capture word order differences
between languages. In this paper we describe
a general method for tree-to-string phrase-
based SMT. We study how syntactic trans-
formation is incorporated into phrase-based
SMT and its effectiveness. We design syntac-
tic transformation models using unlexicalized
form of synchronous context-free grammars.
These models can be learned from source-
parsed bitext. Our system can naturally make
use of both constituent and non-constituent
phrasal translations in the decoding phase. We
considered various levels of syntactic analy-
sis ranging from chunking to full parsing.
Our experimental results of English-Japanese
and English-Vietnamese translation showed
a significant improvement over two baseline
phrase-based SMT systems.
