 
We report grammar inference xperiments on 
partially parsed sentences taken from the Wall 
Street Journal corpus using the inside-outside 
algorithm for stochastic context-free grammars. 
The initial grammar for the inference process 
makes no ,assumption of the kinds of structures 
and their distributions. The inferred grammar is
evaluated by its predicting power and by com- 
paring the bracketing of held out sentences 
imposed by the inferred grammar with the par- 
tial bracketings of these sentences given in the 
corpus. Using part-of-speech tags as the only 
source of lexical information, high bracketing 
accuracy is achieved even with a small subset 
of the available training material (1045 sen- 
tences): 94.4% for test sentences shorter than 
10 words and 90.2% for sentences shorter than 
15 words.
