This paper reports on the SYN-RA
(SYNtax-based Reference Annotation)
project, an on-going project of annotating
German newspaper texts with referential
relations. The project has developed an in-
ventory of anaphoric and coreference rela-
tions for German in the context of a uni-
fied, XML-based annotation scheme for
combining morphological, syntactic, se-
mantic, and anaphoric information. The
paper discusses how this unified annota-
tion scheme relates to other formats cur-
rently discussed in the literature, in par-
ticular the annotation graph model of Bird
and Liberman (2001) and the pie-in-the-
sky scheme for semantic annotation.
