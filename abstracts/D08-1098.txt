 
An increasingly popular method for 
finding information online is via the 
Community Question Answering 
(CQA) portals such as Yahoo! An-
swers, Naver, and Baidu Knows. 
Searching the CQA archives, and rank-
ing, filtering, and evaluating the sub-
mitted answers requires intelligent 
processing of the questions and an-
swers posed by the users. One impor-
tant task is automatically detecting the 
question?s subjectivity orientation: 
namely, whether a user is searching for 
subjective or objective information. 
Unfortunately, real user questions are 
often vague, ill-posed, poorly stated. 
Furthermore, there has been little la-
beled training data available for real 
user questions. To address these prob-
lems, we present CoCQA, a co-training 
system that exploits the association be-
tween the questions and contributed 
answers for question analysis tasks. 
The co-training approach allows 
CoCQA to use the effectively unlim-
ited amounts of unlabeled data readily 
available in CQA archives. In this pa-
per we study the effectiveness of 
CoCQA for the question subjectivity 
classification task by experimenting 
over thousands of real users? questions.
