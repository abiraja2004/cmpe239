Abst rac t  
We present work on the automatic generation of
short indicative-informative abstracts of scien- 
tific and technical articles. The indicative part 
of the abstract identifies the topics of the docu- 
ment while the informative part of the abstract 
elaborate some topics according to the reader's 
interest by motivating the topics, describing en- 
tities and defining concepts. We have defined 
our method of automatic abstracting by study- 
ing a corpus professional bstracts. The method 
also considers the reader's interest as essential 
in the process of abstracting.
