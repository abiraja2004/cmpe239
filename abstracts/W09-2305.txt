 Because of the variations of the languages, the coverage of the references is very important to the reference based automatic evaluation of machine translation systems. We propose a method to extend the reference set of the au-tomatic evaluation only based on multiple manual references and their syntactic struc-tures. In our approach, the syntactic equiva-lents in the reference sentences are identified and hybridized to generate new references. The new method need no external knowledge and can obtain the equivalents of long sub-segments of reference sentences. The experi-mental results show that using the extended reference set the popular automatic evaluation metrics achieve better correlations with the human assessments. 1
