In the line of research extending statis-
tical parsing to more expressive gram-
mar formalisms, we demonstrate for the
first time the use of tree-adjoining gram-
mars (TAG). We present a Bayesian non-
parametric model for estimating a proba-
bilistic TAG from a parsed corpus, along
with novel block sampling methods and
approximation transformations for TAG
that allow efficient parsing. Our work
shows performance improvements on the
Penn Treebank and finds more compact
yet linguistically rich representations of
the data, but more importantly provides
techniques in grammar transformation and
statistical inference that make practical
the use of these more expressive systems,
thereby enabling further experimentation
along these lines.
