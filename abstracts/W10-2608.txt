In this work, we propose a semi-
supervised extension to a well-known
supervised domain adaptation approach
(EA) (Daume? III, 2007). Our proposed
approach (EA++) builds on the notion
of augmented space (introduced in EA)
and harnesses unlabeled data in target do-
main to ameliorate the transfer of infor-
mation from source to target. This semi-
supervised approach to domain adaptation
is extremely simple to implement, and can
be applied as a pre-processing step to any
supervised learner. Experimental results
on sequential labeling tasks demonstrate
the efficacy of the proposed method.
