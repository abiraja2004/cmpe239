Approaches to plural reference generation
emphasise descriptive brevity, but often lack
empirical backing. This paper describes
a corpus-based study of plural descrip-
tions, and proposes a psycholinguistically-
motivated algorithm for plural reference
generation. The descriptive strategy is based
on partitioning and incorporates corpus-
derived heuristics. An exhaustive evaluation
shows that the output closely matches hu-
man data.
