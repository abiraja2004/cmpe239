We explore the use of conditional random
fields (CRFs) to automatically extract impor-
tant metadata from clinical research articles.
These metadata fields include formulaic meta-
data about the authors, extracted from the title
page, as well as free text fields concerning the
study?s critical parameters, such as longitudi-
nal variables and medical intervention meth-
ods, extracted from the body text of the arti-
cle. Extracting such information can help both
readers conduct deep semantic search of arti-
cles and policy makers and sociologists track
macro level trends in research. Preliminary re-
sults show an acceptable level of performance
for formulaic metadata and a high precision
for those found in the free text.
