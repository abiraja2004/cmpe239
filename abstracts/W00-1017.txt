 
This paper describes WI'I; a toolkit 
for building spoken dialogue systems. 
WIT features an incremental under- 
standing mechanism that enables ro- 
bust utterance understanding and real- 
time responses. WIT's ability to com- 
pile domain-dependent system specifi- 
cations into internal knowledge sources 
makes building spoken dialogue sys- 
tems much easier than :it is from 
scratch.
