 
Sentiment analysis is one of the hot de-
manding research areas since last few dec-
ades. Although a formidable amount of 
research have been done, the existing re-
ported solutions or available systems are 
still far from perfect or do not meet the sa-
tisfaction level of end users?. The main is-
sue is the various conceptual rules that 
govern sentiment and there are even more 
clues (possibly unlimited) that can convey 
these concepts from realization to verbali-
zation of a human being. Human psycholo-
gy directly relates to the unrevealed clues 
and governs the sentiment realization of us. 
Human psychology relates many things 
like social psychology, culture, pragmatics 
and many more endless intelligent aspects 
of civilization. Proper incorporation of hu-
man psychology into computational senti-
ment knowledge representation may solve 
the problem. In the present paper we pro-
pose a template based online interactive 
gaming technology, called Dr Sentiment to 
automatically create the PsychoSenti-
WordNet involving internet population. 
The PsychoSentiWordNet is an extension 
of SentiWordNet that presently holds hu-
man psychological knowledge on a few as-
pects along with sentiment knowledge.
