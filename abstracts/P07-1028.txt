We propose a new, simple model for the auto-
matic induction of selectional preferences, using
corpus-based semantic similarity metrics. Fo-
cusing on the task of semantic role labeling,
we compute selectional preferences for seman-
tic roles. In evaluations the similarity-based
model shows lower error rates than both Resnik?s
WordNet-based model and the EM-based clus-
tering model, but has coverage problems.
