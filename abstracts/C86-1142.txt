 
This paper describes a method for converting a 
task-dependent grammar into a word predictor of a 
speech understanding system, Since tile word 
prediction is a top-down operation, left  recursive 
rules induces an in f in i te  looping. We have solved 
this problem by applying an algorithm for bottom-up 
parsing,
