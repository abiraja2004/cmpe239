We present a novel method to identify ef-
fective surface text patterns using an inter-
net search engine. Precision is only one
of the criteria to identify the most effec-
tive patterns among the candidates found.
Another aspect is frequency of occurrence.
Also, a pattern has to relate diverse in-
stances if it expresses a non-functional re-
lation. The learned surface text patterns
are applied in an ontology population al-
gorithm, which not only learns new in-
stances of classes but also new instance-
pairs of relations. We present some ?rst
experiments with these methods.
