In this paper we show to what degree the count-
ability of English nouns is predictable from their
semantics. We found that at 78% of nouns?
countability could be predicted using an ontol-
ogy of 2,710 nodes. We also show how this
predictability can be used to aid non-native
speakers to determine the countability of En-
glish nouns when building a bilingual machine
translation lexicon.
