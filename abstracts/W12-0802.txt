It has remained an open question whether
the twins property for weighted tree au-
tomata is decidable. This property is crucial
for determinizing such an automaton, and
it has been argued that determinization im-
proves the output of parsers and translation
systems. We show that the twins property
for weighted tree automata over extremal
semifields is decidable.
