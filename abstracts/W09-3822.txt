 
This paper presents a set of experiments per-
formed on parsing the Basque Dependency 
Treebank. We have applied feature propaga-
tion to dependency parsing, experimenting the 
propagation of several morphosyntactic fea-
ture values. In the experiments we have used 
the output of a parser to enrich the input of a 
second parser. Both parsers have been gener-
ated by Maltparser, a freely data-driven de-
pendency parser generator. The transforma-
tions, combined with the pseudoprojective 
graph transformation, obtain a LAS of 77.12% 
improving the best reported results for Basque.
