In this work, we present a scenario where con-
textual targeted paraphrasing of sub-sentential
phrases is performed automatically to support
the task of text revision. Candidate para-
phrases are obtained from a preexisting reper-
toire and validated in the context of the orig-
inal sentence using information derived from
the Web. We report on experiments on French,
where the original sentences to be rewrit-
ten are taken from a rewriting memory au-
tomatically extracted from the edit history of
Wikipedia.
