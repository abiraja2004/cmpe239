Building on the use of local contexts, or
frames, for human category acquisition,
we explore the treatment of contexts as
categories. This allows us to examine and
evaluate the categorical properties that lo-
cal unsupervised methods can distinguish
and their relationship to corpus POS tags.
From there, we use lexical information
to combine contexts in a way which pre-
serves the intended category, providing a
platform for grammatical category induc-
tion.
