 
Natural language interfaces designed for 
situationally embedded domains (e.g. 
cars, videogames) must incorporate 
knowledge about the users? context to 
address the many ambiguities of situated 
language use. We introduce a model of 
situated language acquisition that operates 
in two phases.  First, intentional context is 
represented and inferred from user actions 
using probabilistic context free grammars.  
Then, utterances are mapped onto this 
representation in a noisy channel 
framework.  The acquisition model is 
trained on unconstrained speech collected 
from subjects playing an interactive game, 
and tested on an understanding task.
