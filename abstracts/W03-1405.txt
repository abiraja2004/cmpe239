The goal of this paper is to integrate the
Conceptual Mapping Model with an on-
tology-based knowledge representation
(i.e. Suggested Upper Merged Ontology
(SUMO)) in order to demonstrate that
conceptual metaphor analysis can be re-
stricted and eventually, automated. In
particular, we will propose a corpora-
based operational definition for Mapping
Principles, which are explanations of why
a conventional conceptual metaphor has a
particular source-target domain pairing.
This paper will examine 2000 random ex-
amples of ?economy? (jingji) in Mandarin
Chinese and postulate Mapping Principles
based frequency and delimited with
SUMO.
