We report evaluation results for our sum-
marization system and analyze the result-
ing summarization data for three differ-
ent types of corpora. To develop a ro-
bust summarization system, we have cre-
ated a system based on sentence extraction
and applied it to summarize Japanese and
English newspaper articles, obtained some
of the top results at two evaluation work-
shops. We have also created sentence ex-
traction data from Japanese lectures and
evaluated our system with these data. In
addition to the evaluation results, we an-
alyze the relationships between key sen-
tences and the features used in sentence
extraction. We find that discrete combi-
nations of features match distributions of
key sentences better than sequential com-
binations.
