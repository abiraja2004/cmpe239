In this paper, we use tree kernels to exploit
deep syntactic parsing information for nat-
ural language applications. We study the
properties of different kernels and we pro-
vide algorithms for their computation in
linear average time. The experiments with
SVMs on the task of predicate argument
classification provide empirical data that
validates our methods.
