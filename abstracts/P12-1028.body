In this paper, we propose innovative repre-
sentations for automatic classification of verbs
according to mainstream linguistic theories,
namely VerbNet and FrameNet. First, syntac-
tic and semantic structures capturing essential
lexical and syntactic properties of verbs are
defined. Then, we design advanced similarity
functions between such structures, i.e., seman-
tic tree kernel functions, for exploiting distri-
butional and grammatical information in Sup-
port Vector Machines. The extensive empir-
ical analysis on VerbNet class and frame de-
tection shows that our models capture mean-
ingful syntactic/semantic structures, which al-
lows for improving the state-of-the-art.
