text categorization in which the domain 
ontologies are automatically acquired 
through morphological rules and statistical 
methods. The ontology-based approach is 
a promising way for general information 
retrieval applications such as knowledge 
management or knowledge discovery. As 
a way to evaluate the quality of domain 
ontologies, we test our method through 
several experiments.  Automatically 
acquired domain ontologies, with or 
without manual editing, have been used 
for text categorization. The results are 
quite satisfactory. Furthermore, we have 
developed an automatic method to 
evaluate the quality of our domain 
ontology.
