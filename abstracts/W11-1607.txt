We present a system for fusing sentences
which are drawn from the same source docu-
ment but have different content. Unlike previ-
ous work, our approach is supervised, training
on real-world examples of sentences fused by
professional journalists in the process of edit-
ing news articles. Like Filippova and Strube
(2008), our system merges dependency graphs
using Integer Linear Programming. However,
instead of aligning the inputs as a preprocess,
we integrate the tasks of finding an alignment
and selecting a merged sentence into a joint
optimization problem, and learn parameters
for this optimization using a structured online
algorithm. Evaluation by human judges shows
that our technique produces fused sentences
that are both informative and readable.
