We explore a hybrid approach for Chinese
definitional question answering by com-
bining deep linguistic analysis with sur-
face pattern learning. We answer four
questions in this study: 1) How helpful are
linguistic analysis and pattern learning? 2)
What kind of questions can be answered
by pattern matching? 3) How much an-
notation is required for a pattern-based
system to achieve good performance? 4)
What linguistic features are most useful?
Extensive experiments are conducted on
biographical questions and other defini-
tional questions. Major findings include:
1) linguistic analysis and pattern learning
are complementary; both are required to
make a good definitional QA system; 2)
pattern matching is very effective in an-
swering biographical questions while less
effective for other definitional questions;
3) only a small amount of annotation is
required for a pattern learning system to
achieve good performance on biographi-
cal questions; 4) the most useful linguistic
features are copulas and appositives; re-
lations also play an important role; only
some propositions convey vital facts.
