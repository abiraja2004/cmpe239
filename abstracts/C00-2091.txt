 
Most of the studies in the framework of Lambek 
calculus have considered the parsing process and 
ignored the generation process. This paper wants 
to rely on the close link between Lambek calculus 
and linear logic to present a method for the genera- 
tion process with semantic proof nets. We express 
the process as a proof search procedure based on a 
graph calculus and the solutions appear as a matrix 
computation preserving the decidability properties, 
and we characterize a polynomial time case.
