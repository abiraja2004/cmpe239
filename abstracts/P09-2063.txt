We propose a new specifically designed
method for paraphrase generation based
on Monte-Carlo sampling and show how
this algorithm is suitable for its task.
Moreover, the basic algorithm presented
here leaves a lot of opportunities for fu-
ture improvement. In particular, our algo-
rithm does not constraint the scoring func-
tion in opposite to Viterbi based decoders.
It is now possible to use some global fea-
tures in paraphrase scoring functions. This
algorithm opens new outlooks for para-
phrase generation and other natural lan-
guage processing applications like statis-
tical machine translation.
