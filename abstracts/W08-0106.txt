A key problem for models of  dialogue  is  to 
explain  how  semantic  co-ordination  in  dia-
logue  is  achieved  and  sustained.  This  paper 
presents findings from a series of Maze Task 
experiments  which are  not  readily explained 
by the primary co-ordination mechanisms of 
existing  models.  It  demonstrates  that  align-
ment in dialogue is not simply an outcome of 
successful  interaction,  but  a  communicative 
resource  exploited  by  interlocutors  in  con-
verging on a semantic model. We argue this 
suggests mechanisms of co-ordination in dia-
logue which are of relevance for a general ac-
count  of  how  semantic  co-ordination  is 
achieved.
