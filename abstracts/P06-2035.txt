 
This paper deals with multilingual data-
base generation from parallel corpora. 
The idea is to contribute to the enrich-
ment of lexical databases for languages 
with few linguistic resources. Our ap-
proach is endogenous: it relies on the raw 
texts only, it does not require external 
linguistic resources such as stemmers or 
taggers. The system produces alignments 
for the 20 European languages of the 
?Acquis Communautaire? Corpus.
