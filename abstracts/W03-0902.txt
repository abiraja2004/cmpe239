We have been developing techniques for ex-
tracting general world knowledge from miscel-
laneous texts by a process of approximate inter-
pretation and abstraction, focusing initially on
the Brown corpus. We apply interpretive rules
to clausal patterns and patterns of modifica-
tion, and concurrently abstract general ?possi-
bilistic? propositions from the resulting formu-
las. Two examples are ?A person may believe
a proposition?, and ?Children may live with
relatives?. Our methods currently yield over
117,000 such propositions (of variable quality)
for the Brown corpus (more than 2 per sen-
tence). We report here on our efforts to eval-
uate these results with a judging scheme aimed
at determining how many of these propositions
pass muster as ?reasonable general claims?
about the world in the opinion of human judges.
We find that nearly 60% of the extracted propo-
sitions are favorably judged according to our
scheme by any given judge. The percentage
unanimously judged to be reasonable claims by
multiple judges is lower, but still sufficiently
high to suggest that our techniques may be of
some use in tackling the long-standing ?knowl-
edge acquisition bottleneck? in AI.
