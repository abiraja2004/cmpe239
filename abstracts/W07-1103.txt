This paper describes the design and imple-
mentation of a lexicon of Dutch multiword
expressions (MWEs). No exhaustive re-
search on a standard lexical representation
of MWEs has been done for Dutch before.
The approach taken is innovative, since it
is based on the Equivalence Class Method.
Furthermore, the selection of the lexical en-
tries and their properties is corpus-based.
The design of the lexicon and the standard
representation will be tested in Dutch NLP
systems. The purpose of the current paper is
to give an overview of the decisions made in
order to come to a standard lexical represen-
tation and to discuss the description fields
this representation comprises.
