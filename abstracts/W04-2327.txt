In the five years since it was proposed, the
MATE scheme for anaphoric annotation has
been used in a variety of annotation projects,
and the resulting corpora have been used to
study both anaphora resolution and NL gener-
ation. Annotation tools inspired by the propos-
als have been used in some of these projects.
In this paper we discuss these first experiences
with the scheme, some lessons that have been
learned, and suggest a few modifications.
