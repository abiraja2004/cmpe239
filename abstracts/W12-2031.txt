In this paper we describe the technical im-
plementation of our system that participated
in the Helping Our Own 2012 Shared Task
(HOO-2012). The system employs a num-
ber of preprocessing steps and machine learn-
ing classifiers for correction of determiner and
preposition errors in non-native English texts.
We use maximum entropy classifiers trained
on the provided HOO-2012 development data
and a large high-quality English text collec-
tion. The system proposes a number of highly-
probable corrections, which are evaluated by a
language model and compared with the origi-
nal text. A number of deterministic rules are
used to increase the precision and recall of the
system. Our system is ranked among the three
best performing HOO-2012 systems with a
precision of 31.15%, recall of 22.08% and F1-
score of 25.84% for correction of determiner
and preposition errors combined.
