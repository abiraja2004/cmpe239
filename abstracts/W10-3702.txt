The morphosyntactic treatment of multi-
word units is particularly challenging in
morphologically rich languages. We
present a comparative study of two for-
malisms meant for lexicalized description
of MWUs in Polish. We show their ex-
pressive power and describe encoding ex-
periments, involving novice and expert
lexicographers, and allowing to evaluate
the accuracy and efficiency of both imple-
mentations.
