 
Instructional tex-ts have been the object of many studies re- 
cently, motivated by the increased need to produce manuals 
(especially multilingual manuals) coupled with the cost of 
translators and technical writers. Because these studies con- 
centrate on aspects other than the linguistic realismion of 
instructions - for example, the integration of text and graph- 
i cs -  they all generate a sequence of steps required to achieve 
a task, using imperatives. Our research so flu- shows, how- 
ever, that manuals can iu fact have different styles, i.e., not 
all instructions are stated using a sequence of imperatives, 
and that, furthermore, different parts of manuals often use 
different styles. In this paper, we present our preliminary 
results from an analysis of over 30 user guides/manuals for 
consumer appliances and discuss ome of the implications.
