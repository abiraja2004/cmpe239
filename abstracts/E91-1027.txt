 
Givcn a grammar for a language, it is possible to 
create finite state mechanisms that approximate 
its recognition capacity. These simple automata 
consider only short context information~ drawn 
from local syntactic constraints which the 
grammar hnposes. While it is short of providing 
the strong generative capacity of the grammar, 
such an approximation is useful for removing 
most word tagging ambiguities, identifying many 
cases of iU-fonncd input, and assisting efficiently 
in othcr natural language processing tasks. Our 
basic approach to the acquisition and usage of 
local syntactic constraints was presented clse- 
whcre; in this papcr we present some formal and 
empiric-,d results pertaining to properties of the 
approximating automata.
