Extracting sentences that contain important in-
formation from a document is a form of text
summarization. The technique is the key to the
automatic generation of summaries similar to
those written by humans. To achieve such ex-
traction, it is important to be able to integrate
heterogeneous pieces of information. One ap-
proach, parameter tuning by machine learning,
has been attracting a lot of attention. This pa-
per proposes a method of sentence extraction
based on Support Vector Machines (SVMs). To
confirm the method?s performance, we conduct
experiments that compare our method to three
existing methods. Results on the Text Summa-
rization Challenge (TSC) corpus show that our
method offers the highest accuracy. Moreover,
we clarify the different features effective for ex-
tracting different document genres.
