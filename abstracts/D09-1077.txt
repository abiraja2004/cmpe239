This paper describes a time-series model
for parsing transcribed speech containing
disfluencies. This model differs from pre-
vious parsers in its explicit modeling of a
buffer of recent words, which allows it to
recognize repairs more easily due to the
frequent overlap in words between errors
and their repairs. The parser implement-
ing this model is evaluated on the stan-
dard Switchboard transcribed speech pars-
ing task for overall parsing accuracy and
edited word detection.
