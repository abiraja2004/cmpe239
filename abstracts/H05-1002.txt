This paper investigates automatic identi-
fication of Information Structure (IS) in
texts. The experiments use the Prague
Dependency Treebank which is annotated
with IS following the Praguian approach
of Topic Focus Articulation. We auto-
matically detect t(opic) and f(ocus), us-
ing node attributes from the treebank as
basic features and derived features in-
spired by the annotation guidelines. We
present the performance of decision trees
(C4.5), maximum entropy, and rule in-
duction (RIPPER) classifiers on all tec-
togrammatical nodes. We compare the re-
sults against a baseline system that always
assigns f(ocus) and against a rule-based
system. The best system achieves an ac-
curacy of 90.69%, which is a 44.73% im-
provement over the baseline (62.66%).
