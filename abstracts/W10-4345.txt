We perform a study of existing dialogue
corpora to establish the theoretical max-
imum performance of the selection ap-
proach to simulating human dialogue be-
havior in unseen dialogues. This maxi-
mum is the proportion of test utterances
for which an exact or approximate match
exists in the corresponding training cor-
pus. The results indicate that some do-
mains seem quite suitable for a corpus-
based selection approach, with over half of
the test utterances having been seen before
in the corpus, while other domains show
much more novelty compared to previous
dialogues.
