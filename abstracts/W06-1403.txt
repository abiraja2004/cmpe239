This paper presents a novel algorithm
for efficiently generating paraphrases from
disjunctive logical forms. The algorithm
is couched in the framework of Combina-
tory Categorial Grammar (CCG) and has
been implemented as an extension to the
OpenCCG surface realizer. The algorithm
makes use of packed representations sim-
ilar to those initially proposed by Shem-
tov (1997), generalizing the approach in a
more straightforward way than in the algo-
rithm ultimately adopted therein.
