In this paper a multiclassifier based approach is presented for a
word sense disambiguation (WSD) problem. A vector representation
is used for training and testing cases and the Singular Value Decom-
position (SVD) technique is applied to reduce the dimension of the
representation. The approach we present consists in creating a set of
k-NN classifiers and combining the predictions generated in order to
give a final word sense prediction for each case to be classified. The
combination is done by applying a Bayesian voting scheme. The ap-
proach has been applied to a database of 100 words made available by
the lexical sample WSD subtask of SemEval-2007 (task 17) organizers.
Each of the words was considered an independent classification prob-
lem. A methodological parameter tuning phase was applied in order to
optimize parameter setting for each word. Results achieved are among
the best and make the approach encouraging to apply to other WSD
tasks.
