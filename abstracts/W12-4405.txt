Supervised Named Entity Recognizers require
large amounts of annotated text. Since manual
annotation is a highly costly procedure, reduc-
ing the annotation cost is essential. We present
a fully automatic method to build NE anno-
tated corpora from Wikipedia. In contrast to
recent work, we apply a new method, which
maps the DBpedia classes into CoNLL NE
types. Since our method is mainly language-
independent, we used it to generate corpora
for English and Hungarian. The corpora are
freely available.
