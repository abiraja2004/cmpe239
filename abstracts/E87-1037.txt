 
Currently several grammatical formalisms converge 
towards being declarative and towards utilizing 
context-free phrase-structure grammar as a back- 
bone, e.g. LFG and PATR-II. Typically the pro- 
cessing of these formalisms is organized within a 
chart-parsing framework. The declarative charac- 
ter of the formalisms makes it important to decide 
upon an overall optimal control strategy on the part 
of the processor. In particular, this brings the rule- 
invocation strategy into critical focus: to gain max- 
imal processing efficiency, one has to determine the 
best way of putting the rules to use. The aim of this 
paper is to provide a survey and a practical compari- 
son of fundamental rule-invocation strategies within 
context-free chart parsing.
