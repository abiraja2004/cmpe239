We present two English-to-Czech systems
that took part in the WMT 2013 shared
task: TECTOMT and PHRASEFIX. The
former is a deep-syntactic transfer-based
system, the latter is a more-or-less stan-
dard statistical post-editing (SPE) applied
on top of TECTOMT. In a brief survey, we
put SPE in context with other system com-
bination techniques and evaluate SPE vs.
another simple system combination tech-
nique: using synthetic parallel data from
TECTOMT to train a statistical MT sys-
tem (SMT). We confirm that PHRASEFIX
(SPE) improves the output of TECTOMT,
and we use this to analyze errors in TEC-
TOMT. However, we also show that ex-
tending data for SMT is more effective.
