 
This paper presents an algorithm for learn- 
ing the probabilities of optional phonolog- 
ical rules from corpora. The algorithm is 
based on using a speech recognition sys- 
tem to discover the surface pronunciations 
of words in spe.ech corpora; using an auto- 
matic system obviates expensive phonetic 
labeling by hand. We describe the details 
of our algorithm and show the probabili- 
ties the system has learned for ten common 
phonological rules which model reductions 
and coarticulation effects. These probabili- 
ties were derived from a corpus of 7203 sen- 
tences of read speech from the Wall Street 
Journal, and are shown to be a reason- 
ably close match to probabilities from pho- 
netically hand-transcribed data (TIMIT). 
Finally, we analyze the probability differ- 
ences between rule use in male versus fe- 
male speech, and suggest hat the differ- 
ences are caused by differing average rates 
of speech.
