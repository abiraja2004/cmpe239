 
We propose that machine translation (MT) is a 
useful application for evaluating and deriving 
the development of NL components, 
especially in a wide-coverage analysis system. 
Given the architecture of our MT system, 
which is a transfer system based on linguistic 
modules, correct analysis is expected to be a 
prerequisite for correct translation, suggesting 
a correlation between the two, given relatively 
mature transfer and generation components.  
We show through error analysis that there is 
indeed a strong correlation between the quality 
of the translated output and the subjectively 
determined goodness of the analysis.  We use 
this correlation as a guide for development of 
a coordinated parallel analysis effort in 7 
languages.
