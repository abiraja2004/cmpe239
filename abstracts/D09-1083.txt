Measuring the similarity between two
texts is a fundamental problem in many
NLP and IR applications. Among the ex-
isting approaches, the cosine measure of
the term vectors representing the origi-
nal texts has been widely used, where the
score of each term is often determined
by a TFIDF formula. Despite its sim-
plicity, the quality of such cosine similar-
ity measure is usually domain dependent
and decided by the choice of the term-
weighting function. In this paper, we pro-
pose a novel framework that learns the
term-weighting function. Given the la-
beled pairs of texts as training data, the
learning procedure tunes the model pa-
rameters by minimizing the specified loss
function of the similarity score. Com-
pared to traditional TFIDF term-weighting
schemes, our approach shows a significant
improvement on tasks such as judging the
quality of query suggestions and filtering
irrelevant ads for online advertising.
