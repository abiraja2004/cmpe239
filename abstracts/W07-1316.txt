This paper reports the results of a re-
search project that experiments with cross-
tabulation in aiding phonemic reconstruc-
tion. Data from the Tup?? stock was used,
and three tests were conducted in order to
determine the efficacy of this application:
the confirmation and challenging of a previ-
ously established reconstruction in the fam-
ily; testing a new reconstruction generated
by our model; and testing the upper limit
of simultaneous, multiple correspondences
across several languages. Our conclusion
is that the use of cross tabulations (imple-
mented within a database as pivot tables) of-
fers an innovative and effective tool in com-
parative study and sound reconstruction.
