Finite-state approaches have been highly successful at describ-
ing the morphological processes of many languages. Such
approaches have largely focused on modeling the phone- or
character-level processes that generate candidate lexical types,
rather than tokens in context. For the full analysis of words
in context, disambiguation is also required (Hakkani-Tu?r et al,
2000; Hajic? et al, 2001). In this paper, we apply a novel
source-channel model to the problem of morphological disam-
biguation (segmentation into morphemes, lemmatization, and
POS tagging) for concatenative, templatic, and inflectional lan-
guages. The channel model exploits an existing morphological
dictionary, constraining each word?s analysis to be linguistically
valid. The source model is a factored, conditionally-estimated
random field (Lafferty et al, 2001) that learns to disambiguate
the full sentence by modeling local contexts. Compared with
baseline state-of-the-art methods, our method achieves statisti-
cally significant error rate reductions on Korean, Arabic, and
Czech, for various training set sizes and accuracy measures.
