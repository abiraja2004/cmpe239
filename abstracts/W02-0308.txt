Objectives: To automatically extend
downwards an existing biomedical termi-
nology using a corpus and both lexical
and terminological knowledge. Methods:
Adjectival modifiers are removed from
terms extracted from the corpus (three
million noun phrases extracted from
MEDLINE), and demodified terms are
searched for in the terminology (UMLS
Metathesaurus, restricted to disorders and
procedures). A phrase from MEDLINE
becomes a candidate term in the Metathe-
saurus if the following two requirements
are met: 1) a demodified term created
from this phrase is found in the terminol-
ogy and 2) the modifiers removed to cre-
ate the demodified term also modify
existing terms from the terminology, for a
given semantic category. A manual re-
view of a sample of candidate terms was
performed. Results: Out of the 3 million
simple phrases randomly extracted from
MEDLINE, 125,000 new terms were
identified for inclusion in the UMLS.
83% of the 1000 terms reviewed manually
were associated with a relevant UMLS
concept. Discussion: The limitations of
this approach are discussed, as well as ad-
aptation and generalization issues.
