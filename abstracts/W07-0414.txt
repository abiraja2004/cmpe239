This paper describes a new method to
compare reordering constraints for Statis-
tical Machine Translation. We investi-
gate the best possible (oracle) BLEU score
achievable under different reordering con-
straints. Using dynamic programming, we
efficiently find a reordering that approxi-
mates the highest attainable BLEU score
given a reference and a set of reordering
constraints. We present an empirical eval-
uation of popular reordering constraints:
local constraints, the IBM constraints,
and the Inversion Transduction Grammar
(ITG) constraints. We present results for a
German-English translation task and show
that reordering under the ITG constraints
can improve over the baseline by more
than 7.5 BLEU points.
