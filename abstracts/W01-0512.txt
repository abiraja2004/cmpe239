In this paper we describe a morphological analy-
sis method based on a maximum entropy model.
This method uses a model that can not only
consult a dictionary with a large amount of lex-
ical information but can also identify unknown
words by learning certain characteristics. The
model has the potential to overcome the un-
known word problem.
