In this paper, we present a word sense
disambiguation (WSD) based system for
multilingual lexical substitution. Our
method depends on having a WSD system
for English and an automatic word align-
ment method. Crucially the approach re-
lies on having parallel corpora. For Task
2 (Sinha et al, 2009) we apply a super-
vised WSD system to derive the English
word senses. For Task 3 (Lefever & Hoste,
2009), we apply an unsupervised approach
to the training and test data. Both of our
systems that participated in Task 2 achieve
a decent ranking among the participating
systems. For Task 3 we achieve the highest
ranking on several of the language pairs:
French, German and Italian.
