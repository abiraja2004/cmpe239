We report on a project to derive word
translation relationships automatically
from parallel corpora. Our effort is
distinguished by the use of simpler,
faster models than those used in pre-
vious high-accuracy approaches. Our
methods achieve accuracy on single-
word translations that seems compara-
ble to any work previously reported, up
to nearly 60% coverage of word types,
and they perform particularly well on a
class of multi-word compounds of spe-
cial interest to our translation effort.
