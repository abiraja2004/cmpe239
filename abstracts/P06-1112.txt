In this paper, we explore correlation of
dependency relation paths to rank candi-
date answers in answer extraction. Using
the correlation measure, we compare de-
pendency relations of a candidate answer
and mapped question phrases in sentence
with the corresponding relations in ques-
tion. Different from previous studies, we
propose an approximate phrase mapping
algorithm and incorporate the mapping
score into the correlation measure. The
correlations are further incorporated into
a Maximum Entropy-based ranking model
which estimates path weights from train-
ing. Experimental results show that our
method significantly outperforms state-of-
the-art syntactic relation-based methods
by up to 20% in MRR.
