Advances in natural language generation and
speech processing techniques, combined with
changes in the commercial landscape, have
brought within reach dramatic improvements
in Augmentative Alternative Communication
(AAC). These improvements, though over-
whelmingly positive, amplify a family of per-
sonal data use problems. This paper argues
that the AAC design and implementation pro-
cess needs to identify and address personal
data use problems. Accordingly, this paper
explores personal data management problems
and proposes responses. This paper is situated
in the context of AAC technology but the re-
sponses could be generalised for other com-
munities affected by low digital literacy, low
literacy levels and cognitive challenges.
