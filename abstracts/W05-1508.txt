We introduce a method for transferring
annotation from a syntactically annotated
corpus in a source language to a target lan-
guage. Our approach assumes only that
an (unannotated) text corpus exists for the
target language, and does not require that
the parameters of the mapping between
the two languages are known. We outline
a general probabilistic approach based on
Data Augmentation, discuss the algorith-
mic challenges, and present a novel algo-
rithm for sampling from a posterior distri-
bution over trees.
