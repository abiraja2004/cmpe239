Unrehearsed spoken language often
contains disfluencies. In order to cor-
rectly interpret a spoken utterance,
any such disfluencies must be identi-
fied and removed or otherwise dealt
with. Operating on transcripts of
speech which contain disfluencies, our
particular focus here is the identifica-
tion and correction of speech repairs
using a noisy channel model. Our aim
is to develop a high-accuracy mecha-
nism that can identify speech repairs
in an incremental fashion, as the ut-
terance is processed word-by-word.
We also address the issue of the evalu-
ation of such incremental systems. We
propose a novel approach to evalua-
tion, which evaluates performance in
detecting and correcting disfluencies
incrementally, rather than only assess-
ing performance once the processing of
an utterance is complete. This demon-
strates some shortcomings in our ba-
sic incremental model, and so we then
demonstrate a technique that improves
performance on the detection of disflu-
encies as they happen.
