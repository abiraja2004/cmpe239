We revisit the idea of history-based pars-
ing, and present a history-based parsing
framework that strives to be simple, gen-
eral, and flexible. We also provide a de-
coder for this probability model that is
linear-space, optimal, and anytime. A
parser based on this framework, when
evaluated on Section 23 of the Penn Tree-
bank, compares favorably with other state-
of-the-art approaches, in terms of both ac-
curacy and speed.
