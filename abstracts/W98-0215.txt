 
Prototypes of two direct audio/tactile access 
methods are demonstrated that allow people 
with print disabilities to "see" diagrams, maps, 
charts, and other graphically-displayed 
information. All methods require that labels or 
other identifying information be available for 
each important object in a figure. In web 
applications, this additional information is
accessed by exercising a link associated with an 
object. People with severe visual disabilities 
may need a tactile image mounted on a touch 
screen to access object-related information. It is 
expected that recently-introduced force 
feedback "haptic mice" may soon provide asy 
haptic access to the objects as well. The critical 
factor that ensures accessibility is availability of 
information about all important objects, since 
there is currently no way to transform any but 
the simplest purely visual graphic information 
into audio or tactile/haptic information that is 
easily understandable. These requirements, 
which also ensure good searchability, should 
influence development of future data structures 
and visualization displays.
