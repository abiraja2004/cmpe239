We present a distantly supervised system for
extracting the temporal bounds of fluents (re-
lations which only hold during certain times,
such as attends school). Unlike previous
pipelined approaches, our model does not as-
sume independence between each fluent or
even between named entities with known con-
nections (parent, spouse, employer, etc.). In-
stead, we model what makes timelines of flu-
ents consistent by learning cross-fluent con-
straints, potentially spanning entities as well.
For example, our model learns that someone
is unlikely to start a job at age two or to marry
someone who hasn?t been born yet. Our sys-
tem achieves a 36% error reduction over a
pipelined baseline.
