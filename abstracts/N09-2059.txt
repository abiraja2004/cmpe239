Word sense distributions are usually skewed.
Predicting the extent of the skew can help a
word sense disambiguation (WSD) system de-
termine whether to consider evidence from the
local context or apply the simple yet effec-
tive heuristic of using the first (most frequent)
sense. In this paper, we propose a method to
estimate the entropy of a sense distribution to
boost the precision of a first sense heuristic by
restricting its application to words with lower
entropy. We show on two standard datasets
that automatic prediction of entropy can in-
crease the performance of an automatic first
sense heuristic.
