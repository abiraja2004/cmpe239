This paper proposes an approach to im-
prove graph-based dependency parsing by
using decision history. We introduce a
mechanism that considers short dependen-
cies computed in the earlier stages of pars-
ing to improve the accuracy of long de-
pendencies in the later stages. This re-
lies on the fact that short dependencies are
generally more accurate than long depen-
dencies in graph-based models and may
be used as features to help parse long de-
pendencies. The mechanism can easily
be implemented by modifying a graph-
based parsing model and introducing a set
of new features. The experimental results
show that our system achieves state-of-
the-art accuracy on the standard PTB test
set for English and the standard Penn Chi-
nese Treebank (CTB) test set for Chinese.
