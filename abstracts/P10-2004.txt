 
Source language parse trees offer very useful 
but imperfect reordering constraints for statis-
tical machine translation. A lot of effort has 
been made for soft applications of syntactic 
constraints. We alternatively propose the se-
lective use of syntactic constraints. A classifier 
is built automatically to decide whether a node 
in the parse trees should be used as a reorder-
ing constraint or not. Using this information 
yields a 0.8 BLEU point improvement over a 
full constraint-based system.
