 
This paper describes the conversion of a Hid- 
den Markov Model into a finite state trans- 
ducer that closely approximates the behavior 
of the stochastic model. In some cases the 
transducer is equivalent o the HMM. This 
conversion is especially advantageous forpart- 
of-speech tagging because the resulting trans- 
ducer can be composed with other transducers 
that encode correction rules for the most fre- 
quent tagging errors. The speed of tagging is 
also improved. The described methods have 
been implemented and successfully tested.
