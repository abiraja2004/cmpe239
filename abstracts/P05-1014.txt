 
This paper suggests refinements for the 
Distributional Similarity Hypothesis. Our 
proposed hypotheses relate the distribu-
tional behavior of pairs of words to lexical 
entailment ? a tighter notion of semantic 
similarity that is required by many NLP 
applications. To automatically explore the 
validity of the defined hypotheses we de-
veloped an inclusion testing algorithm for 
characteristic features of two words, which 
incorporates corpus and web-based feature 
sampling to overcome data sparseness. The 
degree of hypotheses validity was then em-
pirically tested and manually analyzed with 
respect to the word sense level. In addition, 
the above testing algorithm was exploited 
to improve lexical entailment acquisition.
