There is a widely held belief in the natural lan-
guage and computational linguistics commu-
nities that Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) is
a significant step toward improving important
applications, e.g. question answering and in-
formation extraction. In this paper, we present
an SRL system for Modern Standard Arabic
that exploits many aspects of the rich mor-
phological features of the language. The ex-
periments on the pilot Arabic Propbank data
show that our system based on Support Vector
Machines and Kernel Methods yields a global
SRL F1 score of 82.17%, which improves the
current state-of-the-art in Arabic SRL.
