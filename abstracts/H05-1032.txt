The paper presents a Bayesian model for
text summarization, which explicitly en-
codes and exploits information on how hu-
man judgments are distributed over the
text. Comparison is made against non
Bayesian summarizers, using test data
from Japanese news texts. It is found that
the Bayesian approach generally lever-
ages performance of a summarizer, at
times giving it a significant lead over non-
Bayesian models.
