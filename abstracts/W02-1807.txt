In Chinese language processing, the 
recognition and analysis for serial verb 
constructions (SVCs) is a fascinating research 
topic. Chinese language researchers each may 
have a different definition and interpretation of 
SVC since the structure of SVC makes Chinese 
unique to other languages and contains complex 
semantic and pragmatic information. This paper 
proposes a formal definition of SVC and a 
knowledge based approach for the recognition of 
SVCs, which is adopted in TOTAL-CK, a 
transfer-based MT system from Chinese to 
Korean. The recognition process is carried out in 
two stages: the analysis stage classifies SVCs 
into general categories, and the transfer stage 
performs further classification for Korean 
transfer. Some evaluation result for each stage 
was also given with statistics of each category of 
SVCs
