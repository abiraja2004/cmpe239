This paper presents an approach for detecting
promotional content in Wikipedia. By incor-
porating stylometric features, including fea-
tures based on n-gram and PCFG language
models, we demonstrate improved accuracy
at identifying promotional articles, compared
to using only lexical information and meta-
features.
