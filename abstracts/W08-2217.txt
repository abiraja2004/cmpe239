The most recent release of PDTB 2.0 contains annotations of senses of
connectives. The PDTB 2.0 manual describes the hierarchical set of
senses used in the annotation and offers rough semantic descriptions of
each label. In this paper, we refine the semantics of concession sub-
stantially and offer a formal description of concessive relations and the
associated inferences drawn by the reader, utilizing basic notions from
Hobbs?s logic, including the distinction between causes and causal com-
plexes (Hobbs, 2005). This work is part of a larger project on the se-
mantics of connectives which aims at developing formal descriptions of
discourse relations, useful for processing real data.
