We use the technique of SVM anchoring to
demonstrate that lexical features extracted
from a training corpus are not necessary to
obtain state of the art results on tasks such
as Named Entity Recognition and Chunk-
ing. While standard models require as
many as 100K distinct features, we derive
models with as little as 1K features that
perform as well or better on different do-
mains. These robust reduced models in-
dicate that the way rare lexical features
contribute to classification in NLP is not
fully understood. Contrastive error analy-
sis (with and without lexical features) in-
dicates that lexical features do contribute
to resolving some semantic and complex
syntactic ambiguities ? but we find this
contribution does not generalize outside
the training corpus. As a general strat-
egy, we believe lexical features should not
be directly derived from a training corpus
but instead, carefully inferred and selected
from other sources.
