Latent-variable PCFGs (L-PCFGs) are a
highly successful model for natural language
parsing. Recent work (Cohen et al, 2012)
has introduced a spectral algorithm for param-
eter estimation of L-PCFGs, which?unlike
the EM algorithm?is guaranteed to give con-
sistent parameter estimates (it has PAC-style
guarantees of sample complexity). This paper
describes experiments using the spectral algo-
rithm. We show that the algorithm provides
models with the same accuracy as EM, but is
an order of magnitude more efficient. We de-
scribe a number of key steps used to obtain
this level of performance; these should be rel-
evant to other work on the application of spec-
tral learning algorithms. We view our results
as strong empirical evidence for the viability
of spectral methods as an alternative to EM.
