In this paper we present a novel, cus-
tomizable IE paradigm that takes advan-
tage of predicate-argument structures. We
also introduce a new way of automatically
identifying predicate argument structures,
which is central to our IE paradigm. It is
based on: (1) an extended set of features;
and (2) inductive decision tree learning.
The experimental results prove our claim
that accurate predicate-argument struc-
tures enable high quality IE results.
