Abstract
We describe a model for creating word-to-word and
phrase-to-phrase alignments between documents
and their human written abstracts. Such alignments
are critical for the development of statistical sum-
marization systems that can be trained on large cor-
pora of document/abstract pairs. Our model, which
is based on a novel Phrase-Based HMM, outper-
forms both the Cut & Paste alignment model (Jing,
2002) and models developed in the context of ma-
chine translation (Brown et al, 1993).
