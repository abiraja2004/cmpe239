Ensuring consistency of Part-of-Speech
(POS) tagging plays an important role
in constructing high-quality Chinese
corpora. After analyzing the POS tag-
ging of multi-category words in large-
scale corpora, we propose a novel con-
sistency check method of POS tagging
in this paper. Our method builds a
vector model of the context of multi-
category words, and uses the k-NN al-
gorithm to classify context vectors con-
structed from POS tagging sequences
and judge their consistency. The ex-
perimental results indicate that the pro-
posed method is feasible and effective.
