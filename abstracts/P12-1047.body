Learning for sentence re-writing is a funda-
mental task in natural language processing and
information retrieval. In this paper, we pro-
pose a new class of kernel functions, referred
to as string re-writing kernel, to address the
problem. A string re-writing kernel measures
the similarity between two pairs of strings,
each pair representing re-writing of a string.
It can capture the lexical and structural sim-
ilarity between two pairs of sentences with-
out the need of constructing syntactic trees.
We further propose an instance of string re-
writing kernel which can be computed effi-
ciently. Experimental results on benchmark
datasets show that our method can achieve bet-
ter results than state-of-the-art methods on two
sentence re-writing learning tasks: paraphrase
identification and recognizing textual entail-
ment.
