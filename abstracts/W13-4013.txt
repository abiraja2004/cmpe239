This paper presents a practical
methodology for the integration of
reinforcement learning during the
design of a Spoken Dialogue System
(SDS). It proposes a method that
enables SDS designers to know, in
advance, the number of dialogues that
their system will need in order to learn
the value of each state-action couple.
We ask the designer to provide a user
model in a simple way. Then, we run
simulations with this model and we
compute confidence intervals for the
mean of the expected return of the
state-action couples.
