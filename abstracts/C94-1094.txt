. The Text Encoding Initiative (TEl) is an 
international project established in 1988 to develop 
guidelines for the preparation and interchange of 
electronic texts for research, and to satisfy a broad range 
of uses by the language industries more generally. The 
need for standardized encoding practices has become 
inxreasingly critical as the need to use and, most 
importantly, reuse vast amounts of electronic text has 
dramatically increased for both research and industry, in 
particular for natural language processing. In January 
1994, the TEl isstled its Guidelines for the Fmcoding and 
hiterehange of Machine-Readable Texts, which provide 
standardized encoding conventions for a large range of 
text types and features relevant for a broad range of 
applications.
