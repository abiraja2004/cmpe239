This paper presents a method and implemen-
tation of parsing German V2 word order by
means of constraints that reside in lexical
heads. It first describes the design of the
underlying parsing engine: the head-corner
chart parsing that incorporates a procedure
that dynamically enforces word order con-
straints. While the parser could potentially
generate all the permutations of terminal sym-
bols, constraint checking is conducted locally
in an efficient manner. The paper then shows
how this parser can adequately cover a variety
of V2 word order patterns with sets of lexi-
cally encoded constraints, including non-local
preposing of an embedded argument or an ad-
verbial.
