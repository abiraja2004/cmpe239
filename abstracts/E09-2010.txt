The subject of this demonstration is natu-
ral language interaction, focusing on adap-
tivity and profiling of the dialogue man-
agement and the generated output (text
and speech). These are demonstrated in
a museum guide use-case, operating in a
simulated environment. The main techni-
cal innovations presented are the profiling
model, the dialogue and action manage-
ment system, and the text generation and
speech synthesis systems.
