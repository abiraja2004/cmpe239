We consider the impact Active Learning
(AL) has on effective and efficient text cor-
pus annotation, and report on reduction rates
for annotation efforts ranging up until 72%.
We also address the issue whether a corpus
annotated by means of AL ? using a particu-
lar classifier and a particular feature set ? can
be re-used to train classifiers different from
the ones employed by AL, supplying alter-
native feature sets as well. We, finally, report
on our experience with the AL paradigm un-
der real-world conditions, i.e., the annota-
tion of large-scale document corpora for the
life sciences.
