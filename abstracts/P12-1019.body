Long-span features, such as syntax, can im-
prove language models for tasks such as
speech recognition and machine translation.
However, these language models can be dif-
ficult to use in practice because of the time
required to generate features for rescoring a
large hypothesis set. In this work, we pro-
pose substructure sharing, which saves dupli-
cate work in processing hypothesis sets with
redundant hypothesis structures. We apply
substructure sharing to a dependency parser
and part of speech tagger to obtain significant
speedups, and further improve the accuracy
of these tools through up-training. When us-
ing these improved tools in a language model
for speech recognition, we obtain significant
speed improvements with bothN -best and hill
climbing rescoring, and show that up-training
leads to WER reduction.
