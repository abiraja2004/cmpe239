In this paper, we described our Chinese
word segmentation system for the 3rd
SIGHAN Chinese Language Processing
Bakeoff Word Segmentation Task. Our
system deal with the Chinese character se-
quence by using the Maximum Entropy
model, which is fully automatically gen-
erated from the training data by analyz-
ing the character sequences from the train-
ing corpus. We analyze its performance
on both closed and open tracks on Mi-
crosoft Research (MSRA) and University
of Pennsylvania and University of Col-
orado (UPUC) corpus. It is shown that we
can get the results just acceptable without
using dictionary. The conclusion is also
presented.
