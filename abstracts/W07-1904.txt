In this paper we describe an experiment
aimed at determining the most effective and
natural orientation of a virtual guide that
gives route directions in a 3D virtual envi-
ronment. We hypothesized that, due to the
presence of mirrored gestures, having the
route provider directly face the route seeker
would result in a less effective and less nat-
ural route description than having the route
provider adapt his orientation to that of the
route seeker. To compare the effectiveness
of the different orientations, after having re-
ceived a route description the participants in
our experiment had to ?virtually? traverse the
route using prerecorded route segments. The
results showed no difference in effectiveness
between the two orientations, but suggested
that the orientation where the speaker di-
rectly faces the route seeker is more natural.
