Low interannotator agreement (IAA) is a
well-known issue in manual semantic tag-
ging (sense tagging). IAA correlates with
the granularity of word senses and they
both correlate with the amount of informa-
tion they give as well as with its reliability.
We compare different approaches to seman-
tic tagging in WordNet, FrameNet, Prop-
Bank and OntoNotes with a small tagged
data sample based on the Corpus Pattern
Analysis to present the reliable information
gain (RG), a measure used to optimize the
semantic granularity of a sense inventory
with respect to its reliability indicated by
the IAA in the given data set. RG can also
be used as feedback for lexicographers, and
as a supporting component of automatic se-
mantic classifiers, especially when dealing
with a very fine-grained set of semantic cat-
egories.
