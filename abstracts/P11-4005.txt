We introduce a new method for learning to 
detect grammatical errors in learner?s writ-
ing and provide suggestions. The method 
involves parsing a reference corpus and 
inferring grammar patterns in the form of a 
sequence of content  words, function words, 
and parts-of-speech (e.g., ?play ~ role in 
Ving? and ?look forward to  Ving?). At run-
time, the given passage submitted by the 
learner is matched using an extended 
Levenshtein algorithm against  the set  of 
pattern rules in order to detect  errors and 
provide suggestions. We present a proto-
type implementation of the proposed 
method, EdIt, that  can handle a broad range 
of errors. Promising results are illustrated 
with three common types of errors in non-
native writing.
