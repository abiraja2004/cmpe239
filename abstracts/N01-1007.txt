We present two methods for learning the struc-
ture of personal names from unlabeled data.
The rst simply uses a few implicit constraints
governing this structure to gain a toehold on the
problem | e.g., descriptors come before rst
names, which come before middle names, etc.
The second model also uses possible coreference
information. We found that coreference con-
straints on names improve the performance of
the model from 92.6% to 97.0%. We are in-
terested in this problem in its own right, but
also as a possible way to improve named entity
recognition (by recognizing the structure of dif-
ferent kinds of names) and as a way to improve
noun-phrase coreference determination.
