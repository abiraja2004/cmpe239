We approached the temporal relation identi-
fication tasks of TempEval 2007 as pair-wise
classification tasks. We introduced a va-
riety of syntactically and semantically mo-
tivated features, including temporal-logic-
based features derived from running our
Task B system on the Task A and C data.
We trained support vector machine models
and achieved the second highest accuracies
on the tasks: 61% on Task A, 75% on Task B
and 54% on Task C.
