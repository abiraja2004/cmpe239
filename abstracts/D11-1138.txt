We present an online learning algorithm for
training parsers which allows for the inclusion
of multiple objective functions. The primary
example is the extension of a standard su-
pervised parsing objective function with addi-
tional loss-functions, either based on intrinsic
parsing quality or task-specific extrinsic mea-
sures of quality. Our empirical results show
how this approach performs for two depen-
dency parsing algorithms (graph-based and
transition-based parsing) and how it achieves
increased performance on multiple target tasks
including reordering for machine translation
and parser adaptation.
