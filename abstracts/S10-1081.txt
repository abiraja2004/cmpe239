The Duluth-WSI systems in SemEval-2
built word co?occurrence matrices from
the task test data to create a second order
co?occurrence representation of those test
instances. The senses of words were in-
duced by clustering these instances, where
the number of clusters was automatically
predicted. The Duluth-Mix system was a
variation of WSI that used the combina-
tion of training and test data to create the
co-occurrence matrix. The Duluth-R sys-
tem was a series of random baselines.
