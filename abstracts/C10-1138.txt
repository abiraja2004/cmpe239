In this paper we investigate the challenges
of applying statistical machine translation
to meeting conversations, with a particu-
lar view towards analyzing the importance
of modeling contextual factors such as the
larger discourse context and topic/domain
information on translation performance.
We describe the collection of a small cor-
pus of parallel meeting data, the develop-
ment of a statistical machine translation
system in the absence of genre-matched
training data, and we present a quantita-
tive analysis of translation errors result-
ing from the lack of contextual modeling
inherent in standard statistical machine
translation systems. Finally, we demon-
strate how the largest source of translation
errors (lack of topic/domain knowledge)
can be addressed by applying document-
level, unsupervised word sense disam-
biguation, resulting in performance im-
provements over the baseline system.
