Adaptor grammars are a framework for
expressing and performing inference over
a variety of non-parametric linguistic
models. These models currently provide
state-of-the-art performance on unsuper-
vised word segmentation from phonemic
representations of child-directed unseg-
mented English utterances. This paper in-
vestigates the applicability of these mod-
els to unsupervised word segmentation of
Mandarin. We investigate a wide vari-
ety of different segmentation models, and
show that the best segmentation accuracy
is obtained frommodels that capture inter-
word ?collocational? dependencies. Sur-
prisingly, enhancing the models to exploit
syllable structure regularities and to cap-
ture tone information does improve over-
all word segmentation accuracy, perhaps
because the information these elements
convey is redundant when compared to the
inter-word dependencies.
