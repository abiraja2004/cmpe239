We analyze models for semantic role
assignment by defining a meta-model
that abstracts over features and learning
paradigms. This meta-model is based on
the concept of role confusability, is de-
fined in information-theoretic terms, and
predicts that roles realized by less specific
grammatical functions are more difficult
to assign. We find that confusability is
strongly correlated with the performance
of classifiers based on syntactic features,
but not for classifiers including semantic
features. This indicates that syntactic fea-
tures approximate a description of gram-
matical functions, and that semantic fea-
tures provide an independent second view
on the data.
