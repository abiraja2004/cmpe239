 
We describe a highly interactive system for 
bidirectional, broad-coverage spoken lan-
guage communication in the healthcare area. 
The paper briefly reviews the system's inter-
active foundations, and then goes on to dis-
cuss in greater depth our Translation 
Shortcuts facility, which minimizes the need 
for interactive verification of sentences after 
they have been vetted. This facility also con-
siderably speeds throughput while maintain-
ing accuracy, and allows use by minimally 
literate patients for whom any mode of text 
entry might be difficult.
