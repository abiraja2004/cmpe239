 
Literal movement grammars (LMGs) pro- 
vide a general account of extraposition phe- 
nomena through an attribute mechanism al- 
lowing top-down displacement of syntacti- 
cal information. LMGs provide a simple 
and efficient reatment of complex linguistic 
phenomena such as cross-serial dependen- 
cies in German and Dutch--separating the 
treatment of natural anguage into a parsing 
phase closely resembling traditional context- 
free treatment, and a disambiguation phase 
which can be carried out using matching, as 
opposed to full unification employed in most 
current grammar formalisms of linguistical 
relevance.
