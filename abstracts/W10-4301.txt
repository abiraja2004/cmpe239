 
We present a first step towards a model of 
speech generation for incremental dialogue 
systems. The model allows a dialogue system 
to incrementally interpret spoken input, while 
simultaneously planning, realising and self-
monitoring the system response. The model 
has been implemented in a general dialogue 
system framework. Using this framework, we 
have implemented a specific application and 
tested it in a Wizard-of-Oz setting, comparing 
it with a non-incremental version of the same 
system. The results show that the incremental 
version, while producing longer utterances, 
has a shorter response time and is perceived 
as more efficient by the users.
