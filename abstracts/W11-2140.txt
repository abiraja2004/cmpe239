This paper presents the system we developed
for the 2011 WMT Haitian Creole?English
SMS featured translation task. Applying stan-
dard statistical machine translation methods to
noisy real-world SMS data in a low-density
language setting such as Haitian Creole poses
a unique set of challenges, which we attempt
to address in this work. Along with techniques
to better exploit the limited available train-
ing data, we explore the benefits of several
methods for alleviating the additional noise
inherent in the SMS and transforming it to
better suite the assumptions of our hierarchi-
cal phrase-based model system. We show
that these methods lead to significant improve-
ments in BLEU score over the baseline.
