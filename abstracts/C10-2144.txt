We present a general methodology for ex-
tracting multi-word expressions (of vari-
ous types), along with their translations,
from small parallel corpora. We auto-
matically align the parallel corpus and fo-
cus on misalignments; these typically in-
dicate expressions in the source language
that are translated to the target in a non-
compositional way. We then use a large
monolingual corpus to rank and filter the
results. Evaluation of the quality of the ex-
traction algorithm reveals significant im-
provements over na??ve alignment-based
methods. External evaluation shows an
improvement in the performance of ma-
chine translation that uses the extracted
dictionary.
