 
The lexical acquisition system presented in this pa- 
per incrementally updates linguistic properties of un- 
known words inferred from their surrounding con- 
text by parsing sentences with an HPSG grammar 
for German. We employ a gradual, information- 
based concept of "unknownness" providing a uni- 
form treatment for the range of completely known to 
maximally unknown lexical entries. "Unknown" in- 
formation is viewed as revisable information, which 
is either generalizable or specializable. Updating 
takes place after parsing, which only requires amod- 
ified lexical lookup. Revisable pieces of informa- 
tion are identified by grammar-specified declarations 
wlfich provide access paths into the parse feature 
structure. The updating mechanism revises the cor- 
responding places in the lexical feature structures iff 
the context actually provides new information. For 
revising generalizable inlbrmation, type union is re- 
quired. A worked-out example demonstrates the in- 
ferential capacity of our implemented system.
