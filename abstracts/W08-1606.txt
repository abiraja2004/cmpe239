In this paper, we present the explanation struc-
ture of procedural texts, that supports and moti-
vates the goal-instruction structure. We focus in
particular on arguments, and show how arguments
of type warnings and advices can be extracted. Fi-
nally, we show how a domain dependent know-
how textual knowledge base can be constructed
and queried.
