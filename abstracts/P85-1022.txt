 
In the new Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar 
(HPSG) language processing system that is currently under 
development at Hewlett-Packard Laboratories, the 
Montagovian semantics of the earlier GPSG system (see 
\[Gawron et al 19821) is replaced by a radically different 
approach with a number of distinct advantages. In place 
of the lambda calculus and standard first-order logic, our 
medium of conceptual representation is a new logical for- 
realism called NFLT (Neo-Fregean Language of Thought); 
compositional semantics is effected, not by schematic 
lambda expressions, but by LISP procedures that operate 
on NFLT expressions to produce new expressions. NFLT 
has a number of features that make it well-suited {'or nat- 
ural language translations, including predicates of variable 
arity in which explicitly marked situational roles supercede 
order-coded argument positions, sortally restricted quan- 
tification, a compositional (but nonextensional) semantics 
that handles causal contexts, and a princip\[ed conceptual 
raising mechanism that we expect o lead to a computation- 
ally tractable account of propositional attitudes. The use 
of semantically compositional LiSP procedures in place of 
lambda-schemas llows us to produce fully reduced trans- 
lations on the fly, with no need for post-processing. This 
approach should simplify the task of using semantic infor- 
mation (such as sortal incompatibilities) to eliminate bad 
parse paths.
