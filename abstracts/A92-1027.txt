 In the rest of this section we will look at some of the 
We present an efficient algorithm for chart-based 
phrase structure parsing of natural anguage that is tai- 
lored to the problem of extracting specific information 
from unrestricted texts where many of the words are un- 
known and much of the text is irrelevant to the task. 
The parser gains algorithmic efficiency through areduc- 
tion of its search space. As each new edge is added to 
the chart, the algorithm checks only the topmost of the 
edges adjacent to it, rather than all such edges as in con- 
ventional treatments. The resulting spanning edges are 
insured to be the correct ones by carefully controlling 
the order in which edges are introduced so that every 
final constituent covers the longest possible span. This 
is facilitated through the use of phrase boundary heuris- 
tics based on the placement of function words, and by 
heuristic rules that permit certain kinds of phrases to be 
deduced espite the presence of unknown words. A fur- 
ther reduction in the search space is achieved by using 
semantic rather than syntactic ategories on the terminal 
and nonterminal edges, thereby reducing the amount of 
ambiguity and thus the number of edges, since only 
edges with a valid semantic interpretation are ever intro- 
daced.
