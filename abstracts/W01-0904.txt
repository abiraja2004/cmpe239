In this paper we discuss the need for
corpora with a variety of annotations
to provide suitable resources to evalu-
ate different Natural Language Process-
ing systems and to compare them. A
supervised machine learning technique
is presented for translating corpora be-
tween syntactic formalisms and is ap-
plied to the task of translating the Penn
Treebank annotation into a Categorial
Grammar annotation. It is compared
with a current alternative approach and
results indicate annotation of broader
coverage using a more compact gram-
mar.
