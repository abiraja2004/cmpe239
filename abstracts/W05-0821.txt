Statistical machine translation systems
use a combination of one or more transla-
tion models and a language model. While
there is a significant body of research ad-
dressing the improvement of translation
models, the problem of optimizing lan-
guage models for a specific translation
task has not received much attention. Typ-
ically, standard word trigram models are
used as an out-of-the-box component in
a statistical machine translation system.
In this paper we apply language model-
ing techniques that have proved benefi-
cial in automatic speech recognition to the
ACL05 machine translation shared data
task and demonstrate improvements over a
baseline system with a standard language
model.
