Discovering the significant relations embedded in
documents would be very useful not only for infor-
mation retrieval but also for question answering and
summarization. Prior methods for relation discov-
ery, however, needed large annotated corpora which
cost a great deal of time and effort. We propose
an unsupervised method for relation discovery from
large corpora. The key idea is clustering pairs of
named entities according to the similarity of con-
text words intervening between the named entities.
Our experiments using one year of newspapers re-
veals not only that the relations among named enti-
ties could be detected with high recall and precision,
but also that appropriate labels could be automati-
cally provided for the relations.
