 
This paper briefly describes our system in 
The Fourth SIGHAN Bakeoff. 
Discriminative models including maximum 
entropy model and conditional random 
fields are utilized in Chinese word 
segmentation and named entity recognition 
with different tag sets and features. 
Transformation-based learning model is 
used in part-of-speech tagging. Evaluation 
shows that our system achieves the 
F-scores: 92.64% and 92.73% in NCC 
Word Segmentation close and open tests, 
89.11% in MSRA name entity recognition 
open test, 91.13% and 91.97% in PKU 
part-of-speech tagging close and open tests. 
All the results get medium performances 
on the bakeoff tracks.
