Abduction is a method for finding the best explanation for observations. Arguably
the most advanced approach to abduction, especially for natural language processing, is
weighted abduction, which uses logical formulas with costs to guide inference. But it
has no clear probabilistic semantics. In this paper we propose an approach that imple-
ments weighted abduction in Markov logic, which uses weighted first-order formulas to
represent probabilistic knowledge, pointing toward a sound probabilistic semantics for
weighted abduction. Application to a series of challenge problems shows the power and
coverage of our approach.
