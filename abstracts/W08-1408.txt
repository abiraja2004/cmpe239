 
The Europe Media Monitor system 
(EMM) gathers and aggregates an aver-
age of 50,000 newspaper articles per day 
in over 40 languages. To manage the in-
formation overflow, it was decided to 
group similar articles per day and per 
language into clusters and to link daily 
clusters over time into stories. A story 
automatically comes into existence when 
related groups of articles occur within a 
7-day window. While cross-lingual links 
across 19 languages for individual news 
clusters have been displayed since 2004 
as part of a freely accessible online appli-
cation (http://press.jrc.it/NewsExplorer), 
the newest development is work on link-
ing entire stories across languages. The 
evaluation of the monolingual aggrega-
tion of historical clusters into stories and 
of the linking of stories across languages 
yielded mostly satisfying results.
