Many approaches for named entity recogni-
tion rely on dictionaries gathered from cu-
rated databases (such as Entrez Gene for
gene names.) Strategies for matching entries
in a dictionary against arbitrary text use ei-
ther inexact string matching that allows for
known deviations, dictionaries enriched ac-
cording to some observed rules, or a com-
bination of both. Such refined dictionar-
ies cover potential structural, lexical, ortho-
graphical, or morphological variations. In
this paper, we present an approach to au-
tomatically analyze dictionaries to discover
how names are composed and which varia-
tions typically occur. This knowledge can
be constructed by looking at single entries
(names and synonyms for one gene), and
then be transferred to entries that show simi-
lar patterns in one or more synonyms. For
instance, knowledge about words that are
frequently missing in (or added to) a name
(?antigen?, ?protein?, ?human?) could au-
tomatically be extracted from dictionaries.
This paper should be seen as a vision paper,
though we implemented most of the ideas
presented and show results for the task of
gene name recognition. The automatically
extracted name composition rules can eas-
ily be included in existing approaches, and
provide valuable insights into the biomedi-
cal sub-language.
