This paper proposes the usage of variant
corpora, i.e., parallel text corpora that are
equal in meaning but use different ways
to express content, in order to improve
corpus-based machine translation. The us-
age of multiple training corpora of the
same content with different sources results
in variant models that focus on specific
linguistic phenomena covered by the re-
spective corpus. The proposed method
applies each variant model separately re-
sulting in multiple translation hypotheses
which are selectively combined accord-
ing to statistical models. The proposed
method outperforms the conventional ap-
proach of merging all variants by reducing
translation ambiguities and exploiting the
strengths of each variant model.
