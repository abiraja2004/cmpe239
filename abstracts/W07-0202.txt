This paper introduces multi-level associa-
tion graphs (MLAGs), a new graph-based
framework for information retrieval (IR).
The goal of that framework is twofold:
First, it is meant to be a meta model of
IR, i.e. it subsumes various IR models
under one common representation. Sec-
ond, it allows to model different forms of
search, such as feedback, associative re-
trieval and browsing at the same time. It
is shown how the new integrated model
gives insights and stimulates new ideas for
IR algorithms. One of these new ideas is
presented and evaluated, yielding promis-
ing experimental results.
