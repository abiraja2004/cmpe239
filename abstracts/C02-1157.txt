In this paper, we present a parser based on a stochas-
tic structured language model (SLM) with a exible
history reference mechanism. An SLM is an alterna-
tive to an n-gram model as a language model for a
speech recognizer. The advantage of an SLM against
an n-gram model is the ability to return the struc-
ture of a given sentence. Thus SLMs are expected
to play an important part in spoken language under-
standing systems. The current SLMs refer to a xed
part of the history for prediction just like an n-gram
model. We introduce a exible history reference
mechanism called an ACT (arboreal context tree;
an extension of the context tree to tree-shaped his-
tories) and describe a parser based on an SLM with
ACTs. In the experiment, we built an SLM-based
parser with a xed history and one with ACTs, and
compared their parsing accuracies. The accuracy of
our parser was 92.8%, which was higher than that
for the parser with the xed history (89.8%). This
result shows that the exible history reference mech-
anism improves the parsing ability of an SLM, which
has great importance for language understanding.
