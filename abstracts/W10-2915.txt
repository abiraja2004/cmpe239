Probabilistic phrase-based synchronous
grammars are now considered promis-
ing devices for statistical machine transla-
tion because they can express reordering
phenomena between pairs of languages.
Learning these hierarchical, probabilistic
devices from parallel corpora constitutes a
major challenge, because of multiple la-
tent model variables as well as the risk
of data overfitting. This paper presents
an effective method for learning a family
of particular interest to MT, binary Syn-
chronous Context-Free Grammars with in-
verted/monotone orientation (a.k.a. Bi-
nary ITG). A second contribution con-
cerns devising a lexicalized phrase re-
ordering mechanism that has complimen-
tary strengths to Chiang?s model. The
latter conditions reordering decisions on
the surrounding lexical context of phrases,
whereas our mechanism works with the
lexical content of phrase pairs (akin to
standard phrase-based systems). Surpris-
ingly, our experiments on French-English
data show that our learning method ap-
plied to far simpler models exhibits per-
formance indistinguishable from the Hiero
system.
