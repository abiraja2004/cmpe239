. The current work applies Conditional Random Fields to the problem 
of temporal reference mapping from Chinese text to English text. The learning 
algorithm utilizes a moderate number of linguistic features that are easy and in-
expensive to obtain. We train a tense classifier upon a small amount of manu-
ally labeled data. The evaluation results are promising according to standard 
measures as well as in comparison with a pilot tense annotation experiment in-
volving human judges. Our study exhibits potential value for full-scale machine 
translation systems and other natural language processing tasks in a cross-
lingual scenario.
