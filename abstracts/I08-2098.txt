 
This paper presents a method to enhance a 
Chinese parser in parsing conjunctive 
structures. Long conjunctive structures 
cause long-distance dependencies and tre-
mendous syntactic ambiguities. Pure syn-
tactic approaches hardly can determine 
boundaries of conjunctive phrases properly. 
In this paper, we propose a divide-and-
conquer approach which overcomes the dif-
ficulty of data-sparseness of the training 
data and uses both syntactic symmetry and 
semantic reasonableness to evaluate am-
biguous conjunctive structures. In compar-
ing with the performances of the PCFG 
parser without using the divide-and-
conquer approach, the precision of the con-
junctive boundary detection is improved 
from 53.47% to 83.17%, and the bracketing 
f-score of sentences with conjunctive struc-
tures is raised up about 11 %.
