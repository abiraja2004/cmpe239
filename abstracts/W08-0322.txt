The novel kernel regression model for SMT
only demonstrated encouraging results on
small-scale toy data sets in previous works due
to the complexities of kernel methods. It is
the first time results based on the real-world
data from the shared translation task will be
reported at ACL 2008 Workshop on Statisti-
cal Machine Translation. This paper presents
the key modules of our system, including the
kernel ridge regression model, retrieval-based
sparse approximation, the decoding algorithm,
as well as language modeling issues under this
framework.
