We constructed a system for answering non-
factoid Japanese questions. We used var-
ious methods of passage retrieval for the
system. We extracted paragraphs based on
terms from an input question and output
them as the preferred answers. We classified
the non-factoid questions into six categories.
We used a particular method for each cate-
gory. For example, we increased the scores
of paragraphs including the word ?reason?
for questions including the word ?why.? We
participated at NTCIR-6 QAC-4, where our
system obtained the most correct answers
out of all the eight participating teams. The
rate of accuracy was 0.77, which indicates
that our methods were effective.
