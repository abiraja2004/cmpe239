 
In this article, we present MetaMorpho, a rule 
based machine translation system that was 
used to create MorphoLogic?s submission to 
the WMT08 shared Hungarian to English 
translation task. The architecture of Meta-
Morpho does not fit easily into traditional 
categories of rule based systems: the building 
blocks of its grammar are pairs of rules that 
describe source and target language structures 
in a parallel fashion and translated structures 
are created while parsing the input.
