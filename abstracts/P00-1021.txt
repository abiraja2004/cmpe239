We examine the benets of using multi-
ple agents to produce explanations. In
particular, we identify the ability to con-
struct prior plans as a key issue con-
straining the eectiveness of a single-
agent approach. We describe an imple-
mented system that uses multiple agents
to tackle a problem for which prior plan-
ning is particularly impractical: real-
time soccer commentary. Our commen-
tary system demonstrates a number of
the advantages of decomposing an expla-
nation task among several agents. Most
notably, it shows how individual agents
can benet from following dierent dis-
course strategies. Further, it illustrates
that discourse issues such as controlling
interruption, abbreviation, and main-
taining consistency can also be decom-
posed: rather than considering them at
the single level of one linear explana-
tion they can also be tackled separately
within each individual agent. We evalu-
ate our system's output, and show that
it closely compares to the speaking pat-
terns of a human commentary team.
