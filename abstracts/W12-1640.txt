With the aim of investigating how humans un-
derstand each other through language and ges-
tures, this paper focuses on how people un-
derstand incomplete sentences. We trained a
system based on interrupted but resumed sen-
tences, in order to find plausible completions
for incomplete sentences. Our promising re-
sults are based on multi-modal features.
