We will demonstrate a novel graphical inter-
face for correcting search errors in the out-
put of a speech recognizer. This interface
allows the user to visualize the word lattice
by ?pulling apart? regions of the hypothesis
to reveal a cloud of words simlar to the ?tag
clouds? popular in many Web applications.
This interface is potentially useful for dicta-
tion on portable touchscreen devices such as
the Nokia N800 and other mobile Internet de-
vices.
