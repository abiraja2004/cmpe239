The FrameNet project has developed a
lexical knowledge base providing a unique
level of detail as to the the possible syn-
tactic realizations of the specific seman-
tic roles evoked by each predicator, for
roughly 7,000 lexical units, on the ba-
sis of annotating more than 100,000 ex-
ample sentences extracted from corpora.
An interim version of the FrameNet data
was released in October, 2002 and is be-
ing widely used. A new, more portable
version of the FrameNet software is also
being made available to researchers else-
where, including the Spanish FrameNet
project.
This demo and poster will briefly ex-
plain the principles of Frame Semantics
and demonstrate the new unified tools for
lexicon building and annotation and also
FrameSQL, a search tool for finding pat-
terns in annotated sentences. We will dis-
cuss the content and format of the data re-
leases and how the software and data can
be used by other NLP researchers.
