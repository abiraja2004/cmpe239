 
This paper presents Hedge Trimmer, a HEaDline 
GEneration system that creates a headline for a newspa-
per story using linguistically-motivated heuristics to 
guide the choice of a potential headline.  We present 
feasibility tests used to establish the validity of an ap-
proach that constructs a headline by selecting words in 
order from a story.  In addition, we describe experimen-
tal results that demonstrate the effectiveness of our lin-
guistically-motivated approach over a HMM-based 
model, using both human evaluation and automatic met-
rics for comparing the two approaches.
