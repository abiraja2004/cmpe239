We present a new approach to learning a
semantic parser (a system that maps natu-
ral language sentences into logical form).
Unlike previous methods, it exploits an ex-
isting syntactic parser to produce disam-
biguated parse trees that drive the compo-
sitional semantic interpretation. The re-
sulting system produces improved results
on standard corpora on natural language
interfaces for database querying and sim-
ulated robot control.
