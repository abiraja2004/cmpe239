The computation of selectional prefer-
ences, the admissible argument values for
a relation, is a well-known NLP task with
broad applicability. We present LDA-SP,
which utilizes LinkLDA (Erosheva et al,
2004) to model selectional preferences.
By simultaneously inferring latent top-
ics and topic distributions over relations,
LDA-SP combines the benefits of pre-
vious approaches: like traditional class-
based approaches, it produces human-
interpretable classes describing each re-
lation?s preferences, but it is competitive
with non-class-based methods in predic-
tive power.
We compare LDA-SP to several state-of-
the-art methods achieving an 85% increase
in recall at 0.9 precision over mutual in-
formation (Erk, 2007). We also eval-
uate LDA-SP?s effectiveness at filtering
improper applications of inference rules,
where we show substantial improvement
over Pantel et al?s system (Pantel et al,
2007).
