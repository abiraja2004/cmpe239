We present here VISUSYN, a prototype we
developed in order to study meaning con-
struction. This software implements the
model of dynamic construction of meaning
proposed by Victorri and Fuchs (1996). It
allows a semantic visualization that can be
used to compute the meaning of a lexical
unit in a given context
