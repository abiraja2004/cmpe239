Consumers are often forced to wade
through many on-line reviews in
order to make an informed prod-
uct choice. This paper introduces
OPINE, an unsupervised information-
extraction system which mines re-
views in order to build a model of im-
portant product features, their evalu-
ation by reviewers, and their relative
quality across products.
Compared to previous work, OPINE
achieves 22% higher precision (with
only 3% lower recall) on the feature
extraction task. OPINE?s novel use of
relaxation labeling for finding the se-
mantic orientation of words in con-
text leads to strong performance on
the tasks of finding opinion phrases
and their polarity.
