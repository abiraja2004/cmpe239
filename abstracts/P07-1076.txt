 
Many errors produced by unsupervised and 
semi-supervised relation extraction (RE) 
systems occur because of wrong recogni-
tion of entities that participate in the rela-
tions. This is especially true for systems 
that do not use separate named-entity rec-
ognition components, instead relying on 
general-purpose shallow parsing. Such sys-
tems have greater applicability, because 
they are able to extract relations that 
contain attributes of unknown types. 
However, this generality comes with the 
cost in accuracy. In this paper we show 
how to use corpus statistics to validate and 
correct the arguments of extracted relation 
instances, improving the overall RE 
performance. We test the methods on 
SRES ? a self-supervised Web relation 
extraction system. We also compare the 
performance of corpus-based methods to 
the performance of validation and correc-
tion methods based on supervised NER 
components.
