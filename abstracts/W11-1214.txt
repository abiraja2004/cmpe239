In this paper we investigate automatic data-
text alignment, i.e. the task of automatically
aligning data records with textual descrip-
tions, such that data tokens are aligned with
the word strings that describe them. Our meth-
ods make use of log likelihood ratios to esti-
mate the strength of association between data
tokens and text tokens. We investigate data-
text alignment at the document level and at
the sentence level, reporting results for sev-
eral methodological variants as well as base-
lines. We find that log likelihood ratios pro-
vide a strong basis for predicting data-text
alignment.
