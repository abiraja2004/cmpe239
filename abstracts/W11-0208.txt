Named Entity Recognition (NER) is an im-
portant first step for BioNLP tasks, e.g., gene
normalization and event extraction. Employ-
ing supervised machine learning techniques
for achieving high performance recent NER
systems require a manually annotated corpus
in which every mention of the desired seman-
tic types in a text is annotated. However, great
amounts of human effort is necessary to build
and maintain an annotated corpus. This study
explores a method to build a high-performance
NER without a manually annotated corpus,
but using a comprehensible lexical database
that stores numerous expressions of seman-
tic types and with huge amount of unanno-
tated texts. We underscore the effectiveness of
our approach by comparing the performance
of NERs trained on an automatically acquired
training data and on a manually annotated cor-
pus.
