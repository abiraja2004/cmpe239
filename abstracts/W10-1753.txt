We describe DCU?s LFG dependency-
based metric submitted to the shared eval-
uation task of WMT-MetricsMATR 2010.
The metric is built on the LFG F-structure-
based approach presented in (Owczarzak
et al, 2007). We explore the following
improvements on the original metric: 1)
we replace the in-house LFG parser with
an open source dependency parser that
directly parses strings into LFG depen-
dencies; 2) we add a stemming module
and unigram paraphrases to strengthen the
aligner; 3) we introduce a chunk penalty
following the practice of METEOR to re-
ward continuous matches; and 4) we intro-
duce and tune parameters to maximize the
correlation with human judgement. Exper-
iments show that these enhancements im-
prove the dependency-based metric?s cor-
relation with human judgement.
