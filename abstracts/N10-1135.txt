We describe a cross-lingual method for the in-
duction of selectional preferences for resource-
poor languages, where no accurate monolin-
gual models are available. The method uses
bilingual vector spaces to ?translate? foreign
language predicate-argument structures into
a resource-rich language like English. The
only prerequisite for constructing the bilin-
gual vector space is a large unparsed corpus
in the resource-poor language, although the
model can profit from (even noisy) syntactic
knowledge. Our experiments show that the
cross-lingual predictions correlate well with
human ratings, clearly outperforming monolin-
gual baseline models.
