Scientific papers revolve around cita-
tions, and for many discourse level
tasks one needs to know whose work
is being talked about at any point in
the discourse. In this paper, we in-
troduce the scientific attribution task,
which links different linguistic expres-
sions to citations. We discuss the
suitability of different evaluation met-
rics and evaluate our classification ap-
proach to deciding attribution both in-
trinsically and in an extrinsic evalua-
tion where information about scientific
attribution is shown to improve per-
formance on Argumentative Zoning, a
rhetorical classification task.
