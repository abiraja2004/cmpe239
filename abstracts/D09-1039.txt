In this work we present a novel technique
to rescore fragments in the Data-Oriented
Translation model based on their contri-
bution to translation accuracy. We de-
scribe three new rescoring methods, and
present the initial results of a pilot experi-
ment on a small subset of the Europarl cor-
pus. This work is a proof-of-concept, and
is the first step in directly optimizing trans-
lation decisions solely on the hypothesized
accuracy of potential translations resulting
from those decisions.
