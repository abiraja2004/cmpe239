To facilitate the application of semantics in
statistical machine translation, we propose
a broad-coverage predicate-argument struc-
ture mapping technique using automated re-
sources. Our approach utilizes automatic
syntactic and semantic parsers to gener-
ate Chinese-English predicate-argument struc-
tures. The system produced a many-to-many
argument mapping for all PropBank argu-
ment types by computing argument similarity
based on automatic word alignment, achieving
80.5% F-score on numbered argument map-
ping and 64.6% F-score on all arguments. By
measuring predicate-argument structure sim-
ilarity based on the argument mapping, and
formulating the predicate-argument structure
mapping problem as a linear-assignment prob-
lem, the system achieved 84.9% F-score us-
ing automatic SRL, only 3.7% F-score lower
than using gold standard SRL. The map-
ping output covered 49.6% of the annotated
Chinese predicates (which contains predicate-
adjectives that often have no parallel annota-
tions in English) and 80.7% of annotated En-
glish predicates, suggesting its potential as a
valuable resource for improving word align-
ment and reranking MT output.
