There are few computational models of sec-
ond language acquisition (SLA). At the same
time, many questions in the field of SLA re-
main unanswered. In particular, SLA patterns
are difficult to study due to the large amount of
variation between human learners. We present
a computational model of second language
construction learning that allows manipulating
specific parameters such as age of onset and
amount of exposure. We use the model to
study general developmental patterns of SLA
and two specific effects sometimes found in
empirical studies: construction priming and a
facilitatory effect of skewed frequencies in the
input. Our simulations replicate the expected
SLA patterns as well as the two effects. Our
model can be used in further studies of various
SLA phenomena.
