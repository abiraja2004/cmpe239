Dzongkha,  the  national  language  of 
Bhutan, is continuous in written form 
and it fails to mark the word boundary. 
Dzongkha word segmentation is one of 
the  fundamental  problems  and  a 
prerequisite  that  needs  to  be  solved 
before  more  advanced  Dzongkha  text 
processing and other natural  language 
processing  tools  can  be  developed. 
This paper presents our initial attempt 
at segmenting Dzongkha sentences into 
words.  The  paper  describes  the 
implementation of Maximal  Matching 
(Dictionary based Approach) followed 
by bigram techniques  (Non-dictionary 
based  Approach)  in  segmenting  the 
Dzongkha  scripts.  Although  the  used 
techniques  are  basic  and  naive,  it 
provides  a  baseline  of  the  Dzongkha 
word  segmentation  task.  Preliminary 
experimental  results  show  percentage 
of  segmentation  accuracy.  However, 
the segmentation accuracy is dependent 
on the  type  of  document  domain  and 
size and quality of the lexicon and the 
corpus. Some of the related issues for 
future directions are also discussed.
Keywords:  Dzongkha  script,  word 
segmentation,  maximal  matching,  bigram 
technique, smoothing technique.
