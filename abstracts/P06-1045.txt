Various methods have been proposed for
automatic synonym acquisition, as syn-
onyms are one of the most fundamen-
tal lexical knowledge. Whereas many
methods are based on contextual clues
of words, little attention has been paid
to what kind of categories of contex-
tual information are useful for the pur-
pose. This study has experimentally inves-
tigated the impact of contextual informa-
tion selection, by extracting three kinds of
word relationships from corpora: depen-
dency, sentence co-occurrence, and prox-
imity. The evaluation result shows that
while dependency and proximity perform
relatively well by themselves, combina-
tion of two or more kinds of contextual in-
formation gives more stable performance.
We?ve further investigated useful selection
of dependency relations and modification
categories, and it is found that modifi-
cation has the greatest contribution, even
greater than the widely adopted subject-
object combination.
