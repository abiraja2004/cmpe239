This paper reports about the development of
a Named Entity Recognition (NER) system
for Bengali using the statistical Conditional
Random Fields (CRFs). The system makes
use of the different contextual information
of the words along with the variety of fea-
tures that are helpful in predicting the var-
ious named entity (NE) classes. A portion
of the partially NE tagged Bengali news cor-
pus, developed from the archive of a lead-
ing Bengali newspaper available in the web,
has been used to develop the system. The
training set consists of 150K words and has
been manually annotated with a NE tagset
of seventeen tags. Experimental results of
the 10-fold cross validation test show the ef-
fectiveness of the proposed CRF based NER
system with an overall average Recall, Pre-
cision and F-Score values of 93.8%, 87.8%
and 90.7%, respectively.
