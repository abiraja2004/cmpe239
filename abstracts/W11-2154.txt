We describe our system for the news com-
mentary translation task of WMT 2011. The
submitted run for the French-English direction
is a combination of two MOSES-based sys-
tems developed at LIG and LIA laboratories.
We report experiments to improve over the
standard phrase-based model using statistical
post-edition, information retrieval methods to
subsample out-of-domain parallel corpora and
ROVER to combine n-best list of hypotheses
output by different systems.
