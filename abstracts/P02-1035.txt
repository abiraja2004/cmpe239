We present a stochastic parsing system
consisting of a Lexical-Functional Gram-
mar (LFG), a constraint-based parser and
a stochastic disambiguation model. We re-
port on the results of applying this sys-
tem to parsing the UPenn Wall Street
Journal (WSJ) treebank. The model com-
bines full and partial parsing techniques
to reach full grammar coverage on unseen
data. The treebank annotations are used
to provide partially labeled data for dis-
criminative statistical estimation using ex-
ponential models. Disambiguation perfor-
mance is evaluated by measuring matches
of predicate-argument relations on two
distinct test sets. On a gold standard of
manually annotated f-structures for a sub-
set of the WSJ treebank, this evaluation
reaches 79% F-score. An evaluation on a
gold standard of dependency relations for
Brown corpus data achieves 76% F-score.
