 
In this paper, we present the proposed me-
thod of participating SIGHAN-2010 Chi-
nese word segmentation bake-off. In this 
year, our focus aims to quick train and test 
the given data. Unlike the most structural 
learning algorithms, such as conditional 
random fields, we design an in-house devel-
opment conditional support vector Markov 
model (CMM) framework. The method is 
very quick to train and also show better per-
formance in accuracy than CRF. To give a 
fair comparison, we compare our method to 
CRF with three additional tasks, namely, 
CoNLL-2000 chunking, SIGHAN-3 Chi-
nese word segmentation. The results were 
encourage and indicated that the proposed 
CMM produces better not only accuracy but 
also training time efficiency. The official re-
sults in SIGHAN-2010 also demonstrates 
that our method perform very well in tradi-
tional Chinese with fine-tuned features set.
