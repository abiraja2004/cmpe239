The automatic analysis and categorization of
web text has witnessed a booming interest due
to the increased text availability of different
formats, content, genre and authorship. We
present a new tool that searches the web and
performs in real-time a) html-free text extrac-
tion, b) classification for thematic content and
c) evaluation of expected reading difficulty.
This tool will be useful to adolescent and adult
low-level reading students who face, among
other challenges, a troubling lack of reading
material for their age, interests and reading
level.
