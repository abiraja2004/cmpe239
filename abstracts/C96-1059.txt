 
In this paper, we define the notion of 
a preventative expression and discuss a 
corpus study of such expressions in in- 
structional text. We discuss our cod- 
ing schema, which takes into account 
both form and function features, and 
present measures of inter-coder reliabil- 
ity for those features. We then discuss 
the correlations that exist between the 
function and the form features.
