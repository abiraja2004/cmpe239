In current dependency parsing models, con-
ventional features (i.e. base features) defined
over surface words and part-of-speech tags
in a relatively high-dimensional feature space
may suffer from the data sparseness problem
and thus exhibit less discriminative power on
unseen data. In this paper, we propose a
novel semi-supervised approach to address-
ing the problem by transforming the base fea-
tures into high-level features (i.e. meta fea-
tures) with the help of a large amount of au-
tomatically parsed data. The meta features are
used together with base features in our final
parser. Our studies indicate that our proposed
approach is very effective in processing un-
seen data and features. Experiments on Chi-
nese and English data sets show that the fi-
nal parser achieves the best-reported accuracy
on the Chinese data and comparable accuracy
with the best known parsers on the English
data.
