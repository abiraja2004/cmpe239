Recent times have seen a tremendous growth
in mobile based data services that allow peo-
ple to use Short Message Service (SMS) to
access these data services. In a multilin-
gual society it is essential that data services
that were developed for a specific language
be made accessible through other local lan-
guages also. In this paper, we present a ser-
vice that allows a user to query a Frequently-
Asked-Questions (FAQ) database built in a lo-
cal language (Hindi) using Noisy SMS En-
glish queries. The inherent noise in the SMS
queries, along with the language mismatch
makes this a challenging problem. We handle
these two problems by formulating the query
similarity over FAQ questions as a combina-
torial search problem where the search space
consists of combinations of dictionary varia-
tions of the noisy query and its top-N transla-
tions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach on a real-life dataset.
