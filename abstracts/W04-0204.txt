 
In this paper we describe the (annotation) tools underly-
ing two automatic techniques to analyse the meaning 
and use of backward causal connectives in large Dutch 
newspaper corpora. With the help of these techniques, 
Latent Semantic Analysis and Thematic Text Analysis, 
the contexts of more than 14,000 connectives were stud-
ied. We will focus here on the methods of analysis and 
on the fairly straightforward (annotation) tools needed 
to perform the semantic analyses, i.e. POS-tagging, lem-
matisation and a thesaurus-like thematic dictionary.
