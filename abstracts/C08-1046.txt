In Japanese dependency parsing, Kudo?s
relative preference-based method (Kudo
and Matsumoto, 2005) outperforms both
deterministic and probabilistic CKY-based
parsing methods. In Kudo?s method, for
each dependent word (or chunk) a log-
linear model estimates relative preference
of all other candidate words (or chunks) for
being as its head. This cannot be consid-
ered in the deterministic parsing methods.
We propose an algorithm based on a tour-
nament model, in which the relative pref-
erences are directly modeled by one-on-
one games in a step-ladder tournament. In
an evaluation experiment with Kyoto Text
Corpus Version 4.0, the proposed method
outperforms previous approaches, includ-
ing the relative preference-based method.
