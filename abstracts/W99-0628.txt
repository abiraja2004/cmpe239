 
In this paper we use various methods for multiple 
neural network combination in tasks of prepo- 
sitional phrase attachment. Experiments with 
aggregation functions such as unweighted and 
weighted average, OWA operator, Choquet inte- 
gral and stacked generalization demonstrate hat 
combining multiple networks improve the esti- 
mation of each individual neural network. Using 
the Ratnaparkhi data set (the complete training 
set and the complete test set) we obtained an ac- 
curacy score of 86.08%. In spite of the high cost 
in computational time of neural net training, the 
response time in test mode is faster than others 
methods.
