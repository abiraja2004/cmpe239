In this paper we present a hybrid ap-
proach for the acquisition of syntactico-
semantic patterns from raw text. Our
approach co-trains a decision list learner
whose feature space covers the set of all
syntactico-semantic patterns with an Ex-
pectation Maximization clustering algo-
rithm that uses the text words as attributes.
We show that the combination of the two
methods always outperforms the decision
list learner alone. Furthermore, using a
modular architecture we investigate sev-
eral algorithms for pattern ranking, the
most important component of the decision
list learner.
