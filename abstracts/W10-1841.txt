In conversational language, references to
people (especially to the conversation par-
ticipants, e.g., I, you, and we) are an es-
sential part of many expressed meanings.
In most conversational settings, however,
many such expressions have numerous po-
tential meanings, are frequently vague,
and are highly dependent on social and sit-
uational context. This is a significant chal-
lenge to conversational language under-
standing systems ? one which has seen
little attention in annotation studies. In this
paper, we present a method for annotat-
ing verbal reference to people in conver-
sational speech, with a focus on reference
to conversation participants. Our goal is
to provide a resource that tackles the is-
sues of vagueness, ambiguity, and contex-
tual dependency in a nuanced yet reliable
way, with the ultimate aim of supporting
work on summarization and information
extraction for conversation.
