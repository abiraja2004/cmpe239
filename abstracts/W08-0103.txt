 
We describe a novel n-best correction model 
that can leverage implicit user feedback (in 
the form of clicks) to improve performance in 
a multi-modal speech-search application. The 
proposed model works in two stages. First, the 
n-best list generated by the speech recognizer 
is expanded with additional candidates, based 
on confusability information captured via user 
click statistics. In the second stage, this ex-
panded list is rescored and pruned to produce 
a more accurate and compact n-best list. Re-
sults indicate that the proposed n-best correc-
tion model leads to significant improvements 
over the existing baseline, as well as other tra-
ditional n-best rescoring approaches.
