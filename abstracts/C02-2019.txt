This paper describes a project tagging a sponta-
neous speech corpus with morphological infor-
mation such as word segmentation and parts-of-
speech. We use a morphological analysis system
based on a maximum entropy model, which is
independent of the domain of corpora. In this
paper we show the tagging accuracy achieved by
using the model and discuss problems in tagging
the spontaneous speech corpus. We also show
that a dictionary developed for a corpus on a
certain domain is helpful for improving accu-
racy in analyzing a corpus on another domain.
