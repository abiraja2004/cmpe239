. This paper presents a supervised approach for relation extraction. We 
apply Support Vector Machines to detect and classify the relations in Automatic 
Content Extraction (ACE) corpus. We use a set of features including lexical to-
kens, syntactic structures, and semantic entity types for relation detection and 
classification problem. Besides these linguistic features, we successfully utilize 
the distance between two entities to improve the performance. In relation detec-
tion, we filter out the negative relation candidates using entity distance thresh-
old. In relation classification, we use the entity distance as a feature for Support 
Vector Classifier. The system is evaluated in terms of recall, precision, and F-
measure, and errors of the system are analyzed with proposed solution.
