A finite-state approach to temporal ontology
for natural language text is described under
which intervals (of the real line) paired with
event descriptions are encoded as strings. The
approach is applied to an interval temporal
logic linked to TimeML, a standard mark-up
language for time and events, for which vari-
ous finite-state mechanisms are proposed.
