This paper presents an efficient approach
to finding more bilingual webpage pairs
with high credibility via link analysis, us-
ing little prior knowledge or heuristics.
It extends from a previous algorithm that
takes the number of bilingual URL pairs
that a key (i.e., a URL pairing pattern) can
match as the objective function to search
for the best set of keys yielding the greatest
number of webpage pairs within targeted
bilingual websites. Enhanced algorithms
are proposed to match more bilingual web-
pages following the credibility based on
statistical analysis of the link relationship
of the seed websites available. With about
12,800 seed websites as test set, the en-
hanced algorithms improve precision over
baseline by more than 5%, from 94.06%
to 99.40%, and hence find above 20%
more true bilingual URL pairs, illustrating
that significantly more bilingual webpages
with high credibility can be mined with the
help of the link analysis.
