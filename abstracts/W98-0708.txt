 
An analysis that defines predicates for Wordnet verb 
classes and links them to semantic interpretation is 
presented. The selectional restrictions for the the- 
matic roles defining the predicates are WordNet on- 
tological categories. Thematic roles are also linked 
to the syntactic relations that realize them. The pa- 
per illustrates the methodology by providing a de- 
tailed analysis of some major WordNet verb classes.
