 
We describe the operation of our argumentation system, and discuss its use of attentional focus 
during both content planning and argument presentation. During content planning, attentional focus 
guides an abductive process used to build-up arguments. This process is applied to a model of a user's 
? beliefs and a normative model. During argument presentation, attentional focus supports the generation 
of enthymematic arguments.
