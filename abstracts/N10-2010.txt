This paper introduces a Web-based demon-
stration of an interactive-predictive framework
for syntactic tree annotation, where the user is
tightly integrated into the interactive parsing
system. In contrast with the traditional post-
editing approach, both the user and the sys-
tem cooperate to generate error-free annotated
trees. User feedback is provided by means of
natural mouse gestures and keyboard strokes.
