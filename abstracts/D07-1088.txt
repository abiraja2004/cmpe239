 
In this paper, we address the problem of 
extracting data records and their attributes 
from unstructured biomedical full text. 
There has been little effort reported on this 
in the research community. We argue that 
semantics is important for record extraction 
or finer-grained language processing tasks. 
We derive a data record template including 
semantic language models from unstruc-
tured text and represent them with a dis-
course level Conditional Random Fields 
(CRF) model. We evaluate the approach 
from the perspective of Information Extrac-
tion and achieve significant improvements 
on system performance compared with 
other baseline systems.
