Statistical parsers trained and tested on the
Penn Wall Street Journal (WSJ) treebank
have shown vast improvements over the
last 10 years. Much of this improvement,
however, is based upon an ever-increasing
number of features to be trained on (typi-
cally) the WSJ treebank data. This has led
to concern that such parsers may be too
finely tuned to this corpus at the expense
of portability to other genres. Such wor-
ries have merit. The standard ?Charniak
parser? checks in at a labeled precision-
recall f -measure of 89.7% on the Penn
WSJ test set, but only 82.9% on the test set
from the Brown treebank corpus.
This paper should allay these fears. In par-
ticular, we show that the reranking parser
described in Charniak and Johnson (2005)
improves performance of the parser on
Brown to 85.2%. Furthermore, use of the
self-training techniques described in (Mc-
Closky et al, 2006) raise this to 87.8%
(an error reduction of 28%) again with-
out any use of labeled Brown data. This
is remarkable since training the parser and
reranker on labeled Brown data achieves
only 88.4%.
