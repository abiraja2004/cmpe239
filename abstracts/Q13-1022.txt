Head splitting techniques have been success-
fully exploited to improve the asymptotic
runtime of parsing algorithms for project-
ive dependency trees, under the arc-factored
model. In this article we extend these tech-
niques to a class of non-projective dependency
trees, called well-nested dependency trees with
block-degree at most 2, which has been previ-
ously investigated in the literature. We define a
structural property that allows head splitting for
these trees, and present two algorithms that im-
prove over the runtime of existing algorithms
at no significant loss in coverage.
