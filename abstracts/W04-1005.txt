 
Analysis of 9000 manually written summaries of 
newswire stories used in four Document Under-
standing Conferences indicates that approximately 
40% of their lexical items do not occur in the source 
document. A further comparison of different sum-
maries of the same document shows agreement on 
28% of their vocabulary. It can be argued that these 
relationships establish a performance ceiling for 
automated summarization systems which do not 
perform syntactic and semantic analysis on the 
source document.
