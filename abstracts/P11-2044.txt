The task of aligning corresponding phrases
across two related sentences is an important
component of approaches for natural language
problems such as textual inference, paraphrase
detection and text-to-text generation. In this
work, we examine a state-of-the-art struc-
tured prediction model for the alignment task
which uses a phrase-based representation and
is forced to decode alignments using an ap-
proximate search approach. We propose in-
stead a straightforward exact decoding tech-
nique based on integer linear programming
that yields order-of-magnitude improvements
in decoding speed. This ILP-based decoding
strategy permits us to consider syntactically-
informed constraints on alignments which sig-
nificantly increase the precision of the model.
