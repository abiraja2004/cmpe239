In this paper, we present two methods to use
a noisy parallel news corpus to improve sta-
tistical machine translation (SMT) systems.
Taking full advantage of the characteristics of
our corpus and of existing resources, we use
a bootstrapping strategy, whereby an existing
SMT engine is used both to detect parallel sen-
tences in comparable data and to provide an
adaptation corpus for translation models. MT
experiments demonstrate the benefits of vari-
ous combinations of these strategies.
