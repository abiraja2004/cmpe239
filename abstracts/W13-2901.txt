In this paper, we introduce a syntax-based
sentence simplifier that models simplifi-
cation using a probabilistic synchronous
tree substitution grammar (STSG). To im-
prove the STSG model specificity we uti-
lize a multi-level backoff model with addi-
tional syntactic annotations that allow for
better discrimination over previous STSG
formulations. We compare our approach
to T3 (Cohn and Lapata, 2009), a re-
cent STSG implementation, as well as
two state-of-the-art phrase-based sentence
simplifiers on a corpus of aligned sen-
tences from English and Simple English
Wikipedia. Our new approach performs
significantly better than T3, similarly to
human simplifications for both simplicity
and fluency, and better than the phrase-
based simplifiers for most of the evalua-
tion metrics.
