We propose a technique to generate non-
projective word orders in an efficient statisti-
cal linearization system. Our approach pre-
dicts liftings of edges in an unordered syntac-
tic tree by means of a classifier, and uses a
projective algorithm for tree linearization. We
obtain statistically significant improvements
on six typologically different languages: En-
glish, German, Dutch, Danish, Hungarian, and
Czech.
