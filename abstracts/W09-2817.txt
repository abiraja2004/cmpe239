The GREC-NEG Task at Generation Chal-
lenges 2009 required participating sys-
tems to select coreference chains for all
people entities mentioned in short en-
cyclopaedic texts about people collected
from Wikipedia. Three teams submitted
six systems in total, and we additionally
created four baseline systems. Systems
were tested automatically using a range of
existing intrinsic metrics. We also eval-
uated systems extrinsically by applying
coreference resolution tools to the outputs
and measuring the success of the tools.
In addition, systems were tested in an in-
trinsic evaluation involving human judges.
This report describes the GREC-NEG Task
and the evaluation methods applied, gives
brief descriptions of the participating sys-
tems, and presents the evaluation results.
