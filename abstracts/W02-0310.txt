 
We describe the use of clinical data 
present in the medical record to 
determine the relevance of research 
evidence from literature databases. 
We studied the effect of using 
automated knowledge approaches as 
compared to physician?s selection of 
articles, when using a traditional 
information retrieval system. Three 
methods were evaluated. The first 
method identified terms and their 
semantics and relationships in the 
patient?s record to build a map of the 
record, which was represented in 
conceptual graph notation. This 
approach was applied to data in an 
individual?s medical record and used 
to score citations retrieved using a 
graph matching algorithm. The 
second method identified associations 
between terms in the medical record, 
assigning them semantic types and 
weights based on the co-occurrence of 
these associations in citations of 
biomedical literature. The method was 
applied to data in an individual?s  
medical record and used to score 
citations. The last method combined 
the first two. The results showed that 
physicians agreed better with each 
other than with the automated 
methods. However, we found a 
significant positive relation between 
physicians? selection of abstracts and 
two of the methods. We believe the 
results encourage the use of clinical 
data to determine the relevance of 
medical literature to the care of 
individual patients.
