In this work we describe the modeling and
prediction of Interaction Quality (IQ) in Spo-
ken Dialogue Systems (SDS) using Support
Vector Machines. The model can be employed
to estimate the quality of the ongoing inter-
action at arbitrary points in a spoken human-
computer interaction. We show that the use
of 52 completely automatic features character-
izing the system-user exchange significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. The
model is evaluated on publically available data
from the CMU Let?s Go Bus Information sys-
tem. It reaches a performance of 61.6% un-
weighted average recall when discriminating
between 5 classes (good to very poor). It can
be further shown that incorporating knowl-
edge about the user?s emotional state does
hardly improve the performance.
