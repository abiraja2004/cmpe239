This paper presents a method for bootstrapping a
fine-grained, broad-coverage part-of-speech (POS)
tagger in a new language using only one person-
day of data acquisition effort. It requires only three
resources, which are currently readily available in
60-100 world languages: (1) an online or hard-copy
pocket-sized bilingual dictionary, (2) a basic library
reference grammar, and (3) access to an existing
monolingual text corpus in the language. The al-
gorithm begins by inducing initial lexical POS dis-
tributions from English translations in a bilingual
dictionary without POS tags. It handles irregular,
regular and semi-regular morphology through a ro-
bust generative model using weighted Levenshtein
alignments. Unsupervised induction of grammatical
gender is performed via global modeling of context-
window feature agreement. Using a combination of
these and other evidence sources, interactive train-
ing of context and lexical prior models are accom-
plished for fine-grained POS tag spaces. Experi-
ments show high accuracy, fine-grained tag resolu-
tion with minimal new human effort.
