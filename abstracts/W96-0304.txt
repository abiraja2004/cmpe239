 
This paper discusses a case study in which lexical semantic techniques were used to implement a
prototype scoring system for short-answer, f ee-responses to test questions. Scoring, as it is discussed in 
this paper, is a kind of clasgification problem. Responses are automatically scored by being assigned 
appropriate classifications. The ultimate goal is to develop a scoring system which can reliably analyze 
response content. 
For this study, a domain-specific, concept-based lexicon, and a concept grammar were built to represent 
the response set, using 200 of 378 responses from the original data set. The lexicon is built, from 
individual words, and 2-word and 3-word terms from the training data. The lexicon is best characterized 
by Bergler's (1995) layered lexicon. Concept grammar rules are built by mapping concepts from the 
lexicon onto the concept-structure patterns present in a set of training responses. Previous attempts to 
score these responses using lexically-based statistical techniques and structure-independent content 
grammars were not reliable (Burstein and Kaplan (1995)). The results discussed in this paper illustrate 
the reliability of the lexical semantic methods used in the study.
