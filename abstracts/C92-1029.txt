 
Parsing a long sentence is very difficult, since long 
sentences often have conjunctions which result in am- 
biguities. If the conjunctive structures existing in a 
long sentence can be analyzed correctly, ambiguities 
can be reduced greatly and a sentence can be parsed 
in a high successful rate. Since the prior part and 
the posterior part of a conjunctive structure have a 
similar structure very often, finding two similar series 
of words is an essential point in solving this problem. 
Similarities of all pairs of words are calculated and 
then the two series of words which have the great- 
est sum of similarities are found by a technique of 
dynamic programming. We deal with not only con- 
junctive noun phrases, but also conjunctive predica- 
tive clauses created by "Renyoh chuushi-ho". We will 
illustrate the effectiveness of this method by the anal- 
ysis of 180 long Japanese sentences.
