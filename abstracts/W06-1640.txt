Combining fine-grained opinion informa-
tion to produce opinion summaries is im-
portant for sentiment analysis applica-
tions. Toward that end, we tackle the
problem of source coreference resolution
? linking together source mentions that re-
fer to the same entity. The partially super-
vised nature of the problem leads us to de-
fine and approach it as the novel problem
of partially supervised clustering. We pro-
pose and evaluate a new algorithm for the
task of source coreference resolution that
outperforms competitive baselines.
