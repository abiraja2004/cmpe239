We present the first work on antecedent se-
lection for bridging resolution without restric-
tions on anaphor or relation types. Our model
integrates global constraints on top of a rich
local feature set in the framework of Markov
logic networks. The global model improves
over the local one and both strongly outper-
form a reimplementation of prior work.
