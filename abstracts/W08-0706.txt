We examine the typology of quantity-
insensitive (QI) stress systems and ask to what
extent an existing optimality theoretic model
of QI stress can predict the observed typolog-
ical frequencies of stress patterns. We find
three significant correlates of pattern attesta-
tion and frequency: the trigram entropy of a
pattern, the degree to which it is ?confusable?
with other patterns predicted by the model,
and the number of constraint rankings that
specify the pattern.
