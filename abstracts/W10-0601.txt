(Mitchell et al, 2008) showed that it was pos-
sible to use a text corpus to learn the value of
hypothesized semantic features characterizing
the meaning of a concrete noun. The authors
also demonstrated that those features could
be used to decompose the spatial pattern of
fMRI-measured brain activation in response to
a stimulus containing that noun and a picture
of it. In this paper we introduce a method for
learning such semantic features automatically
from a text corpus, without needing to hypoth-
esize them or provide any proxies for their
presence on the text. We show that those fea-
tures are effective in a more demanding classi-
fication task than that in (Mitchell et al, 2008)
and describe their qualitative relationship to
the features proposed in that paper.
