When term ambiguity and variability are very
high, dictionary-based Named Entity Recogni-
tion (NER) is not an ideal solution even though
large-scale terminological resources are avail-
able. Many researches on statistical NER have
tried to cope with these problems. However,
it is not straightforward how to exploit exist-
ing and additional Named Entity (NE) dictio-
naries in statistical NER. Presumably, addi-
tion of NEs to an NE dictionary leads to bet-
ter performance. However, in reality, the re-
training of NER models is required to achieve
this. We have established a novel way to im-
prove the NER performance by addition of
NEs to an NE dictionary without retraining.
We chose protein name recognition as a case
study because it most suffers the problems re-
lated to heavy term variation and ambiguity.
In our approach, first, known NEs are identi-
fied in parallel with Part-of-Speech (POS) tag-
ging based on a general word dictionary and
an NE dictionary. Then, statistical NER is
trained on the tagger outputs with correct NE
labels attached. We evaluated performance of
our NER on the standard JNLPBA-2004 data
set. The F-score on the test set has been im-
proved from 73.14 to 73.78 after adding the
protein names appearing in the training data to
the POS tagger dictionary without any model
retraining. The performance further increased
to 78.72 after enriching the tagging dictionary
with test set protein names. Our approach
has demonstrated high performance in pro-
tein name recognition, which indicates how
to make the most of known NEs in statistical
NER.
