 
Algorithms for the alignment of words in 
translated texts are well established. How- 
ever, only recently new approaches have 
been proposed to identify word translations 
from non-parallel or even unrelated texts. 
This task is more difficult, because most 
statistical clues useful in the processing of 
parallel texts cannot be applied to non-par- 
allel texts. Whereas for parallel texts in 
some studies up to 99% of the word align- 
ments have been shown to be correct, the 
accuracy for non-parallel texts has been 
around 30% up to now. The current study, 
which is based on the assumption that there 
is a correlation between the patterns of word 
co-occurrences in corpora of different lan- 
guages, makes a significant improvement to
about 72% of word translations identified 
correctly.
