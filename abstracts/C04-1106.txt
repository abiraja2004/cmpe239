The reality of analogies between words is re-
futed by noone (e.g., I walked is to to walk as I
laughed is to to laugh, noted I walked : to walk
:: I laughed : to laugh). But computational lin-
guists seem to be quite dubious about analogies
between sentences: they would not be enough
numerous to be of any use. We report experi-
ments conducted on a multilingual corpus to es-
timate the number of analogies among the sen-
tences that it contains. We give two estimates,
a lower one and a higher one. As an analogy
must be valid on the level of form as well as on
the level of meaning, we relied on the idea that
translation should preserve meaning to test for
similar meanings.
