We formalize weighted dependency pars-
ing as searching for maximum spanning
trees (MSTs) in directed graphs. Using
this representation, the parsing algorithm
of Eisner (1996) is sufficient for search-
ing over all projective trees in O(n3) time.
More surprisingly, the representation is
extended naturally to non-projective pars-
ing using Chu-Liu-Edmonds (Chu and
Liu, 1965; Edmonds, 1967) MST al-
gorithm, yielding an O(n2) parsing al-
gorithm. We evaluate these methods
on the Prague Dependency Treebank us-
ing online large-margin learning tech-
niques (Crammer et al, 2003; McDonald
et al, 2005) and show that MST parsing
increases efficiency and accuracy for lan-
guages with non-projective dependencies.
