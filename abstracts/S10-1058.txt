In this paper we describe Mephisto, our
system for Task 9 of the SemEval-2 work-
shop. Our approach to this task is to de-
velop a machine learning classifier which
determines for each verb pair describing
a noun compound which verb should be
ranked higher. These classifications are
then combined into one ranking. Our clas-
sifier uses features from the Google N-
gram Corpus, WordNet and the provided
training data.
