Anchor text plays a special important role in 
improving the performance of general Web 
search, due to the fact that it is relatively ob-
jective description for a Web page by poten-
tially a large number of other Web pages. 
Academic Search provides indexing and 
search functionality for academic articles. It 
may be desirable to utilize anchor text in aca-
demic search as well to improve the search re-
sults quality. The main challenge here is that 
no explicit URLs and anchor text is available 
for academic articles. In this paper we define 
and automatically assign a pseudo-URL for 
each academic article. And a machine learning 
approach is adopted to extract pseudo-anchor 
text for academic articles, by exploiting the ci-
tation relationship between them. The ex-
tracted pseudo-anchor text is then indexed and 
involved in the relevance score computation of 
academic articles. Experiments conducted on 
0.9 million research papers show that our ap-
proach is able to dramatically improve search 
performance.
