This paper describes how a question an-
swering (QA) system developed for small-
sized document collections of several mil-
lion sentences was modified in order to
work with a monolingual subset of the
web. The basic QA system relies on com-
plete sentence parsing, inferences, and se-
mantic representation matching. The ex-
tensions and modifications needed for use-
ful and quick answers from web docu-
ments are discussed. The main extension
is a two-level approach that first accesses a
web search engine and downloads some of
its document hits and then works similar
to the basic QA system. Most modifica-
tions are restrictions like a maximal num-
ber of documents and a maximal length
of investigated document parts; they en-
sure acceptable answer times. The result-
ing web QA system is evaluated on the
German test collection from QA@CLEF
2004. Several parameter settings and
strategies for accessing the web search en-
gine are investigated. The main results are:
precision-oriented extensions and exper-
imentally derived parameter settings are
needed to achieve similar performance on
the web as on small-sized document col-
lections that show higher homogeneity and
quality of the contained texts; adapting a
semantic QA system to the web is feasible,
but answering a question is still expensive
in terms of bandwidth and CPU time.
