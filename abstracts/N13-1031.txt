This paper describes the annotation process
and linguistic properties of the Persian syn-
tactic dependency treebank. The treebank
consists of approximately 30,000 sentences
annotated with syntactic roles in addition to
morpho-syntactic features. One of the unique
features of this treebank is that there are al-
most 4800 distinct verb lemmas in its sen-
tences making it a valuable resource for ed-
ucational goals. The treebank is constructed
with a bootstrapping approach by means of
available tagging and parsing tools and man-
ually correcting the annotations. The data is
splitted into standard train, development and
test set in the CoNLL dependency format and
is freely available to researchers.
