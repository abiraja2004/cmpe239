The computation of logical form has been pro-
posed as an intermediate step in the translation
of sentences to logic. Logical form encodes
the resolution of scope ambiguities. In this
paper, we describe experiments on a modest-
sized corpus of regulation annotated with a
novel variant of logical form, called abstract
syntax trees (ASTs). The main step in com-
puting ASTs is to order scope-taking opera-
tors. A learning model for ranking is adapted
for this ordering. We design features by study-
ing the problem of comparing the scope of one
operator to another. The scope comparisons
are used to compute ASTs, with an F-score of
90.6% on the set of ordering decisons.
