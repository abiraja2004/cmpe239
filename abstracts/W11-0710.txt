In this paper we investigate the connection be-
tween language and community membership
of long time community participants through
computational modeling techniques. We re-
port on findings from an analysis of language
usage within a popular online discussion fo-
rum with participation of thousands of users
spanning multiple years. We find community
norms of long time participants that are char-
acterized by forum specific jargon and a style
that is highly informal and shows familiarity
with specific other participants and high emo-
tional involvement in the discussion. We also
find quantitative evidence of persistent shifts
in language usage towards these norms across
users over the course of the first year of com-
munity participation. Our observed patterns
suggests language stabilization after 8 or 9
months of participation.
