We present the CSF - Common Semantic Fea-
tures method for metaphor detection. This
method has two distinguishing characteristics:
it is cross-lingual and it does not rely on the
availability of extensive manually-compiled
lexical resources in target languages other than
English. A metaphor detecting classifier is
trained on English samples and then applied to
the target language. The method includes pro-
cedures for obtaining semantic features from
sentences in the target language. Our exper-
iments with Russian and English sentences
show comparable results, supporting our hy-
pothesis that a CSF-based classifier can be ap-
plied across languages. We obtain state-of-
the-art performance in both languages.
