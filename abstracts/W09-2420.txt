Domain portability and adaptation of NLP
components and Word Sense Disambiguation
systems present new challenges. The diffi-
culties found by supervised systems to adapt
might change the way we assess the strengths
and weaknesses of supervised and knowledge-
based WSD systems. Unfortunately, all ex-
isting evaluation datasets for specific domains
are lexical-sample corpora. With this paper
we want to motivate the creation of an all-
words test dataset for WSD on the environ-
ment domain in several languages, and present
the overall design of this SemEval task.
