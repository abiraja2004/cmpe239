Current approaches for semantic parsing take
a supervised approach requiring a consider-
able amount of training data which is expen-
sive and difficult to obtain. This supervision
bottleneck is one of the major difficulties in
scaling up semantic parsing.
We argue that a semantic parser can be trained
effectively without annotated data, and in-
troduce an unsupervised learning algorithm.
The algorithm takes a self training approach
driven by confidence estimation. Evaluated
over Geoquery, a standard dataset for this
task, our system achieved 66% accuracy, com-
pared to 80% of its fully supervised counter-
part, demonstrating the promise of unsuper-
vised approaches for this task.
