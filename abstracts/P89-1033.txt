 
The logic behind parsers for categorial grammars 
can be formalized in several different ways. Lam- 
bek Calculus (LC) constitutes an example for a na- 
tural deduction 1 style parsing method. 
In natural language processing, the task of a 
parser usually consists in finding derivations for all 
different readings of a sentence. The original Lam- 
bek Calculus, when it is used as a parser/theorem 
prover, has the undesirable property of allowing for 
the derivation of more than one proof for a reading 
of a sentence, in the general case. 
In order to overcome this inconvenience and to 
turn Lambek Calculus into a reasonable parsing 
method, we show the existence of "relative" normal 
form proof trees and make use of their properties to 
constrain the proof procedure in the desired way.
