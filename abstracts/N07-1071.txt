 
Semantic inference is a key component 
for advanced natural language under-
standing. However, existing collections of 
automatically acquired inference rules 
have shown disappointing results when 
used in applications such as textual en-
tailment and question answering. This pa-
per presents ISP, a collection of methods 
for automatically learning admissible ar-
gument values to which an inference rule 
can be applied, which we call inferential 
selectional preferences, and methods for 
filtering out incorrect inferences. We 
evaluate ISP and present empirical evi-
dence of its effectiveness.
