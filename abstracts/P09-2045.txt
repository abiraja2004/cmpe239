This paper proposes a method to ex-
tract product features from user reviews
and generate a review summary. This
method only relies on product specifica-
tions, which usually are easy to obtain.
Other resources like segmenter, POS tag-
ger or parser are not required. At fea-
ture extraction stage, multiple specifica-
tions are clustered to extend the vocabu-
lary of product features. Hierarchy struc-
ture information and unit of measurement
information are mined from the specifi-
cation to improve the accuracy of feature
extraction. At summary generation stage,
hierarchy information in specifications is
used to provide a natural conceptual view
of product features.
