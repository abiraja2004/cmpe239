This paper introduces a new open source,
WFST-based toolkit for Grapheme-to-
Phoneme conversion. The toolkit is efficient,
accurate and currently supports a range of
features including EM sequence alignment
and several decoding techniques novel in
the context of G2P. Experimental results
show that a combination RNNLM system
outperforms all previous reported results on
several standard G2P test sets. Preliminary
experiments applying Lattice Minimum
Bayes-Risk decoding to G2P conversion are
also provided. The toolkit is implemented
using OpenFst.
