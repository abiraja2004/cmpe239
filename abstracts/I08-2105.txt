We present experiments that analyze the
necessity of using a highly interconnected
word/sense graph for unsupervised all-
words word sense disambiguation. We show
that allowing only grammatically related
words to influence each other?s senses leads
to disambiguation results on a par with the
best graph-based systems, while greatly re-
ducing the computation load. We also com-
pare two methods for computing selectional
preferences between the senses of every two
grammatically related words: one using a
Lesk-based measure on WordNet, the other
using dependency relations from the British
National Corpus. The best configuration
uses the syntactically-constrained graph, se-
lectional preferences computed from the
corpus and a PageRank tie-breaking algo-
rithm. We especially note good performance
when disambiguating verbs with grammati-
cally constrained links.
