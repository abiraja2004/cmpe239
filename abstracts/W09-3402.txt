This paper presents an empirical work
for Vietnamese NP chunking task. We
show how to build an annotation corpus of
NP chunking and how discriminative se-
quence models are trained using the cor-
pus. Experiment results using 5 fold cross
validation test show that discriminative se-
quence learning are well suitable for Viet-
namese chunking. In addition, by em-
pirical experiments we show that the part
of speech information contribute signifi-
cantly to the performance of there learning
models.
