 
Morphological analysis as applied to Eng-
lish has generally involved the study of 
rules for inflections and derivations. Recent 
work has attempted to derive such rules 
from automatic analysis of corpora. Here 
we study similar issues, but in the context 
of the biological literature. We introduce a 
new approach which allows us to assign 
probabilities of the semantic relatedness of 
pairs of tokens that occur in text in conse-
quence of their relatedness as character 
strings. Our analysis is based on over 84 
million sentences that compose the MED-
LINE database and over 2.3 million token 
types that occur in MEDLINE and enables 
us to identify over 36 million token type 
pairs which have assigned probabilities of 
semantic relatedness of at least 0.7 based 
on their similarity as strings.
