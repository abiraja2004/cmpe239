This document describes the Word Sense Disam-
biguation system used by Language Computer Cor-
poration at English Coarse Grained All Word Task
at SemEval 2007. The system is based on two su-
pervised machine learning algorithms: Maximum
Entropy and Support Vector Machines. These algo-
rithms were trained on a corpus created from Sem-
Cor, Senseval 2 and 3 all words and lexical sample
corpora and Open Mind Word Expert 1.0 corpus.
We used topical, syntactic and semantic features.
Some semantic features were created using WordNet
glosses with semantic relations tagged manually and
automatically as part of eXtended WordNet project.
We also tried to create more training instances from
the disambiguated WordNet glosses found in XWN
project (XWN, 2003). For words for which we could
not build a sense classifier, we used First Sense in
WordNet as a back-off strategy in order to have cov-
erage of 100%. The precision and recall of the over-
all system is 81.446% placing it in the top 5 systems.
