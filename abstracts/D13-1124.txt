Why do certain combinations of words such
as ?disadvantageous peace? or ?metal to the
petal? appeal to our minds as interesting ex-
pressions with a sense of creativity, while
other phrases such as ?quiet teenager?, or
?geometrical base? not as much? We present
statistical explorations to understand the char-
acteristics of lexical compositions that give
rise to the perception of being original, inter-
esting, and at times even artistic. We first ex-
amine various correlates of perceived creativ-
ity based on information theoretic measures
and the connotation of words, then present ex-
periments based on supervised learning that
give us further insights on how different as-
pects of lexical composition collectively con-
tribute to the perceived creativity.
