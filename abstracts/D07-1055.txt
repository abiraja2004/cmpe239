We address the problem of training the free
parameters of a statistical machine transla-
tion system. We show significant improve-
ments over a state-of-the-art minimum er-
ror rate training baseline on a large Chinese-
English translation task. We present novel
training criteria based on maximum likeli-
hood estimation and expected loss compu-
tation. Additionally, we compare the maxi-
mum a-posteriori decision rule and the min-
imum Bayes risk decision rule. We show
that, not only from a theoretical point of
view but also in terms of translation qual-
ity, the minimum Bayes risk decision rule is
preferable.
