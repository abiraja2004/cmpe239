Contextual information extracted from cor-
pora is frequently used to model seman-
tic similarity. We discuss distinct classes
of context types and compare their effec-
tiveness for compound noun interpretation.
Contexts corresponding to word-word sim-
ilarity perform better than contexts corre-
sponding to relation similarity, even when
relational co-occurrences are extracted from
a much larger corpus. Combining word-
similarity and relation-similarity kernels fur-
ther improves SVM classification perfor-
mance.
