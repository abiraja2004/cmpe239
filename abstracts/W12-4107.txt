To be able to answer the question What
causes tumors to shrink?, one would re-
quire a large cause-effect relation repos-
itory. Many efforts have been payed on
is-a and part-of relation leaning, however
few have focused on cause-effect learn-
ing. This paper describes an automated
bootstrapping procedure which can learn
and produce with minimal effort a cause-
effect term repository. To filter out the
erroneously extracted information, we in-
corporate graph-based methods. To evalu-
ate the performance of the acquired cause-
effect terms, we conduct three evaluations:
(1) human-based, (2) comparison with ex-
isting knowledge bases and (3) applica-
tion driven (SemEval-1 Task 4) in which
the goal is to identify the relation between
pairs of nominals. The results show that
the extractions at rank 1500 are 89% ac-
curate, they comprise 61% from the terms
used in the SemEval-1 Task 4 dataset and
can be used in the future to produce addi-
tional training examples for the same task.
