This  paper  presents  the proposed Query
Expansion  (QE) techniques  based  on
Khmer specific characteristics to improve
the retrieval performance of Khmer Infor-
mation Retrieval (IR) system. Four types
of Khmer specific characteristics: spelling
variants, synonyms, derivative words and
reduplicative  words  have  been  investi-
gated in this research. In order to evalu-
ate the effectiveness and the efficiency of
the proposed QE techniques, a prototype of
Khmer IR system has been implemented.
The system is built  on top of the popu-
lar open source information retrieval soft-
ware library Lucene
1
. The Khmer word
segmentation tool  (Chea et  al., 2007) is
also implemented into the system to im-
prove the accuracy of indexing as well as
searching. Furthermore, the Google web
search engine is also used in the evalua-
tion process. The results show the pro-
posed QE techniques improve the retrieval
performance both of the proposed system
and the Google web search engine. With
the reduplicative word QE technique, an
improvement of 17.93% of recall can be
achieved to the proposed system.
