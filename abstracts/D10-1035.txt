Multi-category bootstrapping algorithms were
developed to reduce semantic drift. By ex-
tracting multiple semantic lexicons simultane-
ously, a category?s search space may be re-
stricted. The best results have been achieved
through reliance on manually crafted negative
categories. Unfortunately, identifying these
categories is non-trivial, and their use shifts
the unsupervised bootstrapping paradigm to-
wards a supervised framework.
We present NEG-FINDER, the first approach
for discovering negative categories automat-
ically. NEG-FINDER exploits unsupervised
term clustering to generate multiple nega-
tive categories during bootstrapping. Our al-
gorithm effectively removes the necessity of
manual intervention and formulation of nega-
tive categories, with performance closely ap-
proaching that obtained using negative cate-
gories defined by a domain expert.
