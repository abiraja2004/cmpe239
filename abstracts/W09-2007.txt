 
This paper is concerned with the possibility of 
quantifying and comparing the productivity of 
similar yet distinct syntactic constructions, 
predicting the likelihood of encountering un-
seen lexemes in their unfilled slots. Two ex-
amples are explored: variants of comparative 
correlative constructions (CCs, e.g. the faster 
the better), which are potentially very produc-
tive but in practice lexically restricted; and 
ambiguously attached prepositional phrases 
with the preposition with, which can host both 
large and restricted inventories of arguments 
under different conditions. It will be shown 
that different slots in different constructions 
are not equally likely to be occupied produc-
tively by unseen lexemes, and suggested that 
in some cases this can help disambiguate the 
underlying syntactic and semantic structure.
