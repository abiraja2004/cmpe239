 
This paper explores techniques for reduc-
ing the effectiveness of standard author-
ship attribution techniques so that an au-
thor A can preserve anonymity for a par-
ticular document D. We discuss feature 
selection and adjustment and show how 
this information can be fed back to the 
author to create a new document D? for 
which the calculated attribution moves 
away from A. Since it can be labor inten-
sive to adjust the document in this fash-
ion, we attempt to quantify the amount of 
effort required to produce the ano-
nymized document and introduce two 
levels of anonymization: shallow and 
deep. In our test set, we show that shal-
low anonymization can be achieved by 
making 14 changes per 1000 words to 
reduce the likelihood of identifying A as 
the author by an average of more than 
83%. For deep anonymization, we adapt 
the unmasking work of Koppel and 
Schler to provide feedback that allows 
the author to choose the level of ano-
nymization.
