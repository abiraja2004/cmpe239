Natural language parsing has to be accu-
rate and quick. Explanation-based Learn-
ing (EBL) is a technique to speed-up pars-
ing. The accuracy however often declines
with EBL. The paper shows that this accu-
racy loss is not due to the EBL framework
as such, but to deductive parsing. Abduc-
tive EBL allows extending the deductive
closure of the parser. We present a Chi-
nese parser based on abduction. Exper-
iments show improvements in accuracy
and efficiency.1
