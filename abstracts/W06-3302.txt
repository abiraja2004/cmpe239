 
This paper describes a natural language 
query engine that enables users to search 
for entities, relationships, and events that 
are extracted from biological literature. 
The query interpretation is guided by a 
domain ontology, which provides a map-
ping between linguistic structures and 
domain conceptual relations. We focus on 
the usability of the natural language inter-
face to users who are used to keyword-
based information retrieval. Preliminary 
evaluation of our approach using the 
GENIA corpus and ontology shows prom-
ising results.
