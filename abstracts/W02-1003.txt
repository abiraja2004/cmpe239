We demonstrate a problem with the stan-
dard technique for learning probabilistic
decision lists. We describe a simple, in-
cremental algorithm that avoids this prob-
lem, and show how to implement it effi-
ciently. We also show a variation that adds
thresholding to the standard sorting algo-
rithm for decision lists, leading to similar
improvements. Experimental results show
that the new algorithm produces substan-
tially lower error rates and entropy, while
simultaneously learning lists that are over
an order of magnitude smaller than those
produced by the standard algorithm.
