We introduce a novel algorithm for generat-
ing referring expressions, informed by human
and computer vision and designed to refer to
visible objects. Our method separates abso-
lute properties like color from relative proper-
ties like size to stochastically generate a di-
verse set of outputs. Expressions generated
using this method are often overspecified and
may be underspecified, akin to expressions
produced by people. We call such expressions
identifying descriptions. The algorithm out-
performs the well-known Incremental Algo-
rithm (Dale and Reiter, 1995) and the Graph-
Based Algorithm (Krahmer et al, 2003; Vi-
ethen et al, 2008) across a variety of images
in two domains. We additionally motivate
an evaluation method for referring expression
generation that takes the proposed algorithm?s
non-determinism into account.
