Different summarization requirements could
make the writing of a good summary more dif-
ficult, or easier. Summary length and the char-
acteristics of the input are such constraints in-
fluencing the quality of a potential summary.
In this paper we report the results of a quanti-
tative analysis on data from large-scale evalu-
ations of multi-document summarization, em-
pirically confirming this hypothesis. We fur-
ther show that features measuring the cohe-
siveness of the input are highly correlated with
eventual summary quality and that it is possi-
ble to use these as features to predict the diffi-
culty of new, unseen, summarization inputs.
