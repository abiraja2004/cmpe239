We present a novel approach to decid-
ing whether two sentences hold a para-
phrase relationship. We employ a gen-
erative model that generates a paraphrase
of a given sentence, and we use proba-
bilistic inference to reason about whether
two sentences share the paraphrase rela-
tionship. The model cleanly incorporates
both syntax and lexical semantics using
quasi-synchronous dependency grammars
(Smith and Eisner, 2006). Furthermore,
using a product of experts (Hinton, 2002),
we combine the model with a comple-
mentary logistic regression model based
on state-of-the-art lexical overlap features.
We evaluate our models on the task of
distinguishing true paraphrase pairs from
false ones on a standard corpus, giving
competitive state-of-the-art performance.
