We describe a probabilistic approach to content se-
lection for meeting summarization. We use skip-
chain Conditional Random Fields (CRF) to model
non-local pragmatic dependencies between paired
utterances such as QUESTION-ANSWER that typi-
cally appear together in summaries, and show that
these models outperform linear-chain CRFs and
Bayesian models in the task. We also discuss dif-
ferent approaches for ranking all utterances in a se-
quence using CRFs. Our best performing system
achieves 91.3% of human performance when evalu-
ated with the Pyramid evaluation metric, which rep-
resents a 3.9% absolute increase compared to our
most competitive non-sequential classifier.
