  
This paper proposes machine learning 
techniques, which help disambiguate word 
meaning. These methods focus on considering 
the relationship between a word and its 
surroundings, described as context information 
in the paper. Context information is produced 
from rule-based translation such as part-of-
speech tags, semantic concept, case relations and 
so on. To automatically extract the context 
information, we apply machine learning 
algorithms which are C4.5, C4.5rule and 
RIPPER. In this paper, we test on ParSit, which 
is an interlingual-based machine translation for 
English to Thai. To evaluate our approach, an 
verb-to-be is selected because it has increased in 
frequency and it is quite difficult to be translated 
into Thai by using only linguistic rules. The 
result shows that the accuracy of C4.5, C4.5rule 
and RIPPER are 77.7%, 73.1% and 76.1% 
respectively whereas ParSit give accuracy only 
48%.
