 
This paper proposes a method for extracting 
bilingual text pairs from a comparable cor- 
pus. The basic idea of the method is to ap- 
ply bootstrapping to an existing corpus- 
based cross-language information retrieval 
(CLIR) approach. We conducted prelimi- 
nary tests with English and Japanese bilin- 
gual corpora. The bootstrapping method 
led to much better esults for the task of ex- 
tracting translation pairs compared with a 
corpus-based CLIR method without boot- 
strapping, and the extracted translation pairs 
could be useftfl training data for improving 
results of the corpus-based CLIR method.
