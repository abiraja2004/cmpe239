We aim to shed light on the state-of-the-art in NP
coreference resolution by teasing apart the differ-
ences in the MUC and ACE task definitions, the as-
sumptions made in evaluation methodologies, and
inherent differences in text corpora. First, we exam-
ine three subproblems that play a role in coreference
resolution: named entity recognition, anaphoric-
ity determination, and coreference element detec-
tion. We measure the impact of each subproblem on
coreference resolution and confirm that certain as-
sumptions regarding these subproblems in the eval-
uation methodology can dramatically simplify the
overall task. Second, we measure the performance
of a state-of-the-art coreference resolver on several
classes of anaphora and use these results to develop
a quantitative measure for estimating coreference
resolution performance on new data sets.
