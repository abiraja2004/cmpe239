This paper presents a corpus targeting eval-
uative meaning as it pertains to descriptions
of events. The corpus, POLITICAL-ADS is
drawn from 141 television ads from the 2008
U.S. presidential race and contains 3945 NPs
and 1549 VPs annotated for scalar sentiment
from three different perspectives: the narra-
tor, the annotator, and general society. We
show that annotators can distinguish these per-
spectives reliably and that correlation between
the annotator?s own perspective and that of a
generic individual is higher than those with
the narrator. Finally, as a sample application,
we demonstrate that a simple compositional
model built off of lexical resources outper-
forms a lexical baseline.
