In many natural language applications, there
is a need to enrich syntactical parse trees. We
present a statistical tree annotator augmenting
nodes with additional information. The anno-
tator is generic and can be applied to a va-
riety of applications. We report 3 such ap-
plications in this paper: predicting function
tags; predicting null elements; and predicting
whether a tree constituent is projectable in ma-
chine translation. Our function tag prediction
system outperforms significantly published re-
sults.
