Factoring a Synchronous Context-Free
Grammar into an equivalent grammar with
a smaller number of nonterminals in each
rule enables synchronous parsing algo-
rithms of lower complexity. The prob-
lem can be formalized as searching for the
tree-decomposition of a given permutation
with the minimal branching factor. In this
paper, by modifying the algorithm of Uno
and Yagiura (2000) for the closely related
problem of finding all common intervals
of two permutations, we achieve a linear
time algorithm for the permutation factor-
ization problem. We also use the algo-
rithm to analyze the maximum SCFG rule
length needed to cover hand-aligned data
from various language pairs.
