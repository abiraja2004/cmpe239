Models of dialog state are important, both
scientifically and practically, but today?s best
build strongly on tradition. This paper
presents a new way to identify the impor-
tant dimensions of dialog state, more bottom-
up and empirical than previous approaches.
Specifically, we applied Principal Compo-
nent Analysis to a large number of low-level
prosodic features to find the most important
dimensions of variation. The top 20 out of
76 dimensions accounted for 81% of the vari-
ance, and each of these dimensions clearly re-
lated to dialog states and activities, including
turn taking, topic structure, grounding, empa-
thy, cognitive processes, attitude and rhetori-
cal structure.
