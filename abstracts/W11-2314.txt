Numerical information is very common in
all kinds of documents from newspapers and
magazines to household bills and wage slips.
However, many people find it difficult to un-
derstand, particularly people with poor educa-
tion and disabilities. Sometimes numerical in-
formation is presented with hedges that mod-
ify the meaning. A numerical hedge is a word
or phrase employed to indicate explicitly that
some loss of precision has taken place (e.g.,
?around?) and it may also indicate the di-
rection of approximation (e.g., ?more than?).
This paper presents a study of the use of nu-
merical hedges that is part of research inves-
tigating the process of rewriting difficult nu-
merical expressions in simpler ways. We car-
ried out a survey in which experts in numer-
acy were asked to simplify a range of pro-
portion expressions and analysed the results to
obtain guidelines for automating the simplifi-
cation task.
