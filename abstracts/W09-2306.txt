Recently, numerous statistical machine trans-
lation models which can utilize various kinds
of translation rules are proposed. In these
models, not only the conventional syntactic
rules but also the non-syntactic rules can be
applied. Even the pure phrase rules are in-
cludes in some of these models. Although the
better performances are reported over the con-
ventional phrase model and syntax model, the
mixture of diversified rules still leaves much
room for study. In this paper, we present a
refined rule classification system. Based on
this classification system, the rules are classi-
fied according to different standards, such as
lexicalization level and generalization. Espe-
cially, we refresh the concepts of the structure
reordering rules and the discontiguous phrase
rules. This novel classification system may
supports the SMT research community with
some helpful references.
