We propose a novel method for automat-
ically interpreting compound nouns based
on a predefined set of semantic relations.
First we map verb tokens in sentential con-
texts to a fixed set of seed verbs using
WordNet::Similarity and Moby?s
Thesaurus. We then match the sentences
with semantic relations based on the se-
mantics of the seed verbs and grammatical
roles of the head noun and modifier. Based
on the semantics of the matched sentences,
we then build a classifier using TiMBL.
The performance of our final system at in-
terpreting NCs is 52.6%.
