Instances of a word drawn from different
domains may have different sense priors
(the proportions of the different senses of
a word). This in turn affects the accuracy
of word sense disambiguation (WSD) sys-
tems trained and applied on different do-
mains. This paper presents a method to
estimate the sense priors of words drawn
from a new domain, and highlights the im-
portance of using well calibrated probabil-
ities when performing these estimations.
By using well calibrated probabilities, we
are able to estimate the sense priors effec-
tively to achieve significant improvements
in WSD accuracy.
