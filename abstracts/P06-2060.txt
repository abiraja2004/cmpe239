Several NLP tasks are characterized by
asymmetric data where one class label
NONE, signifying the absence of any
structure (named entity, coreference, re-
lation, etc.) dominates all other classes.
Classifiers built on such data typically
have a higher precision and a lower re-
call and tend to overproduce the NONE
class. We present a novel scheme for vot-
ing among a committee of classifiers that
can significantly boost the recall in such
situations. We demonstrate results show-
ing up to a 16% relative improvement in
ACE value for the 2004 ACE relation ex-
traction task for English, Arabic and Chi-
nese.
