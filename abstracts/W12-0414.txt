Whistleblowers and activists need the abil-
ity to communicate without disclosing their
identity, as of course do kidnappers and ter-
rorists. Recent advances in the technol-
ogy of stylometry (the study of authorial
style) or ?authorship attribution? have made
it possible to identify the author with high
reliability in a non-confrontational setting.
In a confrontational setting, where the au-
thor is deliberately masking their identity
(i.e. attempting to deceive), the results are
much less promising. In this paper, we
show that although the specific author may
not be identifiable, the intent to deceive and
to hide his identity can be. We show this
by a reanalysis of the Brennan and Green-
stadt (2009) deception corpus and discuss
some of the implications of this surprising
finding.
