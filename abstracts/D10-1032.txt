Polysemy is a major characteristic of natu-
ral languages. Like words, syntactic forms
can have several meanings. Understanding the
correct meaning of a syntactic form is of great
importance to many NLP applications. In this
paper we address an important type of syn-
tactic polysemy ? the multiple possible senses
of tense syntactic forms. We make our dis-
cussion concrete by introducing the task of
Tense Sense Disambiguation (TSD): given a
concrete tense syntactic form present in a sen-
tence, select its appropriate sense among a
set of possible senses. Using English gram-
mar textbooks, we compiled a syntactic sense
dictionary comprising common tense syntac-
tic forms and semantic senses for each. We an-
notated thousands of BNC sentences using the
defined senses. We describe a supervised TSD
algorithm trained on these annotations, which
outperforms a strong baseline for the task.
