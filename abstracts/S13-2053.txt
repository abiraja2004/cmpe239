In this paper, we describe how we created two
state-of-the-art SVM classifiers, one to de-
tect the sentiment of messages such as tweets
and SMS (message-level task) and one to de-
tect the sentiment of a term within a message
(term-level task). Among submissions from
44 teams in a competition, our submissions
stood first in both tasks on tweets, obtaining
an F-score of 69.02 in the message-level task
and 88.93 in the term-level task. We imple-
mented a variety of surface-form, semantic,
and sentiment features. We also generated
two large word?sentiment association lexi-
cons, one from tweets with sentiment-word
hashtags, and one from tweets with emoticons.
In the message-level task, the lexicon-based
features provided a gain of 5 F-score points
over all others. Both of our systems can be
replicated using freely available resources.1
