Abstract
Sentence compression has attracted much in-
terest in recent years, but most sentence com-
pressors are extractive, i.e., they only delete
words. There is a lack of appropriate datasets
to train and evaluate abstractive sentence com-
pressors, i.e., methods that apart from delet-
ing words can also rephrase expressions. We
present a new dataset that contains candi-
date extractive and abstractive compressions
of source sentences. The candidate compres-
sions are annotated with human judgements
for grammaticality and meaning preservation.
We discuss how the dataset was created, and
how it can be used in generate-and-rank ab-
stractive sentence compressors. We also re-
port experimental results with a novel abstrac-
tive sentence compressor that uses the dataset.
