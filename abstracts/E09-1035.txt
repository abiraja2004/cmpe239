This paper presents six novel approaches
to biographic fact extraction that model
structural, transitive and latent proper-
ties of biographical data. The ensem-
ble of these proposed models substantially
outperforms standard pattern-based bio-
graphic fact extraction methods and per-
formance is further improved by modeling
inter-attribute correlations and distribu-
tions over functions of attributes, achiev-
ing an average extraction accuracy of 80%
over seven types of biographic attributes.
