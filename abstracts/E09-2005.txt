We demonstrate an open-source natural
language generation engine that produces
descriptions of entities and classes in En-
glish and Greek from OWL ontologies that
have been annotated with linguistic and
user modeling information expressed in
RDF. We also demonstrate an accompany-
ing plug-in for the Prote?ge? ontology editor,
which can be used to create the ontology?s
annotations and generate previews of the
resulting texts by invoking the generation
engine. The engine has been embedded in
robots acting as museum tour guides in the
physical world and in Second Life; here
we demonstrate the latter application.
