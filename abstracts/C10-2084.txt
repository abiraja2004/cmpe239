 
While ITG has many desirable properties 
for word alignment, it still suffers from 
the limitation of one-to-one matching. 
While existing approaches relax this li-
mitation using phrase pairs, we propose a 
ITG formalism, which even handles units 
of non-contiguous words, using both 
simple and hierarchical phrase pairs. We 
also propose a parameter estimation me-
thod, which combines the merits of both 
supervised and unsupervised learning, 
for the ITG formalism. The ITG align-
ment system achieves significant im-
provement in both word alignment quali-
ty and translation performance.
