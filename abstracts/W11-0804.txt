In this paper we present preliminary exper-
iments that aim to reduce lexical data spar-
sity in statistical parsing by exploiting infor-
mation about named entities. Words in the
WSJ corpus are mapped to named entity clus-
ters and a latent variable constituency parser
is trained and tested on the transformed cor-
pus. We explore two different methods for
mapping words to entities, and look at the ef-
fect of mapping various subsets of named en-
tity types. Thus far, results show no improve-
ment in parsing accuracy over the best base-
line score; we identify possible problems and
outline suggestions for future directions.
