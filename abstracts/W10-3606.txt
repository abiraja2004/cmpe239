 
Word Segmentation is the foremost 
obligatory task in almost all the NLP 
applications, where the initial phase requires 
tokenization of input into words. Like other 
Asian languages such as Chinese, Thai and 
Myanmar, Urdu also faces word 
segmentation challenges. Though the Urdu 
word segmentation problem is not as severe 
as the other Asian language, since space is 
used for word delimitation, but the space is 
not consistently used, which gives rise to 
both space omission and space insertion 
errors in Urdu. In this paper we present a 
word segmentation system for handling 
space omission problem in Urdu script with 
application to Urdu-Devnagri Transliteration 
system. Instead of using manually 
segmented monolingual corpora to train 
segmenters, we make use of bilingual 
corpora and statistical word disambiguation  
techniques. Though our approach is adapted 
for the specific transliteration task at hand by 
taking the corresponding target (Hindi) 
language into account, the techniques 
suggested can  be adapted to  independently 
solve the space omission Urdu word 
segmentation problems. The two major 
components of our system are : 
identification of merged words for 
segmentation and proper segmentation of the 
merged words. The system was tested on 
1.61 million word Urdu test data. The recall 
and precision for the merged word 
recognition component were found to be  
99.29% and 99.38% respectively. The 
words are correctly segmented with 99.15% 
accuracy.
