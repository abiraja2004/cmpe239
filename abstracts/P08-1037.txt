To date, parsers have made limited use of se-
mantic information, but there is evidence to
suggest that semantic features can enhance
parse disambiguation. This paper shows that
semantic classes help to obtain significant im-
provement in both parsing and PP attachment
tasks. We devise a gold-standard sense- and
parse tree-annotated dataset based on the in-
tersection of the Penn Treebank and SemCor,
and experiment with different approaches to
both semantic representation and disambigua-
tion. For the Bikel parser, we achieved a
maximal error reduction rate over the base-
line parser of 6.9% and 20.5%, for parsing and
PP-attachment respectively, using an unsuper-
vised WSD strategy. This demonstrates that
word sense information can indeed enhance
the performance of syntactic disambiguation.
