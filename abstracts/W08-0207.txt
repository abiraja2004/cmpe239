This paper describes the design of a pilot re-
search and educational effort at the Univer-
sity of Maryland centered around technologies
for tackling Web-scale problems. In the con-
text of a ?cloud computing? initiative lead by
Google and IBM, students and researchers are
provided access to a computer cluster running
Hadoop, an open-source Java implementation
of Google?s MapReduce framework. This
technology provides an opportunity for stu-
dents to explore large-data issues in the con-
text of a course organized around teams of
graduate and undergraduate students, in which
they tackle open research problems in the hu-
man language technologies. This design rep-
resents one attempt to bridge traditional in-
struction with real-world, large-data research
challenges.
