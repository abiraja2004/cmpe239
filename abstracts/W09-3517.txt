NEWS 2009 Machine Transliteration Shared 
Task held as part of ACL-IJCNLP 2009. We 
submitted one standard run and two non-
standard runs for English to Hindi translitera-
tion. The modified joint source-channel model 
has been used along with a number of alterna-
tives. The system has been trained on the 
NEWS 2009 Machine Transliteration Shared 
Task datasets. For standard run, the system 
demonstrated an accuracy of 0.471 and the 
mean F-Score of 0.861. The non-standard runs 
yielded the accuracy and mean F-scores of 
0.389 and 0.831 respectively in the first one 
and 0.384 and 0.828 respectively in the second 
one. The non-standard runs resulted in sub-
stantially worse performance than the standard 
run. The reasons for this are the ranking algo-
rithm used for the output and the types of to-
kens present in the test set.
