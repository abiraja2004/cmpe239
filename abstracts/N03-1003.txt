We address the text-to-text generation prob-
lem of sentence-level paraphrasing ? a phe-
nomenon distinct from and more difficult than
word- or phrase-level paraphrasing. Our ap-
proach applies multiple-sequence alignment to
sentences gathered from unannotated compara-
ble corpora: it learns a set of paraphrasing pat-
terns represented by word lattice pairs and au-
tomatically determines how to apply these pat-
terns to rewrite new sentences. The results of
our evaluation experiments show that the sys-
tem derives accurate paraphrases, outperform-
ing baseline systems.
