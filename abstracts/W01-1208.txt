We propose a question answering sys-
tem which uses an encyclopedia as a
knowledge base. However, since ex-
isting encyclopedias lack technical/new
terms, we use an encyclopedia automat-
ically generated from the World Wide
Web. For this purpose, we first search
the Web for pages containing a term
in question. Then linguistic patterns
and HTML structures are used to ex-
tract text fragments describing the term.
Finally, extracted term descriptions are
organized based on word senses and
domains. We also evaluate our sys-
tem by way of experiments, where the
Japanese Information-Technology En-
gineers Examination is used as a test
collection.
