 
We discuss in this paper a proposal to inte-grate the annotation of contexts with focus-sensitive expressions (namely the Portu-guese exclusive adverb s? ?only?) in a mo-dality scheme. We describe some properties of contexts involving both exclusive parti-cles and modal triggers and discuss how to integrate this with an existing annotation scheme implemented for European Portu-guese. We present the results of the applica-tion of this annotation scheme to a sample of 100 sentences.
