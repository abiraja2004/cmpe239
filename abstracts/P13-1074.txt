 
Punctuations are not available in automatic 
speech recognition outputs, which could cre-
ate barriers to many subsequent text pro-
cessing tasks. This paper proposes a novel 
method to predict punctuation symbols for the 
stream of words in transcribed speech texts. 
Our method jointly performs parsing and 
punctuation prediction by integrating a rich set 
of syntactic features when processing words 
from left to right. It can exploit a global view 
to capture long-range dependencies for punc-
tuation prediction with linear complexity. The 
experimental results on the test data sets of 
IWSLT and TDT4 show that our method can 
achieve high-level performance in punctuation 
prediction over the stream of words in tran-
scribed speech text.
