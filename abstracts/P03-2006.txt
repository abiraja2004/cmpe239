We describe an algorithm for recover-
ing non-local dependencies in syntac-
tic dependency structures. The pattern-
matching approach proposed by John-
son (2002) for a similar task for phrase
structure trees is extended with machine
learning techniques. The algorithm is es-
sentially a classifier that predicts a non-
local dependency given a connected frag-
ment of a dependency structure and a
set of structural features for this frag-
ment. Evaluating the algorithm on the
Penn Treebank shows an improvement of
both precision and recall, compared to the
results presented in (Johnson, 2002).
