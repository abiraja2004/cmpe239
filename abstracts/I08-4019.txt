 
This paper expounds a Chinese word seg-
mentation system built for the Fourth 
SIGHAN Bakeoff. The system participates 
in six tracks, namely the CityU Closed, 
CKIP Closed, CTB Closed, CTB Open, 
SXU Closed and SXU Open tracks. The 
model of Conditional Random Field is used 
as a basic approach in the system, with at-
tention focused on the construction of fea-
ture templates and Chinese character cate-
gorization. The system is also augmented 
with some post-processing approaches such 
as the Extended Word String, model inte-
gration and others. The system performs 
fairly well on the 5 tracks of the Bakeoff.
