 
DATR is a declarative language for representing a 
restricted class of inheritance networks, permit- 
ting both multiple and default inheritance. The 
principal intended area of application is the 
representation of lexical entries for natural 
language processing, and we use examples from 
this domain throughout. In this paper we 
present the syntax and inference mechanisms for 
the language. The goal of the DATR enterprise is 
the design of a simple language that (i) has the 
necessary expressive power to encode the lexical 
entries presupposed by contemporary work in 
the unification grammar tradition, (ii) can 
express all the evident generalizations about 
such entries, (iii) has an explicit heory of infer- 
ence, (iv) is computationally tractable, and (v) 
has an explicit declarative semantics. The 
present paper is primarily concerned with (iii), 
though the examples used may hint at our stra- 
tegy in respect of (i) and (ii).
