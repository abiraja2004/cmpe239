In this paper, we study the answer
sentence selection problem for ques-
tion answering. Unlike previous work,
which primarily leverages syntactic analy-
sis through dependency tree matching, we
focus on improving the performance us-
ing models of lexical semantic resources.
Experiments show that our systems can
be consistently and significantly improved
with rich lexical semantic information, re-
gardless of the choice of learning algo-
rithms. When evaluated on a bench-
mark dataset, the MAP and MRR scores
are increased by 8 to 10 points, com-
pared to one of our baseline systems using
only surface-form matching. Moreover,
our best system also outperforms pervious
work that makes use of the dependency
tree structure by a wide margin.
