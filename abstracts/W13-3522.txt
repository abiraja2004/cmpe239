The use of pivot languages and word-
alignment techniques over bilingual cor-
pora has proved an effective approach for
extracting paraphrases of words and short
phrases. However, inherent ambiguities in
the pivot language(s) can lead to inade-
quate paraphrases. We propose a novel ap-
proach that is able to extract paraphrases
by pivoting through multiple languages
while discriminating word senses in the in-
put language, i.e., the language to be para-
phrased. Text in the input language is an-
notated with ?senses? in the form of for-
eign phrases obtained from bilingual par-
allel data and automatic word-alignment.
This approach shows 62% relative im-
provement over previous work in generat-
ing paraphrases that are judged both more
accurate and more fluent.
