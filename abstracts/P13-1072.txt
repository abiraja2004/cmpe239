We address the problem of informal word
recognition in Chinese microblogs. A key
problem is the lack of word delimiters in
Chinese. We exploit this reliance as an
opportunity: recognizing the relation be-
tween informal word recognition and Chi-
nese word segmentation, we propose to
model the two tasks jointly. Our joint in-
ference method significantly outperforms
baseline systems that conduct the tasks in-
dividually or sequentially.
