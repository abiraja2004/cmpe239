Within Information Extraction tasks,
Named Entity Recognition has received
much attention over latest decades. From
symbolic / knowledge-based to data-driven
/ machine-learning systems, many ap-
proaches have been experimented. Our
work may be viewed as an attempt to
bridge the gap from the data-driven per-
spective back to the knowledge-based one.
We use a knowledge-based system, based
on manually implemented transducers,
that reaches satisfactory performances. It
has the undisputable advantage of being
modular. However, such a hand-crafted
system requires substantial efforts to
cope with dedicated tasks. In this con-
text, we implemented a pattern extractor
that extracts symbolic knowledge, using
hierarchical sequential pattern mining
over annotated corpora. To assess the
accuracy of mined patterns, we designed a
module that recognizes Named Entities in
texts by determining their most probable
boundaries. Instead of considering Named
Entity Recognition as a labeling task, it
relies on complex context-aware features
provided by lower-level systems and
considers the tagging task as a markovian
process. Using thos systems, coupling
knowledge-based system with extracted
patterns is straightforward and leads to a
competitive hybrid NE-tagger. We report
experiments using this system and compare
it to other hybridization strategies along
with a baseline CRF model.
