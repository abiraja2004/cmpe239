We present a novel approach for extracting
a minimal synchronous context-free grammar
(SCFG) for Hiero-style statistical machine
translation using a non-parametric Bayesian
framework. Our approach is designed to ex-
tract rules that are licensed by the word align-
ments and heuristically extracted phrase pairs.
Our Bayesian model limits the number of
SCFG rules extracted, by sampling from the
space of all possible hierarchical rules; addi-
tionally our informed prior based on the lex-
ical alignment probabilities biases the gram-
mar to extract high quality rules leading to im-
proved generalization and the automatic iden-
tification of commonly re-used rules. We
show that our Bayesian model is able to ex-
tract minimal set of hierarchical phrase rules
without impacting the translation quality as
measured by the BLEU score.
