Linearization-based HPSG theories are widely
used for analyzing languages with relatively
free constituent order. This paper introduces
the Generalized ID/LP (GIDLP) grammar for-
mat, which supports a direct encoding of such
theories, and discusses key aspects of a parser
that makes use of the dominance, precedence,
and linearization domain information explicitly
encoded in this grammar format. We show
that GIDLP grammars avoid the explosion in
the number of rules required under a traditional
phrase structure analysis of free constituent or-
der. As a result, GIDLP grammars support more
modular and compact grammar encodings and
require fewer edges in parsing.
