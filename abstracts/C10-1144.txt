Supertagging is an important technique
for deep syntactic analysis. A super-
tagger is usually trained independently
of the parser using a sequence labeling
method. This presents an inconsistent
training objective between the supertagger
and the parser. In this paper, we pro-
pose a forest-guided supertagger training
method to alleviate this problem by incor-
porating global grammar constraints into
the supertagging process using a CFG-
filter. It also provides an approach to
make the supertagger and the parser more
tightly integrated. The experiment shows
that using the forest-guided trained super-
tagger, the parser got an absolute 0.68%
improvement from baseline in F-score
for predicate-argument relation recogni-
tion accuracy and achieved a competi-
tive result of 89.31% with a faster pars-
ing speed, compared to a state-of-the-art
HPSG parser.
