We describe an approach to two areas of
biomedical information extraction, drug devel-
opment and cancer genomics. We have devel-
oped a framework which includes corpus anno-
tation integrated at multiple levels: a Treebank
containing syntactic structure, a Propbank con-
taining predicate-argument structure, and an-
notation of entities and relations among the en-
tities. Crucial to this approach is the proper
characterization of entities as relation compo-
nents, which allows the integration of the entity
annotation with the syntactic structure while
retaining the capacity to annotate and extract
more complex events. We are training statis-
tical taggers using this annotation for such ex-
traction as well as using them for improving the
annotation process.
