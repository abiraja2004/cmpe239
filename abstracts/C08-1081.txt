We present the first results on parsing the
SYNTAGRUS treebank of Russian with a
data-driven dependency parser, achieving
a labeled attachment score of over 82%
and an unlabeled attachment score of 89%.
A feature analysis shows that high parsing
accuracy is crucially dependent on the use
of both lexical and morphological features.
We conjecture that the latter result can be
generalized to richly inflected languages in
general, provided that sufficient amounts
of training data are available.
