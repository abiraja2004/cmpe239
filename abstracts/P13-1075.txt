Structural information in web text pro-
vides natural annotations for NLP prob-
lems such as word segmentation and pars-
ing. In this paper we propose a discrim-
inative learning algorithm to take advan-
tage of the linguistic knowledge in large
amounts of natural annotations on the In-
ternet. It utilizes the Internet as an external
corpus with massive (although slight and
sparse) natural annotations, and enables a
classifier to evolve on the large-scaled and
real-time updated web text. With Chinese
word segmentation as a case study, exper-
iments show that the segmenter enhanced
with the Chinese wikipedia achieves sig-
nificant improvement on a series of testing
sets from different domains, even with a
single classifier and local features.
