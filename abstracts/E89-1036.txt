 
A framework for t rans la t ing  speaker 's  
meaning or intention is proposed based on two 
notions, Illocutionary Force Types (IFTs) for 
analysis and Decision Parameters (DPs) for 
generat ion .  IFTs are a cer ta in  k ind of 
classification of utterances concerning speaker's 
meaning. DPs present background information 
of language use in order to derive an appropriate 
expression from speaker's meaning. In Japanese, 
IFTs can be derived automatical ly through 
syntactical constraints. To generate appropriate 
expressions, language-specific communication 
strategies related to DP values should be given a 
priori. The whole process is performed in a 
unification-based framework.
