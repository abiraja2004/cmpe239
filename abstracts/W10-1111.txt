 
Current metrics for de-identification are based on information extraction metrics, and do not address the real-world questions ?how good are current systems?, and ?how good do they need to be?. Metrics are needed that quantify both the risk of re-identification and informa-tion preservation. We review the challenges in de-identifying clinical texts and the current metrics for assessing clinical de-identification systems. We then introduce three areas to ex-plore that can lead to metrics that quantify re-identification risk and information preserva-tion. 1
