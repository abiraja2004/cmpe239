Recently there has been a growing in-
terest in infrastructures for sharing NLP
tools and resources. This paper presents
SiSSA, a project that aims at devel-
oping an infrastructure for prototyping,
editing and validation of NLP applica-
tion architectures. The system will pro-
vide the user with a graphical environ-
ment for (1) selecting the NLP activities
relevant for the particular NLP task and
the associated linguistic processors that
execute them; (2) connecting new lin-
guistic processors to SiSSA; (3) check-
ing that the chosen architectural hy-
pothesis corresponds to the functional
specifications of the given application.
