This paper describes a study in which a
corpus of spoken Danish annotated with
focus and topic tags was used to inves-
tigate the relation between information
structure and pauses. The results show
that intra-clausal pauses in the focus do-
main, tend to precede those words that
express the property or semantic type
whereby the object in focus is distin-
guished from other ones in the domain.
