In this paper, we outline our approach to
interpreting semantic relations in nominal
pairs in SemEval-2007 task #4: Classifica-
tion of Semantic Relations between Nomi-
nals. We build on two baseline approaches
to interpreting noun compounds: sense col-
location, and constituent similarity. These
are consolidated into an overall system in
combination with co-training, to expand the
training data. Our two systems attained an
average F-score over the test data of 58.7%
and 57.8%, respectively.
