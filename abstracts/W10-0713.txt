We describe our experience using both Ama-
zon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) and Crowd-
Flower to collect simple named entity anno-
tations for Twitter status updates. Unlike most
genres that have traditionally been the focus of
named entity experiments, Twitter is far more
informal and abbreviated. The collected anno-
tations and annotation techniques will provide
a first step towards the full study of named en-
tity recognition in domains like Facebook and
Twitter. We also briefly describe how to use
MTurk to collect judgements on the quality of
?word clouds.?
