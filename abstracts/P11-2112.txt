This paper proposes a novel approach for ef-
fectively utilizing unsupervised data in addi-
tion to supervised data for supervised learn-
ing. We use unsupervised data to gener-
ate informative ?condensed feature represen-
tations? from the original feature set used in
supervised NLP systems. The main con-
tribution of our method is that it can of-
fer dense and low-dimensional feature spaces
for NLP tasks while maintaining the state-of-
the-art performance provided by the recently
developed high-performance semi-supervised
learning technique. Our method matches the
results of current state-of-the-art systems with
very few features, i.e., F-score 90.72 with
344 features for CoNLL-2003 NER data, and
UAS 93.55 with 12.5K features for depen-
dency parsing data derived from PTB-III.
