We present a development pipeline and asso-
ciated algorithms designed to make grammar-
based generation easier to deploy in imple-
mented dialogue systems. Our approach real-
izes a practical trade-off between the capabili-
ties of a system?s generation component and
the authoring and maintenance burdens im-
posed on the generation content author for a
deployed system. To evaluate our approach,
we performed a human rating study with sys-
tem builders who work on a common large-
scale spoken dialogue system. Our results
demonstrate the viability of our approach and
illustrate authoring/performance trade-offs be-
tween hand-authored text, our grammar-based
approach, and a competing shallow statistical
NLG technique.
