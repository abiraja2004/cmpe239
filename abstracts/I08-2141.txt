Many languages of the world (some with
very large numbers of native speakers) are
not yet supported on computers. In this pa-
per we first present a simple method to pro-
vide an extra layer of easily customizable
language-encoding support for less comput-
erized languages. We then describe an ed-
itor called Sanchay Editor, which uses this
method and also has many other facilities
useful for those using less computerized lan-
guages for simple text editing or for Nat-
ural Language Processing purposes, espe-
cially for annotation.
