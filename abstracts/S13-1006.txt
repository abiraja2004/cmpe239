This paper describes the participation of iKer-
nels system in the Semantic Textual Similar-
ity (STS) shared task at *SEM 2013. Different
from the majority of approaches, where a large
number of pairwise similarity features are
used to learn a regression model, our model
directly encodes the input texts into syntac-
tic/semantic structures. Our systems rely on
tree kernels to automatically extract a rich set
of syntactic patterns to learn a similarity score
correlated with human judgements. We ex-
periment with different structural representa-
tions derived from constituency and depen-
dency trees. While showing large improve-
ments over the top results from the previous
year task (STS-2012), our best system ranks
21st out of total 88 participated in the STS-
2013 task. Nevertheless, a slight refinement to
our model makes it rank 4th.
