We propose the hypothesis that word ety-
mology is useful for NLP applications as
a bridge between languages. We support
this hypothesis with experiments in cross-
language (English-Italian) document cat-
egorization. In a straightforward bag-of-
words experimental set-up we add etymo-
logical ancestors of the words in the docu-
ments, and investigate the performance of
a model built on English data, on Italian
test data (and viceversa). The results show
not only statistically significant, but a large
improvement ? a jump of almost 40 points
in F1-score ? over the raw (vanilla bag-of-
words) representation.
