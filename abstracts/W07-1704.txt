The paper presents two techniques for
lemmatization of Polish person names. First,
we apply a rule-based approach which re-
lies on linguistic information and heuris-
tics. Then, we investigate an alterna-
tive knowledge-poor method which employs
string distance measures. We provide an
evaluation of the adopted techniques using
a set of newspaper texts.
