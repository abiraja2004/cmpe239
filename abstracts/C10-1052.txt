 It has been recognized for quite some time that sustainable data formats play an important role in the development and curation of linguistic resources. The purpose of this paper is to show how GermaNet, the German version of the Princeton WordNet, can be con-verted to the Lexical Markup Frame-work (LMF), a published ISO standard (ISO-24613) for encoding lexical re-sources. The conversion builds on Wordnet-LMF, which has been pro-posed in the context of the EU KYOTO project as an LMF format for wordnets. The present paper proposes a number of crucial modifications and a set of extensions to Wordnet-LMF that are needed for conversion of wordnets in general and for conversion of Ger-maNet in particular. 1
