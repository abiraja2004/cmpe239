Vocal activity detection is an impor-
tant technology for both automatic speech
recognition and automatic speech under-
standing. In meetings, standard vocal
activity detection algorithms have been
shown to be ineffective, because partici-
pants typically vocalize for only a frac-
tion of the recorded time and because,
while they are not vocalizing, their channels
are frequently dominated by crosstalk from
other participants. In the present work,
we review a particular type of normaliza-
tion of maximum cross-channel correlation,
a feature recently introduced to address the
crosstalk problem. We derive a plausible
geometric interpretation and show how the
frame size affects performance.
