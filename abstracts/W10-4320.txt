In  this paper we examine the influence  of 
dimensionality  on  natural  language  route 
directions  in  dialogue.  Specifically,  we 
show  that  giving  route  instructions  in  a 
quasi-3d  environment  leads  to  experiential 
descriptive  accounts,  as  manifested  by  a 
higher  proportion  of  location  descriptions, 
lack of chunking, use of 1st person singular 
personal pronouns, and more frequent use of 
temporal and spatial deictic terms. 2d scen-
arios  lead  to  informative  instructions,  as 
manifested by a frequent use of motion ex-
pressions,  chunking of route elements,  and 
use of mainly 2nd person singular personal 
pronouns.
