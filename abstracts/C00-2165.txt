 
While large POS(part-of-speech) annotated 
corpora play an important role in natural 
language processing, the annotated corpus 
requires very high accuracy and consistency. 
To build such an accurate and consistent 
corpus, we often use a manual tagging 
method. But the manual tagging is very 
labor intensive and expensive. Furthernaore, 
it is not easy to get consistent results from 
the humari experts. In this paper, we present 
an efficient tool lbr building large accurate 
and consistent corpora with minimal human 
labor. The proposed tool supports semi- 
automatic tagging. Using disambiguation 
rules acquired from human experts, it 
minimizes the human intervention in both 
the manual tagging and post-editing steps.
