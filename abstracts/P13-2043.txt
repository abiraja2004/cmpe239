We propose discriminative methods to
generate semantic distractors of fill-in-the-
blank quiz for language learners using a
large-scale language learners? corpus. Un-
like previous studies, the proposed meth-
ods aim at satisfying both reliability and
validity of generated distractors; distrac-
tors should be exclusive against answers
to avoid multiple answers in one quiz,
and distractors should discriminate learn-
ers? proficiency. Detailed user evaluation
with 3 native and 23 non-native speakers
of English shows that our methods achieve
better reliability and validity than previous
methods.
