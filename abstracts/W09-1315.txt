We introduce a controlled natural language for
biomedical queries, called BIOQUERYCNL,
and present an algorithm to convert a biomed-
ical query in this language into a program
in answer set programming (ASP)?a for-
mal framework to automate reasoning about
knowledge. BIOQUERYCNL allows users to
express complex queries (possibly containing
nested relative clauses and cardinality con-
straints) over biomedical ontologies; and such
a transformation of BIOQUERYCNL queries
into ASP programs is useful for automat-
ing reasoning about biomedical ontologies by
means of ASP solvers. We precisely describe
the grammar of BIOQUERYCNL, implement
our transformation algorithm, and illustrate its
applicability to biomedical queries by some
examples.
