This paper describes a Verb Phrase El-
lipsis (VPE) detection system, built for
robustness, accuracy and domain inde-
pendence. The system is corpus-based,
and uses machine learning techniques
on free text that has been automatically
parsed. Tested on a mixed corpus com-
prising a range of genres, the system
achieves a 70% F1-score. This system is
designed as the first stage of a complete
VPE resolution system that is input free
text, detects VPEs, and proceeds to find
the antecedents and resolve them.
