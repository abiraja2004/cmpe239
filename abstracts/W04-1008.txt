 
 We describe SmartMail, a prototype system for 
automatically identifying action items (tasks) in 
email messages. SmartMail presents the user with 
a task-focused summary of a message. The 
summary consists of a list of action items extracted 
from the message. The user can add these action 
items to their ?to do? list.
