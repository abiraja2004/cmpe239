This paper investigates the impact of mis-
spelled words in statistical machine transla-
tion and proposes an extension of the transla-
tion engine for handling misspellings. The en-
hanced system decodes a word-based confu-
sion network representing spelling variations
of the input text.
We present extensive experimental results on
two translation tasks of increasing complex-
ity which show how misspellings of different
types do affect performance of a statistical ma-
chine translation decoder and to what extent
our enhanced system is able to recover from
such errors.
