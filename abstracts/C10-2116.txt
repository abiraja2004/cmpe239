With OWL (Web Ontology Language) es-
tablished as a standard for encoding on-
tologies on the Semantic Web, interest
has begun to focus on the task of ver-
balising OWL code in controlled English
(or other natural language). Current ap-
proaches to this task assume that axioms
in OWL can be mapped to sentences in
English. We examine three potential prob-
lems with this approach (concerning log-
ical sophistication, information structure,
and size), and show that although these
could in theory lead to insuperable diffi-
culties, in practice they seldom arise, be-
cause ontology developers use OWL in
ways that favour a transparent mapping.
This result is evidenced by an analysis of
patterns from a corpus of over 600,000 ax-
ioms in about 200 ontologies.
