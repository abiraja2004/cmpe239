We experiment with extending a lattice pars-
ing methodology for parsing Hebrew (Gold-
berg and Tsarfaty, 2008; Golderg et al, 2009)
to make use of a stronger syntactic model: the
PCFG-LA Berkeley Parser. We show that the
methodology is very effective: using a small
training set of about 5500 trees, we construct
a parser which parses and segments unseg-
mented Hebrew text with an F-score of almost
80%, an error reduction of over 20% over the
best previous result for this task. This result
indicates that lattice parsing with the Berkeley
parser is an effective methodology for parsing
over uncertain inputs.
