In this demonstration we present a mixed-
initiative dialog system for address recog-
nition that lets users to specify a complete
addresses in a single sentence with ad-
dress components spoken in their natural
sequence. Users can also specify fewer ad-
dress components in several ways, based
on their convenience. The system extracts
specified address components, prompts for
missing information, disambiguates items
independently or collectively all the while
guiding the user so as to obtain the de-
sired valid address. The language mod-
eling and dialog management techniques
developed for this purpose are also briefly
described. Finally, several use cases with
screen shots are presented. The combined
system yields very high task completion
accuracy on user tests.
