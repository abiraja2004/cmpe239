 
This paper reports on the integration of a 
speech recognition component into a small 
robot, J. Edgar, which was developed in the 
AI Vision Lab at the University of  
Melbourne. While the use of voice 
commands was fairly easy to implement, 
the interaction of the voice commands with 
the existing navigation system of the robot 
turned out to pose a number of problems.
