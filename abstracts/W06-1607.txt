We discuss different strategies for smooth-
ing the phrasetable in Statistical MT, and
give results over a range of translation set-
tings. We show that any type of smooth-
ing is a better idea than the relative-
frequency estimates that are often used.
The best smoothing techniques yield con-
sistent gains of approximately 1% (abso-
lute) according to the BLEU metric.
