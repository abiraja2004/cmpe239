This paper describes the extraction from
Wikipedia of lexical reference rules, iden-
tifying references to term meanings trig-
gered by other terms. We present extrac-
tion methods geared to cover the broad
range of the lexical reference relation and
analyze them extensively. Most extrac-
tion methods yield high precision levels,
and our rule-base is shown to perform bet-
ter than other automatically constructed
baselines in a couple of lexical expan-
sion and matching tasks. Our rule-base
yields comparable performance to Word-
Net while providing largely complemen-
tary information.
