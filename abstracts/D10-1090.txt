We present PEM, the first fully automatic met-
ric to evaluate the quality of paraphrases, and
consequently, that of paraphrase generation
systems. Our metric is based on three crite-
ria: adequacy, fluency, and lexical dissimilar-
ity. The key component in our metric is a ro-
bust and shallow semantic similarity measure
based on pivot language N-grams that allows
us to approximate adequacy independently of
lexical similarity. Human evaluation shows
that PEM achieves high correlation with hu-
man judgments.
