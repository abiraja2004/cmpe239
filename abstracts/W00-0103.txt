 
This paper presents an algorithm for finding 
systematic polysemous classes in WordNet 
and similar semantic databases, based on a 
definition in (Apresjan 1973). The 
introduction of systematic polysemous 
classes can reduce the amount of lexical 
semantic processing, because the number of 
disambiguation decisions can be restricted 
more clearly to those cases that involve real 
ambiguity (homonymy). In many 
applications, for instance in document 
categorization, information retrieval, and 
information extraction, it may be sufficient 
to know if a given word belongs to a certain 
class (underspecified sense) rather than to 
know which of its (related) senses exactly to 
pick. The approach for finding systematic 
polysemous classes is based on that of 
(Buitelaar 1998a, Buitelaar 1998b), while 
addressing some previous hortcomings.
