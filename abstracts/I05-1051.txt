. The merit of phrase-based statistical machine translation is
often reduced by the complexity to construct it. In this paper, we ad-
dress some issues in phrase-based statistical machine translation, namely:
the size of the phrase translation table, the use of underlying transla-
tion model probability and the length of the phrase unit. We present
Level-Of-Detail (LOD) approach, an agglomerative approach for learn-
ing phrase-level alignment. Our experiments show that LOD approach
significantly improves the performance of the word-based approach. LOD
demonstrates a clear advantage that the phrase translation table grows
only sub-linearly over the maximum phrase length, while having a per-
formance comparable to those of other phrase-based approaches.
