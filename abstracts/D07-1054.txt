We propose a domain specific model for
statistical machine translation. It is well-
known that domain specific language mod-
els perform well in automatic speech recog-
nition. We show that domain specific lan-
guage and translation models also benefit
statistical machine translation. However,
there are two problems with using domain
specific models. The first is the data sparse-
ness problem. We employ an adaptation
technique to overcome this problem. The
second issue is domain prediction. In or-
der to perform adaptation, the domain must
be provided, however in many cases, the
domain is not known or changes dynami-
cally. For these cases, not only the trans-
lation target sentence but also the domain
must be predicted. This paper focuses on
the domain prediction problem for statisti-
cal machine translation. In the proposed
method, a bilingual training corpus, is au-
tomatically clustered into sub-corpora. Each
sub-corpus is deemed to be a domain. The
domain of a source sentence is predicted by
using its similarity to the sub-corpora. The
predicted domain (sub-corpus) specific lan-
guage and translation models are then used
for the translation decoding. This approach
gave an improvement of 2.7 in BLEU (Pa-
pineni et al, 2002) score on the IWSLT05
Japanese to English evaluation corpus (im-
proving the score from 52.4 to 55.1). This is
a substantial gain and indicates the validity
of the proposed bilingual cluster based mod-
els.
