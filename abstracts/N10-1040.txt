We investigate methods of generating addi-
tional bilingual phrase pairs for a phrase-
based decoder by translating short sequences
of source text. Because our translation task
is more constrained, we can use a model that
employs more linguistically rich features than
a traditional decoder. We have implemented
an example of this approach. Experimental re-
sults suggest that the phrase pairs produced by
our method are useful to the decoder, and lead
to improved sentence translations.
