This paper presents a technique for 
transliteration based directly on techniques 
developed for phrase-based statistical 
machine translation. The focus of our work 
is in providing a transliteration system that 
could be used to translate unknown words 
in a speech-to-speech machine translation 
system. Therefore the system must  be able 
to generate arbitrary sequence of characters 
in the target language, rather than words 
chosen from a pre-determined vocabulary. 
We evalauted our method automatically 
relative to a set of human-annotated 
reference transliterations as well as by 
assessing it  for correctness using human 
evaluators. Our experimental results 
demonstrate that for both transliteration 
and back-transliteration the system is able 
to produce correct, or phonetically 
e q u i v a l e n t t o c o r r e c t o u t p u t  i n 
approximately 80% of cases.
