We extend previous work on tree kernels to estimate
the similarity between the dependency trees of sen-
tences. Using this kernel within a Support Vector
Machine, we detect and classify relations between
entities in the Automatic Content Extraction (ACE)
corpus of news articles. We examine the utility of
different features such as Wordnet hypernyms, parts
of speech, and entity types, and find that the depen-
dency tree kernel achieves a 20% F1 improvement
over a ?bag-of-words? kernel.
