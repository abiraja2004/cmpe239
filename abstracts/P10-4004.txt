 
GernEdiT (short for: GermaNet Editing Tool) offers a graphical interface for the lexicogra-phers and developers of GermaNet to access and modify the underlying GermaNet re-source. GermaNet is a lexical-semantic word-net that is modeled after the Princeton Word-Net for English. The traditional lexicographic development of GermaNet was error prone and time-consuming, mainly due to a complex underlying data format and no opportunity of automatic consistency checks. GernEdiT re-places the earlier development by a more user-friendly tool, which facilitates automatic checking of internal consistency and correct-ness of the linguistic resource. This paper pre-sents all these core functionalities of GernEdiT along with details about its usage and usabil-ity. 1
