This paper describes our approaches to Na-
tive Language Identification (NLI) for the NLI
shared task 2013. NLI as a sub area of au-
thor profiling focuses on identifying the first
language of an author given a text in his sec-
ond language. Researchers have reported sev-
eral sets of features that have achieved rel-
atively good performance in this task. The
type of features used in such works are: lex-
ical, syntactic and stylistic features, depen-
dency parsers, psycholinguistic features and
grammatical errors. In our approaches, we se-
lected lexical and syntactic features based on
n-grams of characters, words, Penn TreeBank
(PTB) and Universal Parts Of Speech (POS)
tagsets, and perplexity values of character of
n-grams to build four different models. We
also combine all the four models using an en-
semble based approach to get the final result.
We evaluated our approach over a set of 11 na-
tive languages reaching 75% accuracy.
