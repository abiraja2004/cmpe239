We present a generative model for unsuper-
vised coreference resolution that views coref-
erence as an EM clustering process. For
comparison purposes, we revisit Haghighi
and Klein?s (2007) fully-generative Bayesian
model for unsupervised coreference resolu-
tion, discuss its potential weaknesses and con-
sequently propose three modifications to their
model. Experimental results on the ACE data
sets show that our model outperforms their
original model by a large margin and com-
pares favorably to the modified model.
