User-contributed content is creating a surge on
the Internet. A list of ?buzzing topics? can
effectively monitor the surge and lead people
to their topics of interest. Yet a topic phrase
alone, such as ?SXSW?, can rarely present
the information clearly. In this paper, we
propose to explore a variety of text sources
for summarizing the Twitter topics, includ-
ing the tweets, normalized tweets via a ded-
icated tweet normalization system, web con-
tents linked from the tweets, as well as inte-
gration of different text sources. We employ
the concept-based optimization framework for
topic summarization, and conduct both au-
tomatic and human evaluation regarding the
summary quality. Performance differences are
observed for different input sources and types
of topics. We also provide a comprehensive
analysis regarding the task challenges.
