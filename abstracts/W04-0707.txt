Vieira and Poesio (2000) proposed an algorithm for
definite description (DD) resolution that incorpo-
rates a number of heuristics for detecting discourse-
new descriptions. The inclusion of such detec-
tors was motivated by the observation that more
than 50% of definite descriptions (DDs) in an av-
erage corpus are discourse new (Poesio and Vieira,
1998), but whereas the inclusion of detectors for
non-anaphoric pronouns in algorithms such as Lap-
pin and Leass? (1994) leads to clear improvements
in precision, the improvements in anaphoric DD res-
olution (as opposed to classification) brought about
by the detectors were rather small. In fact, Ng and
Cardie (2002a) challenged the motivation for the
inclusion of such detectors, reporting no improve-
ments, or even worse performance. We re-examine
the literature on the topic in detail, and propose a re-
vised algorithm, taking advantage of the improved
discourse-new detection techniques developed by
Uryupina (2003).
