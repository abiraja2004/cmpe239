Confidence-Weighted linear classifiers (CW)
and its successors were shown to perform
well on binary and multiclass NLP prob-
lems. In this paper we extend the CW ap-
proach for sequence learning and show that it
achieves state-of-the-art performance on four
noun phrase chucking and named entity recog-
nition tasks. We then derive few algorith-
mic approaches to estimate the prediction?s
correctness of each label in the output se-
quence. We show that our approach provides
a reliable relative correctness information as
it outperforms other alternatives in ranking
label-predictions according to their error. We
also show empirically that our methods output
close to absolute estimation of error. Finally,
we show how to use this information to im-
prove active learning.
