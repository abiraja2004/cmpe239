the collocations in time dimension, and the interesting collocations related to special events. The temporal mutual information is 
employed to observe the strength of term-to-term associations over time. An event detection algorithm identifies the collocations that 
may cause an event in a specific timestamp. An event summarization algorithm retrieves a set of collocations which describe an event. 
We compare our approach with the approach without considering the time interval. The experimental results demonstrate that the 
temporal collocations capture the real world semantics and real world events over time.
