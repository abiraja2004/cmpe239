During language acquisition, children learn
to segment speech into phonemes, syllables,
morphemes, and words. We examine word
segmentation specifically, and explore the
possibility that children might have general-
purpose chunking mechanisms to perform
word segmentation. The Voting Experts (VE)
and Bootstrapped Voting Experts (BVE) algo-
rithms serve as computational models of this
chunking ability. VE finds chunks by search-
ing for a particular information-theoretic sig-
nature: low internal entropy and high bound-
ary entropy. BVE adds to VE the abil-
ity to incorporate information about word
boundaries previously found by the algorithm
into future segmentations. We evaluate the
general chunking model on phonemically-
encoded corpora of child-directed speech, and
show that it is consistent with empirical results
in the developmental literature. We argue that
it offers a parsimonious alternative to special-
purpose linguistic models.
