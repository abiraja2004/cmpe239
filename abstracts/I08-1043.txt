This study presents a method to automat-
ically acquire paraphrases using bilingual
corpora, which utilizes the bilingual de-
pendency relations obtained by projecting
a monolingual dependency parse onto the
other language sentence based on statisti-
cal alignment techniques. Since the para-
phrasing method is capable of clearly disam-
biguating the sense of an original phrase us-
ing the bilingual context of dependency re-
lation, it would be possible to obtain inter-
changeable paraphrases under a given con-
text. Also, we provide an advanced method
to acquire generalized translation knowl-
edge using the extracted paraphrases. We
applied the method to acquire the gener-
alized translation knowledge for Korean-
English translation. Through experiments
with parallel corpora of a Korean and En-
glish language pairs, we show that our para-
phrasing method effectively extracts para-
phrases with high precision, 94.3% and
84.6% respectively for Korean and English,
and the translation knowledge extracted
from the bilingual corpora could be general-
ized successfully using the paraphrases with
the 12.5% compression ratio.
