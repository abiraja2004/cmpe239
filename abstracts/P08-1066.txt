In this paper, we propose a novel string-to-
dependency algorithm for statistical machine
translation. With this new framework, we em-
ploy a target dependency language model dur-
ing decoding to exploit long distance word
relations, which are unavailable with a tra-
ditional n-gram language model. Our ex-
periments show that the string-to-dependency
decoder achieves 1.48 point improvement in
BLEU and 2.53 point improvement in TER
compared to a standard hierarchical string-to-
string system on the NIST 04 Chinese-English
evaluation set.
