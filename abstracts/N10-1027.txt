Language identification is the task of identify-
ing the language a given document is written
in. This paper describes a detailed examina-
tion of what models perform best under dif-
ferent conditions, based on experiments across
three separate datasets and a range of tokeni-
sation strategies. We demonstrate that the task
becomes increasingly difficult as we increase
the number of languages, reduce the amount
of training data and reduce the length of docu-
ments. We also show that it is possible to per-
form language identification without having to
perform explicit character encoding detection.
