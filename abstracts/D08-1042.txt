This paper introduces a new kernel which
computes similarity between two natural lan-
guage sentences as the number of paths shared
by their dependency trees. The paper gives a
very efficient algorithm to compute it. This
kernel is also an improvement over the word
subsequence kernel because it only counts
linguistically meaningful word subsequences
which are based on word dependencies. It
overcomes some of the difficulties encoun-
tered by syntactic tree kernels as well. Ex-
perimental results demonstrate the advantage
of this kernel over word subsequence and syn-
tactic tree kernels.
