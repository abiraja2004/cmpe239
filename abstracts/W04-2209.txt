  
The JMdict project has at its aim the 
compilation of a multilingual lexical 
database with Japanese as the pivot 
language. Using an XML structure designed 
to cater for a mix of languages and a rich set 
of lexicographic information, it has reached 
a size of approximately 100,000 entries, 
with most entries having translations in 
English, French and German. The 
compilation involves information re-use, 
with the French and German translations 
being drawn from separately maintained 
lexicons. Material from other languages is 
also being included. The file is freely 
available for research purposes and for 
incorporation in dictionary application 
software, and is available in several WWW 
server systems.
