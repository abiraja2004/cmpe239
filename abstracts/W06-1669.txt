This paper explores the use of two graph
algorithms for unsupervised induction and
tagging of nominal word senses based on
corpora. Our main contribution is the op-
timization of the free parameters of those
algorithms and its evaluation against pub-
licly available gold standards. We present
a thorough evaluation comprising super-
vised and unsupervised modes, and both
lexical-sample and all-words tasks. The
results show that, in spite of the infor-
mation loss inherent to mapping the in-
duced senses to the gold-standard, the
optimization of parameters based on a
small sample of nouns carries over to all
nouns, performing close to supervised sys-
tems in the lexical sample task and yield-
ing the second-best WSD systems for the
Senseval-3 all-words task.
