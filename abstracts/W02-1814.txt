  
Pronunciation-translated names (P-Names) 
bring more ambiguities to Chinese word 
segmentation and generic named entity 
recognition. As there are few annotated 
resources that can be used to develop a good 
P-Name extraction system, this paper 
presents a bootstrapping algorithm, called 
PN-Finder, to tackle this problem. Starting 
from a small set of P-Name characters and 
context cue-words, the algorithm iteratively 
locates more P-Names from the Internet. 
The algorithm uses a combination of 
P-Name and context word probabilities to 
identify new P-Names. Experiments show 
that our PN-Finder is able to locate a large 
number of P-Names (over 100,000) from the 
Internet with a high recognition accuracy of 
over 85%. Further tests on the MET-2 test 
set show that our PN-Finder can achieve a 
performance of over 90% in F1 value in 
locating P-Names. The results demonstrate 
that our PN-Finder is effective.
