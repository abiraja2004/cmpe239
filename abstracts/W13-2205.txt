We describe the CMU systems submit-
ted to the 2013 WMT shared task in ma-
chine translation. We participated in three
language pairs, French?English, Russian?
English, and English?Russian. Our
particular innovations include: a label-
coarsening scheme for syntactic tree-to-
tree translation and the use of specialized
modules to create ?synthetic translation
options? that can both generalize beyond
what is directly observed in the parallel
training data and use rich source language
context to decide how a phrase should
translate in context.
