Classical Information Extraction (IE) sys-
tems fill slots in domain-specific frames.
This paper reports on SEQ, a novel
open IE system that leverages a domain-
independent frame to extract ordered se-
quences such as presidents of the United
States or the most common causes of death
in the U.S. SEQ leverages regularities
about sequences to extract a coherent set
of sequences from Web text. SEQ nearly
doubles the area under the precision-recall
curve compared to an extractor that does
not exploit these regularities.
