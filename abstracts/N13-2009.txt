We examine the application of data-driven
paraphrasing to natural language understand-
ing. We leverage bilingual parallel corpora
to extract a large collection of syntactic para-
phrase pairs, and introduce an adaptation
scheme that allows us to tackle a variety of
text transformation tasks via paraphrasing. We
evaluate our system on the sentence compres-
sion task. Further, we use distributional sim-
ilarity measures based on context vectors de-
rived from large monolingual corpora to anno-
tate our paraphrases with an orthogonal source
of information. This yields significant im-
provements in our compression system?s out-
put quality, achieving state-of-the-art perfor-
mance. Finally, we propose a refinement of
our paraphrases by classifying them into nat-
ural logic entailment relations. By extend-
ing the synchronous parsing paradigm towards
these entailment relations, we will enable our
system to perform recognition of textual en-
tailment.
