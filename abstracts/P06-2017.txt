Cross-linguistic similarities are reflected
by the speech sound systems of languages
all over the world. In this work we try
to model such similarities observed in the
consonant inventories, through a complex
bipartite network. We present a systematic
study of some of the appealing features of
these inventories with the help of the bi-
partite network. An important observation
is that the occurrence of consonants fol-
lows a two regime power law distribution.
We find that the consonant inventory size
distribution together with the principle of
preferential attachment are the main rea-
sons behind the emergence of such a two
regime behavior. In order to further sup-
port our explanation we present a synthe-
sis model for this network based on the
general theory of preferential attachment.
