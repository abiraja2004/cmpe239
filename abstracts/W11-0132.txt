This paper reports on an exploratory investigation as to whether classes of Urdu N-V com-
plex predicates can be identified on the basis syntactic patterns and lexical choices associated
with the N-V complex predicates. Working with data from a POS annotated corpus, we show
that choices with respect to the number of arguments, case marking on subjects and which
light verbs are felicitous with which nouns depend heavily on the semantics of the noun in
the N-V complex predicate. This initial work represents an important step towards identi-
fying semantic criteria relevant for complex predicate formation. Identifying the semantic
criteria and being able to systematically code them in turn represents a first step towards
building up a lexical resource for nouns as part of developing natural language processing
tools for the underresourced South Asian language Urdu.
