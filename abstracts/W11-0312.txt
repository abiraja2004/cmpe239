We present a computational model of lan-
guage learning via a sequence of interactions
between a teacher and a learner. Experiments
learning limited sublanguages of 10 natural
languages show that the learner achieves a
high level of performance after a reasonable
number of interactions, the teacher can pro-
duce meaning-preserving corrections of the
learner?s utterances, and the learner can de-
tect them. The learner does not treat correc-
tions specially; nonetheless in several cases,
significantly fewer interactions are needed by
a learner interacting with a correcting teacher
than with a non-correcting teacher.
