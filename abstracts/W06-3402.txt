In a context where information retrieval is
extended to spoken ?documents? includ-
ing conversations, it will be important to
provide users with the ability to seek in-
formational content, rather than socially
motivated small talk that appears in many
conversational sources. In this paper we
present a preliminary study aimed at auto-
matically identifying ?irrelevance? in the
domain of telephone conversations. We
apply a standard machine learning algo-
rithm to build a classifier that detects off-
topic sections with better-than-chance ac-
curacy and that begins to provide insight
into the relative importance of features for
identifying utterances as on topic or not.
