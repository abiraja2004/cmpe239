 
In this paper, we construct a biomedical 
semantic role labeling (SRL) system that 
can be used to facilitate relation extraction. 
First, we construct a proposition bank on 
top of the popular biomedical GENIA 
treebank following the PropBank annota-
tion scheme. We only annotate the predi-
cate-argument structures (PAS?s) of thirty 
frequently used biomedical predicates and 
their corresponding arguments. Second, 
we use our proposition bank to train a 
biomedical SRL system, which uses a 
maximum entropy (ME) model. Thirdly, 
we automatically generate argument-type 
templates which can be used to improve 
classification of biomedical argument 
types. Our experimental results show that 
a newswire SRL system that achieves an 
F-score of 86.29% in the newswire do-
main can maintain an F-score of 64.64% 
when ported to the biomedical domain. 
By using our annotated biomedical corpus, 
we can increase that F-score by 22.9%. 
Adding automatically generated template 
features further increases overall F-score 
by 0.47% and adjunct arguments (AM) F-
score by 1.57%, respectively.
