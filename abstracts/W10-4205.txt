We describe a method for assigning English
tense and aspect in a system that realizes sur-
face text for symbolically encoded narratives. Our
testbed is an encoding interface in which proposi-
tions that are attached to a timeline must be real-
ized from several temporal viewpoints. This in-
volves a mapping from a semantic encoding of
time to a set of tense/aspect permutations. The
encoding tool realizes each permutation to give
a readable, precise description of the narrative so
that users can check whether they have correctly
encoded actions and statives in the formal repre-
sentation. Our method selects tenses and aspects
for individual event intervals as well as subinter-
vals (with multiple reference points), quoted and
unquoted speech (which reassign the temporal fo-
cus), and modal events such as conditionals.
