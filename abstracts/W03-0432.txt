We present a named entity recognition and
classification system that uses only probabilis-
tic character-level features. Classifications by
multiple orthographic tries are combined in a
hidden Markov model framework to incorpo-
rate both internal and contextual evidence. As
part of the system, we perform a preprocess-
ing stage in which capitalisation is restored to
sentence-initial and all-caps words with high
accuracy. We report f-values of 86.65 and
79.78 for English, and 50.62 and 54.43 for the
German datasets.
