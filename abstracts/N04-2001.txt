 
This paper analyzes various issues in building 
a HMM based multilingual speech recognizer 
for Indian languages. The system is originally 
designed for Hindi and Tamil languages and 
adapted to incorporate Indian accented Eng-
lish. Language-specific characteristics in 
speech recognition framework are highlighted. 
The recognizer is embedded in information re-
trieval applications and hence several issues 
like handling spontaneous telephony speech in 
real-time, integrated language identification 
for interactive response and automatic graph-
eme to phoneme conversion to handle Out Of 
Vocabulary words are addressed. Experiments 
to study relative effectiveness of different al-
gorithms have been performed and the results 
are investigated.
