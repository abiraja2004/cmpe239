This paper presents an approach to person
name disambiguation using K-means clus-
tering on rich-feature-enhanced document
vectors, augmented with additional web-
extracted snippets surrounding the polyse-
mous names to facilitate term bridging. This
yields a significant F-measure improvement
on the shared task training data set. The pa-
per also illustrates the significant divergence
between the properties of the training and
test data in this shared task, substantially
skewing results. Our system optimized on
F0.2 rather than F0.5 would have achieved
top performance in the shared task.
