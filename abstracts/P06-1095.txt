 
This paper investigates a machine learn-
ing approach for temporally ordering and 
anchoring events in natural language 
texts. To address data sparseness, we 
used temporal reasoning as an over-
sampling method to dramatically expand 
the amount of training data, resulting in 
predictive accuracy on link labeling as 
high as 93% using a Maximum Entropy 
classifier on human annotated data. This 
method compared favorably against a se-
ries of increasingly sophisticated base-
lines involving expansion of rules de-
rived from human intuitions.
