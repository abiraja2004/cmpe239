 
We discuss several feature sets for 
novelty detection at the sentence level, 
using the data and procedure established 
in task 2 of the TREC 2004 novelty track. 
In particular, we investigate feature sets 
derived from graph representations of 
sentences and sets of sentences. We show 
that a highly connected graph produced 
by using sentence-level term distances 
and pointwise mutual information can 
serve as a source to extract features for 
novelty detection. We compare several 
feature sets based on such a graph 
representation. These feature sets allow us 
to increase the accuracy of an initial 
novelty classifier which is based on a bag-
of-word representation and KL 
divergence. The final result ties with the 
best system at TREC 2004.
