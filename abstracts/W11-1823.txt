We introduce our incremental coreference res-
olution system for the BioNLP 2011 Shared
Task on Protein/Gene interaction. The benefits
of an incremental architecture over a mention-
pair model are: a reduction of the number
of candidate pairs, a means to overcome the
problem of underspecified items in pair-wise
classification and the natural integration of
global constraints such as transitivity. A fil-
tering system takes into account specific fea-
tures of different anaphora types. We do not
apply Machine Learning, instead the system
classifies with an empirically derived salience
measure based on the dependency labels of the
true mentions. The OntoGene pipeline is used
for preprocessing.
