We present the design, preparation, results
and analysis of the Cancer Genetics (CG)
event extraction task, a main task of the
BioNLP Shared Task (ST) 2013. The CG
task is an information extraction task tar-
geting the recognition of events in text,
represented as structured n-ary associa-
tions of given physical entities. In addition
to addressing the cancer domain, the CG
task is differentiated from previous event
extraction tasks in the BioNLP ST series
in addressing a wide range of pathological
processes and multiple levels of biological
organization, ranging from the molecular
through the cellular and organ levels up to
whole organisms. Final test set submis-
sions were accepted from six teams. The
highest-performing system achieved an F-
score of 55.4%. This level of performance
is broadly comparable with the state of
the art for established molecular-level ex-
traction tasks, demonstrating that event ex-
traction resources and methods generalize
well to higher levels of biological orga-
nization and are applicable to the analy-
sis of scientific texts on cancer. The CG
task continues as an open challenge to
all interested parties, with tools and re-
sources available from http://2013.
