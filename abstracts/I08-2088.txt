Target task matched parallel corpora are re-
quired for statistical translation model train-
ing. However, training corpora sometimes
include both target task matched and un-
matched sentences. In such a case, train-
ing set selection can reduce the size of the
translation model. In this paper, we propose
a training set selection method for transla-
tion model training using linear translation
model interpolation and a language model
technique. According to the experimental
results, the proposed method reduces the
translation model size by 50% and improves
BLEU score by 1.76% in comparison with a
baseline training corpus usage.
