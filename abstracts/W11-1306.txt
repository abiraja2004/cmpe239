This paper describes three systems from the
University of Minnesota, Duluth that partici-
pated in the DiSCo 2011 shared task that eval-
uated distributional methods of measuring se-
mantic compositionality. All three systems
approached this as a problem of collocation
identification, where strong collocates are as-
sumed to be minimally compositional. duluth-
1 relies on the t-score, whereas duluth-2 and
duluth-3 rely on Pointwise Mutual Informa-
tion (pmi). duluth-1 was the top ranked sys-
tem overall in coarse?grained scoring, which
was a 3-way category assignment where pairs
were assigned values of high, medium, or low
compositionality.
