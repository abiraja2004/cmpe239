Developing natural language processing
tools for low-resource languages often re-
quires creating resources from scratch.
While a variety of semi-supervised meth-
ods exist for training from incomplete
data, there are open questions regarding
what types of training data should be used
and how much is necessary. We dis-
cuss a series of experiments designed to
shed light on such questions in the con-
text of part-of-speech tagging. We obtain
timed annotations from linguists for the
low-resource languages Kinyarwanda and
Malagasy (as well as English) and eval-
uate how the amounts of various kinds
of data affect performance of a trained
POS-tagger. Our results show that an-
notation of word types is the most im-
portant, provided a sufficiently capable
semi-supervised learning infrastructure is
in place to project type information onto
a raw corpus. We also show that finite-
state morphological analyzers are effective
sources of type information when few la-
beled examples are available.
