Opinion mining and sentiment analy-
sis has recently gained increasing atten-
tion among the NLP community. Opin-
ion mining is considered a domain-
dependent task. Constructing lexicons
for different domains is labor intensive.
In this paper, we propose a framework
for constructing Thai language resource
for feature-based opinion mining. The
feature-based opinion mining essentially
relies on the use of two main lexicons,
features and polar words. Our approach
for extracting features and polar words
from opinionated texts is based on syn-
tactic pattern analysis. The evaluation
is performed with a case study on ho-
tel reviews. The proposed method has
shown to be very effective in most cases.
However, in some cases, the extraction
is not quite straightforward. The rea-
sons are due to, firstly, the use of conver-
sational language in written opinionated
texts and, secondly, the language seman-
tic. We provide discussion with possible
solutions on pattern extraction for some
of the challenging cases.
