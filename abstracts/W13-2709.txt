Manually assigned keywords provide a
valuable means for accessing large docu-
ment collections. They can serve as a shal-
low document summary and enable more
efficient retrieval and aggregation of infor-
mation. In this paper we investigate key-
words in the context of the Dutch Folk-
tale Database, a large collection of stories
including fairy tales, jokes and urban leg-
ends. We carry out a quantitative and qual-
itative analysis of the keywords in the col-
lection. Up to 80% of the assigned key-
words (or a minor variation) appear in the
text itself. Human annotators show moder-
ate to substantial agreement in their judg-
ment of keywords. Finally, we evaluate a
learning to rank approach to extract and
rank keyword candidates. We conclude
that this is a promising approach to auto-
mate this time intensive task.
