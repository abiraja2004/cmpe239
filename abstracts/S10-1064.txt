 
This paper describes our system 
participating in task 18 of SemEval-2010, 
i.e. disambiguating Sentiment-
Ambiguous Adjectives (SAAs). To 
disambiguating SAAs, we compare the 
machine learning-based and lexicon-
based methods in our submissions: 1) 
Maximum entropy is used to train  
classifiers based on the annotated 
Chinese data from the NTCIR opinion 
analysis tasks, and the clause-level and 
sentence-level classifiers are compared; 
2) For the lexicon-based method, we first 
classify the adjectives into two classes: 
intensifiers (i.e. adjectives intensifying 
the intensity of context) and suppressors 
(i.e. adjectives decreasing the intensity of 
context), and then use the polarity of 
context to get the SAAs? contextual 
polarity based on a sentiment lexicon. 
The results show that the performance of 
maximum entropy is not quite high due 
to little training data; on the other hand, 
the lexicon-based method could improve 
the precision by considering the polarity 
of context.
