Automatic processing of medical dictations
poses a significant challenge. We approach
the problem by introducing a statistical frame-
work capable of identifying types and bound-
aries of sections, lists and other structures
occurring in a dictation, thereby gaining ex-
plicit knowledge about the function of such
elements. Training data is created semi-
automatically by aligning a parallel corpus
of corrected medical reports and correspond-
ing transcripts generated via automatic speech
recognition. We highlight the properties of
our statistical framework, which is based on
conditional random fields (CRFs) and im-
plemented as an efficient, publicly available
toolkit. Finally, we show that our approach
is effective both under ideal conditions and
for real-life dictation involving speech recog-
nition errors and speech-related phenomena
such as hesitation and repetitions.
