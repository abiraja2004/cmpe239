Recent research presents conflicting evi-
dence on whether word sense disambigua-
tion (WSD) systems can help to improve the
performance of statistical machine transla-
tion (MT) systems. In this paper, we suc-
cessfully integrate a state-of-the-art WSD
system into a state-of-the-art hierarchical
phrase-based MT system, Hiero. We show
for the first time that integrating a WSD sys-
tem improves the performance of a state-of-
the-art statistical MT system on an actual
translation task. Furthermore, the improve-
ment is statistically significant.
