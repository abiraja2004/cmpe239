This study explores the feasibility of perform-
ing Chinese word segmentation (CWS) and
POS tagging by deep learning. We try to avoid
task-specific feature engineering, and use deep
layers of neural networks to discover relevant
features to the tasks. We leverage large-scale
unlabeled data to improve internal representa-
tion of Chinese characters, and use these im-
proved representations to enhance supervised
word segmentation and POS tagging models.
Our networks achieved close to state-of-the-
art performance with minimal computational
cost. We also describe a perceptron-style al-
gorithm for training the neural networks, as
an alternative to maximum-likelihood method,
to speed up the training process and make the
learning algorithm easier to be implemented.
