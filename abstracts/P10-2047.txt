We establish the following characteris-
tics of the task of perspective classifi-
cation: (a) using term frequencies in a
document does not improve classification
achieved with absence/presence features;
(b) for datasets allowing the relevant com-
parisons, a small number of top features is
found to be as effective as the full feature
set and indispensable for the best achieved
performance, testifying to the existence
of perspective-specific keywords. We re-
late our findings to research on word fre-
quency distributions and to discourse ana-
lytic studies of perspective.
