The automatic extraction of trend informa-
tion from text documents such as news-
paper articles would be useful for explor-
ing and examining trends. To enable this,
we used data sets provided by a workshop
on multimodal summarization for trend in-
formation (the MuST Workshop) to con-
struct an automatic trend exploration sys-
tem. This system first extracts units, tem-
porals, and item expressions from news-
paper articles, then it extracts sets of ex-
pressions as trend information, and finally
it arranges the sets and displays them in
graphs. For example, when documents
concerning the politics are given, the sys-
tem extracts ?%? and ?Cabinet approval
rating? as a unit and an item expression in-
cluding temporal expressions. It next ex-
tracts values related to ?%?. Finally, it
makes a graph where temporal expressions
are used for the horizontal axis and the
value of percentage is shown on the ver-
tical axis. This graph indicates the trend
of Cabinet approval rating and is useful
for investigating Cabinet approval rating.
Graphs are obviously easy to recognize
and useful for understanding information
described in documents. In experiments,
when we judged the extraction of a correct
graph as the top output to be correct, the
system accuracy was 0.2500 in evaluation
A and 0.3334 in evaluation B. (In evalua-
tion A, a graph where 75% or more of the
points were correct was judged to be cor-
rect; in evaluation B, a graph where 50%
or more of the points were correct was
judged to be correct.) When we judged
the extraction of a correct graph in the top
five outputs to be correct, accuracy rose to
0.4167 in evaluation A and 0.6250 in eval-
uation B. Our system is convenient and ef-
fective because it can output a graph that
includes trend information at these levels
of accuracy when given only a set of doc-
uments as input.
