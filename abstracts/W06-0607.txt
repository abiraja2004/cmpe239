 
This paper applies the categories from an 
opinion annotation scheme developed for 
monologue text to the genre of multiparty 
meetings. We describe modifications to 
the coding guidelines that were required 
to extend the categories to the new type 
of data, and present the results of an in-
ter-annotator agreement study. As re-
searchers have found with other types of 
annotations in speech data, inter-
annotator agreement is higher when the 
annotators both read and listen to the data 
than when they only read the transcripts.   
Previous work exploited prosodic clues 
to perform automatic detection of speaker 
emotion (Liscombe et al 2003). Our 
findings suggest that doing so to recog-
nize opinion categories would be a prom-
ising line of work.
