 
In this paper, we present a Chinese event ex-
traction system. We point out a language spe-
cific issue in Chinese trigger labeling, and 
then commit to discussing the contributions of 
lexical, syntactic and semantic features ap-
plied in trigger labeling and argument labeling. 
As a result, we achieved competitive perform-
ance, specifically, F-measure of 59.9 in trigger 
labeling and F-measure of 43.8 in argument 
labeling.
