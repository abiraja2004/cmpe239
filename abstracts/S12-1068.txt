This paper presents the systems we developed
while participating in the first task (English
Lexical Simplification) of SemEval 2012. Our
first system relies on n-grams frequencies
computed from the Simple English Wikipedia
version, ranking each substitution term by de-
creasing frequency of use. We experimented
with several other systems, based on term fre-
quencies, or taking into account the context in
which each substitution term occurs. On the
evaluation corpus, we achieved a 0.465 score
with the first system.
