This paper discusses preliminary work investi-
gating the application of Machine Translation
(MT) metrics toward the evaluation of transla-
tions written by human novice (student) trans-
lators. We describe a study in which we ap-
ply the metric TERp (Translation Edit Rate
Plus) to a corpus of student-written transla-
tions from Spanish to English and compare the
judgments of TERp against assessments pro-
vided by a translation instructor.
