This paper discusses our contribution to the
third RTE Challenge ? the SALSA RTE sys-
tem. It builds on an earlier system based on
a relatively deep linguistic analysis, which
we complement with a shallow component
based on word overlap. We evaluate their
(combined) performance on various data
sets. However, earlier observations that the
combination of features improves the over-
all accuracy could be replicated only partly.
