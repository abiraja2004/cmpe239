 
Medical concepts in clinical reports can be 
found with a high degree of variability of ex-
pression. Normalizing medical concepts to 
standardized vocabularies is a common way 
of accounting for this variability. One of the 
challenges in medical concept normalization 
is the difficulty in comparing two concepts 
which are orthographically different in repre-
sentation but are identical in meaning. In this 
work we describe a method to compare medi-
cal phrases by utilizing the information found 
in syntactic dependencies. We collected a 
large corpus of radiology reports from our 
university medical center. A shallow semantic 
parser was used to identify anatomical phras-
es. We performed a series of transformations 
to convert the anatomical phrase into a norma-
lized syntactic dependency representation. 
The new representation provides an easy in-
tuitive way of comparing the phrases for the 
purpose of concept normalization.
