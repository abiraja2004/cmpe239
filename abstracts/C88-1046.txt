 
Th.s paper explores the extent o which phoneme sequence 
constralnt'~ can be used to identify word boundaries in coutinnous 
speech recog~fition. The input consists of phonemic transcriptions 
(without word boundaries indicated) of 145 utterances produced by 
1 ~e speaker. The constraints are derived by matching the 
complete set of 3 phonente sequences that can occur' across word 
boundaries toentries in large lexicons containing both citation and 
reduced h)rm pronunciations. Phonemic assimilatoxy adjushnents 
across word boundaries are alse taken into account. The results 
show that around 37% of all word boundaries can be correctly 
identified t rom a knowledge of .~uch phoneme sequence contraints 
alone, and ~hat his figure rises to 45% when a knowledge of one- 
and two-phoneme words and all legal, word-initial and word-final, 
two-pitoneloe sequences are taken into account. The possibility of 
including :~uch constraints in tim architecture of a corrtinuous 
speech reeogniser is discussed.
