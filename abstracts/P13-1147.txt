Relation Extraction (RE) is the task of
extracting semantic relationships between
entities in text. Recent studies on rela-
tion extraction are mostly supervised. The
clear drawback of supervised methods is
the need of training data: labeled data is
expensive to obtain, and there is often a
mismatch between the training data and
the data the system will be applied to.
This is the problem of domain adapta-
tion. In this paper, we propose to combine
(i) term generalization approaches such as
word clustering and latent semantic anal-
ysis (LSA) and (ii) structured kernels to
improve the adaptability of relation ex-
tractors to new text genres/domains. The
empirical evaluation on ACE 2005 do-
mains shows that a suitable combination
of syntax and lexical generalization is very
promising for domain adaptation.
