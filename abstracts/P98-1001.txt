: The paper puts forward a quasi- 
dependency model for structural analysis of Chinese 
baseNPs and a MDL-based algorithm for quasi- 
dependency-strength acquisition. The experiments 
show that the proposed model is more suitable for 
Chinese baseNP analysis and the proposed MDL- 
based algorithm is superior to the traditional ML- 
based algorithm. The paper also discusses the 
problem of incorporating the linguistic knowledge 
into the above statistical model.
