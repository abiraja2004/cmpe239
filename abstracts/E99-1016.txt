 
This paper presents a new approach to 
partial parsing of context-free structures. 
The approach is based on Markov Mod- 
els. Each layer of the resulting structure 
is represented byits own Markov Model, 
and output of a lower layer is passed as 
input to the next higher layer. An em- 
pirical evaluation of the method yields 
very good results for NP/PP chunking of 
German ewspaper texts.
