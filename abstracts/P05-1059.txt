We present a version of Inversion Trans-
duction Grammar where rule probabili-
ties are lexicalized throughout the syn-
chronous parse tree, along with pruning
techniques for efficient training. Align-
ment results improve over unlexicalized
ITG on short sentences for which full EM
is feasible, but pruning seems to have a
negative impact on longer sentences.
