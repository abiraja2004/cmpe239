Multilingual Wikipedia has been used exten-
sively for a variety Natural Language Pro-
cessing (NLP) tasks. Many Wikipedia entries
(people, locations, events, etc.) have descrip-
tions in several languages. These descriptions,
however, are not identical. On the contrary,
descriptions in different languages created for
the same Wikipedia entry can vary greatly in
terms of description length and information
choice. Keeping these peculiarities in mind is
necessary while using multilingual Wikipedia
as a corpus for training and testing NLP ap-
plications. In this paper we present prelimi-
nary results on quantifying Wikipedia multi-
linguality. Our results support the observation
about the substantial variation in descriptions
of Wikipedia entries created in different lan-
guages. However, we believe that asymme-
tries in multilingual Wikipedia do not make
Wikipedia an undesirable corpus for NLP ap-
plications training. On the contrary, we out-
line research directions that can utilize multi-
lingual Wikipedia asymmetries to bridge the
communication gaps in multilingual societies.
