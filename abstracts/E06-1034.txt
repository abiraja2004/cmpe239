Faced with the problem of annotation er-
rors in part-of-speech (POS) annotated
corpora, we develop a method for auto-
matically correcting such errors. Build-
ing on top of a successful error detection
method, we first try correcting a corpus us-
ing two off-the-shelf POS taggers, based
on the idea that they enforce consistency;
with this, we find some improvement. Af-
ter some discussion of the tagging process,
we alter the tagging model to better ac-
count for problematic tagging distinctions.
This modification results in significantly
improved performance, reducing the error
rate of the corpus.
