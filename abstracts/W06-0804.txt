We consider the question of how informa-
tion from the textual context of citations
in scientific papers could improve index-
ing of the cited papers. We first present ex-
amples which show that the context should
in principle provide better and new index
terms. We then discuss linguistic phenom-
ena around citations and which type of
processing would improve the automatic
determination of the right context. We
present a case study, studying the effect
of combining the existing index terms of
a paper with additional terms from papers
citing that paper in our corpus. Finally, we
discuss the need for experimentation for
the practical validation of our claim.
