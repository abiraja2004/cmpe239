Semantic relations between main and complement sentences are of great signifi-
cance in any system of automatic data processing that depends on natural lan-
guage. In this paper we present a strategy for detecting author commitment to
the truth/falsity of complement clauses based on their syntactic type and on the
meaning of their embedding predicate. We show that the implications of a predi-
cate at an arbitrary depth of embedding about its complement clause depend on a
globally determined notion of relative polarity. We, moreover, observe that different
classes of complement-taking verbs have a different effect on the polarity of their
complement clauses and that this effect depends recursively on their own embed-
ding. A polarity propagation algorithm is presented as part of a general strategy of
canonicalization of linguistically-based representations, with a view to minimizing
the demands on the entailment and contradiction detection process.
