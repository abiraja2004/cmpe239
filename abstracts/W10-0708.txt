This study investigates the use of Amazon
Mechanical Turk for the transcription of non-
native speech. Multiple transcriptions were
obtained from several distinct MTurk workers
and were combined to produce merged tran-
scriptions that had higher levels of agreement
with a gold standard transcription than the in-
dividual transcriptions. Three different meth-
ods for merging transcriptions were compared
across two types of responses (spontaneous
and read-aloud). The results show that the
merged MTurk transcriptions are as accurate
as an individual expert transcriber for the read-
aloud responses, and are only slightly less ac-
curate for the spontaneous responses.
