Incremental processing allows system design-
ers to address several discourse phenomena
that have previously been somewhat neglected
in interactive systems, such as backchannels
or barge-ins, but that can enhance the re-
sponsiveness and naturalness of systems. Un-
fortunately, prior work has focused largely
on deterministic incremental decision mak-
ing, rendering system behaviour less flexible
and adaptive than is desirable. We present a
novel approach to incremental decision mak-
ing that is based on Hierarchical Reinforce-
ment Learning to achieve an interactive op-
timisation of Information Presentation (IP)
strategies, allowing the system to generate
and comprehend backchannels and barge-ins,
by employing the recent psycholinguistic hy-
pothesis of information density (ID) (Jaeger,
2010). Results in terms of average rewards
and a human rating study show that our learnt
strategy outperforms several baselines that are
not sensitive to ID by more than 23%.
