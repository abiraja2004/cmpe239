 
Recent studies into Web retrieval have 
shown that word sense disambiguation 
can increase retrieval effectiveness. How-
ever, it remains unclear as to the mini-
mum disambiguation accuracy required 
and the granularity with which one must 
define word sense in order to maximize 
these benefits. This study answers these 
questions using a simulation of the effects 
of ambiguity on information retrieval. It 
goes beyond previous studies by differen-
tiating between homonymy and 
polysemy. Results show that retrieval is 
more sensitive to polysemy than ho-
monymy and that, when resolving 
polysemy, accuracy as low as 55% can 
potentially lead to increased performance.
