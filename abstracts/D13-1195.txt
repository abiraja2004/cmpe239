Constituency parsing with rich grammars re-
mains a computational challenge. Graph-
ics Processing Units (GPUs) have previously
been used to accelerate CKY chart evalua-
tion, but gains over CPU parsers were mod-
est. In this paper, we describe a collection of
new techniques that enable chart evaluation at
close to the GPU?s practical maximum speed
(a Teraflop), or around a half-trillion rule eval-
uations per second. Net parser performance
on a 4-GPU system is over 1 thousand length-
30 sentences/second (1 trillion rules/sec), and
400 general sentences/second for the Berkeley
Parser Grammar. The techniques we introduce
include grammar compilation, recursive sym-
bol blocking, and cache-sharing.
