This paper describes adjective-to-verb
paraphrasing in Japanese. In this para-
phrasing, generated verbs require addi-
tional suffixes according to their difference
in meaning. To determine proper suffixes
for a given adjective-verb pair, we have ex-
amined the verbal features involved in the
theory of Lexical Conceptual Structure.
