identify Korean comparative sentences from 
text documents. This paper first investigates 
many comparative sentences referring to pre-
vious studies and then defines a set of compar-
ative keywords from them. A sentence which 
contains one or more elements of the keyword 
set is called a comparative-sentence candidate. 
Finally, we use machine learning techniques to 
eliminate non-comparative sentences from the 
candidates. As a result, we achieved signifi-
cant performance, an F1-score of 88.54%, in 
our experiments using various web documents.
