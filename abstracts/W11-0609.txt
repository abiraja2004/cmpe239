Conversational participants tend to immedi-
ately and unconsciously adapt to each other?s
language styles: a speaker will even adjust the
number of articles and other function words in
their next utterance in response to the number
in their partner?s immediately preceding utter-
ance. This striking level of coordination is
thought to have arisen as a way to achieve so-
cial goals, such as gaining approval or empha-
sizing difference in status. But has the adap-
tation mechanism become so deeply embed-
ded in the language-generation process as to
become a reflex? We argue that fictional di-
alogs offer a way to study this question, since
authors create the conversations but don?t re-
ceive the social benefits (rather, the imagined
characters do). Indeed, we find significant co-
ordination across many families of function
words in our large movie-script corpus. We
also report suggestive preliminary findings on
the effects of gender and other features; e.g.,
surprisingly, for articles, on average, charac-
ters adapt more to females than to males.
