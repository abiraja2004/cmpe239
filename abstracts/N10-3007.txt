In this paper we present a novel resampling
model for extractive meeting summarization.
With resampling based on the output of a base-
line classifier, our method outperforms previ-
ous research in the field. Further, we com-
pare an existing resampling technique with
our model. We report on an extensive se-
ries of experiments on a large meeting corpus
which leads to classification improvement in
weighted precision and f-score.
