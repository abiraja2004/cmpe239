This paper presents preliminary results of using
authorship attribution methods for the detec-
tion of sockpuppeteering in Wikipedia. Sock-
puppets are fake accounts created by malicious
users to bypass Wikipedia?s regulations. Our
dataset is composed of the comments made
by the editors on the talk pages. To overcome
the limitations of the short lengths of these
comments, we use an voting scheme to com-
bine predictions made on individual user en-
tries. We show that this approach is promising
and that it can be a viable alternative to the
current human process that Wikipedia uses to
resolve suspected sockpuppet cases.
