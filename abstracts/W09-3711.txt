Semantic space models represent the meaning of a word as a vector
in high-dimensional space. They offer a framework in which the mean-
ing representation of a word can be computed from its context, but the
question remains how they support inferences. While there has been
some work on paraphrase-based inferences in semantic space, it is not
clear how semantic space models would support inferences involving
hyponymy, like horse ran ? animal moved. In this paper, we first dis-
cuss what a point in semantic space stands for, contrasting semantic
space with Ga?rdenforsian conceptual space. Building on this, we pro-
pose an extension of the semantic space representation from a point
to a region. We present a model for learning a region representation
for word meaning in semantic space, based on the fact that points at
close distance tend to represent similar meanings. We show that this
model can be used to predict, with high precision, when a hyponymy-
based inference rule is applicable. Moving beyond paraphrase-based
and hyponymy-based inference rules, we last discuss in what way se-
mantic space models can support inferences.
