In this paper, we present a supervised classifi-
cation approach for disambiguation of prepo-
sition senses. We use the SemEval 2007
Preposition Sense Disambiguation datasets to
evaluate our system and compare its results to
those of the systems participating in the work-
shop. We derived linguistically motivated fea-
tures from both sides of the preposition. In-
stead of restricting these to a fixed window
size, we utilized the phrase structure. Testing
with five different classifiers, we can report an
increased accuracy that outperforms the best
system in the SemEval task.
