In this paper, we describe our two SemEval-
2007 entries. Our first entry, for Task 5:
Multilingual Chinese-English Lexical Sam-
ple Task, is a supervised system that decides
the most appropriate English translation of
a Chinese target word. This system uses a
combination of Na??ve Bayes, nearest neigh-
bor cosine, decision lists, and latent seman-
tic analysis. Our second entry, for Task 14:
Affective Text, is a supervised system that
annotates headlines using a predefined list of
emotions. This system uses synonym expan-
sion and matches lemmatized unigrams in
the test headlines against a corpus of hand-
annotated headlines.
