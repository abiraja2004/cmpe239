 
This demo describes the summarization of 
textual material about locations in the context 
of a geo-spatial information display system. 
When the amount of associated textual data is 
large, it is organized and summarized before 
display. A hierarchical summarization frame-
work, conditioned on the small space availa-
ble for display, has been fully implemented. 
Snapshots of the system, with narrative de-
scriptions, demonstrate our results.
