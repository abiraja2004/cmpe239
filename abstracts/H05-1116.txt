We investigate techniques to support the
answering of opinion-based questions.
We first present the OpQA corpus of opin-
ion questions and answers. Using the cor-
pus, we compare and contrast the proper-
ties of fact and opinion questions and an-
swers. Based on the disparate characteris-
tics of opinion vs. fact answers, we argue
that traditional fact-based QA approaches
may have difficulty in an MPQA setting
without modification. As an initial step
towards the development of MPQA sys-
tems, we investigate the use of machine
learning and rule-based subjectivity and
opinion source filters and show that they
can be used to guide MPQA systems.
