 
We present Mixture Model-based Mini-
mum Bayes Risk (MMMBR) decoding, 
an approach that makes use of multiple 
SMT systems to improve translation ac-
curacy. Unlike existing MBR decoding 
methods defined on the basis of single 
SMT systems, an MMMBR decoder re-
ranks translation outputs in the combined 
search space of multiple systems using 
the MBR decision rule and a mixture dis-
tribution of component SMT models for 
translation hypotheses. MMMBR decod-
ing is a general method that is indepen-
dent of specific SMT models and can be 
applied to various commonly used search 
spaces. Experimental results on the NIST 
Chinese-to-English MT evaluation tasks 
show that our approach brings significant 
improvements to single system-based 
MBR decoding and outperforms a state-
of-the-art system combination method. 1
