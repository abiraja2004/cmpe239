 
We describe and motivate an unsupervised 
lexical error detection and correction algo-
rithm and its application in a tool called Lex-
bar appearing as a query box on the Web 
browser toolbar or as a search engine inter-
face. Lexbar accepts as user input candidate 
strings of English to be checked for accept-
ability and, where errors are detected, offers 
corrections. We introduce the notion of hy-
brid n-gram and extract these from BNC as 
the knowledgebase against which to compare 
user input. An extended notion of edit dis-
tance is used to identify most likely candi-
dates for correcting detected errors. Results 
are illustrated with four types of errors.
