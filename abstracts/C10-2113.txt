Texts are replete with gaps, information 
omitted since authors assume a certain 
amount of background knowledge. We de-
fine the process of enrichment that fills 
these gaps.  We describe how enrichment 
can be performed using a Background 
Knowledge Base built from a large corpus.  
We evaluate the effectiveness of various 
openly available background knowledge 
bases and we identify the kind of informa-
tion necessary for enrichment.
