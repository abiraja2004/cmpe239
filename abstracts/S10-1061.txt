This paper describes our participation
in the the SemEval-2010 Task #12,
Parser Evaluation using Textual Entail-
ment. Our system incorporated two depen-
dency parsers, one semantic role labeler,
and a deep parser based on hand-crafted
grammars. The shortest path algorithm
is applied on the graph representation of
the parser outputs. Then, different types
of features are extracted and the entail-
ment recognition is casted into a machine-
learning-based classification task. The
best setting of the system achieves 66.78%
of accuracy, which ranks the 3rd place.
