 
This demonstration presents the Annotation Librarian, an application programming inter-face that supports rapid development of natu-ral language processing (NLP) projects built in Apache Unstructured Information Man-agement Architecture (UIMA). The flexibility of UIMA to support all types of unstructured data ? images, audio, and text ? increases the complexity of some of the most common NLP development tasks. The Annotation Librarian interface handles these common functions and allows the creation and management of anno-tations by mirroring Java methods used to manipulate Strings. The familiar syntax and NLP-centric design allows developers to adopt and rapidly develop NLP algorithms in UIMA. The general functionality of the inter-face is described in relation to the use cases that necessitated its creation.  1
