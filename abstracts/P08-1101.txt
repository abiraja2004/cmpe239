For Chinese POS tagging, word segmentation
is a preliminary step. To avoid error propa-
gation and improve segmentation by utilizing
POS information, segmentation and tagging
can be performed simultaneously. A challenge
for this joint approach is the large combined
search space, which makes efficient decod-
ing very hard. Recent research has explored
the integration of segmentation and POS tag-
ging, by decoding under restricted versions of
the full combined search space. In this paper,
we propose a joint segmentation and POS tag-
ging model that does not impose any hard con-
straints on the interaction between word and
POS information. Fast decoding is achieved
by using a novel multiple-beam search algo-
rithm. The system uses a discriminative sta-
tistical model, trained using the generalized
perceptron algorithm. The joint model gives
an error reduction in segmentation accuracy of
14.6% and an error reduction in tagging ac-
curacy of 12.2%, compared to the traditional
pipeline approach.
