We demonstrate a multimodal dialogue system
using reinforcement learning for in-car sce-
narios, developed at Edinburgh University and
Cambridge University for the TALK project1.
This prototype is the first ?Information State
Update? (ISU) dialogue system to exhibit rein-
forcement learning of dialogue strategies, and
also has a fragmentary clarification feature.
This paper describes the main components and
functionality of the system, as well as the pur-
poses and future use of the system, and surveys
the research issues involved in its construction.
Evaluation of this system (i.e. comparing the
baseline system with handcoded vs. learnt dia-
logue policies) is ongoing, and the demonstra-
tion will show both.
