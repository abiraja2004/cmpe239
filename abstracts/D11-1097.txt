This paper investigates novel methods for in-
corporating syntactic information in proba-
bilistic latent variable models of lexical choice
and contextual similarity. The resulting mod-
els capture the effects of context on the inter-
pretation of a word and in particular its effect
on the appropriateness of replacing that word
with a potentially related one. Evaluating our
techniques on two datasets, we report perfor-
mance above the prior state of the art for esti-
mating sentence similarity and ranking lexical
substitutes.
