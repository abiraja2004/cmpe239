Some of the most robust effects of linguis-
tic variables on eye movements in reading are
those of word length. Their leading explana-
tion states that they are caused by visual acu-
ity limitations on word recognition. However,
Bicknell (2011) presented data showing that a
model of eye movement control in reading that
includes visual acuity limitations and models
the process of word identification from visual
input (Bicknell & Levy, 2010) does not pro-
duce humanlike word length effects, provid-
ing evidence against the visual acuity account.
Here, we argue that uncertainty about word
length in early word identification can drive
word length effects. We present an extension
of Bicknell and Levy?s model that incorpo-
rates word length uncertainty, and show that it
produces more humanlike word length effects.
