We present a comparative study of transition-,
graph- and PCFG-based models aimed at il-
luminating more precisely the likely contri-
bution of CFGs in improving Chinese depen-
dency parsing accuracy, especially by com-
bining heterogeneous models. Inspired by
the impact of a constituency grammar on de-
pendency parsing, we propose several strate-
gies to acquire pseudo CFGs only from de-
pendency annotations. Compared to linguistic
grammars learned from rich phrase-structure
treebanks, well designed pseudo grammars
achieve similar parsing accuracy and have
equivalent contributions to parser ensemble.
Moreover, pseudo grammars increase the di-
versity of base models; therefore, together
with all other models, further improve sys-
tem combination. Based on automatic POS
tagging, our final model achieves a UAS of
87.23%, resulting in a significant improve-
ment of the state of the art.
