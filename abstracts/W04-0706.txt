In this work we test the use of word similarity lists
for anaphora resolution in Portuguese corpora. We
applied an automatic lexical acquisition technique
over parsed texts to identify semantically similar
words. After that, we made use of this lexical
knowledge to resolve coreferent definite descrip-
tions where the head-noun of the anaphor is differ-
ent from the head-noun of its antecedent, which we
call indirect anaphora.
