 
In this paper, we work on extending a 
Chinese thesaurus with words distinctly 
used in various Chinese communities.  
The acquisition and classification of such 
region-specific lexical items is an impor-
tant step toward the larger goal of con-
structing a Pan-Chinese lexical resource.  
In particular, we extend a previous study 
in three respects: (1) to improve auto-
matic classification by removing dupli-
cated words from the thesaurus, (2) to 
experiment with classifying words at the 
subclass level and semantic head level, 
and (3) to further investigate the possible 
effects of data heterogeneity between the 
region-specific words and words in the 
thesaurus on classification performance.  
Automatic classification was based on 
the similarity between a target word and 
individual categories of words in the the-
saurus, measured by the cosine function.  
Experiments were done on 120 target 
words from four regions.  The automatic 
classification results were evaluated 
against a gold standard obtained from 
human judgements.  In general accuracy 
reached 80% or more with the top 10 (out 
of 80+) and top 100 (out of 1,300+) can-
didates considered at the subclass level 
and semantic head level respectively, 
provided that the appropriate data sources 
were used.
