The numeral system of Arabic is rich in its
morphosyntactic variety yet suffers from the
lack of a good computational resource that
describes it in a reusable way. This implies
that applications that require the use of rules
of the Arabic numeral system have to either
reimplement them each time, which implies
wasted resources, or use simplified, impre-
cise rules that result in low quality appli-
cations. A solution has been devised with
Grammatical Framework (GF) to use lan-
guage constructs and grammars as libraries
that can be written once and reused in vari-
ous applications. In this paper, we describe
our implementation of the Arabic numeral
system, as an example of a bigger imple-
mentation of a grammar library for Arabic.
We show that users can reuse our system
by accessing a simple language-independent
API rule.
