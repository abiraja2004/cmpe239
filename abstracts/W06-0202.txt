Several recently reported techniques for
the automatic acquisition of Information
Extraction (IE) systems have used depen-
dency trees as the basis of their extrac-
tion pattern representation. These ap-
proaches have used a variety of pattern
models (schemes for representing IE pat-
terns based on particular parts of the de-
pendency analysis). An appropriate model
should be expressive enough to represent
the information which is to be extracted
from text without being overly compli-
cated. Four previously reported pattern
models are evaluated using existing IE
evaluation corpora and three dependency
parsers. It was found that one model,
linked chains, could represent around 95%
of the information of interest without gen-
erating an unwieldy number of possible
patterns.
