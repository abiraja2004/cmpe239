In the framework of bilingual lexicon acquisition
from cross-lingually relevant news articles on the
Web, it is relatively harder to reliably estimate bilin-
gual term correspondences for low frequency terms.
Considering such a situation, this paper proposes to
complementarily use much larger monolingual Web
documents collected by search engines, as a resource
for reliably re-estimating bilingual term correspon-
dences. We experimentally show that, using a suf-
ficient number of monolingual Web documents, it
is quite possible to have reliable estimate of bilin-
gual term correspondences for those low frequency
terms.
