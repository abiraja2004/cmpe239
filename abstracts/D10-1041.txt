For resource-limited language pairs, coverage
of the test set by the parallel corpus is an
important factor that affects translation qual-
ity in two respects: 1) out of vocabulary
words; 2) the same information in an input
sentence can be expressed in different ways,
while current phrase-based SMT systems can-
not automatically select an alternative way
to transfer the same information. Therefore,
given limited data, in order to facilitate trans-
lation from the input side, this paper pro-
poses a novel method to reduce the transla-
tion difficulty using source-side lattice-based
paraphrases. We utilise the original phrases
from the input sentence and the correspond-
ing paraphrases to build a lattice with esti-
mated weights for each edge to improve trans-
lation quality. Compared to the baseline sys-
tem, our method achieves relative improve-
ments of 7.07%, 6.78% and 3.63% in terms
of BLEU score on small, medium and large-
scale English-to-Chinese translation tasks re-
spectively. The results show that the proposed
method is effective not only for resource-
limited language pairs, but also for resource-
sufficient pairs to some extent.
