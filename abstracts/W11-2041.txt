We present BEETLE II, a tutorial dialogue sys-
tem which accepts unrestricted language in-
put and supports experimentation with differ-
ent dialogue strategies. Our first system eval-
uation compared two dialogue policies. The
resulting corpus was used to study the impact
of different tutoring and error recovery strate-
gies on user satisfaction and student interac-
tion style. It can also be used in the future to
study a wide range of research issues in dia-
logue systems.
