Many phrase alignment models operate over
the combinatorial space of bijective phrase
alignments. We prove that finding an optimal
alignment in this space is NP-hard, while com-
puting alignment expectations is #P-hard. On
the other hand, we show that the problem of
finding an optimal alignment can be cast as
an integer linear program, which provides a
simple, declarative approach to Viterbi infer-
ence for phrase alignment models that is em-
pirically quite efficient.
