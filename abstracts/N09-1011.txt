Recent applications of Tree-Adjoining Gram-
mar (TAG) to the domain of semantics as well
as new attention to syntactic phenomena have
given rise to increased interested in more ex-
pressive and complex multicomponent TAG
formalisms (MCTAG). Although many con-
structions can be modeled using tree-local
MCTAG (TL-MCTAG), certain applications
require even more flexibility. In this pa-
per we suggest a shift in focus from con-
straining locality and complexity through tree-
and set-locality to constraining locality and
complexity through restrictions on the deriva-
tional distance between trees in the same tree
set in a valid derivation. We examine three
formalisms, restricted NS-MCTAG, restricted
Vector-TAG and delayed TL-MCTAG, that
use notions of derivational distance to con-
strain locality and demonstrate how they
permit additional expressivity beyond TL-
MCTAG without increasing complexity to the
level of set local MCTAG.
