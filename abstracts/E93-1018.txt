 
An assumption shared by many theories of 
discourse is that discourse structure con- 
strains anaphora resolution (cf. \[Grosz and 
Sidner 1986\] for definite NPs, \[Lascarides 
and Asher 1991\], \[Nakhimovsky 1988\] 
for temporal anaphora, \[Webber 1990\] 
for deictic pronouns and \[Gardent 1991\], 
\[Prfist and Scha 1990\] for VP ellipsis). The 
aim of this paper is (i) to show that this as- 
sumption also applies to multiple VP ellip- 
sis (VPE), (ii) to argue that other levels of 
linguistic information (such as syntax and 
semantics) interact with discourse structure 
in determining multiple VPE acceptability 
and (i i i)to make these intuitions precise 
by providing a unification-based account of 
multiple VPE resolution.
