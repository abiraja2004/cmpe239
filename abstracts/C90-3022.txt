 
This paper is a first step towards a 
computational ccount of Binding Theory (BT). 
Two algorithms that compute, respectively, 
Principle A and B have been provided. Particular 
attention has been devoted to possible 
interactions of BT with other modules of the 
linguistic theory, such as those ruling 
argumental chains. Finally, the computational 
complexity of the algorithms has been studied.
