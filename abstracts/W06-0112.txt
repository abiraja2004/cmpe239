 
In this paper, we propose a hybrid ap-
proach to chunking Chinese base noun 
phrases (base NPs), which combines 
SVM (Support Vector Machine) model 
and CRF (Conditional Random Field) 
model. In order to compare the result 
respectively from two chunkers, we use 
the discriminative post-processing 
method, whose measure criterion is the 
conditional probability generated from 
the CRF chunker. With respect to the 
special structures of Chinese base NP 
and complete analyses of the first two 
results, we also customize some appro-
priate grammar rules to avoid ambigui-
ties and prune errors. According to our 
overall experiments, the method 
achieves a higher accuracy in the final 
results.
