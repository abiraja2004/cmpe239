In this paper, we present empirical data from a
corpus study on the linear order of subjects and
objects in German main clauses. The aim was
to establish the validity of three well-known or-
dering constraints: given complements tend to
occur before new complements, definite before
indefinite, and pronoun before full noun phrase
complements. Frequencies of occurrences were
derived for subject-first and object-first sen-
tences from the German Negra corpus. While
all three constraints held on subject-first sen-
tences, results for object-first sentences varied.
Our findings suggest an influence of grammat-
ical functions on the ordering of verb comple-
ments.
