This paper presents a novel ensemble
learning approach to resolving German
pronouns. Boosting, the method in
question, combines the moderately ac-
curate hypotheses of several classifiers
to form a highly accurate one. Exper-
iments show that this approach is su-
perior to a single decision-tree classi-
fier. Furthermore, we present a stan-
dalone system that resolves pronouns in
unannotated text by using a fully auto-
matic sequence of preprocessing mod-
ules that mimics the manual annotation
process. Although the system performs
well within a limited textual domain,
further research is needed to make it
effective for open-domain question an-
swering and text summarisation.
