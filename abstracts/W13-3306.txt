The paper presents machine translation ex-
periments from English to Czech with a
large amount of manually annotated dis-
course connectives. The gold-standard
discourse relation annotation leads to bet-
ter translation performance in ranges of
4?60% for some ambiguous English con-
nectives and helps to find correct syntacti-
cal constructs in Czech for less ambiguous
connectives. Automatic scoring confirms
the stability of the newly built discourse-
aware translation systems. Error analysis
and human translation evaluation point to
the cases where the annotation was most
and where less helpful.
