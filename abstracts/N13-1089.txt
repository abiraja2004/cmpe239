Sentence Similarity [SS] computes a similar-
ity score between two sentences. The SS task
differs from document level semantics tasks
in that it features the sparsity of words in a
data unit, i.e. a sentence. Accordingly it is
crucial to robustly model each word in a sen-
tence to capture the complete semantic picture
of the sentence. In this paper, we hypoth-
esize that by better modeling lexical seman-
tics we can obtain better sentential semantics.
We incorporate both corpus-based (selectional
preference information) and knowledge-based
(similar words extracted in a dictionary) lex-
ical semantics into a latent variable model.
The experiments show state-of-the-art perfor-
mance among unsupervised systems on two
SS datasets.
