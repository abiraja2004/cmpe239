Word Sense Disambiguation remains one of
the most complex problems facing compu-
tational linguists to date. In this paper we
present modification to the graph based state
of the art algorithm In-Degree. Our modifi-
cations entail augmenting the basic Lesk sim-
ilarity measure with more relations based on
the structure of WordNet, adding SemCor ex-
amples to the basic WordNet lexical resource
and finally instead of using the LCH similarity
measure for computing verb verb similarity in
the In-Degree algorithm, we use JCN. We re-
port results on three standard data sets using
three different versions of WordNet. We re-
port the highest performing monolingual un-
supervised results to date on the Senseval 2 all
words data set. Our system yields a perfor-
mance of 62.7% using WordNet 1.7.1.
