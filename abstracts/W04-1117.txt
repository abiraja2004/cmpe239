 
Motivated by a systematic analysis of 
Chinese semantic relationships, we 
constructed a Chinese semantic framework 
based on surface syntactic relationships, deep 
semantic relationships and feature structure to 
express dependencies between lexical 
meanings and conceptual structures, and 
relations that underlie those lexical meanings. 
Analyzing the semantic representations of 
10000 Chinese sentences, we provide a model 
of semantically and syntactically annotated 
sentences from which reliable information on 
combinatorial possibilities of each semantic 
item targeted for analysis can be displayed. 
We also propose a semantic argument ? head 
relation, ?basic conceptual structure? and the 
?Head-Driven Principle?. Our results show that 
we can successfully disambiguate some 
troublesome sentences, and minimize the 
redundancy in language knowledge 
descriptions for natural language processing.
