In this paper we discuss the use of multi-
layered tagsets for dialogue acts, in the con-
text of dialogue understanding for multi-
party meeting recording and retrieval ap-
plications. We discuss some desiderata for
such tagsets and critically examine some
previous proposals. We then define MAL-
TUS, a new tagset based on the ICSI-MR
and Switchboard tagsets, which satisfies
these requirements. We present some ex-
periments using MALTUS which attempt
to compare the merits of integrated versus
multi-level classifiers for the detection of di-
alogue acts.
