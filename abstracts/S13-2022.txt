This paper describes the evaluation of differ-
ent kinds of textual features for the Cross-
Lingual Textual Entailment Task of SemEval
2013. We have counted the number of N -
grams for three types of textual entities (char-
acter, word and PoS tags) that exist in the
pair of sentences from which we are inter-
ested in determining the judgment of textual
entailment. Difference, intersection and dis-
tance (Euclidian, Manhattan and Jaccard) of
N -grams were considered for constructing a
feature vector which is further introduced in
a support vector machine classifier which al-
lows to construct a classification model. Five
different runs were submitted, one of them
considering voting system of the previous four
approaches. The results obtained show a per-
formance below the median of six teams that
have participated in the competition.
