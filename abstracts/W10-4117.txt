This paper investigates techniques to au-
tomatically construct training data from
social Q&A collections such as Yahoo!
Answer to support a machine learning-
based complex QA system1. We extract
cue expressions for each type of question
from collected training data and build
question-type-specific classifiers to im-
prove complex QA system. Experiments
on 10 types of complex Chinese ques-
tions verify that it is effective to mine
knowledge from social Q&A collections
for answering complex questions, for in-
stance, the F3 improvement of our sys-
tem over the baseline and translation-
based model reaches 7.9% and 5.1%, re-
spectively.
