In this paper, we show that linguistically mo-
tivated pronunciation rules can improve phone
and word recognition results for Modern Stan-
dard Arabic (MSA). Using these rules and
the MADA morphological analysis and dis-
ambiguation tool, multiple pronunciations per
word are automatically generated to build two
pronunciation dictionaries; one for training
and another for decoding. We demonstrate
that the use of these rules can significantly
improve both MSA phone recognition and
MSA word recognition accuracies over a base-
line system using pronunciation rules typi-
cally employed in previous work on MSA Au-
tomatic Speech Recognition (ASR). We ob-
tain a significant improvement in absolute ac-
curacy in phone recognition of 3.77%?7.29%
and a significant improvement of 4.1% in ab-
solute accuracy in ASR.
