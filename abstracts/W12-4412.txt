 
This work presents an English-to-Chinese 
(E2C) machine transliteration system based 
on two-stage conditional random fields 
(CRF) models with accessor variety (AV) 
as an additional feature to approximate 
local context of the source language. 
Experiment results show that two-stage 
CRF method outperforms the one-stage 
opponent since the former costs less to 
encode more features and finer grained 
labels than the latter.
