 
This paper describes a hybrid model and 
the corresponding algorithm combining 
support vector machines (SVMs) with 
statistical methods to improve the per-
formance of SVMs for the task of Chi-
nese Named Entity Recognition (NER). 
In this algorithm, a threshold of the dis-
tance from the test sample to the hyper-
plane of SVMs in feature space is used to 
separate SVMs region and statistical 
method region. If the distance is greater 
than the given threshold, the test sample 
is classified using SVMs; otherwise, the 
statistical model is used. By integrating 
the advantages of two methods, the hy-
brid model achieves 93.18% F-measure 
for Chinese person names and 91.49% F-
measure for Chinese location names.
