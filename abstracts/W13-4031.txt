We describe the annotation of a multi-
modal corpus that includes pointing ges-
tures and haptic actions (force exchanges).
Haptic actions are rarely analyzed as full-
fledged components of dialogue, but our
data shows haptic actions are used to ad-
vance the state of the interaction. We re-
port our experiments on recognizing Di-
alogue Acts in both offline and online
modes. Our results show that multimodal
features and the dialogue game aid in DA
classification.
