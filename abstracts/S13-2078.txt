Sentiment analysis refers to automatically ex-
tracting the sentiment present in a given natu-
ral language text. We present our participation
to the SemEval2013 competition, in the senti-
ment analysis of Twitter and SMS messages.
Our approach for this task is the combination
of two sentiment analysis subsystems which
are combined together to build the final sys-
tem. Both subsystems use supervised learning
using features based on various polarity lexi-
cons.
