This paper presents the coarse-grained En-
glish all-words task at SemEval-2007. We
describe our experience in producing a
coarse version of the WordNet sense inven-
tory and preparing the sense-tagged corpus
for the task. We present the results of par-
ticipating systems and discuss future direc-
tions.
