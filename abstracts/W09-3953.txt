We present a dialogue annotation scheme
for both spoken and written interaction,
and use it in a telephone transaction cor-
pus and an email corpus. We train classi-
fiers, comparing regular SVM and struc-
tured SVM against a heuristic baseline.
We provide a novel application of struc-
tured SVM to predicting relations between
instance pairs.
