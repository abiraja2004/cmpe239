 
In this paper we propose a methodology 
for investigating the relationship between 
architectures of natural anguage genera- 
tion (NLG) systems and stylistic proper- 
ties of texts. Biber's (1988) methodology 
is used to obtain both the characterisation 
of style of our corpus and the division of 
the corpus into sets of linguistically 
similar texts. These sets will be used for 
studying the architectural spects.
