Many learning tasks have subtasks for which
much training data exists. Therefore, we want
to transfer learning from the old, general-
purpose subtask to a more specific new task,
for which there is often less data. While work
in transfer learning often considers how the
old task should affect learning on the new
task, in this paper we show that it helps to
take into account how the new task affects the
old. Specifically, we perform joint decoding of
separately-trained sequence models, preserv-
ing uncertainty between the tasks and allowing
information from the new task to affect predic-
tions on the old task. On two standard text data
sets, we show that joint decoding outperforms
cascaded decoding.
