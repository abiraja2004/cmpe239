In this paper, we describe an efficient
A* search algorithm for statistical ma-
chine translation. In contrary to beam-
search or greedy approaches it is possi-
ble to guarantee the avoidance of search
errors with A*. We develop various so-
phisticated admissible and almost ad-
missible heuristic functions. Especially
our newly developped method to per-
form a multi-pass A* search with an
iteratively improved heuristic function
allows us to translate even long sen-
tences. We compare the A* search al-
gorithm with a beam-search approach
on the Hansards task.
