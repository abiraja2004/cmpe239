In this paper, the UNITOR system participat-
ing in the SemEval-2013 Sentiment Analysis
in Twitter task is presented. The polarity de-
tection of a tweet is modeled as a classifica-
tion task, tackled through a Multiple Kernel
approach. It allows to combine the contribu-
tion of complex kernel functions, such as the
Latent Semantic Kernel and Smoothed Par-
tial Tree Kernel, to implicitly integrate syn-
tactic and lexical information of annotated ex-
amples. In the challenge, UNITOR system
achieves good results, even considering that
no manual feature engineering is performed
and no manually coded resources are em-
ployed. These kernels in-fact embed distri-
butional models of lexical semantics to deter-
mine expressive generalization of tweets.
