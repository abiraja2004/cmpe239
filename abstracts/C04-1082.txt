Part of speech taggers based on Hidden
Markov Models rely on a series of hypothe-
ses which make certain errors inevitable.
The idea developed in this paper consists
in allowing a limited, controlled ambiguity
in the output of the tagger in order to avoid
a number of errors. The ambiguity takes
the form of ambiguous tags which denote
subsets of the tagset. These tags are used
when the tagger hesitates between the dif-
ferent components of the ambiguous tags.
They are introduced in an existing lexicon
and 3-gram database. Their lexical and
syntactic counts are computed on the basis
of the lexical and syntactic counts of their
constituents, using impurity functions. The
tagging process itself, based on the Viterbi
algorithm, is unchanged. Experiments con-
ducted on the Brown corpus show a recall of
0.982, for an ambiguity rate of 1.233 which
is to be compared with a baseline recall of
0.978 for an ambiguity rate of 1.414 using
the same ambiguous tags and with a recall
of 0.955 corresponding to the one best solu-
tion of standard tagging (without ambigu-
ous tags).
