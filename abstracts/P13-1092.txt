We present the first unsupervised ap-
proach for semantic parsing that rivals
the accuracy of supervised approaches
in translating natural-language questions
to database queries. Our GUSP system
produces a semantic parse by annotat-
ing the dependency-tree nodes and edges
with latent states, and learns a proba-
bilistic grammar using EM. To compen-
sate for the lack of example annotations
or question-answer pairs, GUSP adopts
a novel grounded-learning approach to
leverage database for indirect supervision.
On the challenging ATIS dataset, GUSP
attained an accuracy of 84%, effectively
tying with the best published results by su-
pervised approaches.
