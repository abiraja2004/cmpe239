We describe our submissions to the WMT11
shared MT evaluation task: MTeRater and
MTeRater-Plus. Both are machine-learned
metrics that use features from e-rater R?, an au-
tomated essay scoring engine designed to as-
sess writing proficiency. Despite using only
features from e-rater and without comparing
to translations, MTeRater achieves a sentence-
level correlation with human rankings equiva-
lent to BLEU. Since MTeRater only assesses
fluency, we build a meta-metric, MTeRater-
Plus, that incorporates adequacy by combin-
ing MTeRater with other MT evaluation met-
rics and heuristics. This meta-metric has a
higher correlation with human rankings than
either MTeRater or individual MT metrics
alone. However, we also find that e-rater fea-
tures may not have significant impact on cor-
relation in every case.
