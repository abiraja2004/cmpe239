 
The emergence of the WWW as the main 
source of distributing content opened the 
floodgates of information. The sheer 
volume and diversity of this content 
necessitate an approach that will reinvent 
the way it is analysed. The quantitative 
route to processing information which 
relies on content management tools 
provides structural analysis. The 
challenge we address is to evolve from 
the process of streamlining data to a level 
of understanding that assigns value to 
content. 
We present an open-source multilingual 
platform ATALS that incorporates 
human language technologies in the 
process of multilingual web content 
management. It complements a content 
management software-as-a-service 
component i-Publisher, used for creating, 
running and managing dynamic content-
driven websites with a linguistic 
platform. The platform enriches the 
content of these websites with revealing 
details and reduces the manual work of 
classification editors by automatically 
categorising content. The platform 
ASSET supports six European languages. 
We expect ASSET to serve as a basis for 
future development of deep analysis tools 
capable of generating abstractive 
summaries and training models for 
decision making systems.
