We present and evaluate a randomized local
search procedure for selecting sentences to in-
clude in a multidocument summary. The search
favors the inclusion of adjacent sentences while
penalizing the selection of repetitive material,
in order to improve intelligibility without un-
duly affecting informativeness. Sentence simi-
larity is determined using both surface-oriented
measures and semantic groups obtained from
merging the output templates of an information
extraction subsystem. In a comparative evalu-
ation against two DUC-like baselines and three
simpler versions of our system, we found that
our randomized local search method provided
substantial improvements in both content and
intelligibility, while the use of the IE groups also
appeared to contribute a small further improve-
ment in content.
