 
The POSSLT 1  is a Korean to English 
spoken language translation (SLT) system. 
Like most other SLT systems, automatic 
speech recognition (ASR), machine trans-
lation (MT), and text-to-speech (TTS) are 
coupled in a cascading manner in our 
POSSLT. However, several novel tech-
niques are applied to improve overall 
translation quality and speed. Models 
used in POSSLT are trained on a travel 
domain conversational corpus.
