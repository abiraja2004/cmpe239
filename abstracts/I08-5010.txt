Named Entity Recognition (NER) is the
task of identifying and classifying all proper
nouns in a document as person names, or-
ganization names, location names, date &
time expressions and miscellaneous. Previ-
ous work (Cucerzan and Yarowsky, 1999)
was done using the complete words as fea-
tures which suffers from a low recall prob-
lem. Character n-gram based approach
(Klein et al, 2003) using generative mod-
els, was experimented on English language
and it proved to be useful over the word
based models. Applying the same technique
on Indian Languages, we experimented with
Conditional Random Fields (CRFs), a dis-
criminative model, and evaluated our sys-
tem on two Indian Languages Telugu and
Hindi. The character n-gram based models
showed considerable improvement over the
word based models. This paper describes the
features used and experiments to increase
the recall of Named Entity Recognition Sys-
tems which is also language independent.
