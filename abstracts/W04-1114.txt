 
This paper presents the construction of a 
manually annotated Chinese shallow Treebank, 
named PolyU Treebank. Different from 
traditional Chinese Treebank based on full 
parsing, the PolyU Treebank is based on 
shallow parsing in which only partial syntactical 
structures are annotated. This Treebank can be 
used to support shallow parser training, testing 
and other natural language applications. 
Phrase-based Grammar, proposed by Peking 
University, is used to guide the design and 
implementation of the PolyU Treebank. The 
design principles include good resource sharing, 
low structural complexity, sufficient syntactic 
information and large data scale. The design 
issues, including corpus material preparation, 
standard for word segmentation and POS 
tagging, and the guideline for phrase bracketing 
and annotation, are presented in this paper. 
Well-designed workflow and effective 
semiautomatic and automatic annotation 
checking are used to ensure annotation accuracy 
and consistency. Currently, the PolyU Treebank 
has completed the annotation of a 
1-million-word corpus. The evaluation shows 
that the accuracy of annotation is higher than 
98%.
