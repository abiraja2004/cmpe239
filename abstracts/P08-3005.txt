 
Machine learning methods have been exten-
sively employed in developing MT evaluation 
metrics and several studies show that it can 
help to achieve a better correlation with hu-
man assessments. Adopting the regression 
SVM framework, this paper discusses the lin-
guistic motivated feature formulation strategy. 
We argue that ?blind? combination of avail-
able features does not yield a general metrics 
with high correlation rate with human assess-
ments. Instead, certain simple intuitive fea-
tures serve better in establishing the 
regression SVM evaluation model. With six 
features selected, we show evidences to sup-
port our view through a few experiments in 
this paper.
