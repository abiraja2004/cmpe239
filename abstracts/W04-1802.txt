 
This paper describes and evaluates the 
Metalinguistic Operation Processor (MOP) 
system for automatic compilation of 
metalinguistic information from technical and 
scientific documents. This system is designed 
to extract non-standard terminological 
resources that we have called Metalinguistic 
Information Databases (or MIDs), in order to 
help update changing glossaries, knowledge 
bases and ontologies, as well as to reflect the 
metastable dynamics of special-domain 
knowledge.
