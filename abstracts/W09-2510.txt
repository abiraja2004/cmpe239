Other work has demonstrated the ef-fectiveness of computing presuppositions for solving natural language inference problems.  We extend this work to create a system for correctly computing lexical presuppositions and their interactions within the natural logic framework.  The combination allows our sys-tem to properly handle presupposition projec-tion from the lexical to the sentential level while taking advantage of the accuracy and coverage of the natural logic system.  To solve an inference problem, our system com-putes a sequence of edits from premise to hy-pothesis.  For each edit the system computes an entailment relation and a presupposition entailment relation.  The relations are then separately composed according to a syntactic tree and the semantic properties of its nodes.  Presuppositions are projected based on the properties of their syntactic and semantic en-vironment.  The edits are then composed and the resulting entailment relations are com-bined with the presupposition relation to yield an answer to the inference problem.   1
