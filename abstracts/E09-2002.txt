In this paper, we present a novel approach
for automatic summarization. Our system,
called CBSEAS, integrates a new method
to detect redundancy at its very core, and
produce more expressive summaries than
previous approaches. Moreover, we show
that our system is versatile enough to in-
tegrate opinion mining techniques, so that
it is capable of producing opinion oriented
summaries. The very competitive results
obtained during the last Text Evaluation
Conference (TAC 2008) show that our ap-
proach is efficient.
