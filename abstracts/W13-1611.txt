We compare the performance of two lexicon-
based sentiment systems ? SentiStrength
(Thelwall et al, 2012) and SO-CAL (Taboada
et al, 2011) ? on the two genres of newspaper
text and tweets. While SentiStrength has been
geared specifically toward short social-media
text, SO-CAL was built for general, longer
text. After the initial comparison, we suc-
cessively enrich the SO-CAL-based analysis
with tweet-specific mechanisms and observe
that in some cases, this improves the perfor-
mance. A qualitative error analysis then iden-
tifies classes of typical problems the two sys-
tems have with tweets.
