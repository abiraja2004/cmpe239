This paper describes FERRET, an interac-
tive question-answering (Q/A) system de-
signed to address the challenges of inte-
grating automatic Q/A applications into
real-world environments. FERRET utilizes
a novel approach to Q/A ? known as pre-
dictive questioning ? which attempts to
identify the questions (and answers) that
users need by analyzing how a user inter-
acts with a system while gathering infor-
mation related to a particular scenario.
