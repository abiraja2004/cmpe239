 
Long sentence analysis has been a critical 
problem because of high complexity. This pa- 
per addresses the reduction of parsing com- 
plexity by intra-sentence segmentation, and 
presents max imum entropy model for deter- 
mining segmentation positions. The model 
features lexical contexts of segmentation posi- 
tions, giving a probability to each potential 
position. Segmentation coverage and accu- 
racy of the proposed method are 96% and 
88% respectively. The parsing efficiency is im- 
proved by 77% in time and 71% in space.
