Currently, information architects create meta-
data category hierarchies manually. We present
a nearly-automated approach for deriving such
hierarchies, by converting the lexical hierarchy
WordNet into a format that reflects the contents
of a target information collection. We use the
term ?nearly-automated? because an informa-
tion architect should have to make only small
adjustments to produce an acceptable metadata
structure. We contrast the results with an algo-
rithm that uses lexical co-occurrence statistics.
