In this paper, we provide a statistical ma-
chine learning representation of textual en-
tailment via syntactic graphs constituted
by tree pairs. We show that the natural way
of representing the syntactic relations be-
tween text and hypothesis consists in the
huge feature space of all possible syntac-
tic tree fragment pairs, which can only be
managed using kernel methods. Experi-
ments with Support Vector Machines and
our new kernels for paired trees show the
validity of our interpretation.
