We present an English lexical database which
is fuller, more accurate and more consistent
than any other. We believe this to be so be-
cause the project has been well-planned, with
a 12-month intensive planning phase prior to
the lexicography beginning; well-resourced,
employing a team of fifteen highly experi-
enced lexicographers for a thirty-month main
phase; it has had access to the latest corpus
and dictionary-editing technology; it has not
been constrained to meet any goals other than
an accurate description of the language; and
it has been led by a team with singular expe-
rience in delivering high-quality and innova-
tive resources. The lexicon will be complete
in Summer 2010 and will be available for NLP
groups, on terms designed to encourage its re-
search use.
