 
This paper presents noisy-channel based 
Korean preprocessor system, which cor-
rects word spacing and typographical errors. 
The proposed algorithm corrects both er-
rors simultaneously. Using Eojeol transi-
tion pattern dictionary and statistical data 
such as Eumjeol n-gram and Jaso transition 
probabilities, the algorithm minimizes the 
usage of huge word dictionaries.
