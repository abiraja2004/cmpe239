In this paper, we extend an existing statis-
tical parsing model to produce richer out-
put parse trees, annotated with PropBank
semantic role labels. Our results show
that the model can be robustly extended to
produce more complex output parse trees
without any loss in performance and sug-
gest that joint inference of syntactic and
semantic representations is a viable alter-
native to approaches based on a pipeline
of local processing steps.
