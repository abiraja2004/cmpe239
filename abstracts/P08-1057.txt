This paper presents an innovative, complex
approach to semantic verb classification that
relies on selectional preferences as verb prop-
erties. The probabilistic verb class model un-
derlying the semantic classes is trained by
a combination of the EM algorithm and the
MDL principle, providing soft clusters with
two dimensions (verb senses and subcategori-
sation frames with selectional preferences) as
a result. A language-model-based evaluation
shows that after 10 training iterations the verb
class model results are above the baseline re-
sults.
