In this paper we present our syntactic and se-
mantic dependency parsing system submitted
to both the closed and open challenges of the
CoNLL 2009 Shared Task. The system ex-
tends the system of Zhang, Wang, & Uszko-
reit (2008) in the multilingual direction, and
achieves 76.49 average macro F1 Score on the
closed joint task. Substantial improvements
to the open SRL task have been observed that
are attributed to the HPSG parses with hand-
crafted grammars. ?
