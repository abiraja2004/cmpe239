Chambers and Jurafsky (2009) demonstrated
that event schemas can be automatically in-
duced from text corpora. However, our analy-
sis of their schemas identifies several weak-
nesses, e.g., some schemas lack a common
topic and distinct roles are incorrectly mixed
into a single actor. It is due in part to their
pair-wise representation that treats subject-
verb independently from verb-object. This of-
ten leads to subject-verb-object triples that are
not meaningful in the real-world.
We present a novel approach to inducing
open-domain event schemas that overcomes
these limitations. Our approach uses co-
occurrence statistics of semantically typed re-
lational triples, which we call Rel-grams (re-
lational n-grams). In a human evaluation, our
schemas outperform Chambers?s schemas by
wide margins on several evaluation criteria.
Both Rel-grams and event schemas are freely
available to the research community.
