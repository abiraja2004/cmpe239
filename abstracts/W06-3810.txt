Document indexing and representation of
term-document relations are very impor-
tant for document clustering and retrieval.
In this paper, we combine a graph-based
dimensionality reduction method with a
corpus-based association measure within
the Generalized Latent Semantic Analysis
framework. We evaluate the graph-based
GLSA on the document clustering task.
