We present a method for automatically acquir-
ing knowledge for case alternation between
the passive and active voices in Japanese. By
leveraging several linguistic constraints on al-
ternation patterns and lexical case frames ob-
tained from a large Web corpus, our method
aligns a case frame in the passive voice to a
corresponding case frame in the active voice
and finds an alignment between their cases.
We then apply the acquired knowledge to a
case alternation task and prove its usefulness.
