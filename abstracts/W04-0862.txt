This paper presents the Swarthmore College word-
sense disambiguation system which was designed
for the 2004 SENSEVAL3 competition. Our system
participated in five tasks: the lexical sample tasks in
Basque, Catalan, Italian, Romanian, and Spanish.
For each task, a suite of supervised algorithms were
combined using voting to form the final system.
