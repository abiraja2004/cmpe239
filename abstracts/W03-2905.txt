The article notes certain weaknesses of
current efforts aiming at the standard-
ization of POS tagsets for morphologi-
cally rich languages and argues that, in
order to achieve clear mappings between
tagsets, it is necessary to have clear
and formal rules of delimiting POSs and
grammatical categories within any given
tagset. An attempt at constructing such
a tagset for Polish is presented.
