 
This work addresses the task of identify-
ing thematic correspondences across sub-
corpora focused on different topics.  We 
introduce an unsupervised algorithmic 
framework based on distributional data 
clustering, which generalizes previous ini-
tial works on this task.  The empirical re-
sults reveal interesting commonalities of 
different religions.  We evaluate the re-
sults through measuring the overlap of our 
clusters with clusters compiled manually 
by experts.  The tested variants of our 
framework are shown to outperform al-
ternative methods applicable to the task.
