Graph based dependency parsing is inefficient
when handling non-local features due to high
computational complexity of inference. In
this paper, we proposed an exact and effi-
cient decoding algorithm based on the Branch
and Bound (B&B) framework where non-
local features are bounded by a linear combi-
nation of local features. Dynamic program-
ming is used to search the upper bound. Ex-
periments are conducted on English PTB and
Chinese CTB datasets. We achieved competi-
tive Unlabeled Attachment Score (UAS) when
no additional resources are available: 93.17%
for English and 87.25% for Chinese. Parsing
speed is 177 words per second for English and
97 words per second for Chinese. Our algo-
rithm is general and can be adapted to non-
projective dependency parsing or other graph-
ical models.
