We present a novel model to represent and
assess the discourse coherence of text. Our
model assumes that coherent text implicitly
favors certain types of discourse relation tran-
sitions. We implement this model and apply it
towards the text ordering ranking task, which
aims to discern an original text from a per-
muted ordering of its sentences. The experi-
mental results demonstrate that our model is
able to significantly outperform the state-of-
the-art coherence model by Barzilay and Lap-
ata (2005), reducing the error rate of the previ-
ous approach by an average of 29% over three
data sets against human upper bounds. We fur-
ther show that our model is synergistic with
the previous approach, demonstrating an error
reduction of 73% when the features from both
models are combined for the task.
