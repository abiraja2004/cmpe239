We present a novel semi-supervised training
algorithm for learning dependency parsers.
By combining a supervised large margin loss
with an unsupervised least squares loss, a dis-
criminative, convex, semi-supervised learning
algorithm can be obtained that is applicable
to large-scale problems. To demonstrate the
benefits of this approach, we apply the tech-
nique to learning dependency parsers from
combined labeled and unlabeled corpora. Us-
ing a stochastic gradient descent algorithm, a
parsing model can be efficiently learned from
semi-supervised data that significantly outper-
forms corresponding supervised methods.
