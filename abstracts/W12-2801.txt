This paper addresses the problem of training
an artificial agent to follow verbal instructions
representing high-level tasks using a set of in-
structions paired with demonstration traces of
appropriate behavior. From this data, a map-
ping from instructions to tasks is learned, en-
abling the agent to carry out new instructions
in novel environments.
