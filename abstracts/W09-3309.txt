This paper reports on the ongoing work
of Phrase Detectives, an attempt to cre-
ate a very large anaphorically annotated
text corpus. Annotated corpora of the size
needed for modern computational linguis-
tics research cannot be created by small
groups of hand-annotators however the
ESP game and similar games with a pur-
pose have demonstrated how it might be
possible to do this through Web collabora-
tion. We show that this approach could be
used to create large, high-quality natural
language resources.
