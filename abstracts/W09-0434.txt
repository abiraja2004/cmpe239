Reordering is a serious challenge in sta-
tistical machine translation. We propose
a method for analysing syntactic reorder-
ing in parallel corpora and apply it to un-
derstanding the differences in the perfor-
mance of SMT systems. Results at recent
large-scale evaluation campaigns show
that synchronous grammar-based statisti-
cal machine translation models produce
superior results for language pairs such as
Chinese to English. However, for language
pairs such as Arabic to English, phrase-
based approaches continue to be competi-
tive. Until now, our understanding of these
results has been limited to differences in
BLEU scores. Our analysis shows that cur-
rent state-of-the-art systems fail to capture
the majority of reorderings found in real
data.
