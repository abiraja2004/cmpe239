The goal of the Cross-lingual Word Sense Disam-
biguation task is to evaluate the viability of multilin-
gual WSD on a benchmark lexical sample data set.
The traditional WSD task is transformed into a mul-
tilingual WSD task, where participants are asked to
provide contextually correct translations of English
ambiguous nouns into five target languages, viz.
French, Italian, English, German and Dutch. We re-
port results for the 12 official submissions from 5
different research teams, as well as for the ParaSense
system that was developed by the task organizers.
