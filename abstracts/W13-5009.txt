Many organizations possess large collections
of textual reports that document how a prob-
lem is solved or analysed, e.g. medical pa-
tient records, industrial accident reports, law-
suit records and investigation reports. Ef-
fective use of expert knowledge contained in
these reports may greatly increase productiv-
ity of the organization. In this article, we pro-
pose a method for automatic extraction of rea-
soning chains that contain information used
by the author of a report to analyse the prob-
lem at hand. For this purpose, we devel-
oped a graph-based text representation that
makes the relations between textual units ex-
plicit. This representation is acquired auto-
matically from a report using natural language
processing tools including syntactic and dis-
course parsers. When applied to aviation in-
vestigation reports, our method generates rea-
soning chains that reveal the connection be-
tween initial information about the aircraft in-
cident and its causes.
