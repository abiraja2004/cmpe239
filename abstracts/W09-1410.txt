This work describes a system for the tasks
of identifying events in biomedical text and
marking those that are speculative or negated.
The architecture of the system relies on
both Machine Learning (ML) approaches and
hand-coded precision grammars. We submit-
ted the output of our approach to the event ex-
traction shared task at BioNLP 2009, where
our methods suffered from low recall, al-
though we were one of the few teams to pro-
vide answers for task 3.
