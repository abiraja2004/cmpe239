Timelines interpreting interval temporal
logic formulas are segmented into strings
which serve as semantic representations
for tense and aspect. The strings have
bounded but refinable granularity, suit-
able for analyzing (im)perfectivity, dura-
tivity, telicity, and various relations includ-
ing branching.
