We investigate the performance of an easy-
first, non-directional dependency parser on the
Hebrew Dependency treebank. We show that
with a basic feature set the greedy parser?s ac-
curacy is on a par with that of a first-order
globally optimized MST parser. The addition
of morphological-agreement feature improves
the parsing accuracy, making it on-par with a
second-order globally optimized MST parser.
The improvement due to the morphological
agreement information is persistent both when
gold-standard and automatically-induced mor-
phological information is used.
