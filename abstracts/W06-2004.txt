This paper describes a method of discrim-
inating ambiguous names that relies upon
features found in corpora of a more abun-
dant language. In particular, we discrim-
inate ambiguous names in Bulgarian, Ro-
manian, and Spanish corpora using infor-
mation derived from much larger quan-
tities of English data. We also mix to-
gether occurrences of the ambiguous name
found in English with the occurrences of
the name in the language in which we are
trying to discriminate. We refer to this as
a language salad, and find that it often re-
sults in even better performance than when
only using English or the language itself
as the source of information for discrimi-
nation.
