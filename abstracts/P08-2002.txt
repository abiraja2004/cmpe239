An incremental dependency parser?s proba-
bility model is entered as a predictor in a
linear mixed-effects model of German read-
ers? eye-fixation durations. This dependency-
based predictor improves a baseline that takes
into account word length, n-gram probabil-
ity, and Cloze predictability that are typically
applied in models of human reading. This
improvement obtains even when the depen-
dency parser explores a tiny fraction of its
search space, as suggested by narrow-beam
accounts of human sentence processing such
as Garden Path theory.
