 
This paper describes an architecture 
for performing anaphora resolution in 
a flexible way. Systems which con- 
form to these guidelines are well- 
encapsulated and portable, and can 
be used to compare anaphora resolu- 
tion techniques for new language un- 
derstanding applications. Our im- 
plementation of the architecture in 
a pronoun resolution testing platform 
demonstrates the flexibility of the ap- 
proach.
