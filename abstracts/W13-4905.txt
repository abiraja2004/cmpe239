This paper describes the LIGM-Alpage sys-
tem for the SPMRL 2013 Shared Task. We
only participated to the French part of the de-
pendency parsing track, focusing on the real-
istic setting where the system is informed nei-
ther with gold tagging and morphology nor
(more importantly) with gold grouping of to-
kens into multi-word expressions (MWEs).
While the realistic scenario of predicting both
MWEs and syntax has already been investi-
gated for constituency parsing, the SPMRL
2013 shared task datasets offer the possibil-
ity to investigate it in the dependency frame-
work. We obtain the best results for French,
both for overall parsing and for MWE recog-
nition, using a reparsing architecture that com-
bines several parsers, with both pipeline archi-
tecture (MWE recognition followed by pars-
ing), and joint architecture (MWE recognition
performed by the parser).
