This article presents a bilingual question
answering system, which is able to process
questions and documents both in French
and in English. Two cross-lingual strate-
gies are described and evaluated. First, we
study the contribution of biterms trans-
lation, and the influence of the comple-
tion of the translation dictionaries. Then,
we propose a strategy for transferring the
question analysis from one language to the
other, and we study its influence on the
performance of our system.
