 
This paper reports the results of the 
WordNet.PTglobal project, an extension of 
WordNet.PT to all Portuguese varieties. 
Profiting from a theoretical model of high 
level explanatory adequacy and from a 
convenient and flexible development tool, 
WordNet.PTglobal achieves a rich and multi-
purpose lexical resource, suitable for 
contrastive studies and for a vast range of 
language-based applications covering all 
Portuguese varieties.
