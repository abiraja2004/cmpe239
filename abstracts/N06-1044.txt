We consider several empirical estimators
for probabilistic context-free grammars,
and show that the estimated grammars
have the so-called consistency property,
under the most general conditions. Our
estimators include the widely applied ex-
pectation maximization method, used to
estimate probabilistic context-free gram-
mars on the basis of unannotated corpora.
This solves a problem left open in the lit-
erature, since for this method the consis-
tency property has been shown only under
restrictive assumptions on the rules of the
source grammar.
