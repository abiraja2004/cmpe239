We propose a novel unsupervised word
alignment model based on the Hidden
Markov Tree (HMT) model. Our model
assumes that the alignment variables have
a tree structure which is isomorphic to the
target dependency tree and models the dis-
tortion probability based on the source de-
pendency tree, thereby incorporating the
syntactic structure from both sides of the
parallel sentences. In English-Japanese
word alignment experiments, our model
outperformed an IBM Model 4 baseline
by over 3 points alignment error rate.
While our model was sensitive to poste-
rior thresholds, it also showed a perfor-
mance comparable to that of HMM align-
ment models.
