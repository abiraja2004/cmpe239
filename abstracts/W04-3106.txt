Biomedical literature contains vital informa-
tion for the analysis and interpretation of ex-
periments in the biological sciences. Hu-
man reasoning is the primary method for ex-
tracting, synthesizing, and interpreting the re-
sults contained in the literature, yet the rate at
which publications are produced is exponen-
tial. With the advent of digital, full-text pub-
lication and increasing computational power,
automated techniques for knowledge discov-
ery and synthesis are being developed to assist
humans in making sense of growing literature
databases.
We investigate the use of ontological informa-
tion provided by the Medical Subject Head-
ings (MeSH) project to discover groupings
within a collection of medical literature stored
in PubMed. Vector representations of docu-
ments based on MeSH terms are presented. Re-
sults of agglomerative hierachical clustering on
two collections of biomedical literature, the Rat
Genome Database and Tourette?s Syndrome re-
lated research, suggest novel and understand-
able groupings are obtainable.
