 
The verb-noun sequence in Chinese often 
creates ambiguities in parsing.  These ambi-
guities can usually be resolved if we know 
in advance whether the verb and the noun 
tend to be in the verb-object relation or the 
modifier-head relation.  In this paper, we de-
scribe a learning procedure whereby such 
knowledge can be automatically acquired.  
Using an existing (imperfect) parser with a 
chart filter and a tree filter, a large corpus, 
and the log-likelihood-ratio (LLR) algo-
rithm, we were able to acquire verb-noun 
pairs which typically occur either in verb-
object relations or modifier-head relations.  
The learned pairs are then used in the pars-
ing process for disambiguation.  Evaluation 
shows that the accuracy of the original 
parser improves significantly with the use of 
the automatically acquired knowledge.
