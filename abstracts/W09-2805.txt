In this paper, we propose a new unsu-
pervised approach to sentence compres-
sion based on shallow linguistic process-
ing. For that purpose, paraphrase extrac-
tion and alignment is performed over web
news stories extracted automatically from
the web on a daily basis to provide struc-
tured data examples to the learning pro-
cess. Compression rules are then learned
through the application of Inductive Logic
Programming techniques. Qualitative and
quantitative evaluations suggests that this
is a worth following approach, which
might be even improved in the future.
