We propose Hidden Markov models with
unsupervised training for extractive sum-
marization. Extractive summarization se-
lects salient sentences from documents to
be included in a summary. Unsupervised
clustering combined with heuristics is a
popular approach because no annotated
data is required. However, conventional
clustering methods such as K-means do
not take text cohesion into consideration.
Probabilistic methods are more rigorous
and robust, but they usually require su-
pervised training with annotated data. Our
method incorporates unsupervised train-
ing with clustering, into a probabilistic
framework. Clustering is done by modi-
fied K-means (MKM)--a method that
yields more optimal clusters than the con-
ventional K-means method. Text cohesion
is modeled by the transition probabilities
of an HMM, and term distribution is
modeled by the emission probabilities.
The final decoding process tags sentences
in a text with theme class labels. Parame-
ter training is carried out by the segmental
K-means (SKM) algorithm. The output of
our system can be used to extract salient
sentences for summaries, or used for topic
detection. Content-based evaluation
shows that our method outperforms an ex-
isting extractive summarizer by 22.8% in
terms of relative similarity, and outper-
forms a baseline summarizer that selects
the top N sentences as salient sentences
by 46.3%.
