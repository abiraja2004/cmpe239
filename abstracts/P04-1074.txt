 
Temporal relation resolution involves extraction 
of temporal information explicitly or implicitly 
embedded in a language. This information is of-
ten inferred from a variety of interactive gram-
matical and lexical cues, especially in Chinese. 
For this purpose, inter-clause relations (tempo-
ral or otherwise) in a multiple-clause sentence 
play an important role. In this paper, a computa-
tional model based on machine learning and 
heterogeneous collaborative bootstrapping is 
proposed for analyzing temporal relations in a 
Chinese multiple-clause sentence. The model 
makes use of the fact that events are represented 
in different temporal structures. It takes into ac-
count the effects of linguistic features such as 
tense/aspect, temporal connectives, and dis-
course structures. A set of experiments has been 
conducted to investigate how linguistic features 
could affect temporal relation resolution.
