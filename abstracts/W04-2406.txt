This paper systematically compares unsuper-
vised word sense discrimination techniques
that cluster instances of a target word that oc-
cur in raw text using both vector and similarity
spaces. The context of each instance is repre-
sented as a vector in a high dimensional fea-
ture space. Discrimination is achieved by clus-
tering these context vectors directly in vector
space and also by finding pairwise similarities
among the vectors and then clustering in sim-
ilarity space. We employ two different repre-
sentations of the context in which a target word
occurs. First order context vectors represent
the context of each instance of a target word
as a vector of features that occur in that con-
text. Second order context vectors are an indi-
rect representation of the context based on the
average of vectors that represent the words that
occur in the context. We evaluate the discrim-
inated clusters by carrying out experiments us-
ing sense?tagged instances of 24 SENSEVAL-
2 words and the well known Line, Hard and
Serve sense?tagged corpora.
