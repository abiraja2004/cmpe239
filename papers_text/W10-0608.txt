Abstract
The automatic acquisition of feature-based
conceptual representations from text corpora
can be challenging, given the unconstrained
nature of human-generated features. We
examine large-scale extraction of concept-
relation-feature triples and the utility of syn-
tactic, semantic, and encyclopedic informa-
tion in guiding this complex task. Meth-
ods traditionally employed do not investi-
gate the full range of triples occurring in
human-generated norms (e.g. flute produce
sound), rather targeting concept-feature pairs
(e.g. flute ? sound) or triples involving specific
relations (e.g. is-a, part-of ). We introduce
a novel method that extracts candidate triples
(e.g. deer have antlers, flute produce sound)
from parsed data and re-ranks them using se-
mantic information. We apply this technique
to Wikipedia and the British National Corpus
and assess its accuracy in a variety of ways.
Our work demonstrates the utility of external
knowledge in guiding feature extraction, and
suggests a number of avenues for future work.
1 Introduction
In the cognitive sciences, theories about how con-
crete concepts such as ELEPHANT are represented in
the mind have often adopted a distributed, feature-
based model of conceptual knowledge (e.g. Ran-
dall et al (2004), Tyler et al (2000)). According
to such accounts, conceptual representations consist
of patterns of activation over sets of interconnected
semantic feature nodes (e.g. has eyes, has ears,
is large). To test these theories empirically, cogni-
tive psychologists require an accurate estimate of the
kinds of knowledge that people are likely to repre-
sent in such a system. To date, the most important
sources of such knowledge are property-norming
studies, where a large number of participants write
down lists of features for concepts. For example,
McRae et al (2005) collected a set of norms list-
ing features for 541 concrete concepts. In that study,
the features listed by different participants were nor-
malised by mapping different feature descriptions
with identical meanings to the same feature label.1
Table 1 gives the ten most frequent normed features
for two concepts in the norms.

Table 1: Sample triples from McRae Norms
However, property norm data have certain weak-
nesses (these have been widely discussed; e.g. Mur-
phy (2002), McRae et al (2005)). One issue is
that participants tend to under-report features that
are present in many of the concepts in a given cat-
egory (McRae et al, 2005; Murphy, 2002). For ex-
ample, for the concept ELEPHANT, participants list
salient features like has trunk, but not less salient
features such as breathes air, even though presum-
ably all McRae et al?s participants knew that ele-
phants breathe air. Although the largest collection

?people use it for transportation? were mapped to the same

of norms lists features for over 500 concepts, the
relatively small size of property norm sets still gives
cause for concern. Larger sets of norms would be
useful to psycholinguists; however, large-scale prop-
erty norming studies are time-consuming and costly.
In NLP, researchers have developed methods for
extracting and classifying generic relationships from
data, e.g. Pantel and Pennacchiotti (2008), Davidov
and Rappoport (2008a, 2008b). In recent years,
researchers have also begun to develop methods
which can automatically extract feature norm-like
representations from corpora, e.g. Almuhareb and
Poesio (2005), Barbu (2008), Baroni et al (2009).
The automatic approach is capable of gathering
large-scale distributional data, and furthermore it is
cost-effective. Corpora contain natural-language in-
stances of words denoting concepts and their fea-
tures, and therefore serve as ideal material for fea-
ture generation tasks. However, current methods
are restricted to specific relations between concepts
and their features, or target concept-feature pairs
only. For example, Almuhareb and Poesio (2005)
proposed a method based on manually developed
lexico-syntactic patterns that extracts information
about attributes and values of concepts. They used
these syntactic patterns and two grammatical rela-
tions to create descriptions of nouns consisting of
vector entries and evaluated their approach based
on how well their vector descriptions clustered con-
cepts. This method performed well, but targeted
is-a and part-of relations only. Barbu (2008) com-
bined manually defined linguistic patterns with a co-
occurrence based method to extract features involv-
ing six classes of relations. He then split learning
for the property classes into two distinct paradigms.
One used a pattern-based approach (four classes)
with a seeded pattern-learning algorithm. The other
measured strength of association between the con-
cept and referring adjectives and verbs (two classes).
His pattern-based approach worked well for proper-
ties in the superordinate class, had reasonable recall
for stuff and location classes, but zero recall for part
class. His approach for the other two classes used
various association measures which he summed to
establish an overall score for potential properties.
The recent Strudel model (Baroni et al, 2009) re-
lies on more general linguistic patterns, ?connector
patterns?, consisting of sequences of part-of-speech
(POS) tags to look for candidate feature terms near
a target concept. The method assumes that ?the va-
riety of patterns connecting a concept and a poten-
tial property is a good indicator of the presence of
a true semantic link?. Thus, properties are scored
based on the count of distinct patterns connecting
them to a concept. When evaluated against the ESS-
LLI dataset (Baroni et al (2008); see section 3.1),
Strudel yields a precision of 23.9% ? this figure is
the best state-of-the-art result for unconstrained ac-
quisition of concept-feature pairs.
It seems unlikely that further development of the
shallow connector patterns will significantly im-
prove accuracy, as these already broadly cover most
POS sequences that are concept-feature connectors.
Because of the difficult nature of the task, we believe
that extraction of more accurate representations ne-
cessitates additional linguistic and world knowl-
edge. Furthermore, the utility of Strudel is limited
because it only produces concept-feature pairs, and
not concept-relation-feature triples similar to those
in human generated norms (although the distribution
of the connector patterns for a extracted pair does of-
fer clues about the broad class of semantic relation
that holds between concept and feature).
In this paper, we explore issues of both method-
ology and evaluation that arise when attempting
unconstrained, large-scale extraction of concept-
relation-feature triples in corpus data. Extracting
such human-like features is difficult, and we do not
anticipate a high level of accuracy in these early ex-
periments. We examine the utility of three types
of external knowledge in guiding feature extrac-
tion: syntactic, semantic and encyclopedic. We
build three automatically parsed corpora, two from
Wikipedia and one from the British National Cor-
pus. We introduce a method that (i) extracts concept-
relation-feature triples from grammatical depen-
dency paths produced by a parser and (ii) uses prob-
abilistic information about semantic classes of fea-
tures and concepts to re-rank the candidate triples
before filtering them. We then assess the accuracy
of our model using several different methods, and
demonstrate that external knowledge can help guide
the extraction of human-like features. Finally, we
highlight issues in both methodology and evaluation
that are important for further progress in this area of
research.

2 Extraction Method
2.1 Corpora
We used Wikipedia to investigate the usefulness of
world knowledge for our task. Almost all con-
cepts in the McRae norms have their own Wikipedia
articles, and the articles often include facts simi-
lar to those elicited in norming studies.2 Extrane-
ous data were removed from the articles (e.g. in-
foboxes, bibliographies) to create a plaintext version
of each article. The 1.84 million articles were then
compiled into two subcorpora. The first of these
(Wiki500) consists of the Wikipedia articles corre-
sponding to each of the McRae concepts. It con-
tains c. 500 articles (1.1 million words). The sec-
ond subcorpus is comprised of those articles where
the title is fewer than five words long and contains
one of the McRae concept words.3 This corpus,
called Wiki110K, holds 109,648 plaintext articles
(36.5 million words).
We also employ the 100-million word British Na-
tional Corpus (BNC) (Leech et al, 1994) which con-
tains written (90%) and spoken (10%) English. It
was designed to represent a broad cross-section of
modern British English. This corpus provides an in-
teresting contrast with Wikipedia, since we assume
that any features contained in such a wide-ranging
corpus would be presented in an incidental fashion
rather than explicitly. The BNC may contain use-
ful features which are encoded in everyday speech
and text but not in Wikipedia, perhaps due to their
ambiguity for encyclopedic purposes, or due to their
non-scientific but rather common-sense nature. For
example, eaten by monkeys is listed as a feature of
BANANA in the McRae norms, but the word monkey
does not appear in the Wikipedia banana article.
2.2 Candidate feature extraction
Using a modified, British English version of the
published norms, we recoded them to a uniform
concept-relation-feature representation suitable for
our experiments ? it is triples of this form that we
aim to extract. Our method for extracting concept-
2e.g. The article Elephant describes how elephants are large,
are mammals, and live in Africa.
3This was done in order to avoid articles on very specific
topics which are unlikely to contain basic information about the
target concept.
relation-feature triples consists of two main stages.
In the first stage, we extract large sets of candidate
concept-relation-feature triples for each target con-
cept from parsed corpus data. In the second stage,
we re-rank and filter these triples with the intention
of retaining only those triples which are likely to be
true semantic features.
In the first stage, the corpora are parsed using the
Robust Accurate Statistical Parsing (RASP) system
(Briscoe et al, 2006). For each sentence in the cor-
pora, this yields the most probable analysis returned
by the parser in the form of a set of grammatical
relations (GRs). The GR sets for each sentence con-
taining the target concept noun are then retrieved
from the corpus. These GRs form an undirected
acyclic graph, whose nodes are labelled with words
in the sentence and their POS, and whose edges are
labelled with the GR types linking the nodes to-
gether. Using this graph we generate all possible
paths which are rooted at our target concept node
using a breadth-first search.
We then examine whether any of these paths
match prototypical feature-relation GR structures
according to our manually-generated rules. The
rules were created by first extracting features from
the McRae norms for a small subset of the concepts
and extracting those sentences from the Wiki500
corpus which contained both concept and feature
terms. For each sentence, we then examined each
path through the graph (containing the GRs and POS
tags) linking the concept, the feature, and all inter-
mediate terms, and (providing no other rule already
generated the concept-relation-feature triple) manu-
ally generated a rule based on each path.
For example, the sentence There are also aprons
that will cover the sleeves should yield the triple
apron cover sleeve. We examine the tree structure
of the sentence rooted at the concept (apron):
apron+s:17_NN2
cmod-that cover:34_VV0
L--- dobj sleeve+s:44_NN2
L--- det the:40_AT
L--- aux will:29_VM
cmod-that cover:34_VV0
xcomp be+:8_VBR
L--- ncmod also:12_RR
L--- ncsubj There:2_EX
Here, the relation is relatively simple ? we merely
63
create a rule which requires that the relation is a verb
(i.e. has a V POS tag), the feature has an NN tag and
that there is a dobj GR linking the feature to the
concept. Our rules are effectively a constraint on (a)
which paths should be followed through the tree, and
(b) which items in that path should be noted in our
concept-relation-feature triple. By creating several
such rules and applying them to a large number of
sentences, we extract potential features and relations
for our concepts.
We avoided specifying too many POS tags and
GRs in rules since this could have resulted in too
few matching paths. In the above example, we could
have required also a cmod-that relation linking the
feature and concept ? but this would have excluded
sentences like the apron covered the sleeves. Con-
versely, we avoided making our rules too permis-
sive. For example, eliminating the dobj requirement
would have yielded the triple apron be steel from the
sentence the apron hooks were steel.
The application of this method to a number of
concepts in the Wiki500 corpus yielded 15 rules
which we employed in our experiments. We extract
triples using both singular and plural occurrences of
both the concept term and the feature term. We show
the first three of our rules in Table 2. The first stage
of our method uses the 15 rules to extract a very
large number of candidate triples from corpus data.
Rule: relation of concept has a VVN tag, feature
has a NN tag and they are linked by an xcomp
GR
S: This is an anchor which relies solely on be-
ing a heavy weight.
T: anchor be weight
Rule: relation of concept is a verb, feature is an ad-
jective and they are linked by an xcomp GR
S: Sliced apples turn brown with exposure to
air due to the conversion of natural pheno-
lic substances into melanin upon exposure to
oxygen.
T: apple turn brown
Rule: feature of concept has a VV0 tag, relation is
a verb and they are linked by an aux GR
S: Grassy bottoms may be good holding, but
only if the anchor can penetrate the foliage.
T: anchor can penetrate

example sentence (S) and corresponding triple (T).
2.3 Re-ranking based on semantic information
The second stage of our method evaluates the quality
of the extracted candidates using semantic informa-
tion, with the aim of filtering out the poor quality
features generated in the first stage. We would ex-
pect the number of times a triple is extracted for a
given concept to be proportional to the likelihood
that the triple represents a true feature of that con-
cept. However, production frequency alone is not a
sufficient indicator of quality, because concept terms
can produce unexpected candidate feature terms.4
One may attempt to address this issue by intro-
ducing semantic categories. In other words, the
probability of a feature being part of a concept?s
representation is dependent on the semantic cate-
gory to which the concept belongs (for example,
used for-cutting would be expected to have low
probability for animal concepts). We analysed the
norms to quantify this type of semantic information
with the aim of identifying higher-order structure in
the distribution of semantic classes for features and
concepts. The overarching goal was to determine
whether this information can indeed improve the ac-
curacy of feature extraction.
In formal terms, we assume that there is a 2-
dimensional probability distribution over concept
and feature classes, P(C,F), where C is a concept
class (e.g. Apparel) and F is a feature class (e.g.
Materials). Knowing this distribution provides us
with a means of assessing how likely it is that a can-
didate feature f is true for a concept c, assuming that
we know that c ? C and f ? F . The McRae norms
may be considered to be a sample drawn from this
distribution, if the concept and feature terms appear-
ing in the norms can be assigned to suitable concept
and feature classes. These classes were identified
by way of clustering. The reranking step employed
the McRae norms so we could establish an upper
bound for the semantic analysis, although we could
also use other knowledge resources, e.g. the Open
Mind Common Sense database (Singh et al, 2002).
2.3.1 Clustering
We utilised Lin?s similarity measure (1998) for
our similarity metric, employing WordNet (Fell-

baum, 1998) as the basis for calculating similarity.
This metric is suitable for our task as we would
like to generate appropriate superordinate classes for
which we can calculate distributional statistics. We
could merely cluster on the most frequent sense of
concept and feature words in WordNet, but the most
frequent sense in WordNet may not correspond to
the intended sense in our feature norm data.5 So we
consider also other senses of words in WordNet by
employing a manually-annotated list to choose the
correct sense in WordNet. This is only possible for
concept clustering since we don?t possess a manual
WordNet sense annotation for the 7000 McRae fea-
tures; for the feature clustering, we simply use the
most frequent sense in WordNet.
The concepts and feature-head terms appearing
in the recoded norms were each clustered indepen-
dently into 50 clusters using three methods: hi-
erarchical clustering, k-means clustering and non-
negative matrix factorization (NMF). We show the
first five alphabetical elements from three of the
clusters produced by our clustering methods in Table
3. The hierarchical clustering seems to be producing

refer to a slang meaning for the word cheque ? only the third
most frequent meaning refers to kite as a toy, which most people
would understand to be its predominant sense.

the most intuitive clusters.
We calculated the conditional probability P(F |C)
of a feature cluster given a concept cluster using the
data in the McRae norms. Table 5 gives the condi-
tional probability for each of the three feature clus-
ters given each of the three concept clusters that
were presented in Tables 3 and 4 for hierarchical
clustering. For example, P(Materials|Apparel) is
higher than P(Materials|Fruit/Veg): given a concept
in the Apparel cluster the probability of a Materials
feature is relatively high whereas given a concept in
the Fruit/Veg cluster the probability of a Materials
feature is low. The cluster analysis therefore sup-
ports our hypothesis that the likelihood of a partic-
ular feature for a particular concept is dependent on
the semantic categories that both belong to.
2.3.2 Reranking
We investigated whether this distributional semantic
information could be used to improve the quality of
the candidate triples, by using the conditional prob-
abilities of the appropriate feature cluster given the
concept cluster as a weighting factor. To obtain the
probabilities for a triple, we first find the clusters that
the concept and feature-head words belong to. If the
feature-head word of the extracted triple appears in
the norms, its cluster membership is drawn directly
from there; if not, we assign the feature-head to the
feature cluster with which it has the highest average
similarity.6 Having determined the concept and fea-
6We use average-linkage for hiearchical and k-means clus-
tering, and mean cosine similarity for NMF.
65
ture clusters for the triple, we reweight its raw cor-
pus occurrence frequency by multiplying it by the
conditional probability. In this way, incorrect triples
that occur frequently in the data are downgraded and
more plausible triples have their ranking boosted.
2.3.3 Baseline model
We also implemented as a baseline a co-occurrence-
based model, based on the ?SVD? model de-
scribed by Baroni and colleagues (Baroni and Lenci,
2008; Baroni et al, 2009) ? it is a simple, word-
association method, not tailored to extracting fea-
tures. A context-word-by-target-word frequency co-
occurrence matrix was constructed for both corpora,
with a sentence-sized window. Context words and
target words were defined to be the 5,000 and 10,000
most frequent content words in the corpus respec-
tively. The target words were supplemented with
the concept words from the recoded norms. The
co-occurrence matrix was reduced to 150 dimen-
sions by singular value decomposition, and cosine
similarity between pairs of target words was calcu-
lated. The 200 most similar target words to each
concept acted as the feature-head terms extracted by
this model.
3 Experimental Evaluation
3.1 Methods of Evaluation
We considered a number of methods for evaluating
the quality of the extracted feature triples. One pos-
sibility would be to calculate precision and recall
for the extracted triples with respect to the McRae
norms ?gold standard?. However, direct comparison
with the recoded norms is problematic, since there
may be extracted features which are semantically
equivalent to a triple in the norms but possessing a
different lexical form.7
Since semantically identical features can be lex-
ically different, we followed the approach taken in
the ESSLLI 2008 Workshop on semantic models
(Baroni et al, 2008). The gold standard for the ESS-
LLI task was the top 10 features for 44 of the McRae
concepts. For each concept-feature pair an expan-
sion set was generated containing synonyms of the
7For example, avocado have stone appears in the recoded
norms whilst avocado contain pit is extracted by our method;
direct comparison of these two triples results in avocado con-
tain pit being incorrectly marked as an error.
feature terms appearing in the norms. For example,
the feature lives on water was expanded to the set
{aquatic, lake, ocean, river, sea, water}.
We would expect to find in corpus data correct
features that do not appear in our ?gold standard?
(e.g. breathes air is listed for WHALE but for no
other animal). We therefore aim to attain high re-
call when evaluating against the ESSLLI set (since
ideally all features in the norms should be extracted)
but we are somewhat less concerned about achieving
high precision (since extracted features that are not
in the norms may still be correct, e.g. breathes air
for TIGER). To evaluate the ability of our model
to generate such novel features, we also conducted
a manual evaluation of the highest-ranked extracted
features that did not appear in the norms.

3.2 Evaluation
Previous large-scale models of feature extraction
have been evaluated on pairs rather than triples e.g.
Baroni et al (2009). Table 6 presents the results
of our method when we evaluate using the feature-
head term alone (i.e. in calculating precision and re-
call we disregard the relation verb and require only
a match between the feature-head terms in the ex-
tracted triples and the recoded norms). Results for
six sets of extractions are presented. The first set
is the set of features extracted by the SVD baseline.
66
The second set of extracted triples consists of the
full set of triples extracted by our method, prior to
the reweighting stage. ?Top 20 unweighted? gives
the results when all but the top 20 most frequently
extracted triples for each concept are filtered out.
Note that the filtering criteria here is raw extraction
frequency, without reweighting by conditional prob-
abilities. ?Top 20 (clustering type)? are the corre-
sponding results when the features are weighted by
the conditional probability factors (derived from our
three clustering methods) prior to filtering; that is,
using the top 20 reranked features. The effective-
ness of using the semantic class-based analysis data
in our method can be assessed by comparing the fil-
tered results with and without feature weighting.
For the baseline implementation, the results are
better when we use the smaller Wiki500 corpus
compared to the larger Wiki110K corpus. This is
not surprising, since the smaller corpus contains
only those articles which correspond to the concepts
found in the norms. This smaller corpus thus min-
imises noise due to phenomena such as word poly-
semy which are more apparent in the larger corpus.
The results for the baseline model and the unfil-
tered method are quite similar for the Wiki500 cor-
pus, whilst the results for the unfiltered method us-
ing the Wiki110K corpus give the maximum recall
achieved by our method; 89.4% of the features are
extracted, although this figure is closely followed by
that of the BNC at 88.1%. As the unfiltered method
is deliberately greedy, a large number of features are
being extracted and therefore precision is low.

Table 7: Results for our best method when matching on
features and relations.
For the results of the filtered method, where all
but the top 20 of features were discarded, we see the
benefit of reranking, with the reranked frequencies
for all three clustering types yielding much higher
precision and recall scores than the unweighted
method. Our best performance is achieved using the
BNC and hierarchical clustering, where we obtain
19.4% precision and 38.9% recall. Thus both gen-
eral and encyclopedic corpus data prove useful for
the task. An interesting question is whether these
two data types offer different, complementary fea-
ture types for the task. We discuss this point further
in section 3.3.
Using exactly the same gold standard, Baroni et
al. (2009) obtained precision of 23.9%. However,
this result is not directly comparable with ours, since
we define precision over the whole set of extracted
features while Baroni et al considered the top 10
extracted features only.
The innovation of our method is that it uses infor-
mation about the GR-graph of the sentence to also
extract the relation which appears in the path link-
ing the concept and feature terms in the sentence,
which is not possible in a purely co-occurrence-
based model. We therefore also evaluated the ex-
tracted triples using the full relation + feature-head
pair (i.e. both the feature and the relation verb have
to be correct). The results for our best method are
shown in Table 7. Unsurprisingly, because this task
is more difficult, precision and recall are reduced.
However, since we enforce no constraints on what
the relation may be and since we do not have ex-
panded synonym sets for our relations (as we do for
our features) it is actually impressive to have both
the exact relation verb and feature matching with the
recoded norms almost one in every five times. To our
knowledge, our work is the first to try to compare ex-
tracted features to the full relation and feature norm
parts of the triple.
3.3 Qualitative analysis
Since a key aim of our work is to learn novel features
in corpus data, we also performed a qualitative eval-
uation of the extracted features and relations. This
analysis revealed that many of the errors were not
true errors but potentially valid triples missing from
the gold standard. Table 8 shows the top 10 features
for two concepts extracted by our best method from
the Wiki500 corpus and the BNC corpus. We la-
bel those features that are correct according to the
norms as Correct (C), those which do not appear in
our norms but we believe to be plausible as Plausi-
ble (P), and those that do not appear in the norms
and are also implausible as Incorrect (I). We can see
that our method has detected several plausible fea-
tures not appearing in the norms (and thus our gold
standard), e.g. swan have chick and screwdriver be

sharp. Indeed, it could be argued that some ?incor-
rect? features (e.g. screwdriver achieve goal) could
be considered to be at least broadly accurate. We
recognise that the ideal evaluation for our method
would involve having human participants assess the
extracted features for a diverse cross-section of our
concepts, but this is beyond the scope of this paper.
When considering the top 20 features extracted
using our best method applied to the Wiki500 cor-
pus versus the BNC corpus, the overlap of features
is relatively low at 22.73%. When one also takes the
extracted relations into account, this figure descends
to 6.45%. It is clear that relatively distinct groups of
features are being extracted from the encyclopedic
and general corpus data. Future work could investi-
gate combining these for improved performance e.g.
using the intersection of the best features from the
BNC and Wiki110k corpora to improve precision
and the union to improve recall.
4 Discussion
This paper examined large-scale, unconstrained ac-
quisition of human-like feature norms from corpus
data. Our work was not limited to only a subset
of concepts, relation types or concept-feature pairs.
Rather, we investigated concepts, features and rela-
tions in conjunction, and extracted property norm-
like concept-relation-feature triples.
Our investigation shows that external knowledge
is highly useful in guiding this challenging task. En-
cyclopedic information proved useful for feature ex-
traction: although our Wikipedia corpora are consid-
erably smaller than the BNC, they performed almost
equally well. We also demonstrated the benefits of
employing syntactic information in feature extrac-
tion: our base extraction method operating on parsed
data outperforms the co-occurrence-based baseline
and permits us to extract relation verbs. This un-
derscores the usefulness of parsing for semantically
meaningful feature extraction. This is consistent
with recent work in the field of computational lex-
ical semantics, although GR data has not previously
been successfully applied to feature extraction.
We showed that semantic information about co-
occurring concept and feature clusters can be used
to enhance feature acquisition. We employed the
McRae norms for our analysis, however we could
also employ other knowledge resources and cluster
relation verbs using recent methods, e.g. Sun and
Korhonen (2009), Vlachos et al (2009).
Our paper has also investigated methods of eval-
uation, which is a critical but difficult issue for fea-
ture extraction. Most recent approaches have been
evaluated against the ESSLLI sub-set of the McRae
norms which expands the set of features in the norms
with their synonyms. Yet even expansion sets like
the ESSLLI norms do not facilitate adequate eval-
uation because they are not complete in the sense
that there are true features which are not included
in the norms. Our qualitative analysis shows that
many of the errors against the recoded norms are
in fact correct or plausible features. Future work
can aim for larger-scale qualitative evaluation using
multiple judges as well as investigating other task-
based evaluations. For example, we have demon-
strated that our automatically-acquired feature rep-
resentations can make predictions about fMRI activ-
ity associated with concept stimuli that are as pow-
erful as those produced by a manually-selected set
of features (Devereux et al, 2010).
