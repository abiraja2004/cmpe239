PROJECT GOALS 
The Candide project has two objectives. First, we want to de- 
velop a fully-automatic, large vocabulary, French-to-English 
translation system. Second, we want to develop an interac- 
tive translator's workstation that will increase the speed and 
productivity of a human translator. The philosophy of the 
project is to combine, within a probabilistic framework, both 
statistical information acquired automatically from bilingual 
corpora and linguistic knowledge provided by human experts. 
RECENT RESULTS 
System Overview 
The automatic system is organized around an analysis- 
transfer-synthesis architecture. A French sentence is first an- 
alyzed into an intermediate structure in which various linguis- 
tic components are identified. This structure is then trans- 
fared to a corresponding structure in English. Finally, an 
English sentence is synthesized from the intermediate Eng- 
lish. 
The heart of the system is the transfer component. We view 
transfer from an information-theoretic perspective and attack 
it with statistical modeling techniques. Candide's transfer 
component incorporates a stochastic language model that es- 
timates the probability of an intermediate English structure; 
a stochastic translation model that estimates the conditional 
probability of a French structure given an English one; and a 
decoder that, given a French structure, searches for that Eng- 
lish structure which maximizes the product of the language 
model and translation model probabilities. 
Recent Improvements  
Over the past year we improved Candide on several fronts. 
We increased the sizes of our English and French vocabularies 
to 70,000 and 280,000 respectively. We improved the analy- 
sis phase by overhauling the morphological tables, refining 
the treatment of numerical expressions and proper names, 
improving various syntactic transformations, and improving 
the statistical bilingual sense disambiguation module. 
We enhanced the translation model by using maximum en- 
tropy techniques to make it more sensitive to context. We 
developed a new language model based upon the recently for- 
mulated notion of link grammar. The link grammar model 
takes into account long range correlations between words in 
a sentence, thus attacking a well-known limitation of our pre- 
vious trigram model.

Finally, we re-trained all our stochastic models using more 
text, including 100 million words from the Wall Street Jour- 
nal and UPI. 
Current Performance 
The table summarizes the gain in performance of our sys- 
tem between the July 1992 and July 1993 ARPA sponsored 
machine translation evaluations. 
Fluency Adequacy Time Ratio 
1992 1993 1992 1993 1992 1998 
Fully Automatic .511 .580 .575 .670 
Machine Aided .819 .838 .837 .850 .688 .625 
Manual .833 .840 
Fluency and adequacy are scored on scales from 0 to 1, with 1 
being the highest score. The time ratio is the factor by which 
the use of the machine-aided system decreases the time spent 
by a human translator. 
We also evaluate our automatic translation system on sen- 
tences of 15 words or less randomly chosen from a test corpus 
of Canadian parliamentary proceedings. The 1992 version of 
the system translates 45% of the sentences accurately, while 
the 1993 system translates 62% of the sentences accurately. 
PLANS FOR THE COMING YEAR 
Our strategy is two-pronged. First, we want to bring the 
current incarnation of Candide to its full potential, thus es- 
tablishing a benchmark for our future research. Second, we 
want to begin developing a new version of Oandide that uses 
more sophisticated intermediate structures. 
For the current version, we will enlarge the vocabularies and 
make incremental corrections to several analysis and synthe- 
sis components. We will also speed-up the decoder so that 
we can perform tests more quickly. For the next version, we 
will continue work on the link grammar language model. We 
will also begin developing a new translation model that takes 
advantage of the enhanced intermediate structures.
