Abstract
We integrate semantic information at two
stages of the translation process of a state-of-
the-art SMT system. A Word Sense Disam-
biguation (WSD) classifier produces a proba-
bility distribution over the translation candi-
dates of source words which is exploited in
two ways. First, the probabilities serve to
rerank a list of n-best translations produced by
the system. Second, the WSD predictions are
used to build a supplementary language model
for each sentence, aimed to favor translations
that seem more adequate in this specific sen-
tential context. Both approaches lead to sig-
nificant improvements in translation perfor-
mance, highlighting the usefulness of source
side disambiguation for SMT.
1 Introduction
Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) is the task of
identifying the sense of words in texts by reference
to some pre-existing sense inventory. The selec-
tion of the appropriate inventory and WSD method
strongly depends on the goal WSD intends to serve:
recent methods are increasingly oriented towards
the disambiguation needs of specific end applica-
tions, and explicitly aim at improving the overall
performance of complex Natural Language Process-
ing systems (Ide and Wilks, 2007; Carpuat and Wu,
2007). This task-oriented conception of WSD is
manifested in the area of multilingual semantic pro-
cessing: supervised methods, which were previously
shown to give the best results, are being abandoned
in favor of unsupervised ones that do not rely on pre-
annotated training data. Accordingly, pre-defined
semantic inventories, that usually served to provide
the lists of candidate word senses, are being replaced
by senses relevant to the considered applications and
directly identified from corpora by means of word
sense induction methods.
In a multilingual setting, the sense inventories
needed for disambiguation are generally built from
all possible translations of words or phrases in a par-
allel corpus (Carpuat and Wu, 2007; Chan et al.,
2007), or by using more complex representations
of the semantics of translations (Apidianaki, 2009;
Mihalcea et al., 2010; Lefever and Hoste, 2010).
However, integrating this semantic knowledge into
Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) raises sev-
eral challenges: the way in which the predictions of
the WSD classifier have to be taken into account;
the type of context exploited for disambiguation;
the target words to be disambiguated (?all-words?
WSD vs. WSD restricted to target words satisfy-
ing specific criteria); the use of a single classifier
versus building separate classifiers for each source
word; the quantity and type of data used for training
the classifier (e.g., use of raw data or of more ab-
stract representations, such as lemmatization, allow-
ing to deal with sparseness issues), and many oth-
ers. Seemingly, the optimal way to take advantage
of WSD predictions remains an open issue.
In this work, we carry out a set of experiments
to investigate the impact of integrating the predic-
tions of a cross-lingual WSD classifier into an SMT
system, at two different stages of the translation pro-
cess. The first approach exploits the probability dis-
tribution built by the WSD classifier over the set of
translations of words found in the parallel corpus,
1
for reranking the translations in the n-best list gen-
erated by the SMT system. Words in the list that
match one of the proposed translations are boosted
and are thus more likely to appear in the final trans-
lation. Our results on the English-French IWSLT?11
task show substantial improvements in translation
quality. The second approach provides a tighter in-
tegration of the WSD classifier with the rest of the
system: using the WSD predictions, an additional
sentence specific language model is estimated and
used during decoding. These additional local mod-
els can be used as an external knowledge source to
reinforce translation hypotheses matching the pre-
diction of the WSD system.
In the rest of the paper, we present related work
on integrating semantic information into SMT (Sec-
tion 2). The WSD classifier used in the current study
is described in Section 3. We then present the two
approaches adopted for integrating the WSD out-
put into SMT (Section 4). Evaluation results are
presented in Section 5, before concluding and dis-
cussing some avenues for future work.
2 Related work
Word sense disambiguation systems generally work
at the word level: given an input word and its con-
text, they predict its (most likely) meaning. At
the same time, state-of-the-art translation systems
all consider groups of words (phrases, tuples, etc.)
rather than single words in the translation process.
This discrepancy between the units used in MT and
those used in WSD is one of the major difficul-
ties in integrating word predictions into the decoder.
This was, for instance, one of the reasons for the
somewhat disappointing results obtained by Carpuat
and Wu (2005) when the output of a WSD system
was directly incorporated into a Chinese-English
SMT system. Because of this difficulty, other cross-
lingual semantics works have considered only sim-
plified tasks, like blank-filling, without addressing
the integration of the WSD models in full-scale MT
systems (Vickrey et al., 2005; Specia, 2006).
Since the pioneering work of Carpuat and Wu
(2005), several more successful ways to take WSD
predictions into account have been proposed. For
instance, Carpuat and Wu (2007) proposed to gen-
eralize the WSD system so that it performs a fully
phrasal multiword disambiguation. However, given
that the number of phrases is far larger than the num-
ber of words, this approach suffers from sparsity
and computational problems, as it requires training
a classifier for each entry of the phrase table.
Chan et al. (2007) introduced a way to modify the
rule weights of a hierarchical translation system to
reflect the predictions of their WSD system. While
their approach and ours are built on the same intu-
ition (an adaptation of a model to incorporate word
predictions) their work is specific to hierarchical
systems, while ours can be applied to any decoder
that uses a language model. Haque et al. (2009) et
Haque et al. (2010) introduce lexico-syntactic de-
scriptions in the form of supertags as source lan-
guage context-informed features in a phrase-based
SMT and a state-of-the-art hierarchical model, re-
spectively, and report significant gains in translation
quality.
Closer to our work, Mauser et al. (2009) and Pa-
try and Langlais (2011) train a global lexicon model
that predicts the bag of output words from the bag
of input words. As no explicit alignment between
input and output words is used, words are chosen
based on the (global) input context. For each input
sentence, the decoder considers these word predic-
tions as an additional feature that it uses to define a
new model score which favors translation hypothe-
ses containing words predicted by the global lexicon
model. A difference between this approach and our
work is that instead of using a global lexicon model,
we disambiguate a subset of the words in the input
sentence by employing a WSD classifier that cre-
ates a probability distribution over the translations
of each word in its context.
The unsupervised cross-lingual WSD classifier
used in this work is similar to the one proposed in
Apidianaki (2009). The original classifier disam-
biguates new instances of words in context by se-
lecting the most appropriate cluster of translations
among a set of candidate clusters found in an auto-
matically built bilingual sense inventory. The sense
inventory exploited by the classifier is created by
a cross-lingual word sense induction (WSI) method
that reveals the senses of source words by grouping
their translations into clusters according to their se-
mantic proximity, revealed by a distributional sim-
ilarity calculation. The resulting clusters represent
2
the source words? candidate senses. This WSD
method gave good results in a word prediction task
but, similarly to the work of Vickrey et al. (2005)
and of Specia (2006), the predictions are not inte-
grated into a complete MT system.
3 The WSD classifier
Our WSD classifier is a variation of the one intro-
duced in Apidianaki (2009). The main difference
is that here the classifier serves to discriminate be-
tween unclustered translations of a word and to as-
sign a probability to each translation for new in-
stances of the word in context. Each translation is
represented by a source language feature vector that
the classifier uses for disambiguation. All experi-
ments carried out in this study are for the English
(EN) - French (FR) language pair.
3.1 Source Language Feature Vectors
Preprocessing The information needed by the clas-
sifier is gathered from the EN-FR training data pro-
vided for the IWSLT?11 evaluation task.1 The
dataset consists of 107,268 parallel sentences, word-
aligned in both translation directions using GIZA++
(Och and Ney, 2003). We disambiguate EN words
found in the parallel corpus that satisfy the set of
criteria described below.
Two bilingual lexicons are built from the align-
ment results and filtered to eliminate spurious align-
ments. First, translation correspondences with a
probability lower than a threshold are discarded;2
then translations are filtered by part-of-speech
(PoS), keeping for each word only translations per-
taining to the same grammatical category;3 finally,
only intersecting alignments (i.e., correspondences
found in the lexicons of both directions) are retained.
Given that the lexicons contain word forms, the in-
tersection is calculated based on lemmatization in-
formation in order to perform a generalization over
the contents of the lexicons. For instance, if the EN
adjective regular is translated by habituelle (femi-
1http://www.iwslt2011.org/
2The translation probabilities between word tokens are
found in the translation table produced by GIZA++; the thresh-
old is set to 0.01.
3For this filtering, we employ a PoS and lemmatization lex-
icon built after tagging both parts of the training corpus with
TreeTagger (Schmid, 1994).
nine singular form of the adjective habituel) in the
EN-FR lexicon, but is found to translate habituel
(masculine singular form) in the other direction,
the EN-FR correspondence regular/habituelle is re-
tained (because the two variants of the adjective are
reduced to the same lemma).
All lexicon entries satisfying the above criteria are
retained and used for disambiguation. In these initial
experiments, we disambiguate English words having
less than 20 French translations in the lexicon. Each
French translation of an English word that appears
more than once in the training corpus4 is character-
ized by a weighted English feature vector built from
the training data.
Vector building The feature vectors corresponding
to the translations are built by exploiting information
from the source contexts (Apidianaki, 2008; Grefen-
stette, 1994). For each translation of an EN word w,
we extract the content words that co-occur with w
in the corresponding source sentences of the parallel
corpus (i.e. the content words that occur in the same
sentence as w whenever it is translated by this trans-
lation). The extracted source language words con-
stitute the features of the vector built for the transla-
tion.
For each translation Ti of w, let N be the number
of features retained from the corresponding source
context. Each feature Fj (1 ? j ? N) receives a to-
tal weight tw(Fj,Ti) defined as the product of the
feature?s global weight, gw(Fj), and its local weight
with that translation, lw(Fj,Ti):
tw(Fj,Ti) = gw(Fj) ? lw(Fj,Ti) (1)
The global weight of a feature Fj is a function of
the number Ni of translations (Ti?s) to which Fj is re-
lated, and of the probabilities (pi j) that Fj co-occurs
with instances of w translated by each of the Ti?s:
gw(Fj) = 1?
?Ti pi j log(pi j)
Ni
(2)
Each of the pi j?s is computed as the ratio between
the co-occurrence frequency of Fj with w when
translated as Ti, denoted as cooc frequency(Fj,Ti),
4We do not consider hapax translations because they often
correspond to alignment errors.
3
and the total number of features (N) seen with Ti:
pi j =
cooc frequency(Fj,Ti)
N
(3)
Finally, the local weight lw(Fj,Ti) between Fj and Ti
directly depends on their co-occurrence frequency:
lw(Fj,Ti) = log(cooc frequency(Fj,Ti)) (4)
3.2 Cross-Lingual WSD
The weighted feature vectors corresponding to the
different translations of an English word are used
for disambiguation.5 As noted in Section 3.1, we
disambiguate source words satisfying a set of crite-
ria. Disambiguation is performed by comparing the
vector associated with each translation to the new
context of the words in the input sentences from the
IWSLT?11 test set.
More precisely, the information contained in each
vector is exploited by the WSD classifier to produce
a probability distribution over the translations, for
each new instance of a word in context. We dis-
ambiguate word forms (not lemmas) in order to di-
rectly use the selected translations in the translated
texts. However, we should note that in some cases
this reduces the role of WSD to distinguishing be-
tween different forms of one word and no different
senses are involved. Using more abstract represen-
tations (corresponding to senses) is one of the per-
spectives of this work.
The classifier assigns a score to each transla-
tion by comparing information in the corresponding
source vector to information found in the new con-
text. Given that the vector features are lemmatized,
the new context is lemmatized as well and the lem-
mas of the content words are gathered in a bag of
words. The adequacy of each translation for a new
instance of a word is estimated by comparing the
translation?s vector with the bag of words built from
the new context. If common features are found be-
tween the new context and a translation vector, an
association score is calculated corresponding to the
mean of the weights of the common features rela-
tively to the translation (i.e. found in its vector). In
5The vectors are not used for clustering the translations as
in Apidianaki (2009) but all translations are considered as can-
didate senses.
Equation (5), (CFj)|CF |j=1 is the set of common fea-
tures between the translation vector Vi and the new
context C and tw is the weight of a CF with transla-
tion Ti (cf. formula (1)).
assoc score(Vi,C) =
?|CF |j=1 tw(CFj,Ti)
|CF| (5)
The scores assigned to the different translations of a
source word are normalized to sum up to one.
In this way, a subset of the words that occur in the
input sentences from the test set are annotated with
their translations and the associated scores (contex-
tual probabilities), as shown in the example in Fig-
ure 1.6 The WSD classifier makes predictions only
for the subset of the words found in the source part
of the parallel test set that were retained from the ini-
tial EN-FR lexicon after filtering. Table 1 presents
the total coverage of the WSD method as well as its
coverage for words of different PoS, with a focus
on content words. We report the number of disam-
biguated words for each content PoS (cf. third col-
umn) and the corresponding percentage, calculated
on the basis of the total number of words pertaining
to this PoS (cf. second column). We observe that
the coverage of the method on nouns and adjectives
is higher than the one on verbs. Given the rich ver-
bal morphology of French, several verbs have a very
high number of translations in the bilingual lexicon
(over 20) and are not handled during disambigua-
tion. The same applies to function words (articles,
prepositions, conjunctions, etc.) included in the ?all
PoS? category.
4 Integrating Semantics into SMT
In this section, we present two ways to integrate
WSD predictions into an SMT decoder. The first
one (Section 4.1) is a simple method based on n-
best reranking. This method, already proposed in
the literature (Specia et al., 2008), allows us to eas-
ily evaluate the impact of WSD predictions on au-
tomatic translation quality. The second one (Sec-
tion 4.2) builds on the idea, introduced in (Crego et
al., 2010), of using an additional language model to
6Some source words are tagged with only one translation
(e.g. stones {pierres(1.000)}) because their other translations
in the lexicon occurred only once in the training corpus and,
consequently, were not considered.

4.1 N-best List Reranking
A simple way to influence translation hypotheses se-
lection with WSD information is to use the WSD
probabilities of translation variants to produce an ad-
ditional feature appended to the n-best list after its
generation. The feature value should reflect the de-
gree to which a particular hypothesis includes pro-
posed WSD variants for the respective words. Re-
running the standard MERT optimization procedure
on the augmented features gives a new set of model
weights, that are used to rescore the n-best list.
We propose the following method of features con-
struction. Given the phrase alignment information
between a source sentence and a hypothesis, we ver-
ify if one or more of the proposed WSD variants for
the source word occur in the corresponding phrase of
the translation hypothesis. If this is the case, the cor-
responding probabilities are additively accumulated
for the current hypothesis. At the end, two features
are appended to each hypothesis in the n-best list:
the total score accumulated for the hypothesis and
the same score normalized by the number of words
in the hypothesis.
Two MERT initialization schemes were consid-
ered: (1) all model weights are initialized to zero,
and (2) all the weights of ?standard? features are ini-
tialized to the values found by MERT and the new
WSD features to zero.
4.2 Local Language Models
We propose to adapt the approach introduced in
Crego et al. (2010) as an alternative way to inte-
grate the WSD predictions within the decoder: for
each sentence to be translated, an additional lan-
guage model (LM) is estimated and taken into ac-
count during decoding. As this additional ?local?
model depends on the source sentence, it can be
used as an external source of knowledge to reinforce
translation hypotheses complying with criteria pre-
dicted from the whole source sentence. For instance,
the unigram probabilities of the additional LM can
be derived from the (word) predictions of a WSD
system, bigram probabilities from the prediction of
phrases and so on and so forth. Although this ap-
proach was suggested in (Crego et al., 2010), this
5
is, to the best of our knowledge, the first time it is
experimentally validated.
In practice, the predictions of the WSD system
described in Section 3 can be integrated by defining,
for each sentence, an additional unigram language
model as follows:
? each translation predicted by the WSD classi-
fier can be generated by the language model
with the probability estimated by the WSD
classifier; no information about the source
word that has been disambiguated is consid-
ered;
? the probability of unknown words is set to a
small arbitrary constant.
Even if most of the words composing the transla-
tion hypothesis are considered as unknown words,
hypotheses that contain the words predicted by the
WSD system still have a higher LM score and are
therefore preferred. Note that even if we only use
unigram language models in our experiments, as
senses are predicted at the word level, our approach
is able to handle disambiguation of phrases as well.
This approach has two main advantages over ex-
isting ways to integrate WSD predictions in an SMT
system. First, no hard decisions are made: errors
of the WSD can be ?corrected? by the translation.
Second, sense disambiguation at the word level is
naturally and automatically propagated at the phrase
level: the additional LM is influencing all phrase
pairs using one of the predicted words.
Compared to the reranking approach introduced
in the previous section, this method results in a
tighter integration with the decoder. In particu-
lar, the WSD predictions are applied before search-
space pruning and are therefore expected to have a
more important role.
5 Evaluation
5.1 Experimental Setting
In all our experiments, we considered the TED-
talk English to French data set provided by the
IWSLT?11 evaluation campaign, a collection of pub-
lic speeches on a variety of topics. We used the
Moses decoder (Koehn et al., 2007).
The TED-talk corpus is a small data set made
of a monolingual corpus (111,431 sentences) used
to estimate a 4-gram language model with KN-
smoothing, and a bilingual corpus (107,268 sen-
tences) used to extract the phrase table. All data
are tokenized, cleaned and converted to lowercase
letters using the tools provided by the WMT orga-
nizers.7 We then use a standard training pipeline to
construct the translation model: the bitext is aligned
using GIZA++, symmetrized using the grow-diag-
final-and heuristic; the phrase table is extracted and
scored using the tools distributed with Moses. Fi-
nally, systems are optimized using MERT on the
934 sentences of the dev-2010 set. All evalua-
tions are performed on the 1,664 sentences of the
test-2010 set.
5.2 Baseline
In addition to the models introduced in Section 4,
we considered two other supplementary models as
baselines. The first one uses the IBM 1 model esti-
mated during the SMT system training as a simple
WSD system: for each source sentence, a unigram
additional language model is defined by taking, for
each source, the 20 best translations according to the
IBM 1 model and their probability. Model 1 has
been shown to be one of the best performing fea-
tures to be added to an SMT system in a reranking
step (Och et al., 2004) and can be seen as a naive
WSD classifier.
To test the validity of our approach, we repli-
cate the ?oracle? experiments of Crego et al. (2010)
and estimate the best gain our method can achieve.
These experiments consist in using the reference to
train a local n-gram language model (with n in the
range 1 to 3) which amounts, in the local language
model method of Section 4.2, to assuming that the
WSD system correctly predicted a single translation
for each source word.
5.3 Results
Table 2 reports the results of our experiments. It
appears that, for the considered task, sense disam-
biguation improves translation performance: n-best
rescoring results in a 0.37 BLEU improvement and
using an additional language model brings about an
improvement of up to a 0.88 BLEU. In both cases,
MERT assigns a large weight to the additional fea-

Table 3: Contrastive lexical evaluation: % of words correctly translated within each PoS class
tures during tuning. When rescoring n-best, an im-
provement is observed only when the weights are
initialized to zero and not to the weights resulting
from the previous optimization, maybe because of
the difficulty to exit the local minimum MERT had
found earlier.
As expected, integrating the WSD predictions
with an additional language model results in a larger
improvement than simple rescoring, which shows
the importance of applying this new source of in-
formation early in the translation pipeline, before
search space pruning. Also note that the system us-
ing the IBM 1 predictions is outperformed by the
system using the WSD classifier introduced in Sec-
tion 3, showing the quality of its predictions.
Oracle experiments stress the high potential of
the method introduced in (Crego et al., 2010) as a
way to integrate external sources of knowledge: all
three conditions result in large improvements over
the baseline and the proposed methods. It must,
however, be noted that contrary to the WSD method
introduced in Section 3, these oracle experiments
rely on sense predictions for all source words and
not only content words. Surprisingly enough, pre-
dicting phrases instead of words results only in a
small improvement. Additional experiments are re-
quired to explain why 2-gram oracle achieved such
a low performance.
5.4 Contrastive lexical evaluation
All the measures used for evaluating the impact
of WSD information on translation show improve-
ments, as discussed in the previous section. We
complement these results with another measure of
translation performance, proposed by Max et al.
(2010), which allows for a more fine-grained con-
trastive evaluation of the translations produced by
different systems. The method permits to compare
the results produced by the systems on different
word classes and to take into account the source
words that were actually translated. We focus this
evaluation on the classes of content words (nouns,
adjectives, verbs and adverbs) on which WSD had
an important coverage. Our aim is, first, to ex-
plore how these words are handled by a WSD-
informed SMT system (the system using the lo-
cal language models) compared to the baseline sys-
tem that does not exploit any semantic informa-
tion; and, second, to investigate whether their dis-
ambiguation influences the translation of surround-
ing non-disambiguated words.
Table 3 reports the percentage of words cor-
rectly translated by the semantically-informed sys-
tem within each content word class: consistent gains
in translation quality are observed for all parts-of-
speech compared to the baseline, and the best results
are obtained for nouns.

Table 4 shows how the words surrounding a dis-
ambiguated word w (noun, verb, adjective or adverb)
in the text are handled by the two systems. More
precisely, we look at the translation of words in the
immediate context of w, i.e. at positions w?2, w?1,
w+1 and w+2. The left column reports the percent-
age of correct translations produced by the baseline
system (without disambiguation) for words in these
positions; the right column shows the positive im-
pact that the disambiguation of a word has on the
translation of its neighbors. Note that this time we
look at disambiguated words and their context with-
out evaluating the correctness of the WSD predic-
tions. Nevertheless, even in this case, consistent
gains are observed when WSD information is ex-
ploited. For instance, when a noun is disambiguated,
70.46% and 76.3% of the immediately preceding
(w?1) and following (w+1) words, respectively, are
correctly translated, versus 68.69% and 75.17% of
correct translations produced by the baseline system.
6 Conclusion and future work
The preliminary results presented in this paper on
integrating cross-lingual WSD into a state-of-the-
art SMT system are encouraging. Both adopted ap-
proaches (n-best rescoring and local language mod-
eling) benefit from the predictions of the proposed
cross-lingual WSD classifier. The contrastive eval-
uation results further show that WSD improves not
only the translation of disambiguated words, but also
the translation of neighboring words in the input
texts.
We consider various ways for extending this
work. First, future experiments will involve the use
of more abstract representations of senses than indi-
vidual translations, by applying a cross-lingual word
sense induction method to the training corpus prior
to disambiguation. We will also experiment with
disambiguation at the level of lemmas, to reduce
sparseness issues, and with different ways for han-
dling lemmatized predictions by the SMT systems.
Furthermore, we intend to extend the coverage of the
WSD method by exploring other filtering methods
for cleaning the alignment lexicons, and by address-
ing the disambiguation of words of all PoS.
