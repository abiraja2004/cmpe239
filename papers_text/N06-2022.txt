Abstract
The identification of personality by auto-
matic analysis of conversation has many
applications in natural language process-
ing, from leader identification in meetings
to partner matching on dating websites.
We automatically train models of the main
five personality dimensions, on a corpus
of conversation extracts and personality
ratings. Results show that the models per-
form better than the baseline, and their
analysis confirms previous findings link-
ing language and personality, while re-
vealing many new linguistic and prosodic
markers.
1 Introduction
It is well known that utterances convey information
about the speaker in addition to their semantic con-
tent. One such type of information consists of cues
to the speaker?s personality traits, typically assessed
along five dimensions known as the Big Five (Nor-
man, 1963):
? Extraversion (sociability, assertiveness)
? Emotional stability (vs. neuroticism)
? Agreeableness to other people (friendliness)
? Conscientiousness (discipline)
? Intellect (openness to experience)
Findings include that extraverts talk more, louder,
and faster, with fewer pauses and hesitations, and
more informal language (Scherer, 1979; Furnham,
1990; Heylighen and Dewaele, 2002; Gill and Ober-
lander, 2002). Neurotics use more 1st person sin-
gular pronouns and negative emotion words, while
conscientious people avoid negations and negative
emotion words (Pennebaker and King, 1999). The
use of words related to insight and the avoidance of
past tense indicate intellect, and swearing and neg-
ative emotion words mark disagreeableness. Cor-
relations are higher in spoken language, possibly
especially in informal conversation (Mehl et al, in
press).
Previous work has modeled emotion and person-
ality in virtual agents, and classified emotions from
actor?s speech (Andre? et al, 1999; Liscombe et al,
2003). However, to our knowledge no one has tested
whether it is possible to automatically recognize per-
sonality from conversation extracts of unseen sub-
jects. Our hypothesis is that automatic analysis of
conversation to detect personality has application
in a wide range of language processing domains.
Identification of leaders using personality dimen-
sions could be useful in analyzing meetings and the
conversations of suspected terrorists (Hogan et al,
1994; Tucker and Whittaker, 2004; Nunn, 2005).
Dating websites could analyze text messages to try
to match personalities and increase the chances of a
successful relationship (Donnellan et al, 2004). Di-
alogue systems could adapt to the user?s personality,
like humans do (Reeves and Nass, 1996; Funder and
Sneed, 1993). This work is a first step toward indi-
vidual adaptation in dialogue systems.
We present non-linear statistical models for rank-
ing utterances based on the Big Five personality
traits. Results show that the models perform sig-
nificantly better than a random baseline, and that
prosodic features are good indicators of extraver-
sion. A qualitative analysis confirms previous find-
ings linking language and personality, while reveal-
ing many new linguistic markers.
2 Experimental method
Our approach can be summarized in five steps: (1)
collect individual corpora; (2) collect personality
85
ratings for each participant; (3) extract relevant fea-
tures from the texts; (4) build statistical models of
the personality ratings based on the features; and (5)
test the learned models on the linguistic outputs of
unseen individuals.
2.1 Spoken language and personality ratings
The data consists of daily-life conversation extracts
of 96 participants wearing an Electronically Acti-
vated Recorder (EAR) for two days, collected by
Mehl et al (in press). To preserve the participants?
privacy, random bits of conversation were recorded,
and only the participants? utterances were tran-
scribed, making it impossible to reconstruct whole
conversations. The corpus contains 97,468 words
and 15,269 utterances. Table 1 shows utterances for
two participants judged as introvert and extravert.
Introvert:
- Yeah you would do kilograms. Yeah I see what you?re saying.
- On Tuesday I have class. I don?t know.
- I don?t know. A16. Yeah, that is kind of cool.
- I don?t know. I just can?t wait to be with you and not have
to do this every night, you know?
- Yeah. You don?t know. Is there a bed in there? Well ok just...
Extravert:
- That?s my first yogurt experience here. Really watery. Why?
- Damn. New game.
- Oh.
- Yeah, but he, they like each other. He likes her.
- They are going to end up breaking up and he?s going to be like.
Table 1: Extracts from the corpus, for participants
rated as extremely introvert and extravert.
Between 5 and 7 independent observers scored
each extract using the Big Five Inventory (John and
Srivastava, 1999). Mehl et al (in press) report
strong inter-observer reliabilities for all dimensions
(r = 0.84, p < 0.01). Average observers? ratings
were used as the scores for our experiments.
2.2 Feature selection
Features are automatically extracted from each ex-
tract (see Table 2). We compute the ratio of words
in each category from the LIWC utility (Pennebaker
et al, 2001), as those features are correlated with the
Big Five dimensions (Pennebaker and King, 1999).
Additional psychological characteristics were com-
puted by averaging word feature counts from the
MRC psycholinguistic database (Coltheart, 1981).
In an attempt to capture initiative-taking in conversa-
tion (Walker and Whittaker, 1990; Furnham, 1990),
we introduce utterance type features using heuristics
on the parse tree to tag each utterance as a command,
prompt, question or assertion. Overall tagging accu-
racy over 100 randomly selected utterances is 88%.
As personality influences speech, we also use Praat

(Boersma, 2001) to compute prosodic features char-
acterizing the voice?s pitch, intensity, and speech
rate.
2.3 Statistical model
By definition, personality evaluation assesses rela-
tive differences between individuals, e.g. one per-
86
son is described as an extravert because the average
population is not. Thus, we formulate personality
recognition as a ranking problem: given two indi-
viduals? extracts, which shows more extraversion?
Personality models are trained using RankBoost,
a boosting algorithm for ranking, for each Big Five
trait using the observers? ratings of personality (Fre-
und et al, 1998). RankBoost expresses the learned
models as rules, which support the analysis of dif-
ferences in the personality models (see section 3).
Each rule modifies the conversation extract?s rank-
ing score by ? whenever a feature value exceeds ex-
perimentally learned thresholds, e.g. Rule 1 of the
extraversion model in Table 4 increases the score of
an extract by ? = 1.43 if the speech rate is above
0.73 words per second. Models are evaluated by a
ranking error function which reports the percentage
of misordered pairs of conversation extracts.
3 Results
The features characterize many aspects of lan-
guage production: utterance types, content and syn-
tax (LIWC), psycholinguistic statistics (MRC), and
prosody. To evaluate how each feature set con-
tributes to the final result, we trained models with
the full feature set and with each set individually.
Results are summarized in Table 3. The baseline is a
model ranking extracts randomly, producing a rank-
ing error of 0.5 on average. Results are averaged
over a 10 fold cross-validation.

validation for different feature sets (Type=utterance
type, Pros=prosody). Best models are in bold.
Paired t-tests show that models of extraversion,
agreeableness, conscientiousness and intellect using
all features are better than the random ordering base-
line (two-tailed, p < 0.05)1. Emotional stability is
the most difficult trait to model, while agreeableness

of them significantly outperforms the baseline.
and conscientiousness produce the best results, with
ranking errors of 0.31 and 0.33 respectively. Table 3
shows that LIWC features perform significantly bet-
ter than the baseline for all dimensions but emo-
tional stability, while emotional stability is best pre-
dicted by MRC features. Interestingly, prosodic fea-
tures are very good predictors of extraversion, with
a lower ranking error than the full feature set (0.26),
while utterance type features on their own never out-
perform the baseline.
The RankBoost rules indicate the impact of each
feature on the recognition of a personality trait by
the magnitude of the parameter ? associated with
that feature. Table 4 shows the rules with the most
impact on each best model, with the associated ?
values. The feature labels are in Table 2. For ex-
ample, the model of extraversion confirms previous
findings by associating this trait with a high speech
rate (Rules 1 and 4) and longer conversations (Rule
5). But many new markers emerge: extraverts speak
with a high pitch (Rules 2, 6 and 7), while introverts?
pitch varies a lot (Rules 15, 18 and 20). Agreeable
people use longer words but shorter sentences (Rule
1 and 20), while swear words reduce the agreeable-
ness score (Rules 12, 18 and 19). As expected, con-
scientious people talk a lot about their job (Rule 1),
while unconscientious people swear a lot and speak
loudly (Rules 19 and 20). Our models contain many
additional personality cues which aren?t identified
through a typical correlational analysis.
4 Conclusion
We showed that personality can be recognized auto-
matically in conversation. To our knowledge, this is
the first report of experiments testing trained mod-
els on unseen subjects. There are models for each
dimension that perform significantly better than the
baseline. Combinations of these models may be use-
ful to identify important personality types in dif-
ferent NLP applications, e.g. a combination of
extraversion, emotional stability and intellect indi-
cates leadership, while low intellect, extraversion
and agreeableness are correlated with perceptions of
trustworthiness.
One limitation for applications involving speech
recognition is that recognition errors will introduce
noise in all features except prosodic features, and
prosodic features on their own are only effective in
the extraversion model. However, our data set is rel-
atively small (96 subjects) so we expect that more

might also make additional features useful. In fu-
ture work, we plan to integrate these models in a di-
alogue system to adapt the system?s language gener-
ation; we will then be able to test whether the accu-
racies we achieve are sufficient and explore methods
for improving them.
