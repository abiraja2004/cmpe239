Abstract 
We describe our analysis and modeling 
of the summarization process of Japa-
nese broadcast news. We have studied 
the entire manual summarization proc-
ess of the Japan Broadcasting Corpora-
tion (NHK). The staff of NHK has been 
making manual summarizations of 
news text on a daily basis since De-
cember 2000. We interviewed these 
professional abstractors and obtained a 
considerable amount of news summa-
ries. We matched the summary with the 
original text, investigated the news text 
structure, and thereby analyzed the 
manual summarization process. We 
then developed a summarization model 
on which we intend to build a summa-
rization system. 
1  Introduction 
Automatic text summarization research has a 
long history that dates back to the late 50?s 
(Mani and Maybury, 1999). It started mainly 
with the purpose of information gathering or 
assimilation, and most of the research has dealt 
with extracting the important parts of the texts. 
The summaries obtained with these techniques, 
so called extracts, have been used for judging 
the importance of the texts. 
We have started research on automatic sum-
marization for the purpose of information 
dissemination, namely summarization of news 
texts for broadcast news. Recently, we have 
studied the entire manual summarization process 
of the Japan Broadcasting Corporation (NHK). 
NHK has been making manual summariza-
tions of news text on a daily basis since Decem-
ber 2000, when it started satellite digital 
broadcasting. The summarized text has been 
used for the data service of the digital broadcast-
ing and on Web pages accessible by mobile 
phones.  
We interviewed NHK?s professional abstrac-
tors and analyzed a considerable amount of 
news summaries. We matched these summaries 
with the original news and studied the summari-
zation process based on the results of our analy-
sis and interviews.  
In this paper, we report on what we found 
during the interviews with the abstractors and 
the results of the automatic text alignment be-
tween summaries and the original news together 
with the word position matching. We also pro-
pose a summarization model for an automatic or 
semi-automatic summarization system. 
2 The manual summarization process 
Most of the radio and TV news services of 
NHK are based on a ?general news manuscript.? 
We call such manuscripts the original news in 
this paper. The original news is manually sum-
marized into summary news that are made avail-
able to the public through Web pages and digital 
broadcasting, as mentioned in section 1.  
We asked professional abstractors about the 
summarization environment and process and in 
so doing discovered the following. 
? Abstractor 
The original news is written by NHK report-
ers, and the text is summarized by different 
writers, i.e., professional abstractors. Most pro-
fessional abstractors are retired reporters who 
have expertise in writing news. 
? Compression rate and time allowance 
The original news is compressed to a maxi-
mum length of 105 Japanese characters. We will 
49
show in section 4 that the average compression 
rate is about 22.5%. The upper bound is decided 
from the display design of the data service of 
digital TV broadcasting. The abstractors must 
work quickly because the summary news must 
be broadcast promptly. 
? Techniques 
The abstractors use only information con-
tained in the original news. They scan the origi-
nal news quickly and repeatedly, not to 
understand the full content, but to select the 
parts to be used in the summary news. The ab-
stractors? special reading tendency has been re-
ported in (Mani, 2001), and we can say the same 
tendency was observed in our Japanese abstrac-
tors. The abstractors focus on the lead (the open-
ing part) of the original news. They sometimes 
use the end part of the original news. 
3    Corpus construction 
We planned the summary news corpus as a 
resource to investigate the manual summariza-
tion process and to look into the possibility of an 
automatic summarization system for broadcast 
news. We obtained 18,777 pieces of summary 
news from NHK. Although each piece is a 
summary of a particular original news text, the 
link between the summary and the original news 
is not available.  
We matched the summary and original news 
and constructed a corpus. There have been sev-
eral attempts to construct <summary text, origi-
nal text> corpora (Marcu, 1999; Jing and 
McKeown, 1999). We decided to use the 
method proposed by Jing and McKeown (1999) 
for the reasons given below. 
As our abstractors mentioned that they used 
only information available in the original news, 
we hypothesize that the summary and the origi-
nal news share many surface words. This indi-
cates that the surface-word-based matching 
methods such as (Marcu, 1999; Jing and McKe-
own, 1999) will be effective. 
In particular, the word position matching re-
alized in (Jing and McKeown, 1999) seems es-
pecially useful. We thought that we might be 
able to observe the summarization process pre-
cisely by tracing the word position links, and we 
employed their work with a little modification.  
As a result, our corpus takes the form of the 
triple: <summary, original, word position corre-
spondence>. 
3.1 Matching algorithm 
Jing and McKeown (1999) treated a word 
matching problem between a summary and its 
text, which they called the summary decomposi-
tion problem. They employed a statistical model 
(briefly described below) and obtained good 
results when they tested their method with the 
Ziff-Davis corpus. In the following explanation, 
we use the notion of summary and text instead 
of summary news and original news for simplic-
ity. 
(1) The word position in a summary is repre-
sented by <I>. 
(2) The word position in the text is repre-
sented by a pair of the sentence position (S) 
and the word position in a sentence (W) as in 
<S, W>. 
(3) Each summary word is checked as to 
whether it appears in the text. If it appears, 
all of the positions in the text are stored in 
the form of <S,W> to form a position trellis. 
(4) Scan the n summary words from left to 
right and find the path on the trellis that 
maximizes the score of formula (1).

This formula is the repeated product of the 
probability that the two adjacent words in a 
summary (Ii and Ii+1) appear at positions (S1, W1) 
and (S2, W2) in the text, respectively. This quan-
tity represents the goodness of the summary and 
the text word matching. As a result, the path on 
the trellis with the maximum probability gives 
the overall most likely word position match. 
Jing and McKeown (1999) assigned six-
grade heuristic values to the probability. The 
highest probability of 1.0 was given when two 
adjacent words in a summary appear at adjacent 
positions in the same sentence of the text. The 
lowest probability of 0.5 was given when two 
adjacent words in a summary appear in different 
sentences in the text with a certain distance or 
greater. We fixed the distance at two sentences, 
considering the average sentence count of the 
original news texts.

Summary news text
Figure 1. Summary and original news text matching.  
Jing and McKeown?s algorithm (1999) is de-
signed to treat a fixed summary and text pair and 
needs some modification to be applied to our 
two-fold problem of finding the original news of 
a given summary news from a large collection 
of news together with the word position match-
ing. 
Their method has a special treatment for a 
summary word that does not appear in the text. 
It assumes that such a word does not exist in the 
summary and therefore skips the trellis at this 
word with a probability of 1. This unfavorably 
biases news text that contains fewer matching 
words. To alleviate this problem, we experimen-
tally found that the probability score of 0.55 
works well for such a case (This score was the 
second smallest of the original six-grade score). 
We developed a word match browser to pre-
cisely check the words of the summary and 
original news. 
3.2 Summary and original news matching 
We matched 18,777 summary news texts 
from November 2003 to June 2004 against the 
news database, which mostly covers the original 
news of the period. We followed the procedures 
below. 
? Numerical expression normalization 
Numerical expressions in the original news 
are written in Chinese numerals (Kanji) and 
those of the summary news are written in 
Arabic numerals. We normalized the Chinese 
numerals into Arabic numerals. 
? Morphological analysis 
The summary and original news were mor-
phologically analyzed. We used morphemes 
as a matching unit. In this paper, we will use 
morphemes and words interchangeably. 
? Search span 
Each summary news was matched against the 
news written in the three-day period before 
the summary was written. This period was 
chosen experimentally. 
4  Results and observation 
We randomly checked the news matching re-
sults and found more than 90% were correct. 
Some of the summaries were exceptionally long, 
and we consider that such noisy data was the 
main reason for incorrect matching. Figure 1 
shows a matching example. The underlined (line 
and broken line) sentences show the word posi-
tion match.  
The word matching is not easy to evaluate 
because we do not have the correct matching 
answer. Although there are some problems in 
the matching, most of the results seem to be 
good enough for approximate analysis. The fol-
lowing discussion assumes that the word match-
ing is correct. 
4.1 Compression rate 
Table 1 shows the basic statistics of the 
summary and its corresponding original news. 
51
We can see that the average compression rate is 
22.5% in terms of characters. The average sum-
mary news length (109.9 characters per news 
text) was longer than what we were told (105, 
see section 2). 
We then checked the length of the typical 
summary texts. We found that the cumulative 
relative frequency of the summary text with the 
sentence count from 1 to 4 was 0.99 and was 
quite dominant. We checked the average length 
of these summaries and obtained 105.4, which is 
close to what we were told. We guess that noisy 
?long summaries? skewed the figure.

4.2 Word match ratio 
We measured how many of the summary 
words came from original news. As our match-
ing result contains word-to-word correspon-
dence, we calculated the ratio of the matched 
words in a summary text. Table 2 shows a part 
of the result. It shows the relative frequency of 
the summary news in which 100% of the words 
came from the original news reached 0.265 and 
those that had more than 90% reached 0.970.

This strongly suggests that most of the sum-
mary news is the ?extract? (Mani, 2001), which 
is written using only vocabulary appearing in the 
original news. This result is in accord with what 
the abstractors told us. 
4.3 Summary word employment in the 
original news sentences 
The previous section indicated that our sum-
mary likely belongs to the extract type. Where in 
the original news do these words come from? 
We next measured the word employment ratio 
of each sentence in the original news and the 
result is presented in Figure 2. 
In this graph, the original news is categorized 
into five cases according to its sentence count 
from 4 to 81 and the average word employment 
ratio is shown for each sentence.  
Of this figure, the following observations can 
be made: 
?  Bias toward the first sentence 
In all five cases, the first sentence recorded 
the highest word employment ratio. The per-
centages of the second and third sentences in-
crease when the news contains many sentences. 
The opening part of the news text is called the 
lead. We will discuss its role in the next section. 
? No clear favorite for the final sentence 
There was no employment ratio rise for the 
closing sentences in any case even though our 
abstractors indicated they often use information 
in the last sentence. This inconsistency may be 
due to the word match error. Final sentences 
actually have an important role in news, as we 
will see in the next section. 
5  Summarization model 
In the previous section, we found a quite 
high word overlap between a summary and the 
opening part of the original news text. We 
checked with our word match browser the simi-
larity of the summary news and lead sentences, 
and found that most of the summary sentences 
                                                          
1 These news texts cover the 88 % of the total news texts.  
52
take exactly the same syntactic pattern of the 
opening sentence. Based on this observation and 
what we found in the interviews, we devised a 
news text summarization model. The model can 
explain our abstractors? behavior, and we are 
planning to develop an automatic or semi-
automatic summarization system with it. We 
will explain the typical news text structure and 
present our model. 
5.1 News text structure 
Most of our news texts are written with a 
three-part structure, i.e., lead, body and supple-
ment. Figure 1 shows the two-fold structure of 
the lead and the body. Each part has the follow-
ing characteristics.   
? Lead 
The most important information is briefly de-
scribed in the opening part of a news text. This 
part is called the lead. Proper nouns are often 
avoided in favor of more abstract expressions 
such as ?a young man? or ?a big insurance com-
pany.? The lead is usually written in one or two 
sentences. 
? Body 
The lead is detailed in the body. The 5W1H 
information is mainly elaborated, and the proper 
names that were vaguely mentioned in the lead 
appear here. The statements of people involved 
in the news sometimes appear here. The repeti-
tive structure of the lead and the body is rooted 
in the nature of radio news; listeners cannot go 
back to the previous part if they missed the in-
formation. 
? Supplement 
Necessary information that has not been cov-
ered in the lead and the body is placed here. 
Take for an example of weather news about a 
typhoon. A caution from the Meteorological 
agency is sometimes added after the typhoon?s 
movement has been described.  
5.2 Model 
We found that most of the summary news is 
written based on the lead sentences. They are 
then shortened or partly modified with the ex-
pressions in the body to make them more infor-
mative and self-contained.  
The essential operation, we consider, lies in 
the editing of the lead sentences under the sum-
mary length constraint. Based on the observation, 
we have proposed a two-step summarization 
model of reading and editing. The summary in 
Figure 1 is constructed with the lead sentence 
with the insertion of a phrase in the body. 
? Reading phase 
(1) Identify the lead, the body and the sup-
plement sentences in the original news. 
(2) Analysis 
Find the correspondences between the parts 
in the lead and those in the body. We can re-
gard this process as a co-reference resolution.  
?  Summary editing phase 
(3) Set the lead sentence as the base sentence 
of the summary. 
(4) Apply the following operations until the 
base sentence length is close enough to the 
predefined length N. 
(4-1) Delete parts in the base sentence. 
(4-2) Substitute parts in the base sentence 
with the corresponding parts in the body with 
the results of (2). 
(4-2?) Add a body part to the base sentence. 
We may view this as a null part substituted 
by a body part. 
(4-3) Add supplement sentences. 
The supplement is often included in a sum-
mary; this part contains different information 
from the other parts.  
5.3 Related works and discussion 
Our two-step model essentially belongs to 
the same category as the works of (Mani et al, 
1999) and (Jing and McKeown, 2000). Mani et 
al. (1999) proposed a summarization system 
based on the ?draft and revision.? Jing and 
McKeown (2000) proposed a system based on 
?extraction and cut-and-paste generation.? Our 
abstractors performed the same cut-and-paste 
operations that Jing and McKeown noted in their 
work, and we think that our two-step model will 
be a reasonable starting point for our subsequent 
research. Below are some of our observations. 
53
The lead sentences play a central role in our 
model since they serve as the base of the final 
summary. Their identification can be achieved 
with the same techniques as used for the impor-
tant sentence extraction. In our case, the sen-
tence position information plays an important 
role as was shown by Kato and Uratani (2000). 
We consider the identification of the body and 
the supplement part together with the lead will 
be beneficial for the co-reference resolution. 
The co-reference resolution problem between 
the lead and the body should be treated in a 
more general way than usual. We found that our 
problem ranges from the word level, the corre-
spondence between named entities and their ab-
stract paraphrases, to the sentence level, an 
entire statement of a person and its short para-
phrase. We are now investigating the types of 
co-reference that we have to cover. 
We found that the deletion of lead parts did 
not occur very often in our summary, unlike the 
case of Jing and McKeown (2000). One reason 
is that most of our leads were short enough2 to 
be included in the summary and therefore the 
substitution operation became conspicuous. This 
usually increased the length of summary but 
contributed to making it more lively and infor-
mative. 
A supplement part was often included in the 
summary. We consider that this feature corre-
sponds to the abstractors? comments on em-
ployment of the final sentence, which was not 
clearly detected in our statistical investigation 
described in section 4.3. We are now investigat-
ing the conditions for including the supplement. 
We have so far listed the basic operations of 
editing through the manual checking of samples, 
and we are currently analyzing the operations 
with more examples. We will then study auto-
matic selection of the optimum operation se-
quence to achieve the most informative and 
natural summary. 
6  Conclusions 
We have described the manual summary 
process of NHK?s broadcast news and experi-
ments on automatic text alignment between 
news summaries and the original news together 
                                                          
2 The present summary length constraint is 105 characters. 
Meanwhile, the average length of the first sentence (typi-
cally the lead) of a  news text is 94.5 as is shown in table 1.  
with the word position matching. Through a sta-
tistical analysis of the results and interviews 
with abstractors, we found that the abstractors 
summarize news by taking advantage of its 
structure. Based on this observation, we pro-
posed a summarization model that consists of a 
reading and editing phase. We are now design-
ing an automatic or semi automatic summariza-
tion system employing the model.
