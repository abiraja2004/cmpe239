Abstract
This paper presents G-FLOW, a novel system
for coherent extractive multi-document sum-
marization (MDS).1 Where previous work on
MDS considered sentence selection and or-
dering separately, G-FLOW introduces a joint
model for selection and ordering that balances
coherence and salience. G-FLOW?s core rep-
resentation is a graph that approximates the
discourse relations across sentences based on
indicators including discourse cues, deverbal
nouns, co-reference, and more. This graph en-
ables G-FLOW to estimate the coherence of a
candidate summary.
We evaluate G-FLOW on Mechanical Turk,
and find that it generates dramatically bet-
ter summaries than an extractive summarizer
based on a pipeline of state-of-the-art sentence
selection and reordering components, under-
scoring the value of our joint model.
1 Introduction
The goal of multi-document summarization (MDS)
is to produce high quality summaries of collections
of related documents. Most previous work in ex-
tractive MDS has studied the problems of sentence
selection (e.g., (Radev, 2004; Haghighi and Vander-
wende, 2009)) and sentence ordering (e.g., (Lapata,
2003; Barzilay and Lapata, 2008)) separately, but
we believe that a joint model is necessary to produce
coherent summaries. The intuition is simple: if the
sentences in a summary are first selected?without
regard to coherence?then a satisfactory ordering of
the selected sentences may not exist.

bombing and its aftermath, indicating the source docu-
ment for each node. A coherent summary should begin
with the bombing and then describe the reactions. Sen-
tences are abbreviated for compactness.
An extractive summary is a subset of the sen-
tences in the input documents, ordered in some
way.2 Of course, most possible summaries are in-
coherent. Now, consider a directed graph where the
nodes are sentences in the collection, and each edge
represents a pairwise ordering constraint necessary
for a coherent summary (see Figure 1 for a sample
graph). By definition, any coherent summary must
obey the constraints in this graph.
Previous work has constructed similar graphs au-
tomatically for single document summarization and
manually for MDS (see Section 2). Our system,
G-FLOW extends this research in two important
ways. First, it tackles automatic graph construction
for MDS, which requires novel methods for identi-
fying inter-document edges (Section 3). It uses this

graph to estimate coherence of a candidate summary.
Second, G-FLOW introduces a novel methodology
for joint sentence selection and ordering (Section 4).
It casts MDS as a constraint optimization problem
where salience and coherence are soft constraints,
and redundancy and summary length are hard con-
straints. Because this optimization problem is NP-
hard, G-FLOW uses local search to approximate it.
We report on a Mechanical Turk evaluation that
directly compares G-FLOW to state-of-the-art MDS
systems. Using DUC?04 as our test set, we com-
pare G-FLOW against a combination of an extractive
summarization system with state-of-the-art ROUGE
scores (Lin and Bilmes, 2011) followed by a state-
of-the-art sentence reordering scheme (Li et al,
2011a). We also compare G-FLOW to a combina-
tion of an extractive system with state-of-the-art co-
herence scores (Nobata and Sekine, 2004) followed
by the reordering system. In both cases participants
substantially preferred G-FLOW. Participants chose
G-FLOW 54% of the time when compared to Lin,
and chose Lin?s system 22% of the time. When com-
pared to Nobata, participants chose G-FLOW 60%
of the time, and chose Nobata only 20% of the time.
The remainder of the cases were judged equivalent.
A further analysis shows that G-FLOW?s sum-
maries are judged superior along several dimensions
suggested in the DUC?04 evaluation (including co-
herence, repetitive text, and referents). A compar-
ison against manually written, gold standard sum-
maries, reveals that while the gold standard sum-
maries are preferred in direct comparisons, G-FLOW
has nearly equivalent scores on almost all dimen-
sions suggested in the DUC?04 evaluation.
The paper makes the following contributions:
? We present G-FLOW, a novel MDS system that
jointly solves the sentence selection and order-
ing problems to produce coherent summaries.
? G-FLOW automatically constructs a domain-
independent graph of ordering constraints over
sentences in a document collection, based on
syntactic cues and redundancy across docu-
ments. This graph is the backbone for estimat-
ing the coherence of a summary.
? We perform human evaluation on blind test
sets and find that G-FLOW dramatically outper-
forms state-of-the-art MDS systems.
2 Related Work
Most existing research in multi-document summa-
rization (MDS) focuses on sentence selection for in-
creasing coverage and does not consider coherence
of the summary (Section 2.1). Although coherence
has been used in ordering of summary sentences
(Section 2.2), this work is limited by the quality of
summary sentences given as input. In contrast, G-
FLOW incorporates coherence in both selection and
ordering of summary sentences.
G-FLOW can be seen as an instance of discourse-
driven summarization (Section 2.3). There is prior
work in this area, but primarily for summarization of
single documents. There is some preliminary work
on the use of manually-created discourse models in
MDS. Our approach is fully automated.
2.1 Subset Selection in MDS
Most extractive summarization research aims to in-
crease the coverage of concepts and entities while
reducing redundancy. Approaches include the use of
maximum marginal relevance (Carbonell and Gold-
stein, 1998), centroid-based summarization (Sag-
gion and Gaizauskas, 2004; Radev et al, 2004), cov-
1164
ering weighted scores of concepts (Takamura and
Okumura, 2009; Qazvinian et al, 2010), formula-
tion as minimum dominating set problem (Shen and
Li, 2010), and use of submodularity in sentence se-
lection (Lin and Bilmes, 2011). Graph centrality has
also been used to estimate the salience of a sentence
(Erkan and Radev, 2004). Approaches to content
analysis include generative topic models (Haghighi
and Vanderwende, 2009; Celikyilmaz and Hakkani-
Tur, 2010; Li et al, 2011b), and discriminative mod-
els (Aker et al, 2010).
These approaches do not consider coherence as
one of the desiderata in sentence selection. More-
over, they do not attempt to organize the selected
sentences into an intelligible summary. They are
often evaluted by ROUGE (Lin, 2004), which is
coherence-insensitive. In practice, these approaches
often result in incoherent summaries.
2.2 Sentence Reordering
A parallel thread of research has investigated taking
a set of summary sentences as input and reordering
them to make the summary fluent. Various algo-
rithms use some combination of topic-relatedness,
chronology, precedence, succession, and entity co-
herence for reordering sentences (Barzilay et al,
2001; Okazaki et al, 2004; Barzilay and Lapata,
2008; Bollegala et al, 2010). Recent work has also
used event-based models (Zhang et al, 2010) and
context analysis (Li et al, 2011a).
The hypothesis in this research is that a pipelined
combination of subset selection and reordering will
produce high-quality summaries. Unfortunately,
this is not true in practice, because sentences are se-
lected primarily for coverage without regard to co-
herence. This methodology often leads to an inad-
vertent selection of a set of disconnected sentences,
which cannot be put together in a coherent sum-
mary, irrespective of how the succeeding algorithm
reorders them. In our evaluation, reordering had lim-
ited impact on the quality of the summaries.
2.3 Coherence Models and Summarization
Research on discourse analysis of documents pro-
vides a basis for modeling coherence in a docu-
ment. Several theories have been developed for
modeling discourse, e.g., Centering Theory, Rhetor-
ical Structure Theory (RST), Penn Discourse Tree-
Bank (Grosz and Sidner, 1986; Mann and Thomp-
son, 1988; Wolf and Gibson, 2005; Prasad et al,
2008). Numerous discourse-guided summariza-
tion algorithms have been developed (Marcu, 1997;
Mani, 2001; Taboada and Mann, 2006; Barzilay and
Elhadad, 1997; Louis et al, 2010). However, these
approaches have been applied to single document
summarization and not to MDS.
Discourse models have seen some application to
summary generation in MDS, for example, using a
detailed semantic representation of the source texts
(McKeown and Radev, 1995; Radev and McKe-
own, 1998). A multi-document extension of RST
is Cross-document Structure Theory (CST), which
has been applied to MDS (Zhang et al, 2002; Jorge
and Pardo, 2010). However, these systems require
a stronger input, such as a manual CST-annotation
of the set of documents. Our work can be seen as
an instance of summarization based on lightweight
CST. However, a key difference is that our proposed
algorithm is completely automated and does not re-
quire any additional human annotation. Addition-
ally, while incorporating coherence into selection,
this work does not attempt to order the sentences
coherently, while our approach performs joint selec-
tion and ordering.
Discourse models have also been used for evalu-
ating summary quality (Barzilay and Lapata, 2008;
Louis and Nenkova, 2009; Pitler et al, 2010). Fi-
nally, there is work on generating coherent sum-
maries in specific domains, such as scientific articles
(Saggion and Lapalme, 2002; Abu-Jbara and Radev,
2011) using domain-specific cues like citations. In
contrast, our work generates summaries without any
domain-specific knowledge. Other research has fo-
cused on identifying coherent threads of documents
rather than sentences (Shahaf and Guestrin, 2010).
3 Discourse Graph
As described in Section 1, our goal is to identify
pairwise ordering constraints over a set of input sen-
tences. These constraints specify a multi-document
discourse graph, which is used by G-FLOW to eval-
uate the coherence of a candidate summary.
In this graph G, each vertex is a sentence and an
edge from si to sj indicates that sj can be placed
right after si in a coherent summary. In other words,
the two share a discourse relationship. In the fol-
1165
lowing three sentences (from possibly different doc-
uments) there should be an edge from s1 to s2, but
not between s3 and the other sentences:
s1 Militants attacked a market in Jerusalem.
s2 Arafat condemned the bombing.
s3 The Wye River Accord was signed in Oct.
Discourse theories have proposed a variety of re-
lationships between sentences such as background
and interpretation. RST has 17 such relations (Mann
and Thompson, 1988) and PDTB has 16 (Prasad et
al., 2008). While we seek to identify pairs of sen-
tences that have a relationship, we do not attempt to
label the edges with the exact relation.
We use textual cues from the discourse literature
in combination with the redundancy inherent in re-
lated documents to generate edges. Because this
methodology is noisy, the graph used by G-FLOW is
an approximation, which we refer to as an approx-
imate discourse graph (ADG). We first describe the
construction of this graph, and then discuss the use
of the graph for summary generation (Section 4).
3.1 Deverbal Noun Reference
Often, the main description of an event is mentioned
in a verbal phrase and subsequent references use
deverbal nouns (nominalization of verbs) (e.g., ?at-
tacked? and ?the attack?). In this example, the noun
is derivationally related to the verb, but that is not al-
ways the case. For example, ?bombing? in s2 above
refers to ?attacked? in s1.
We identify verb-noun pairs with this relationship
as follows. First, we locate a set of candidate pairs
from WordNet: for each verb v, we determine po-
tential noun references n using a path length of up to
two in WordNet (moving from verb to noun is pos-
sible via WordNet?s ?derivationally related? links).
This set captures verb-noun pairs such as (?to at-
tack?, ?bombing?), but also includes generic pairs
such as (?to act?, ?attack?). To filter such errors
we score the candidate references. Our goal is to
emphasize common pairs and to deemphasize pairs
with common verbs or verbs that map to many
nouns. To this end, we score pairs by (c/p) ? (c/q),
where c is the number of times the pair (v, n) ap-
pears in adjacent sentences, p is the number of times
the verb appears, and q is the number of times that
v appears with a different noun. We generate these
statistics over a background corpus of 60,000 arti-
cles from the New York Times and Reuters, and
filter out candidate pairs scoring below a threshold
identified over a small training set.
We construct edges in the ADG between pairs of
sentences containing these verb to noun mappings.
To our knowledge, we are the first to use deverbal
nouns for summarization.
3.2 Event/Entity Continuation
Our second indicator is related to lexical chains
(Barzilay and Lapata, 2008). We add an edge in
the ADG from a sentence si to sj if they contain
the same event or entity and the timestamp of si is
less than or equal to the timestamp of sj (timestamps
generated with (Chang and Manning, 2012)).
3.3 Discourse Markers
We use 36 explicit discourse markers (e.g., ?but?,
?however?, ?moreover?) to identify edges between
two adjacent sentences of a document (Marcu and
Echihabi, 2002). This indicator lets us learn an edge
from s4 to s5 below:
s4 Arafat condemned the bombing.
s5 However, Netanyahu suspended peace talks.
3.4 Inferred Edges
We exploit the redundancy of information in MDS
documents to infer edges to related sentences. An
edge (s, s??) can be inferred if there is an existing
edge (s, s?) and s? and s?? express similar informa-
tion. As an example, the edge (s6, s7) can be in-
ferred based on edge (s4, s5):
s6 Arafat condemned the attack.
s7 Netanyahu has suspended the talks.
To infer edges we need an algorithm to identify
sentences expressing similar information. To iden-
tify these pairs, we extract Open Information Extrac-
tion (Banko et al, 2007) relational tuples for each
sentence, and we mark any pair of sentences with
an equivalent relational tuple as redundant (see Sec-
tion 4.3). The inferred edges allow us to propagate
within-document discourse information to sentences
from other documents.
3.5 Co-referent Mentions
A sentence sj will not be clearly understood in iso-
lation and may need another sentence si in its con-
text, if sj has a general reference (e.g., ?the presi-
1166
dent?) pointing to a specific entity or event in si (e.g.,
?President Bill Clinton?). We construct edges based
on coreference mentions, as predicted by Stanford?s
coreference system (Lee et al, 2011). We are able
to identify syntactic edge (s8, s9):
s8 Pres. Clinton expressed sympathy for Israel.
s9 He said the attack should not derail the deal.
3.6 Edge Weights
We weight each edge in the ADG by adding the
number of distinct indicators used to construct that
edge ? if sentences s and s? have an edge because
of a discourse marker and a deverbal reference, the
edge weight wG(s, s?) will be two. We also include
negative edges in the ADG. wG(s, s?) is negative if
s? contains a deverbal noun reference, a discourse
marker, or a co-reference mention that is not fulfilled
by s. For example, if s? contains a discourse marker,
and s is neither the sentence directly preceding s?
and there is no inferred discourse link between s and
s?, then we will add a negative edge wG(s, s?).
3.7 Preliminary Graph Evaluation
We evaluated the quality of the ADG used by G-
FLOW, which is important not only for its use in
MDS, but also because the ADG may be used for
other applications like topic tracking and decompos-
ing an event into sub-events. One author randomly
chose 750 edges and labeled an edge correct if the
pair of sentences did have a discourse relationship
between them and incorrect otherwise. 62% of the
edges accurately reflected a discourse relationship.
Our ADG has on average 31 edges per sentence for
a dataset in which each document cluster has on av-
erage 253 sentences. This evaluation includes only
the positive edges.
4 Summary Generation
We denote a candidate summary X to be a sequence
of sentences ?x1, x2, . . . , x|X|?. G-FLOW?s summa-
rization algorithm searches through the space of or-
dered summaries and scores each candidate sum-
mary along the dimensions of coherence (Section
4.1), salience (Section 4.2) and redundancy (Section
4.3). G-FLOW returns the summary that maximizes
a joint objective function (Section 4.4).

Table 2: Linear regression features for salience.
4.1 Coherence
G-FLOW estimates coherence of a candidate sum-
mary via the ADG. We define coherence as the sum
of edge weights between successive summary sen-
tences. For disconnected sentence pairs, the edge
weight is zero.
Coh(X) =
?
i=1..|X|?1
wG+(xi, xi+1) + ?wG?(xi, xi+1)
wG+ represents positive edges and wG? represents
negative edge weights. ? is a tradeoff coefficient for
positive and negative weights, which is tuned using
the methodology described in Section 4.4.
4.2 Salience
Salience is the inherent value of each sentence to
the documents. We compute salience of a summary
(Sal(X)) as the sum of the saliences of individual
sentences (
?
i Sal(xi)).
To estimate salience of a sentence, G-FLOW uses
a linear regression classifier trained on ROUGE
scores over the DUC?03 dataset. The classifier uses
surface features designed to identify sentences that
cover important concepts. The complete list of fea-
tures and learned weights is in Table 2. The clas-
sifier finds a sentence more salient if it mentions
nouns or verbs that are present in more sentences
across the documents. The highest ranked features
are the last three ? number of other sentences that
mention a noun or a verb in the given sentence. We
use the same procedure as in deverbal nouns for de-
tecting verb mentions that appear as nouns in other
sentences (Section 3.1).
4.3 Redundancy
We also wish to avoid redundancy. G-FLOW first
processes each sentence with a state-of-the-art Open
Information extractor OLLIE (Mausam et al, 2012),
which converts a sentence into its component re-
lational tuples of the form (arg1, relational phrase,
1167
arg2).3 For example, it finds (Militants, bombed, a
marketplace) as a tuple from sentence s12.
Two sentences will express redundant information
if they both contain the same or synonymous com-
ponent fact(s). Unfortunately, detecting synonymy
even at relational tuple level is very hard. G-FLOW
approximates this synonymy by considering two re-
lational tuples synonymous if the relation phrases
contain verbs that are synonyms of each other, have
at least one synonymous argument, and are times-
tamped within a day of each other. Because the in-
put documents cover related events, these relatively
weak rules provide good performance. The same
algorithm is used for inferring edges for the ADG
(Section 3.4). This algorithm can detect that the fol-
lowing sentences express redundant information:
s12 Militants bombed a marketplace in Jerusalem.
s13 He alerted Arafat after assailants attacked the
busy streets of Mahane Yehuda.
4.4 Objective Function
The objective function needs to balance coherence,
salience and redundancy and also honor the given
budget, i.e., maximum summary lengthB. G-FLOW
treats redundancy and budget as hard constraints and
coherence and salience as soft. Coherence is neces-
sarily soft as the graph is approximate. While previ-
ous MDS systems specifically maximized coverage,
in preliminary experiments on a development set, we
found that adding a coverage term did not improve
G-FLOW?s performance. We optimize:
maximize: F (x) , Sal(X) + ?Coh(X)? ?|X|
s.t.
?
i=1..|X| len(xi) < B
?xi, xj ? X : redundant(xi, xj) = 0
Here len refers to the sentence length. We add |X|
term (the number of sentences in the summary) to
avoid picking many short sentences, which may in-
crease coherence and salience scores at the cost of
overall summary quality.
The parameters ?, ? and ? (see Section 4.1) are
tuned automatically using a grid search over a de-
velopment set as follows. We manually generate ex-
tractive summaries for each document cluster in our
development set (DUC?03) and choose the parame-
ter setting that minimizes |F (XG-FLOW) ? F (X?)|
3Available from http://ollie.cs.washington.edu
summed over all document clusters. F is the objec-
tive function, XG-FLOW is the summary produced by
G-FLOW and X? is the manual summary.
This constraint optimization problem is NP hard,
which can be shown by using a reduction of the
longest path problem. For this reason, G-FLOW uses
local search to reach an approximation of the opti-
mum. G-FLOW employs stochastic hill climbing
with random restarts as the base search algorithm.
At each step, the search either adds a sentence, re-
moves a sentence, replaces a sentence by another, or
reorders a pair of sentences. The initial summary for
random restarts is constructed as follows. We first
pick the highest salience sentence with no incoming
negative edges as the first sentence. The following
sentences are probabilistically added one at a time
based on the summary score up to that sentence. The
initial summary is complete when there are no possi-
ble sentences left to fit within the budget. Intuitively,
this heuristic chooses a good starting point by se-
lecting a first sentence that does not rely on context
and subsequent sentences that build a high scoring
summary. As with all local search algorithms, this
algorithm is highly scalable and can easily apply to
large collections of related documents, but does not
guarantee global optima.
5 Experiments
Because summaries are intended for human con-
sumption we focused on human evaluations. We
hired workers on Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT)
to evaluate the summaries. Our evaluation addresses
the following questions: (1) how do G-FLOW sum-
maries compare against the state-of-the-art in MDS
(Section 5.2)? (2) what is G-FLOW?s performance
along important summarization dimensions such as
coherence and redundancy (Section 5.3)? (3) how
does G-FLOW perform on coverage as measured
by ROUGE (Section 5.3.1)? (4) how much do the
components of G-FLOW?s objective function con-
tribute to performance (Section 5.4)? (5) how do G-
FLOW?s summaries compare to human summaries?
5.1 Data and Systems
We evaluated the systems on the Task 2 DUC?04
multi-document summarization dataset. This dataset
consists of 50 clusters of related documents, each of
which contains 10 documents. Each cluster of doc-
1168
uments also includes four gold standard summaries
used for evaluation. As in the DUC?04 competition,
we allowed 665 bytes for each summary including
spaces and punctuation. We used DUC?03 as our
development set, which contains 30 document clus-
ters, again with approximately 10 documents each.
We compared G-FLOW against four systems. The
first is a recent MDS extractive summarizer, which
we choose for its state-of-the-art ROUGE scores
(Lin and Bilmes, 2011).4 The second is a pipeline
of Lin?s system followed by a reimplementation of
a state-of-the-art sentence reordering system (Li et
al., 2011a). We refer to these systems as LIN and
LIN-LI, respectively. This second baseline allows
us to quantify the advantage of using coherence as a
factor in both sentence extraction and ordering.
We also compare against the system that had the
highest coherence ratings at DUC?04 (Nobata and
Sekine, 2004), which we refer to as NOBATA. As
this system did not preform sentence ordering on its
output, we also compare against a pipeline of No-
bata?s system and the sentence reordering system.
We refer to this system as NOBATA-LI.
Lastly, to evaluate how well the system performs
against human generated summaries, we compare
against the gold standard summaries provided by
DUC.
5.2 Overall Summary Quality
Following (Haghighi and Vanderwende, 2009) and
(Celikyilmaz and Hakkani-Tur, 2010), to compare
overall summary quality, we asked AMT workers
to compare two candidate system summaries. The
workers first read a gold standard summary, fol-
lowed by the two system summaries, and were then
asked to choose the better summary from the pair.
The system summaries were shown in a random or-
der to remove any bias.
To ensure that workers provided high quality data
we added two quality checks. First, we restricted
to workers who have an overall approval rating of
over 95% on AMT. Second, we asked the workers
to briefly describe the main events of the summary.
We manually filtered out work where this descrip-
tion was incorrect.
4We thank Lin and Bilmes for providing us with their code.
Unfortunately, we were unable to obtain other recent MDS sys-
tems from their authors.
Six workers compared each pair of summaries.
We recorded the scores for each cluster, and report
three numbers: the percentages of clusters where a
system is more often preferred over the other and the
percentage where the two systems are tied. G-FLOW
is preferred almost three times as often as LIN:
G-FLOW Indifferent LIN
56% 24% 20%
Next, we compared G-FLOW and LIN-LI. Sen-
tence reordering improves performance, but G-
FLOW is still overwhelmingly preferred:
G-FLOW Indifferent LIN-LI
54% 24% 22%
These results suggest that incorporating coher-
ence in sentence extraction adds significant value to
a summarization system. In these experiments, LIN
and LIN-LI are preferred in some cases. We an-
alyzed those summaries more carefully, and found
that occasionally, G-FLOW will sacrifice a small
amount of coverage for coherence, resulting in lower
performance in those cases (see Section 5.3.1).
We also compared LIN and LIN-LI, and found
that reordering does not improve performance by
much.
LIN-LI Indifferent LIN
32% 38% 30%
While the scores presented above represent com-
parisons between G-FLOW and a summarization
system with state-of-the-art ROUGE scores, we
also compared against a summarization system with
state-of-the-art coherence scores ? the system with
the highest coherence scores from DUC?04, (No-
bata and Sekine, 2004). We found that G-FLOW was
again preferred:
G-FLOW Indifferent NOBATA
68% 10% 22%
Adding in sentence ordering again improved the
scores for the comparison system somewhat:
G-FLOW Indifferent NOBATA-LI
60% 20% 20%
While these scores show a significant improve-
ment over previous sytems, they do not convey how
well G-FLOW compares to the gold standard ? man-
ually generated summaries. As a final experiment,
we compared G-FLOW and a second, manually gen-
erated summary:
1169
G-FLOW Indifferent Gold
14% 18% 68%
While we were pleased that in 32% of the cases,
Turkers either preferred G-FLOW or were indiffer-
ent, there is clearly a lot of room for improvement
despite the gains reported over previous sytems.
5.3 Comparison along Summary Dimensions
A high quality summary needs to be good along sev-
eral dimensions. We asked AMT workers to rate
summaries using the quality questions enumerated
in DUC?04 evaluation scheme.5 These questions
concern: (1) coherence, (2) useless, confusing, or
repetitive text, (3) redundancy, (4) nouns, pronouns,
and personal names that are not well-specified (5)
entities rementioned in an overly explicit way, (6)
ungrammatical sentences, and (7) formatting errors.
We evaluated G-FLOW LIN-LI and NOBATA-LI
against the gold standard summaries, using the same
AMT scheme as in the previous section. To assess
automated performance with respect to the standards
set by human summaries, we also evaluated a (dif-
ferent) gold standard summary for each document
cluster, using the same Mechanical Turk scheme as
in the previous section. The 50 summaries produced
by each system were evaluated by four workers. The
results are shown in Figure 2.
G-FLOW was rated significantly better than LIN-
LI in all categories except ?Redundancy? and signif-
icant better than NOBATA-LI on ?Coherence? and
?Referents?. The ratings for ?Coherence?, ?Refer-
ents?, and ?OverlyExplicit? are not surprising given
G-FLOW?s focus on coherence. The results for
?UselessText? may also be due to G-FLOW?s focus
on coherence which ideally prevents it from getting
off topic. Lastly, G-FLOW may perform better on
?Grammatical? and ?Formatting? because it tends to
choose longer sentences than other systems, which
are less likely to be sentence segmentation errors.
There may also be some bleeding from one dimen-
sion to the other ? if a worker likes one summary she
may score it highly for many dimensions.
Finally, somewhat surprisingly, we find G-
FLOW?s performance to be nearly that of human
summaries. G-FLOW is rated statistically signifi-
cantly lower than the gold summaries on only ?Re-

dundancy?. Given the results from the previous sec-
tion, G-FLOW is likely performing worse on cate-
gories not conveyed in these scores, such as Cover-
age, which we examine next.
5.3.1 Coverage Evaluation using ROUGE
Most recent research has focused on the ROUGE
evaluation, and thus implicitly on coverage of in-
formation in a summary. To estimate the coverage
of G-FLOW, we compared the systems on ROUGE
(Lin, 2004). We calculated ROUGE-1 scores for
G-FLOW, LIN, and NOBATA.6 As sentence order-
ing does not matter for ROUGE, we do not include
LIN-LI or NOBATA-LI in this evaluation. Because
our algorithm does not explicitly maximize coverage
while LIN does, we expected G-FLOW to perform
slightly worse than LIN.
The ROUGE-1 scores for G-FLOW, LIN, NO-
BATA and other recent MDS systems are listed in Ta-
ble 3. We also include the ROUGE-1 scores for the
gold summaries (compared to the other gold sum-
maries). G-FLOW has slightly lower scores than
LIN and the gold standard summaries, but much
higher scores than NOBATA. G-FLOW only scores
significantly lower than LIN and the gold standard
summaries.
We can conclude that good summaries have both
the characteristics listed in the quality dimensions,
and good coverage. The gold standard summaries
outperform G-FLOW on both ROUGE scores and
the quality dimension scores, and therefore, out-
perform G-FLOW on overall comparison. How-
ever, G-FLOW is preferred to LIN-LI in addition to
NOBATA-LI indicating that its quality scores out-
weigh its ROUGE scores in that comparison. An
improvement to G-FLOW may focus on increasing

coverage while retaining strengths such as coher-
ence.
5.4 Ablation Experiments
In this ablation study, we evaluated the contribution
of the main components of G-FLOW ? coherence
and salience. The details of the experiments are the
same as in the experiment described in Section 5.2.
We first measured the importance of coherence in
summary generation. This system G-FLOW-SAL is
identical to the full system except that it does not
include the coherence term in the objective function
(see Section 4.4). The results show that coherence is
very important to G-FLOW?s performance:
G-FLOW Indifferent G-FLOW-SAL
54% 26% 20%
Similarly, we evaluated the contribution of
salience. This system G-FLOW-COH does not in-
clude the salience term in the objective function:
G-FLOW Indifferent G-FLOW-COH
60% 20% 20%
Without salience, the system produces readable,
but highly irrelevant summaries.
5.5 Agreement of Expert & AMT Workers
Because summary evaluation is a relatively complex
task, we compared AMT workers? annotations with
expert annotations from DUC?04. We randomly
selected ten summaries from each of the seven
DUC?04 annotators, and asked four Turk workers
to annotate them on the DUC?04 quality questions.
For each DUC?04 annotator, we selected all pairs
of summaries where one summary was judged more
than one point better than the other summary. We
compared whether the workers (voting as in Sec-
tion 5.2) likewise judged that summary better than
the second summary. We found that the annotations
agreed in 75% of cases. When we looked only at
pairs more than two points different, the agreement
was 80%. Thus, given the subjective nature of the
task, we feel reasonably confident that the AMT an-
notations are informative, and that the dramatic pref-
erence of G-FLOW over the baseline systems is due
to a substantial improvement in its summaries.
6 Conclusion
In this paper, we present G-FLOW, a multi-
document summarization system aimed at generat-
ing coherent summaries. While previous MDS sys-
tems have focused primarily on salience and cov-
erage but not coherence, G-FLOW generates an or-
dered summary by jointly optimizing coherence and
salience. G-FLOW estimates coherence by using
an approximate discourse graph, where each node
is a sentence from the input documents and each
edge represents a discourse relationship between
two sentences. Manual evaluations demonstrate that
G-FLOW generates substantially better summaries
than a pipeline of state-of-the-art sentence selec-
tion and reordering components. ROUGE scores,
which measure summary coverage, show that G-
FLOW sacrifices a small amount of coverage for
overall readability and coherence. Comparisons to
gold standard summaries show that G-FLOW must
improve in coverage to equal the quality of manu-
ally written summaries. We believe this research has
applications to other areas of summarization such as
update summarization and query based summariza-
tion, and we are interested in investigating these top-
ics in future work.
