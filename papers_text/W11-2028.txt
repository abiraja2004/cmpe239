Abstract
This paper addresses a first step toward a
spoken dialogue system that evokes user?s
spontaneous backchannels. We construct
an HMM-based dialogue-style text-to-speech
(TTS) system that generates human-like cues
that evoke users? backchannels. A spoken
dialogue system for information navigation
was implemented and the TTS was evaluated
in terms of evoked user backchannels. We
conducted user experiments and demonstrated
that the user backchannels evoked by our TTS
are more informative for the system in detect-
ing users? feelings than those by conventional
reading-style TTS.
1 Introduction
One of the most enduring problems in spoken di-
alogue systems research is realizing a natural dia-
logue in a human-human form. One direction re-
searchers have been utilizing spontaneous nonverbal
and paralinguistic information. For example,
This paper focuses on backchannels, one of the
most common forms of para-linguistic information
in human-human dialogue. In particular, we focus
on users? verbal feedback, such as ?uh-huh? (called
Aizuchi in Japanese), and non-verbal feedback in the
form of nods. Such backchannels are very com-
mon phenomena, and considered to be used to fa-
cilitate smooth human-human communications. In
this regard, Maynard (Maynard, 1986) indicated that
such backchannels are listener?s signals to let the
speaker continue speaking (continuer), to indicate
that the listener understands and consents. It was
also hypothesized that humans detect feelings ex-
pressed via backchannels, and the correlation be-
tween backchannel patterns and user interests was
examined (Kawahara et al, 2008). These studies in-
dicate that detection of spontaneous user backchan-
? currently with Japan Advanced Institute of Science and
Technology (JAIST)
nels can benefit spoken dialogue systems by provid-
ing informative cues that reflect the user?s situation.
For instance, if a spoken dialogue system can detect
user?s backchannels, it can facilitate smooth turn-
taking. The system can also detect user?s feelings
and judge if it should continue the current topic or
change it.
Despite these previous studies and decades of
analysis on backchannels, few practical dialogue
systems have made use of them. This is proba-
bly due to the fact that users do not react as spon-
taneously to dialogue systems as they do to other
humans. We presume one of the reasons for this
is the unnatural intonation of synthesized speech.
That is, conventional speech synthesizers do not pro-
vide users with signs to elicit backchannels; an ap-
propriate set of lexical, acoustic and prosodic cues
(or backchannel-inviting cues (A. Gravano and J.
Hirschberg, 2009)), which tends to precede the lis-
tener?s backchannels in human-human communica-
tion. Though recorded human speech can provide
such cues, it is costly to re-record system?s speech
every time system scripts are updated. In this work,
we therefore tackle the challenge of constructing
dialogue-style text-to-speech (TTS) system that in-
spires users to make spontaneous backchannels un-
der the hypothesis of:
People will give more spontaneous backchannels to
a spoken dialogue system that makes more spontaneous
backchannel-inviting cues than a spoken dialogue system
that makes less spontaneous ones.
which is derived from the Media Equation (Reeves
and Nass, 1996).
2 Related Works
A number of studies have aimed at improving
the naturalness of TTS. Though most of these
have focused on means of realizing a clear and
easy-to-listen-to reading-style speech, some at-
tempts have been made at spontaneous conversa-
tional speech. Andersson (Andersson et al, 2010)
and Marge (Marge et al, 2010) focused on lexi-
259
cal phenomena such as lexical filler and acknowl-
edgments in spontaneous speech, and showed that
inserting them improves the naturalness of human-
computer dialogues. In this work, we tackle con-
structing a natural dialogue-style TTS system focus-
ing on prosodic phenomena such as intonation and
phoneme duration.
In the field of conversation analysis, many studies
analyzed backchannels in human-human dialogue
focusing on lexical and non-verbal cues (Koiso et
al., 1998; Ward and Tsukahara, 2000; A. Gravano
and J. Hirschberg, 2009). For instance these cues
were examined in preceding utterances, such as in
part-of-speech tags, length of pause, power contour
pattern, and F
0
contour pattern around the end of
the Inter-Pausal Units (IPUs). (A. Gravano and J.
Hirschberg, 2009) showed that when several of the
above cues occur simultaneously, the likelihood of
occurrence of a backchannel will increase.
Several studies also utilized the above findings
for spoken dialogue systems. Okato (Okato et al,
1996) and Fujie (Fujie et al, 2005) trained models to
predict backchannels, and implemented spoken di-
alogue systems that make backchannels. Our goal
differs in that it is to inspire users to give backchan-
nels.
3 Construction of Spoken Dialogue TTS
3.1 Spoken Dialogue Data collection for TTS
In order to make spontaneous dialogue-style TTS
that can evoke backchannels, we construct a spon-
taneous dialogue-style speech corpus that contains
backchannel-inviting cues, and then train an HMM
acoustic model for synthesis.
We collected our training data by dubbing a script
of our Kyoto Sightseeing Guidance Spoken Dia-
logue Corpus (Misu et al, 2009), a set of itinerary-
planning dialogues in Japanese. In the dialogue
task, the expert guide has made recommendations on
sightseeing spots and restaurants until has decided
on a plan for the day. With the guide?s recommen-
dations, many users give spontaneous backchannels.
We made a set of dialogue scripts from the corpus,
and asked voice actors to act them out.
When preparing the dialogue script for dubbing,
we first removed fillers and backchannels from the
transcripts of the dialogue corpus. We then anno-
tated the guide?s end of the IPUs, where the the
user made backchannels, with #. A sample dialogue
script is shown in Figure 6. We asked two profes-
sional voice actresses to duplicate the spoken dia-
logue of the script, with playing the role of the tour
guide, and the other as the tourist, sitting face-to-
face. During the recording, we asked the tour guide
role to read the scenario with intonation so that the
tourist role would spontaneously make backchan-
nels at the points marked with #. The tourist was
allowed to make backchannels at will at any pause
segments the guide made. We recorded 12 dialogue
sessions in total. The speech data was manually la-
beled, and 239.3 minutes of tour guide utterances,
which are used to train our HMM for the TTS sys-
tem, were collected. The training data is comple-
mented by the ATR 503 phonetically balanced sen-
tence set (Abe et al, 1990), so as to cover deficien-
cies in the phoneme sequence. The sentence set is
collected from news articles, and data consists of
43.1 minutes of reading-style speech.
3.2 Analysis of Collected Speech Data
Before training the HMM, we analyzed the collected
spoken dialogue data to confirm if the recorded di-
alogue speech data contained backchannel-inviting
prosodic cues. We compared prosodic features of
the dialogue speech data with those of the reading-
style speech data (phonetically balanced sentences
that we collected). Following the findings of a pre-
vious study (Koiso et al, 1998), we investigated the
duration, F
0
contour pattern and power contour pat-
tern of the final phoneme of the IPUs1.
In conversation analysis of Japanese, the F
0
con-
tour pattern label of the final phoneme is often used.
While the contour pattern is usually manually la-
beled, we roughly determined the patterns based on
the following procedure. We first normalized the log
F
0
scale using all utterances so that it has zero mean
and one standard deviation (z-score: z = (x??)/?).
We then divided each final phoneme of the IPU into
former and latter parts, and calculated the F
0
slope
of each segment by linear regression. By combina-
tion of following three patterns, we defined nine F
0
contour patterns for the final phonemes of the IPUs.
The pattern of the segment was judged as rise if the
slope was larger than a threshold ?. If the slope was
less than the threshold??, the pattern was judged as
fall. Otherwise, it was judged as flat. Here, ? was
empirically set to 5.0. The power contour patterns
of the IPUs were estimated by a similar procedure.
We analyzed 3,311 IPUs that were not followed
1For this study, we define an IPU as a maximal sequence
of words surrounded by silence longer than 200 ms. This unit
usually coincides with one Japanese phrasal unit.

by a turn-switch in the dialogue-style speech data
and 645 non-sentence-end IPUs in the reading-
style speech data. The prosodic features of final
phonemes of these IPUs are listed in Table 1.
According to a study (Koiso et al, 1998), in which
prosodic features of IPUs followed by a turn-hold
with backchannel, without backchannel and turn-
switch were compared, a long duration in the final
phoneme is a speaker?s typical sign to keep floor.
The same study also reported that the flat-fall and
rise-fall pattern of F
0
and power are more likely
to be followed by a backchannel than a turn-hold
without a backchannel and turn-switch. In our col-
lected speech corpus, there were actually signifi-
cant (p < 0.01) differences in the duration of the
final phoneme between that in the dialogue-style
speech and in reading-style speech. There was
also significant (p < 0.01) difference in the oc-
currence probability of the above two prosodic pat-
terns between dialogue-style speech and reading-
style speech data. These figures indicate that
as a whole the collected dialogue-style data con-
tains more backchannel-inviting cues than collected
reading-style speech data.
We trained HMM for our TTS system Ximera
using the HMM-based Speech Synthesis System
(HTS) (Zen et al, 2007). We adopted mel log spec-
trum approximation (MLSA) filter-based vocod-
ing (SPTK, 2011), a quint-phone-based phoneme
set and five state HMM-based acoustic modeling.
All training data including reading-style speech data
were used for model training.
4 User Experiment
4.1 Dialogue System used for Experiment
To evaluate our TTS system based on users? reac-
tions, a sightseeing guidance spoken dialogue sys-
Figure 1: Screen shot of the dialogue system
tem that assist users in making decision was im-
plemented. The system can explain six sightseeing
spots in Kyoto. The system provides responses to
user requests for explanation about a certain spot.
Each descriptive text on a sightseeing spot consists
of 500 (?1%) characters, 30 phrases. The text is
synthesized using section 3 TTS2. We set the speech
rate of our TTS as nine phoneme per second.
A display is used to present photos of the tar-
get sightseeing spot and an animated 3D desktop
avatar named Hanna. Figure 1 shows the GUI
the user sees. The avatar can express its status
through several motions. For example, when the
user begins speaking, it can express the state of
listening using the listener?s motion, as shown in
the figure. A sample dialogue with the system is
shown in Table 7. A video (with English subtitles)
of an sample dialogue with a user can be seen at
http://mastarpj.nict.go.jp/?xtmisu/video/TTS.wmv.
To compare the effectiveness of our TTS in
evoking users? spontaneous backchannels, we con-
structed a comparison system that adopts a conven-
tional reading-style TTS system. An HMM model
was trained using 10-hour reading-style speech by
another professional female narrator. Other settings,
such as the descriptive text and avatar agent, were
the same as those of the base system.
4.2 Comparison of Prosodic Features of the
Synthesized Speech
Prior to the experiments, we investigated the
prosodic features of the final phoneme of IPUs in
the synthesized explanations on six spots to confirm
if they contain backchannel-inviting cues. The re-
sults are given in Table 2.
Tendencies in the duration of the final phoneme

speech by the dialogue-style TTS system were simi-
lar to that of recorded dialogue speech, suggests that
the constructed dialogue-style TTS system can du-
plicate the backchannel-inviting cues of the recorded
original speech. The synthesized dialogue-style
speech also contained much more rise-fall and flat-
fall patterns in F
0
and power than that generated by
the reading-style TTS system. The average dura-
tion of the final phoneme was also longer. Consider-
ing the fact that the speech data was generated from
the same script, this indicates that the synthesized
speech by the dialogue-style TTS system contains
more backchannel-inviting features than that by the
reading-style TTS system.
4.3 Experimental Setup
We evaluated the TTS systems using 30 subjects
who had not previously used spoken dialogue sys-
tems. Subjects were asked to use the dialogue sys-
tem in two settings; dialogue-style TTS system and
reading-style TTS system. The experiment was con-
ducted in a small (about 2 m2) soundproof room
with no one else present.
We instructed the subjects to speak with the avatar
agent Hanna (not with the system). We also told
them that the avatar agent was listening to their
speech at all times using the microphone, and was
observing their reactions using the camera above the
display3. Subjects were given the task of acquiring
information about three candidate sightseeing spots
in Kyoto shown on the display and then selecting
one that they liked. An example dialogue with the
system is shown in Table 7. A video (with English
subtitles) showing a real user dialogue can be seen
at http://mastarpj.nict.go.jp/?xtmisu/video/exp.avi.

After the subject selected from candidate spots,
we changed the TTS system settings and instructed
the user to have another dialogue session selecting
one of another three spots. Considering the effects of
the order, the subjects were divided into four groups;
the first group (Group 1) used the system in the order
of ?Spot list A with dialogue-style speech ? Spot
list B with reading-style speech,? the second group
(Group 2) worked in reverse order. Groups 3 and 4
used a system alternating the order of the spot sets.
5 Experimental Results
5.1 Questionnaire Results
After the experiments, subjects were asked to fill in
a questionnaire about the system. Table 3 shows the
questionnaire items. The subjects selected (a) both
are good, (b) dialogue-style speech was better, (c)
reading-style speech was better, or (d) neither were
good. Figure 2 shows the results.
The dialogue-style speech generally earned
higher ratings, but reading-style was slightly higher
in items #2 and #5. This tendency is likely at-
tributable to the fact that the dialogue-style speech
had worse clarity and naturalness than reading-style.
The mean opinion score (MOS), which is often used
to measure clarity and naturalness of TTS, of the
dialogue-style TTS was in fact 2.79, worse than 3.74
for the reading-style.
5.2 Analysis of Frequency of Backchannels
We analyzed the number of backchannels that users
made during the dialogue session. We manually
annotated subjects? verbal feedbacks, such as ?uh-
huh? and nodding of the head using the recorded
video. Out of 30 subjects, 26 gave some form of

Total backchannel (verbal feedback [Aizuchi], nodding)
backchannel to the system. Table 4 shows the per-
centages and average number of times subjects gave
backchannels. Many users made more backchannels
using the dialogue-style TTS system. Despite the
significant difference in questionnaire item #3, there
were no significant differences in the average num-
ber of users? backchannels.
5.3 Informativeness of Backchannels
We then evaluated the TTS in terms of the informa-
tiveness of evoked backchannels. The spontaneous
prosodic pattern of the backchannels is expected
to suggest positive/negative feelings on regarding
the recommended candidate. One promising use
of backchannels in our application is for detecting
users? feelings about the currently focused on spot,
and choosing to continue the explanation on the cur-
rent topic if the user seems interested, or otherwise
change the topic. We therefore label backchannels
made during the systems explanation of the spot
that the user finally selected as ?positive? and those
made during the explanations of the other two spots
as ?negative? and consider distinguishing between
them. In human-human dialogues, it was confirmed
that when a user responds promptly, the majority of
responses are positive, and more backchannels also
suggest positive responses (Kawahara et al, 2008).
We investigated the informativeness of the
backchannels based on their classification rate, or
whether the system can distinguish positive and neg-
ative backchannels, using 10-fold cross-validation.
That is, the backchannels evoked by the dialogue-
style TTS system were divided into 10 groups and
nine were used for training and the other for classi-
fication tests. We trained decision trees using J4.8
algorithm using timing, frequency, total frequency
throughout the session and type of backchannel (ver-
bal feedback or nod) as the feature set. The classifi-
cation error cost of the positive sample was set to (#
negative samples / # positive samples) considering
the difference in the number of positive and nega-
tive samples. Ten trials were conducted by chang-
ing the test set and the average classification rate
was calculated. The classification rate of backchan-
nels evoked by the system with dialogue-style TTS
was 71.4%, The confusion matrix of the classifi-
cation is shown below. We obtained precisions of
62.8% in the classification of the positive backchan-
nels, and 73.2% in that of the negative backchan-
nels. The rates are significantly higher than chance
rates of 33.5% and 66.5%. This result indicates
the backchannels evoked by the dialogue-style TTS
were informative for the system.
Table 5: Confusion matrix of classification
? classified as positive negative
? label
positive 76 141
negative 45 386
The classification rate of the reading-style TTS
system was calculated in the same way. The av-
erage classification rate of backchannels evoked by
reading-style TTS was a significantly lower 47.4%,
meaning they were not informative at all.
These results suggest that our dialogue-style TTS
system can evoke more spontaneous and informative
backchannels that reflects users? intentions than the
conventional reading-style one. This classification
rate is not completely satisfactory, but we expect that
users? feeling can be detected after observing several
backchannels. We also believe that we can estimate
users? interest more precisely by combining verbal
information of dialogue acts (Misu et al, 2010).
6 Conclusions
This paper presented our first steps toward a spoken
dialogue system that evokes users? spontaneous lis-
tener?s reactions. We constructed a dialogue-style
TTS and confirmed that by generating human-like
backchannel-inviting cues, the system can evoke
user?s spontaneous backchannels, which are infor-
mative for the system.
