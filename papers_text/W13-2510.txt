Abstract
This paper presents a comparable trans-
lation corpus created to investigate trans-
lation variation phenomena in terms of
contrasts between languages, text types
and translation methods (machine vs.
computer-aided vs. human). These phe-
nomena are reflected in linguistic fea-
tures of translated texts belonging to dif-
ferent registers and produced with differ-
ent translation methods. For their analysis,
we combine methods derived from trans-
lation studies, language variation and ma-
chine translation, concentrating especially
on textual and lexico-grammatical varia-
tion. To our knowledge, none of the ex-
isting corpora can provide comparable re-
sources for a comprehensive analysis of
variation across text types and translation
methods. Therefore, the corpus resources
created, as well as our analysis results will
find application in different research areas,
such as translation studies, machine trans-
lation, and others.
1 Introduction: Aims and Motivation
Comparable corpora serve as essential resources
for numerous studies and applications in both
linguistics (contrastive language, text analysis),
translation studies and natural language process-
ing (machine translation, computational lexicog-
raphy, information extraction). Many compara-
ble corpora are available and have been being cre-
ated for different language pairs like (a) English,
German and Italian (Baroni et al, 2009); (b) En-
glish, Norwegian, German and French (Johans-
son, 2002); (c) written or spoken English and Ger-
man (Hansen et al, 2012) or (Lapshinova et al,
2012).
However, comparable corpora may be of the
same language, as the feature of ?comparability?
may relate not only to corpora of different lan-
guages but also to those of the same language.
The main feature that makes them comparable is
that they cover the same text type(s) in the same
proportions, cf. for instance, (Laviosa, 1997) or
(McEnery, 2003), and thus, can be used for a cer-
tain comparison task.
As our research goal is the analysis of trans-
lation variation, we need a corpus which allows
us to compare translations, which differ in the
source/target language, the type of the text trans-
lated (genre or register) and the method of trans-
lation (human with/without CAT1 tools, machine
translation). There are a number of corpus-based
studies dedicated to the analysis of variation phe-
nomena, cf. (Teich, 2003; Steiner, 2004; Neu-
mann, 2011) among others. However, all of
them concentrate on the analysis of human trans-
lations only, comparing translated texts with non-
translated ones. In some works on machine trans-
lation, the focus does lie on comparing differ-
ent translation variants (human vs. machine),
e.g. (White, 1994; Papineni et al, 2002; Babych
and Hartley, 2004; Popovic?, 2011). However, they
all serve the task of automatic machine transla-
tion (MT) systems evaluation and use the human-
produced translations as references or training ma-
terial only. None of them provide analysis of
specifc (linguistic) features of different text types
translated with different translation methods.
The same tendencies are observed in the cor-
pus resources available, as they are mostly built
for certain research goals. Although there exists
a number of translation corpora, none of them
fits our research task: most of them include one
translation method only: EUROPARL (Koehn,
2005) and JRC-Acquis (Steinberger et al, 2006)
? translations produced by humans, or DARPA-
94 (White, 1994) ? machine-translated texts only.
1CAT = computer-aided translation
77
Moreover, they all contain one register only and,
therefore, cannot be applied to a comprehensive
analysis of variation phenomena.
Therefore, we decided to compile our own com-
parable corpus which contains translations from
different languages, of different text types, pro-
duced with different translation methods (human
vs. machine). Furthermore, both human and ma-
chine translations contain further varieties: they
are produced by different translators (both profes-
sional and student), with or without CAT tools or
by different MT systems.
This resource will be valuable not only for our
research goals, or for research purposes of further
translation researchers. It can also find further ap-
plications, e.g. in machine translation or CAT tool
development, as well as translation quality asses-
ment.
The remainder of the paper is structured as fol-
lows. Section 2 presents studies we adopt as the-
oretical background for the selection of features
and requirements for corpus resources. In section
4, we describe the compilation and design of the
comparable translation corpus at hand. In section
5, we demonstrate some examples of corpus ap-
plication, and in section 6, we draw some conclu-
sions and provide more ideas for corpus extension
and its further application.
2 Theoretical Background and Resource
Requirements
To design and annotate a corpus reflecting varia-
tion phenomena, we need to define (linguistic) fea-
tures of translations under analysis. As sources for
these features, we use studies on translation and
translationese, those on language variation, as well
as works on machine translation, for instance MT
evaluation and MT quality assessment.
2.1 Translation analysis and translationese
As already mentioned in section 1 above, trans-
lation studies either analyse differences between
original texts and translations, e.g. (House, 1997;
Matthiessen, 2001; Teich, 2003; Hansen, 2003;
Steiner, 2004), or concentrate on the properties of
translated texts only, e.g. (Baker, 1995). How-
ever, it is important that most of them consider
translations to have their own specific properties
which distinguish them from the originals (both of
the source and target language), and thus, estab-
lish specific language of translations ? the transla-
tionese.
Baker (1995) excludes the influence of the
source language on a translation altogether,
analysing characteristic patterns of translations in-
dependent of the source language. Within this
context, she proposed translation universals ? hy-
potheses on the universal features of translations:
explicitation (tendency to spell things out rather
than leave them implicit), simplification (tendency
to simplify the language used in translation), nor-
malisation (a tendency to exaggerate features of
the target language and to conform to its typi-
cal patterns) and levelling out (individual trans-
lated texts are alike), cf. (Baker, 1996). Addition-
ally, translations can also have features of ?shining
through? defined by Teich (2003) ? in this case we
observe some typical features of the source lan-
guage in the translation. The author analyses this
phenomena comparing different linguistic features
(e.g. passive and passive-like constructions) of
originals and translations in English and German.
In some recent applications of translationese
phenomena, e.g. those for cleaning parallel cor-
pora obtained from the Web, or for the im-
provement of translation and language models in
MT (Baroni and Bernardini, 2005; Kurokawa et
al., 2009; Koppel and Ordan, 2011; Lembersky
et al, 2012), authors succeeded to automatically
identify these features with machine learning tech-
niques.
We aim at employing the knowledge (features
described) from these studies, as well as tech-
niques applied to explore these features in the cor-
pus.
2.2 Language variation
Features of translated texts, as well as those of
their sources are influenced by the text types they
belong to, see (Neumann, 2011). Therefore, we
also refer to studies on language variation which
focus on the analysis of variation across registers
and genres, e.g. (Biber, 1995; Conrad and Biber,
2001; Halliday and Hasan, 1989; Matthiessen,
2006; Neumann, 2011) among others. Register
is described as functional variation, see Quirk et
al. (1985) and Biber et al (1999). For exam-
ple, language may vary according to the activ-
itiy of the involved participants, production va-
rieties (written vs. spoken) of a language or
the relationship between speaker and addressee(s).
These parameters correspond to the variables of
78
field, tenor and mode defined in the framework of
Systemic Functional Linguistics (SFL), which de-
scribes language variation according to situational
contexts, cf. e.g. Halliday and Hasan (1989), and
Halliday (2004).
In SFL, these variables are associated with the
corresponding lexico-grammatical features, e.g.
field of discourse is realised in functional verb
classes (e.g., activity, communication, etc) or term
patterns, tenor is realised in modality (expressed
e.g. by modal verbs) or stance expressions, mode
is realised in information structure and textual co-
hesion (e.g. personal and demonstrative refer-
ence). Thus, differences between registers or text
types can be identified through the analysis of oc-
currence of lexico-grammatical features in these
registers, see Biber?s studies on linguistic varia-
tion, e.g. (Biber, 1988; Biber, 1995) or (Biber et
al., 1999).
Steiner (2001) and Teich (2003) refer to regis-
ters as one of the influencing sources of the prop-
erties of translated text. Thus, we attempt to study
variation in translation variants by analysing dis-
tributions of lexico-grammatical features in our
corpus.
2.3 Machine translation
We also refer to studies on machine translation in
our analysis, as we believe that translation vari-
ation phenomena should not be limited to those
produced by humans. Although most studies com-
paring human and machine translation serve the
task of automatic MT evaluation only, cf. (White,
1994; Papineni et al, 2002; Babych and Hartley,
2004), some of them do use linguistic features for
their analysis.
For instance, Popovic? and Burchardt (2011)
define linguistically influenced categories (inflec-
tions, word order, lexical choices) to automatically
classify errors in the output of MT systems. Spe-
cia (2011) and Specia et al (2011) also utilise lin-
guistic features as indicators for quality estima-
tion in MT. The authors emphasize that most MT
studies ignored the MT system-independent fea-
tures, i.e. those reflecting the properties of the
translation and the original. The authors classify
them into source complexity features (sentence
and word length, type-token-ratio, etc.), target flu-
ency features (e.g. translation sentence length or
coherence of the target sentence) and adequacy
features (e.g. absolute difference between the
number of different phrase types in the source and
target or difference between the depth of their syn-
tactic trees, etc.).
3 Methodology
Consideration of the features described in the
above mentioned frameworks will give us new
insights on variation phenomena in translation.
Thus, we collect these features and extract infor-
mation on their distribution across translation vari-
ants of our corpus to evaluate them later with sta-
tistical methods.
Some of the features described by different
frameworks overlap, e.g. type-token-ratio (TTR)
or sentence length as indicator for simplification
in translationese analysis and as a target fluency
feature in MT quality estimation; modal meanings
and theme-rheme distribution in register analysis
and SFL, or alternation of passive verb construc-
tions in register analysis and translation studies.
Investigating language variation in translation,
we need to compare translations produced by dif-
ferent systems with those produced by humans
(with/without the help of CATs). Furthermore, we
need to compare translated texts either with their
originals in the source or comparable originals in
the target language. Moreover, as we know that
text type has influence on both source and target
text (Neumann, 2011), we need to compare differ-
ent text registers of all translation types.
This requires a certain corpus design: we need
a linguistically-annotated corpus for extraction of
particular features (e.g. morpho-syntactic con-
structions); we need to include meta-information
on (a) translation type (human vs. computer-aided
vs. machine, both rule-based and statistical), (b)
text production type (original vs. translation) and
(c) text type (various registers and domains of dis-
course). This will enable the following analysis
procedures: (1) automatic extraction, (2) statisti-
cal evaluation and (3) classification (clustering) of
lexico-grammatical features.
4 Corpus Resources
4.1 Corpus data collection
Due to the lack of resources required for the anal-
ysis of translation variation, we have compiled our
own translation corpus VARTRA (VARiation in
TRAnslation). In this paper, we present the first
version of the corpus ? VARTRA-SMALL, which
is the small and normalised version used for our
79
first analyses and experiments. The compilation
of the full version of VARTRA is a part of our fu-
ture work, cf. section 6.
VARTRA-SMALL contains English original
texts and variants of their translations (to each
text) into German which were produced by: (1)
human professionals (PT), (2) human student
translators with the help of computer-aided trans-
lation tools (CAT), (3) rule-based MT systems
(RBMT) and (4) statistical MT systems (SMT).
The English originals (EO), as well as the trans-
lations by profesionals (PT) were exported from
the already existing corpus CroCo mentioned in
section 1 above. The CAT variant was pro-
duced by student assistents who used the CAT
tool ACROSS in the translation process2. The
current RBMT variant was translated with SYS-
TRAN (RBMT1)3, although we plan to expand
it with a LINGUATEC-generated version4. For
SMT, we have compiled two versions ? the one
produced with Google Translate5 (SMT1), and the
other one with a Moses system (SMT2).
Each translation variant is saved as a subcor-
pus and covers seven registers of written language:
political essays (ESSAY), fictional texts (FIC-
TION), manuals (INSTR), popular-scientific arti-
cles (POPSCI), letters of share-holders (SHARE),
prepared political speeches (SPEECH), and touris-
tic leaflets (TOU), presented in Table 1. The total
number of tokens in VARTRA-SMALL comprises
795,460 tokens (the full version of VARTRA will
comprise at least ca. 1,7 Mio words).
4.2 Corpus annotation
For the extraction of certain feature types, e.g.
modal verbs, passive and active verb construc-
tions, Theme types, textual cohesion, etc. our cor-
pus should be linguistically annotated. All sub-
corpora of VARTRA-SMALL are tokenised, lem-
matised, tagged with part-of-speech information,
segmented into syntactic chunks and sentences.
The annotations were obtained with Tree Tagger
(Schmid, 1994).
In Table 2, we outline the absolute numbers for
different annotation levels per subcorpus (transla-
tion variant) in VARTRA-SMALL.
VARTRA-SMALL is encoded in CWB and can
be queried with the help of Corpus Query Proces-

sor (CQP) (Evert, 2005). We also encode a part
of the meta-data, such as information on regis-
ter, as well as translation method, tools used and
the source language. A sample output encoded in
CQP format that is subsequently used for corpus
query is shown in Figure 1.
In this way, we have compiled a corpus of dif-
ferent translation variants, which are comparable,
as they contain translations of the same texts pro-
duced with different methods and tools. Thus,
this comparable corpus allows for analysis of con-
trasts in terms of (a) text typology (e.g. fiction
vs. popular-scientific articles); (b) text produc-
tion types (originals vs. translations) and (c) trans-
lation types (human vs. machine and their sub-
types).
Furthermore, examination of some translation
phenomena requires parallel components ? align-
ment between originals and translations. At the
moment, alignment on the sentence level (ex-
ported from CroCo) is available for the EO and
PT subcorpora. We do not provide any alignment
for further translation variants at the moment, al-
though we plan to align all of them with the origi-
nals on word and sentence level.
4.3 Corpus querying
As already mentioned in 4.2, VARTRA-SMALL
can be queried with CQP, which allows definition
of language patterns in form of regular expressions
based on string, part-of-speech and chunk tags, as
well as further constraints. In Table 3, we illus-
trate an example of a query which is built to ex-
tract cases of processual finite passive verb con-
structions in German: lines 1 - 5 are used for pas-
sive from a Verbzweit sentence (construction in
German where the finite verb occupies the posi-
tion after the subject), and lines 6 - 10 are used
for Verbletzt constructions (where the finite verb
occupies the final position in the sentence). In
this example, we make use of part-of-speech (lines
3a, 5, 8 and 9a), lemma (lines 3b and 9b) and

CQP also allows us to sort the extracted infor-
mation according to the metadata: text registers
and IDs or translation methods and tools. Table
4 shows an example of frequency distribution ac-
cording to the metadata information. In this way,
we can obtain data for our analyses of translation
variation.
5 Preliminary Analyses

Table 4: Example output of V2 processual pas-

of the corpus, as well as the annotations available
already allow us to compare subcorpora (transla-
tion variants) in terms of shallow features, such
as type-token-ration (TTR), lexical density (LD)
and part-of-speech (POS) distributions. These fea-
tures are among the most frequently used variables
which characterise linguistic variation in corpora,
cf. (Biber et al, 1999) among others. They also
deliver the best scores in the identification of trans-
lationese features. We calculate TTR as the per-
centage of different lexical word forms (types)
per subcorpus. LD is calculated as percentage of
content words and the percentages given in the
POS distribution are the percentages of given word
classes per subcorpus, all normalised per cent. The
numerical results for TTR and LD are given in Ta-
ble 5.

For the analysis of POS distribution, we de-
cide to restrict them to nominal and verbal word
classes. Tables 6 and 7 illustrate distribution of
nominal ? nouns, pronouns (pron), adjectives (adj)
and adpositions (adp), and verbal word classes
? verbs, adverbs (adv) and conjunctions (conj) ?
across different translation variants.

5.2 Interpretation of results
According to Biber (1999), high proportion of
variable lexical words in a text is an indicator
of richness and density of experiential meanings.
This characterises the field of discourse (see sec-
subc verb adv conj total
PT 11.80 3.95 5.32 21.06

SMT2 9.09 2.52 6.06 17.67
Table 7: Verbal word classes in % in VARTRA-

tion 2.2 above), and TTR, thus, indicates infor-
mational density. In terms of translationese (see
section 2.1), TTR reveals simplification features
of translations. Translations always reveal lower
TTR and LD than their originals, cf. (Hansen,
2003).
The highest TTR, thus, the most lexically rich
translation variant in VARTRA is the one pro-
duced by human translators: PT > RBMT >
SMT2 > SMT1 > CAT. It is interesting that the
other human-produced variant demonstrates the
lowest lexical richness which might be explained
by the level of experience of translators (student
82
translators). Another reason could be the strength
of pronominal cohesion and less explicit specifica-
tion of domains. However, the comparison of the
distribution of pronouns (devices for pronominal
cohesion) does not reveal big differences between
PT and CAT, cf. Table 6.
Another simplification feature is LD, which
is also the lowest in CAT-subcorpus of VAR-
TRA: PT > SMT2 > SMT1 > RBMT > CAT.
Steiner (2012) claims that lower lexical density
can indicate increased logical explicitness (in-
creased use of conjunctions and adpositions) in
translations. CAT does demonstrate the highest
number of adpositions in the corpus, although the
difference across subcorpora is not high, see Ta-
ble 6.
The overall variation between the subcorpora in
terms of TTR and LD is not high, which can be in-
terpreted as indicator of levelling out (see section
2.1 above): translations are often more alike in
terms of these features than the individual texts in
a comparable corpus of source or target language.
In terms of nominal vs. verbal word classes,
there seems to be a degree of dominance of nom-
inal classes (56.11% vs. 17.67%) in SMT2 result-
ing in a ratio of 3.18 compared to other subcor-
pora, cf. Table 8.
subc nominal vs. verbal ratio
PT 53.10 : 21.06 2.52
CAT 50.93 : 23.10 2.20
RBMT 51.32 : 21.99 2.33
SMT1 52.89 : 21.02 2.52
SMT2 56.11 : 17.67 3.18
Table 8: Proportionality of nominal vs. verbal op-
position in VARTRA-SMALL
The greatest contributors to this dominance are
nouns and adjectives (Table 6 above). For CAT, we
again observe the lowest numbers (the lowest noun
vs. verb ratio) which means that this translation
variant seems to be the most ?verbal? one. Ac-
cording to Steiner (2012), German translations are
usually more verbal than German originals. Com-
paring German and English in general, the author
claims that German is less ?verbal? than English.
Thus, a higher ?verbality? serves as an indicator
of ?shining though? (see 2.1 above), which we ob-
serve in case of CAT. However, to find this out, we
would need to compare our subcorpora with their
originals, as well as the comparable German orig-
inals.
5.3 First statistical experiments
We use the extracted shallow features for the first
steps in feature evaluation. As our aim is to inves-
tigate the relations between the observed feature
frequencies and the respective translation variants,
we decide for correspondence analysis, a multi-
variate technique, which works on observed fre-
quencies and provides a map of the data usually
plotted in a two dimensional graph, cf. (Baayen,
2008).
As input we use the features described in 5.1
above: TTR, LD, nouns, adjectives (adj), ad-
positions (adp), verbs, adverbs (adv), conjunc-
tions (conj). Additionally, we divide the class
of pronouns into two groups: personal (pers.P)
and demonstrative (dem.P) ? devices to express
pronominal cohesion. We also extract frequency
information on modal verbs which express modal-
ity.
The output of the correspondence analysis is
plotted into a two dimensional graph with arrows
representing the observed feature frequencies and
points representing the translation variants. The
length of the arrows indicates how pronounced a
particular feature is. The position of the points in
relation to the arrows indicates the relative impor-
tance of a feature for a translation variant. The ar-
rows pointing in the direction of an axis indicate a
high contribution to the respective dimension. Fig-
ure 2 shows the graph for our data.
In Table 9, we present the Eigenvalues calcu-
lated for each dimension to assess how well our
data is represented in the graph6. We are able to
obtain a relatively high cumulative value by the
first two dimensions (representing x and y-axis in
Figure 2), as they are the ones used to plot the two-
dimensional graph. The cumulative value for the
first two dimensions is 94,3%, which indicates that
our data is well represented in the graph.
If we consider the y-axis in Figure 2, we see
that there is a separation between human and ma-
chine translation, although SMT2 is on the bor-
derline. CAT is also closer to MT, as it is plotted

Verbs, adjectives and nouns seem to be most
prominent contributors to the other division (con-
sidering the x-axis). Here, we can observe three
groups of subcorpora: CAT and RBMT share cer-
tain properties which differ them from SMT2. PT
remains on the borderline, whereas SMT1 tend
slightly to SMT2.
6 Conclusion and Future Work
In this paper, we presented a comparable corpus
of translations from English into German, which
contains multiple variants of translation of the
same texts. This corpus is an important resource
for the investigation of variation phenomena re-
flected in linguistic features of translations. The
corpus architecture allows us to extract these fea-
tures automatically. Our preliminary results show
that there are both similarities and differences be-
tween translation variants produced by humans
and machine systems. We expect even more vari-
ation, if we compare the distribution of these fea-
tures across text registers available in all subcor-
pora.
However, there is a need to inspect the reasons
for this variation, as they can be effected by trans-
lator experience, restrictions of the CAT system
applied or the training material used in MT.
We believe that our resources, as well as our re-
search results will find application not only in con-
trastive linguistics or translation studies. On the
one hand, our corpus provides a useful dataset to
investigate translation phenomena and processes,
84
but on the other, it can be used for the develop-
ment, optimisation and evaluation of MT systems,
as well as CAT tools (e.g. translation memories).
In the future, we aim at expanding it with more
data: (1) more texts for the existing registers (each
register should contain around 30,000 words), (2)
further text registers (e.g. academic, web and news
texts). We also plan to produce further human
and machine-generated translations, i.e. (3) ma-
chine translations post-edited by humans, as well
as translation outputs of (4) further MT systems.
Moreover, we aim at adding translations from Ger-
man into English to trace variation influenced by
language typology.
As the automatic tagging of part-of-speech and
chunk information might be erroneous, we plan to
evaluate the output of the TreeTagger and com-
pare it with the output of further tools available,
e.g. MATE dependency parser, cf. (Bohnet,
2010). Furthermore, the originals will be aligned
with their translations on word and sentence level.
This annotation type is particularly important for
the analysis of variation in translation of certain
lexico-grammatical structures.
A part of the corpus (CAT, RBMT and SMT
subcorpora) will be available to a wider academic
public, e.g. via the CLARIN-D repository.
