ABSTRACT 
This project note describes a systern that receives, parses, 
indexes, and routes news reports. The core of this ,'mtomatic 
indexer is a parser based on Govermnent-Binding Theory which 
derives thematic and binding relationships of arguments of the 
sentences of slories. These syntactic structures are interpreted 
by a semantic processor which is linked to conceptual represen- 
tations of terms from a controlled indexing vocabulary. As a 
result, the system is capable of indexing news with respect o a 
large set of let+ms that denote Ihe content of the articles. 
I',ACKGROUNI) 
With the rapidly increasing \olume of text being generated. 
transmitted, processed, and stored, it becomes critical that 
informalion retrieval and routing be highly efficient, both in 
time of processing and accuracy. To this end, indexing tech- 
niques have become the prinmry focus of much research, a~d 3'el 
dlese methods have relied on automatic keyword identification 
from texts. This is not to say that natural hmguagc techniques 
have not been examined with respect to their relevance for 
indexing and retrieval (cf./Sparck Jones and Kay 1973/, 
/Walker, Karlgren, and Kay 1977/, and more recently,/Sahon 
mid Smith 1989/). It is that most systems rely on the presence or 
absence of keywords with additional mechanisms such as prox- 
imity constraints, tatistical weighting, word-stem truncation, 
and boolean relrieval expressions. However, these methods do 
~ot take into account the syntactic and semantic structure 
inherent in tile text being indexed. That is, they make virtually 
no use of the fact that it is natural anguage and not a collection 
of arbitrary strings of characters that is being processed. 
Natural anguage processing (NLP) can make its most valuable 
cont,'ibutions to those aspects of indexing where the keyword 
approaches fail, viz., the assignment of terms ~.o text based on 
their semantic or conceptual content. This involves deriving 
abstract relationships among conceptual units. For example, 
consider a story stating: 
( 1 ) China bought 6,000 tonncs of wheat from the 
United States. 
\[)he plausible categorization of (1) is thai it is about foreign 
trade. However, the phrase "foreign trade" does not appear in 
(1), and it is invariably absent fl'om foreign trade stories in 
general. Furthermore, it is extremely unlikely that such foreign 
trade stories cottld be retrieved in an efficient manner, i.e., with 
a tew simple queries. The central issue is that although the 
particulars (e.g., country names and types o fcommodilies) wuy, 
the basic lneanings of foreign trade slodes are equivalent at 
some level, and that this level is wduable for indexing purposes. 
This suggests that systems that could operate at a conceptual 
level would be capable of indexing in ways that cotdd permit 
highly effective retrieval. 
It is with the assumption that NLP technology can provide tile 
means of categorizing text that guide several recent efforts. In 
particular, each of/Hayes et al 1988/,/Kuhns 1988/, and/Rau 
and Jitcobs 1988/ describes ystems that characterize news 
reports with results that could llOt be obtained by keyword 
methods alone. Since a news analysis system (NAS) was first 
reported in/Kuhns 1988/, a number of major enhancements to 
its design and underlying functionality have been incorporated. 
It is the purpose of this paper to report on tbe current state of NAS 
and ils COlllpolleI\]ts. 
SCOPE AND OB,IECTIVES 
A primary design goal behind NAS is to develop a system 
employing NLP technology that wouh:t be capable of either 
routing news t'rom electronic news feeds in real-time or indexing 
news with respect o very large sets of indexing terms (author- 
ity files). ~ This vocabulary is broad and ranges over diverse 
domains, with lerms representing proper names, concrete ob- 
jects, or abslract relationships. The last type is dependent on the 
content of the stories and is particularly suited for the syntactic/ 
semantic techniques of NAS. 
The form of the indexes that NAS produces is a set of pairs of 
headings and subheadings or descriptors. The headings are 
frequently proper names while the descriptors add detailed in- 
formation to the index by denoting various relationships of 
entities mentioned in the news reports. 
ARCHITECTURAL OVERVIEW 
Tile architecture of NAS is modular consisting of several main 
subsystems, viz., a set of preprocessors and template filters, a 
parser, a lexicon, a semantic interpreter, a set of concept bases, 
and an indexer (Figure 1). The system is transportable in that it 
can be interfaced to different news streams and indexing vo- 
cabularies. 
A preprocessor receives a news stream which can be flom a 
satellite dish link, a direct line, or a text file, and identifies the 
beginning and ending of stories in addition to their titles, sen- 
tences, and words. Since the format of each news feed, e.g., 
Reuters or Kyodo, is distinct from the others, a single preproces- 
sor will accept only one news feed. For rigidly-formatted articles 
that are numerical or non-texttlal inform, a template filter, which 
is an indexing component of low-level routines, categorizes 
them from lhe title while deriving specifics l'rom the body of tile 
story.

This structure denotes that a product introduction is one where 
a company introduces (or, synonymously, releases) a product. In 
short, it is a list of typed nodes. A report will be characterized as
a product introduction story if it contains a sentence some of 
whose grammatical components (e.g., agent, predicate, theme) 
can be associated tothe corresponding odes of{ 2), Suppose, l:or

In contrast, textual stories require grammatical processing and 
these are sent to the parser and semantic interpreter. The parser 
which relies on the principles of Government-Binding (GB) 
Theory (/Chomsky 1981/3, outputs predicate-argument struc- 
ture of each sentence of a sto W.a In doing so, the parser identi ties 
empty categories, viz., PROs, traces, and variables, and thematic 
relations, and resolves antecedent and anaphor and pronominal 
bindings. It should be noted that the parser is interfaced to a 
lexicon of over 17,000 items that was developed by analyzing 
strings (words) from a newswim. The size of the lexicon is 
sufficient for news processing. 
The semantic interpreter maps the grammatical structures onto 
conceptual representations or filters stored in a concept base. For 
instance, a representation for "Product Introduction" is
The parser binds the pronominal it, the agent of plans, to A~)ha 
Cor~tx, the subject or agent of the matrix clause. The parser also 
detects an empty category, viz., PRO, in the embedded sentence 
(proposition) with release as the verb and binds the pronominal 
to it. 
Since bound arguments share the same semantic features, the 
semantic interpreter determines that the agent of release in (4) is 
of type COMPANY. In other words, PRO inherits the property 
of COMPANY from the agent of the matrix sentence via the 
intermediate pronominal k. It also determines that the predicate 
release is synonymous with introduce and the theme worksta- 
tion is a product. With the arguments typed and membership of
the predicate within a synonym class known, the semantic proc- 
essor can match the corresponding nodes of the most deeply em- 
bedded clause of (4) with (2), and thus determines that the 
sentence is about a product introduction. Associated with each 
conceptual filter is a set of indexing procedures that are invoked

by the indexing mechanism when a conceptual fi ter is satisfied. 
These thnctions are integrated with databases containing the 
indexing vocabulary and they identify specific information 
about a story including company, personal, and product names, 
and descriptors indicating specific relationships, Figure 3 illus-

ties and the level of "understanding" as reflected by the subhead-

BENCHMARKS 
Formal benchnmrks have been established based on news from 
Reuters. On a Symbolics 3640, NAS can process entire days of 
news (500-600 storiesMay) in 35-40 minutes and can assign 
indexes to approximately 75% of the stories. (The phumed goal 
of at least 85% coverage iscertainly achievable.) Accuracy was 
.judged exlremely high by a group of independent indexers and 
editors. Quality cotdd not be judged quantitatively clue to the 
complexity artd subjectivity of the indexing terms and proce- 
dures. 
FUTURE DIRECTIONS 
In addition to continual extensions tothe various colnponents of
the system, a design for an interface of NAS to deductive 
databases has begun. The development of this extension would 
enable databases to be generated automatically with indexes 
being stored as logical relations, thereby, permitting retrieval or 
alerting capabilities based on explicit as well as implicit c,r 
inferred information. 
A NOTE ON THE IMPLEMENTATION 
NAS was developed in ZetaLisp on Symbolics workstations. It 
has been converted to Common Lisp and runs on Maclvory and 
Macintosh computers. 
CONCLUSION 
The results of NAS demonstrate hat it is possible to employ 
natural language processing and, in particular, linguistic-based 
parsers, to extract conceptual information from texts (news). 
This coupling of theoretical (GB) results with a large-scale 
application provides insights into the possibilities and limita- 
tions of computational aswell as formal inguistics. 
NOTES 
tThe natural language component, however, is not restricted to 
news processing. With another preprocessor and links to an 
expert system, the system has processed text found on insurance 
applications. 
2The use of a GB-based parser within this application results 
flom the ongoing research and development on this type of 
parser. (/Kuhns 1986/describes an earlier implementation f 
GB Theory.) From a research perspective, a parser based on lin- 
guistic theory and applied to "real-world" text helps identify the 
boundaries or interface conditions between core and peripheral 
aspects of the theory. In other words, since GB is a model of core 
grammar and language contains marginal or marked conslruc- 
tions, a GB-based parser nmst co-routine principles of the theory 
with hmguage-specific rules in order to have wide coverage. 
(/Fomita 1988/makes a similar observation.) Thus, it is this 
combination ofa psychologically-real theory and an application 
using fl'ee text that may provide insight into the human sentence 
processing mechanism.
