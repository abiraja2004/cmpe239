Abst ract  
In this paper we describe a method of classifying 
Japanese text documents using domain specific kanji 
charactcrs. Text documents are generally cb~ssified 
by significant words (keywords) of the documents. 
However, it is difficult to extract these significant 
words from Japanese text, because Japanese texts 
are written without using blank spaces, such as de- 
limiters, and must be segmented into words. There- 
fore, instead of words, we used domain specific kanji 
characters which appear more frequently in one do- 
main than the other. We extracted these domain 
specific kanji characters by X ,2 method. Then, us- 
ing these domain specific kanji characters, we clas- 
sifted editorial columns "TENSEI J INGO", edito- 
rim articles, and articles in "Scientific American (in 
Japanese)". The correct recognition scores for' them 
were 47%, 74%, and 85%, respectively. 
1 In t roduct ion  
Document cl~sification has been widely investigated 
for assigning domains to documents for text retrieval, 
or aiding human editors in assigning such domains. 
Various successful systems have been developed to 
classify text documents (Blosseville, 1992; Guthrie, 
1994; Ilamill, 1980; Masand, 1992; Young, 1985). 
Conventional way to develop document classifica- 
tion systems can be divided into the following two 
groups: 
1. semantic approach 
2. statistical approach 
In the semantic approach, document classification is
based on words and keywords of a thesaurus. If the 
thesaurus i constructed well, high score is achieved. 
But this approach as disadvantages in terms of de- 
velopment and maintenance. On the other hand, in 
the statistical approach, a human exl)ert classifies 
a sample set of documents into predefined omains, 
and the computer learns from these samples how 
to classify documents into these domains. '\]'his ap- 
proach offers advantages in terms of development 
and maintenance, but the quality of the results is 
not good enough in comparison with the semantic 
approach. In either approach, document classifica- 
tion using words has problems as follows: 
1. Words in the documents must be normalized 
for matching those in the dictionary and the 
thesaurus. Moreover, in the case of Japanese 
texts, it is difficult to extract words from them, 
because they are written without using blank 
spaces as delimiters and must be segmented 
into words. 
2. A simple word extraction technique generates 
to() many words. In the statistical approach, 
the dimensions of tim training space are too 
big au(l tim classification process usually fails. 
Therefore, the. Jal)anese document classification on 
words needs a high l)recision Japanese morpholog- 
ical analyzer and a great amount of lexical knowl- 
edge. Considering these disadvantages, we propose 
a new method of document classification on kanfi 
character,s, on which document classification is per- 
formed without a morphological analyzer and lexi- 
eel knowledge. In our approach, we extracted o- 
main specific kanji characters for' document classi- 
fication by the X 2 metho(I. The features of docu- 
lnents and domains are rel-)resented using the tim_ 
ture space the axes of which are these domain spe- 
cific kanji characters. Then, we classified Japanese 
documents into domains by mea~suring the similar- 
ity between ew documents and the domains in the 
feature space.

2.1 Text  Representat ion  t)y Kanj i  
Characters  
In previous researches, texts were represented by 
significarlt woMs, and a word was regarded as a min- 
immn semantic unit. But a word is not a minimum 
semantic unit, because a word consists of one or 
more morphemes. Here, we propose the text repre- 
sentation by morpheme. We have applied this idea 
to the Japanese text representation, where a kanji 
character is a morpheme. Each kanji character has 
its meaning, and Japanese words (nouns, verbs, ad- 
jectives, and so on) usually contain one or more 
kanji characters which represent the meaning of the 
words to some extent. 
When representing the features of a text by kanji 
characters, it is important o consider which kanji 
characters are significant for the text representation 
and useful for classification. We assumed that these 
significant kanji characters appear more frequently

in one donlaii'i than the other, and extracted theni 
by the X 2 method. I,'rOlll llOW Oli, these kanji charac- 
ters are called the domain specific kanji characlcrs. 
Then, we represented the conteut e ta  Japanese 
text x as the following vector of douiain specific 
kanji characters: 
x = ( f l ,  f2  . . . . .  f /  . . . . .  / I ) ,  (1)  
where coinponent fi is the frequency ofdoniain SlW. -
ciIic kanji i and I is the nuniber of all the extracted 
kanji characters by the X 2 lnethod. In this way, tilt' 
Japanese text x is expressed as a point in the ~l. 
dimensional feature space the axes of which are the 
domain  specific kanji characters. Then, we used this 
feature space for tel)resenting the features of the do- 
mains. Nainely, the domain vl is rel)rese.nted usilig 
the feature vector of doniain specific kanji charac- 
ters as follows: 
Vi = ( f l ,  f2 , . . . ,  St , . . . ,  .\[1). (2) 
We used this feature space llOt only for I, he text 
representation but also for the docunient classifica- 
tion. \[f the document classification is lJerforined Oil 
kanji characters, we may avoid the two problenls 
described in Section 1. 
1. It is simpler to extract ka, iji characters than tO 
extract Japanese words. 
2. There are about 2,000 kanji char~tcte,'s that 
are considered neccssary h)r general literacy. 
So, the rnaximuln number of dimensiolis of the 
training space is about 2,000. 
Of course, in our approach, the quality of the 
results may not be as good as lit the i)revh)us al)- 
preaches ilSilig the words. But it is signilicanl, I.hat 
we can avoid the cost of iriorphologi(:at mialysis which 
is not so perfect.

3.1 The  Loar i l ing  Sample  
For extracting doiriain specific kanji characters and 
obtaining the fea, till 'e voctoi's of each domain, we ilSe 
articles of "l<ncych}pedia lh:'.ibonsha" ~IrS the le/trn- 
ing sa.nll)le. The reasoll why we use this encyclo- 
Imdia is thai, it is lmblished in the electronic form 
and contains a gi'oat liiiiill)oi' of articles. This en- 
c.yclopedia was written by 6,727 atlthors, and COil- 
rains about 80,000 artich'.s, 6.52 x 107 characters, 
and 7.52 X 107 kanji characters. An exanlple arti- 
c.le of "Encyclopedia lloibonsha" is shown in Figure 
7. Unfortunately, tile articles are not  classified, hut 
there is the author's llaliie at the end of each article 
and his specialty is notified in the preface.. There 
fore, we can chussit'y these articles into the authors'  
specialties autonlaLically. 
The specialties used i .  the encyck}l)edia are wide, 
but they a.re not well balanced i Moreover, some 
doniains of the authors'  specialties contain only few 
iFor exaniple, the specialty of Yuriko Takeuchi is 
Anglo American literature, oil the other hand, that of 
Koichi Anlano is science fiction.

articles. So, it is difficult to extract appropriate 
domain specific kanji characters from the articles 
which are classified into the authors' specialties. 
Therefore, it is important to consider that 206 
specialties in the encyclopedia, which represent al- 
most a half of the specialties, are used as the sub- 
jects of the domain in the Nippon Decimal Classifi- 
cation (NDC). For example, botany, which is one of 
the authors' specialties, is also one of the subjects 
of the domain in the NDC. In addition to this, 
the NDC has hierarchical domains. For keepiug the 
domains well balanced, we combined the specialties 
using the hierarchical relationship of the NDC. The 
procedure for combining the specialties i as follows: 
1. We aligned the specialties to the domains in the 
NDC. 206 specialties corresponded to the do- 
mains of the NDC automatically, and the rest 
was aligned manually. 
2. We combined 418 specialties to 59 code do- 
mains of the NDC, using its hierarchical re- 
lationship. 'Fable 1 shows an example of the 
hierarchical relationship of the NDC. 
However, 59 domains are not well balanced. For ex- 
ample, "physics", "electric engineering", and "Ger- 
man literature" are the code domains of the NDC, 
and we know these domains are not well balanced 
by intuition. So, for keeping the domains well bal- 
anced, we combined 59 domains to 42 manually. 
3.2 Se lect ion of  Domain  Specif ic Kan j i  
Characters  by  the X 2 Method  
Using the value X 2 of the X 2 test, we can detect 
the unevenly distributed kanji characters and ex- 
tract these kanji characters as domain specific kanji 
characters. Indeed, it was verified that X ~ method 
is useful for extracting keywords instead of kanji 
characters(Nagao, 1976). 
Suppose we denote the frequency of kanji i in 
the domain j ,  mid,  and we assume that kanji i is 
distributed evenly. Then the value X 2 ofkanji i, X~, 
is expressed by the equations as follows: 
I 
j= l  
d _ ( * 'd  (4) 
rlzij 
1 
xi j  k 
j= l  
mid-  k , x~.it (s) 
i=1 d : l  
where k is the number of varieties of the kanji char- 
acters and 1 is tile number of the domains. If the 
value X/2 is relatively big, we consider that the kanji 
i is distributed unevenly. 
There are two considerations about the extrac- 
tion of the domain specific kanji characters using 
the X 2 method. The first is the size of the training 
samples. If the size of each training sample is differ- 
ent, the ranking of domain specific kanji characters 
is not equal to tile ranking of tile value X 2. 'File sec- 
ond is that we cannot recognize which domains are 
represented by the extracted kanji characters using 
only the value X :~ of equation (3). In other words, 
there is no guarantee that we can extract the ap- 
propriate domain specific kanji characters from ev- 
ery domain. From this, we have extracted the fixed 
number of domain specific kanji characters from ev- 
ery domain using the ranking of the value X~ d of 
equation (4) instead of (3). Not only the value X~ 
of equation (3) but the value X~ d of equation (4) be- 
come big when the kanji i appears more frequently 
in the domain j than in the other. Table 2 shows 
top 20 domain specific kanji characters of the 42 
domains. Further, Appendix shows tim meanings 
of each domain specific kanji character of "library 
science" domain. 
3.3 Feature  Space for the Docmnent  
Class i f icat ion 
In order to measure the closeness between an un- 
classified document and the 42 domains, we pro- 
posed a feature space the axes of which are domain 
specific kanji characters extracted from the 42 do- 
mains. To represent the features of an unclassified 
document and the 42 domains, we used feature vec- 
tot's (1) and (2) respectively. To find out the closest 
domain, we measured an angle between the unclas- 
sifted document and the 42 domains in the feature 
space. If we are given a new document he feature 
vector of which is x, the classification system can 
compute the angle 0 with each vector vi which rep- 
resents the domain i
and find vi with 
rain 0 ( vi , z ) . 
i 
Using this procedure, every document is classified 
into the closest domain.

4.1 Ex i )e r imenta l  Resu l ts  
For evaluating our approach, we used the following 
three sets of articles in our experiments: 
1. articles in "Scientific American (in .lapanese)" 
(162 articles) 
2. editorial columns in Asahi Newspaper "TEN- 
SE\[ J INGO" (about 2,000 articles) 
3. editorial articles in Asahi Newspaper (about 
3,000 articles) 
Because the articles in "Scientific American (ill Japa- 
nese)" are not cb~ssified, we classified them manu- 
ally. The articles of "TENSEI J INGO" and tile 
editorial articles are classified by editors into a hi- 
797 
erarchy of domains which differ from the domains 
of the NDC. We aligned these domains to the 42 
domains described in Section 3.1. Some articles in 
thereof contain two or more themes, and these arti- 
cles are classified into two or more domains by edi- 
tors. For example, the editorial article 'qbo Many 
Katakana Words" is classified into three domains. 
In these cases, we.j,dge that the result of the au- 
tomatic classification is correct when it corresponds 
to one of the domains where the document is cbLs- 
sifted by editors. Figure 3 , Figure 4, and Figure 5 
describe the variations of the classification results 
with respect o the number of domain specific kanji 
characters. 
4.2 Eva luat ion  
In our approach, the maximum correct recognition 
scores for the editorial articles and the articles in 
"Scientific American (in Japanese)" are 74 % and 85 
%, respectively. Considering that our system uses 
only the statistical information of kanji characters 
and deals with a great amount of documents which 
cover various specialties, our approach achieved a 
good result in document classification. From this, 
we believe that our approach is efficient for broadly 
classifying various subjects of the documents, e.g. 
news stories. A method for classifying news stories 
is significant for distributing and retrieving articles 
in electronic newspaper. 
The maximum recognition scores for "TENSEI 
J INGO" is 47 %. The reasons why the result is far 
worse than the results of the other are: 
1. The style of the documents 
The style of "TENSEI ,lINGO" is similar to 
that of an essay or a novel and it is written in 
colloquial Japanese. In contrast, the style of 
the editorial articles and "Scientific American 
(in Japanese)" is similar to that of a thesis. We 
think the reason why we achieved the good re- 
sult in the classification of the editorial articles 
and "Scientific American (in Japanese)" is that 
many technical terms are used in there and it is 
likely that the kanji characters which represent 
the technical terms are domain specific kanji 
characters in that domain. 
2. Two or more themes in one document 
Many articles of "TENSEI J INGO" contain two 
or more themes. In these articles, it is usual 
that the introductory part has little relation 
to the main theme. For example, the article 
"Splendid ILetirement", whose main theme is 
the Speaker's resignation of the llouse of Rep- 
resentatives, ha~s an introductory part about 
the retirement of famous sportsmen. In conclu- 
sion, our aplJroach is not effective in classifying 
these articles. 
However, if we divide these articles into se- 
mantic objects, e.g. chapter and section, these 
semantic objects may be classified in our ap- 
proach. Table 3 shows the results of classifying 
fifll text and each chapter of a book "Artifi- 
cial Intelligence and Human Being". Because 
this book is manually classified into tile domain

that the system classified this book into the

the system classified Chapter 3 and Chapter 5

5 Conc lus ion  
The quality of the experimental results showed that 
our apl)roach enables document classification with 
a good ac.e|lracy, and suggested the possibility for 
Jat)anese documents to t)e represented on the basis 
of kanji characters they contain. 
6 Future Work  
Because the training samples are created withovt 
this application in mind, we may be able to im- 
prove the performance by increasing the size of the 
training samples or by using different samples which 
have the similar styles and contents to the docu- 
ments. We would also like to study the relation 
between tile quality of the classification result and 
the size of the documents.
