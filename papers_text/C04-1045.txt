Abstract
In this paper, we present an approach to
include morpho-syntactic dependencies into
the training of the statistical alignment
models. Existing statistical translation sys-
tems usually treat different derivations of
the same base form as they were indepen-
dent of each other. We propose a method
which explicitly takes into account such in-
terdependencies during the EM training of
the statistical alignment models. The eval-
uation is done by comparing the obtained
Viterbi alignments with a manually anno-
tated reference alignment. The improve-
ments of the alignment quality compared
to the, to our knowledge, best system are
reported on the German-English Verbmobil
corpus.
1 Introduction
In statistical machine translation, a translation
model Pr(fJ1 |eI1) describes the correspondences
between the words in the source language sen-
tence fJ1 and the words in the target language
sentence eI1. Statistical alignment models are
created by introducing a hidden variable aJ1
representing a mapping from the source word
fj into the target word eaj . So far, most of
the statistical machine translation systems are
based on the single-word alignment models as
described in (Brown et al, 1993) as well as the
Hidden Markov alignment model (Vogel et al,
1996). The lexicon models used in these systems
typically do not include any linguistic or con-
textual information which often results in inad-
equate alignments between the sentence pairs.
In this work, we propose an approach to im-
prove the quality of the statistical alignments
by taking into account the interdependencies of
different derivations of the words. We are get-
ting use of the hierarchical representation of the
statistical lexicon model as proposed in (Nie?en
and Ney, 2001) for the conventional EM training
procedure. Experimental results are reported
for the German-English Verbmobil corpus and
the evaluation is done by comparing the ob-
tained Viterbi alignments after the training of
conventional models and models which are using
morpho-syntactic information with a manually
annotated reference alignment.
2 Related Work
The popular IBM models for statistical ma-
chine translation are described in (Brown et
al., 1993) and the HMM-based alignment model
was introduced in (Vogel et al, 1996). A good
overview of all these models is given in (Och
and Ney, 2003) where the model IBM-6 is also
introduced as the log-linear interpolation of the
other models.
Context dependencies have been introduced
into the training of alignments in (Varea et al,
2002), but they do not take any linguistic infor-
mation into account.
Some recent publications have proposed the
use of morpho-syntactic knowledge for statisti-
cal machine translation, but mostly only for the
preprocessing step whereas training procedure
of the statistical models remains the same (e.g.
(Nie?en and Ney, 2001a)).
Incorporation of the morpho-syntactic knowl-
egde into statistical models has been dealt
in (Nie?en and Ney, 2001): hierarchical lexi-
con models containing base forms and set of
morpho-syntactic tags are proposed for the
translation from German into English. How-
ever, these lexicon models are not used for the
training but have been created from the Viterbi
alignment obtained after the usual training pro-
cedure.
The use of POS information for improving
statistical alignment quality of the HMM-based
model is described in (Toutanova et al, 2002).
They introduce additional lexicon probability
for POS tags in both languages, but actually
are not going beyond full forms.
3 Statistical Alignment Models
The goal of statistical machine translation is to
translate an input word sequence f1, . . . , fJ in
the source language into a target language word
sequence e1, . . . , eI . Given the source language
sequence, we have to choose the target language
sequence that maximises the product of the lan-
guage model probability Pr(eI1) and the trans-
lation model probability Pr(fJ1 |eI1). The trans-
lation model describes the correspondence be-
tween the words in the source and the target
sequence whereas the language model describes
well-formedness of a produced target sequence.
The translation model can be rewritten in the
following way:
Pr(fJ1 |eI1) =
?
aJ1
Pr(fJ1 , aJ1 |eI1)
where aJ1 are called alignments and represent
a mapping from the source word position j to
the target word position i = aj . Alignments
are introduced into translation model as a hid-
den variable, similar to the concept of Hidden
Markov Models (HMM) in speech recognition.
The translation probability Pr(fJ1 , aJ1 |eI1) can
be further rewritten as follows:
Pr(fJ1 , aJ1 |eI1) =
J?
j=1
Pr(fj , aj |f j?11 , aj?11 , eI1)
=
J?
j=1
Pr(aj |f j?11 , aj?11 , eI1) ?
?Pr(fj |f j?11 , aj1, eI1)
where Pr(aj |f j?11 , aj?11 , eI1) is called alignment
probability and Pr(fj |f j?11 , aj1, eI1) is lexicon
probability.
In all popular translation models IBM-1 to
IBM-5 as well as in HMM translation model,
the lexicon probability Pr(fj |f j?11 , aj1, eI1) is ap-
proximated with the simple single-word lexi-
con probability p(fj |eaj ) which takes into ac-
count only full forms of the words fj and
eaj . The difference between these models is
based on the definition of alignment model
Pr(aj |f j?11 , aj?11 , eI1). Detailed description of
those models can be found in (Brown et al,
1993), (Vogel et al, 1996) and (Och and Ney,
2003).
4 Hierarchical Representation of the
Lexicon Model
Typically, the statistical lexicon model is based
only on the full forms of the words and does not
have any information about the fact that some
different full forms are actually derivations of
the same base form. For highly inflected lan-
guages like German this might cause problems
because the coverage of the lexicon might be
low since the token/type ratio for German is
typically much lower than for English (e.g. for
Verbmobil: English 99.4, German 56.3).
To take these interdependencies into account,
we use the hierarchical representation of the sta-
tistical lexicon model as proposed in (Nie?en
and Ney, 2001). A constraint grammar parser
GERCG for lexical analysis and morphological
and syntactic disambiguation for German lan-
guage is used to obtain morpho-syntactic infor-
mation. For each German word, this tool pro-
vides its base form and the sequence of morpho-
syntactic tags, and this information is then
added into the original corpus. For example,
the German word ?gehe? (go), a verb in the
indicative mood and present tense which is de-
rived from the base form ?gehen? is annotated
as ?gehe#gehen-V-IND-PRES#gehen?.
This new representation of the corpus where
full word forms are enriched with its base forms
and tags enables gradual accessing of informa-
tion with different levels of abstraction. Con-
sider for example the above mentioned German
word ?gehe? which can be translated into the
English word ?go?. Another derivation of the
same base form ?gehen? is ?gehst? which also
can be translated by ?go?. Existing statistical
translation models cannot handle the fact that
?gehe? and ?gehst? are derivatives of the same
base form and both can be translated into the
same English word ?go?, whereas the hierarchi-
cal representation makes it possible to take such
interdependencies into account.
5 EM Training
5.1 Standard EM training (review)
In this section, we will briefly review the stan-
dard EM algorithm for the training of the lexi-
con model.
In the E-step the lexical counts are collected
over all sentences in the corpus:
C(f, e) =
?
s
?
a
p(a|f s, es)
?
i,j
?(f, fjs)?(e, eis)
In the M-step the lexicon probabilities are cal-
culated:
p(f |e) = C(f, e)?
f?
C(f? , e)
The procedure is similar for the other model
parameters, i.e. alignment and fertility proba-
bilities.
For models IBM-1, IBM-2 and HMM, an ef-
ficient computation of the sum over all align-
ments is possible. For the other models, the
sum is approximated using an appropriately de-
fined neighbourhood of the Viterbi alignment
(see (Och and Ney, 2003) for details).
5.2 EM training using hierarchical
counts
In this section we describe the EM training of
the lexicon model using so-called hierarchical
counts which are collected from the hierarchi-
caly annotated corpus.
In the E-step the following types of counts are
collected:
? full form counts:
C(f, e) =
?
s
?
a
p(a|f s, es) ?
?
?
i,j
?(f, fjs)?(e, eis)
where f is the full form of the word, e.g.
?gehe?;
? base form+tag counts:
C(fbt, e) =
?
s
?
a
p(a|f s, es) ?
?
?
i,j
?(fbt, fbtjs)?(e, eis)
where fbt represents the base form of the
word f with sequence of corresponding
tags, e.g. ?gehen-V-IND-PRES?;
? base form counts:
C(fb, e) =
?
s
?
a
p(a|f s, es) ?
?
?
i,j
?(fb, fbjs)?(e, eis)
where fb is the base form of the word f ,
e.g. ?gehen?.
For each full form, refined hierarchical counts
are obtained in the following way:
Chier(f, e) = C(f, e) + C(fbt, e) + C(fb, e)
and the M-step is then performed using hier-
archical counts:
p(f |e) = Chier(f, e)?
f?
Chier(f? , e)
The training procedure for the other model
parameters remains unchanged.
6 Experimental Results
We performed our experiments on the Verbmo-
bil corpus. The Verbmobil task (W. Wahlster,
editor, 2000) is a speech translation task in the
domain of appointment scheduling, travel plan-
ning and hotel reservation. The corpus statis-
tics is shown in Table 1. The number of sure and
possible alignments in the manual reference is
given as well. We also used a small training cor-
pus consisting of only 500 sentences randomly
chosen from the main corpus.
We carried out the training scheme
14H5334365 using the toolkit GIZA++.
The scheme is defined according to the number
of iterations for each model. For example, 43
means three iterations of the model IBM-4. We
trained the IBM-1 and HMM model using hier-
archical lexicon counts, and the parameters of
the other models were also indirectly improved
thanks to the refined parameters of the initial
models.

6.1 Evaluation Method
We use the evaluation criterion described in
(Och and Ney, 2000). The obtained word
alignment is compared to a reference alignment
produced by human experts. The annotation
scheme explicitly takes into account the ambi-
guity of the word alignment. The unambiguous
alignments are annotated as sure alignments (S)
and the ambiguous ones as possible alignments
(P ). The set of possible alignments P is used
especially for idiomatic expressions, free trans-
lations and missing function words. The set S
is subset of the set P (S ? P ).
The quality of an alignment A is computed
as appropriately redefined precision and recall
measures. Additionally, we use the alignment
error rate (AER) which is derived from the well-
known F-measure.
recall = |A ? S||S| , precision =
|A ? P |
|A|
AER = 1? |A ? S|+ |A ? P ||A|+ |S|
Thus, a recall error can only occur if a S(ure)
alignment is not found and a precision error
can only occur if a found alignment is not even
P (ossible).
6.2 Alignment Quality Results
Table 2 shows the alignment quality for the two
corpus sizes of the Verbmobil task. Results
are presented for the Viterbi alignments from
both translation directions (German?English
and English?German) as well as for combina-
tion of those two alignments.
The table shows the baseline AER for dif-
ferent training schemes and the corresponding
AER when the hierarchical counts are used. We
see that there is a consistent decrease in AER
for all training schemes, especially for the small
training corpus. It can be also seen that greater
improvements are yielded for the simpler mod-
els.
7 Conclusions
In this work we have presented an approach
for including morpho-syntactic knowledge into
a maximum likelihood training of statistical
translation models. As can be seen in Section
5, going beyond full forms during the training
by taking into account the interdependencies of
the different derivations of the same base form
results in the improvements of the alignment

baseline system (name of the model) and the
system using hierarchical method (+hier)
quality, especially for the small training corpus.
We assume that the method can be very effec-
tive for cases where only small amount of data is
available. We also expect further improvements
by performing a special modelling for the rare
words.
We are planning to investigate possibilities
of improving the alignment quality for different
language pairs using different types of morpho-
syntactic information, like for example to use
word stems and suffixes for morphologicaly rich
languages where some parts of the words have
to be aligned to the whole English words (e.g.
Spanish verbs, Finnish in general, etc.) We are
also planning to use the refined alignments for
the translation process.
