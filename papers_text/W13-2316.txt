Abstract
In this paper, we present an annotation tool
developed specifically for manual senti-
ment analysis of social media posts. The
tool provides facilities for general and tar-
get based opinion marking on different
type of posts (i.e. comparative, ironic,
conditional) with a web based UI which
supports synchronous annotation. It is
also designed as a SaaS (Software as a
Service). The tool?s outstanding features
are easy and fast annotation interface, de-
tailed sentiment levels, multi-client sup-
port, easy to manage administrative mod-
ules and linguistic annotation capabilities.
1 Introduction
Today, monitoring social media is a vital need for
companies and it has a high commercial value. So
almost all companies have social media accounts
and departments for following the social media
about their business sectors. In recent decade,
the studies on sentiment analysis has gained high
popularity and several academic (Pang and Lee,
2007; Liu, 2012) and commercial (Radian6, 2013;
Lithium, 2013) projects emerged in this field. Al-
though there are many works (Bosco et al, 2013;
Wiebe et al, 2005) on creating sentiment corpora,
up to our knowledge there are no publicly avail-
able and professional sentiment annotation tools.
A huge contact center communicates with the
customers for different trade marks on behalf
of them and provides detailed CRM1, impact
1CRM: Customer Relationship Management
and competitor analysis reports. With this pur-
pose, they employ thousands of customer rep-
resentatives among which an increasing percent-
age should deal with social media monitoring, the
new channel of communication. In such an envi-
ronment, the monitoring should be done via pro-
fessional and synchronous UIs (user interfaces)
where the performance of each human agent has
high importance. Most of the current commercial
monitoring tools leaks the following features:
- a detailed sentiment analysis interface for
feature based and comparative opinion dec-
larations,
- an effective and synchronous annotation in-
terface,
- on-demand data loading,
- linguistic annotation modules,
- detailed data analyses for corpus creation (to
be used in supervised machine learning).
The aim of our work is to fulfill all of the above
listed requirements and provide a platform for ef-
fective annotation of social media data. The tool
has the following sentiment and linguistic annota-
tion layers:
- general and target based sentiment
- text normalization
- named entity
- morphology
- syntax
The sentiment annotation module of TURK-
SENT may operate multilingually whereas the lin-
guistic annotation module is initially configured
131
specific to Turkish following the work in ITU
Treebank Annotation Tool (Eryig?it, 2007). It is
also possible to adapt this part to other languages
by plugging relevant linguistic adapters (for semi-
automatic annotation).
TURKSENT will be freely available for aca-
demic projects as a SaaS.
Figure 1: Application Flow
2 Architecture
Figure 1 gives an idea about the flow of our appli-
cation. In our system, the web data is monitored
continuously. It is first of all filtered according
to the target sector by the ?sector filter? and it is
then stored in the relevant database domains. In
our system, each domain represents a workspace
which consists of the related sector data (collected
via web or uploaded manually to the system), an
administrator and a bunch of human annotators.
2.1 Sentiment Annotation
Our choice of SaaS design has the following goals:
- Platform independence (No special machine
or no special operating system)
- Accessibility (Accessible from anywhere
anytime by multiple users)
- No installation effort (Browser based appli-
cation)
- No need to deploy updates to clients
Figure 2 gives a sample sentiment annota-
tion screen-shot on an example Tweet (?Samsung
Galaxy S4?s hardware features are amazing but
software is not stable as Iphone?). The upper
half of the screen (up to the table) show the gen-
eral sentiment part which is tagged as both2 (the
ambivalent smiley). General sentiment tagging
means identifying the sentimental class regardless
of a target. In other words, extracting dominant
sentimental class of an instance. In this stage the
annotator is also expected to select an appropriate
comment category and sentence type.
The lower half is for target based sentiment an-
notation. These deep sentiments are represented
as tuples consisting of the brand, product/service,
feature and sentiment tags. For example, the first
tuple in the sample Tweet will be composed as
the following: <Samsung, Galaxy S4, hardware,
positive>which means the hardware feature of the
Samsung Brand?s product Galaxy S4 had a posi-
tive impact on the Tweet?s author.
2.2 Linguistic Annotation
Recent researches on sentiment analysis show that
it is not possible to really understand the sentiment
of a sentence without any natural language pro-
cessing (NLP). And the addition of NLP features
to these systems increases the success ratios of
the automatic analyzers dramatically. In order to
be able to prepare a sentiment corpus, being able
to annotate the focus data within the same plat-
form is an important issue. Furthermore, the web
data has severe differences when compared to for-
mal natural language text and it needs additional
preprocessing before linguistic phases. With this
need, we added a linguistic annotation interface to
our application which is basically a reimplementa-
tion and adaptation of a previous academic study
(Eryig?it, 2007) according to our needs.
In this layer, the linguistic expert annotator is
asked to first normalize the instances (i.e. mis-
spellings, exaggerations, web jargon), and then de-
termine the entities (ex: ?Galaxy S4?), select the
appropriate postag categories for words and anno-
tate the syntactic parts of a post. It is also possible
to operate this layer semi-automatically by using
the pretrained linguistic tools and outputting their
2Other options are: positive, negative and neutral(no sen-
timental expression at all).

results to the human experts and taking their cor-
rections. This speed-up procedure is only avail-
able for Turkish now, but the tool is developed as
a pluggable architecture to support further studies
on other languages. Figure 3 shows some sample
screenshots for the linguistic layer.
2.3 Administrative Operations
TURKSENT has a simple and easy-to-use admin
interface. A user who has administration rights has
the ability to perform the actions listed below:
- Creating a workspace (with a focus data and
annotator group)
- Determining the data subsets for linguistic
annotation
- Controlling/Changing the ongoing annota-
tions
- Defining configurable items (sentence types,
comment categories, product/service list, fea-
ture list, brand list)
- Defining linguistic tags (pos tags, named en-
tity types, dependency types)
3 Usability
The usability is seriously taken into account dur-
ing the design and development of our application.
The spent time per post is a high concern within
big operations. End-user software tests are accom-
plished and observed for each step. On the final
UI design, every action can be done via keyboard
without the need of mouse usage. Almost every
text areas has strong auto-completion feature in it-
self. While an annotator is working on an issue,
it is possible to deliver any idea-suggestion to the
administrator within seconds. And if an annotator
need to browse his/her previous annotations, can
easily search and find within them.
4 Conclusion
In this work, we presented a professional sen-
timent annotation tool TURKSENT which sup-
ports synchronous annotations on a web-based
platform. The study is a part of an automatic sen-
timent analysis research project. That is why, it
both aims to manually annotate the sentiments of
web posts and to create a sentiment corpus also
annotated linguistically (to be used in automatic
133

sentiment analysis). With this purpose it consists
different layers of annotation specific to web data.
It serves as a SaaS and designed as dynamic as
possible for future use on different sectors and lan-
guages.
