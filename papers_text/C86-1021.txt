1 Introduction 
The interlingual approach to MT has been repeatedly 
advocated  by researchers  o r ig ina l ly  in teres ted  Jn 
natura l  language unders tand ing  who take mach ine  
translation to be one possible application. However, 
not only the ambiguity but also the vagueness which 
every natura l  language inev i tab ly  has leads this 
approach into essent ia l  d i f f icu l t ies .  In contrast, 
our project,  the Mu-pro ject ,  adopts  the t rans fer  
approach as the basic  f ramework  of MT. This  paper 
describes the detailed const ruct ion  of the t ransfer  
phase of our system from Japanese  to Engl ish, and 
gives some examples of problems which seem difficult 
to treat in the interlJngual approach. 
The basic design principles of the transfer phase of 
our sys tem have a l ready been ment ioned  in (i) (2). 
Some of the pr inc ip les  wh ich  are re levant  to the 
topic of this paper are: 
(a)Multiple Layer of Grammars 
(b)Multiple Layer Presentation 
(c) Lexicon Driven Processing 
(d) Form-Oriented Dictionary Description 
This paper a lso shows how these pr inc ip les  are 
realized in the current system. 
2 The Construction of the Transfer Phase 
The t ransfer  phase of our system consists  of the 
following three sub-phases (Fig. i). 
Pre-Transfer Phase (Pre-TP) 
Main Transfer Phase (MTP) 
Pc st -Transfer Phase (Post-TP) 
f-re-Transfer p .ha . : , l -~  Ma in Transfer Phase ~ P:st-Transfer :has J 
Fig. I. Construction of the Transfer Phase 
Analys is  resul ts  'of input sentences  of the source 
language (SL) are represented  in the fo rm of 
annotated  tree structures,  f rom wh ich  one can 
retrieve various levels of information contained in 
the input sentences. The MTP is performed recursively 
f rom the top of the tree to the bot tom (Fig. 2). At 
each  s tep  of the recurs ion ,  the sub-s t ruc ture  
governed by a node (current node, node X ira Fig. 2) 
is transferr(~d to the corresponding structure of the 
target language (TL). This phase main ly  per fo rms 
lexJcal tran~'{fer, that is, it chooses an appropriate 
target lexical  i tem for node X by examin ing  the 
annotation parts of that node and its dependent nodes 
(nodes  YI,..Y2,..Yn). The se lec t ion  of a ta rget  
lexical  i tem may place certa in const ra ins  on the 
transfer of the dependent nodes. These constrains are 
expressed  as proper ty -va lue  pairs and added to the 
annotation parts of the dependent nodes, which are to 
be u t i l i zed  in the subsequent  recurs ion  steps. For 
language pairs  such as Japanese and Engl ish  wh ich  
belong to quite different language families, however, 
the lexical  t ransfer  is not so s t ra ight forward.  It 
often happens that single lexical  i tems of SL 
cor respond to complex  (-~xpressions of TL and vice 
versa. Fur thermore ,  certa in  s t ruc tura l  changes are 
also required. 
Because the MTP recursively transfers sub-structures 
governed by single nodes, certa in  g lobal  s t ructura l  
differences cannot be naturally treated. Such global 
changes are deal t with by the Pre-TP and Pest-TP sub- 
phases (See section 7) .

3 The Form-Or iented Dict ionatz  and Lexical Transfer  
of Nouns 
The fo l lowing four co lumns are provided in the form- 
oriented bi l ingual  dict ionary of nouns (Fig. 3). The 
descr ip t ion  of each  co lumn is expanded in to  
corresponding types of lexical rule (i.e. GRADE rules 
wh ich  are s to red  in the d ic t ionar ies  and invoked  at  
spec i f ied  process ing  phases  : GRADE is the 
programming language for wr i t ing grammar  rules used 
in our project).

Even major  par ts -o f - speech  such  as nouns  need not 
cor respond between two languages .  Cer ta in  Japanese  
nouns  cor respond to words  of d i f fe rent  par ts -o f -  
speech in Eng l i sh ,  depend ing  on the sur round ing  
context. 
Ex-I :~ 0) $~ - - ->  wooden desk 
(tree) (desk)

( interact ion)  (input) 
However ,  the same nouns  should  be t rans la ted  as 
nouns in Engl~sh in contexts such as : 
Ex-2. :/g 0) ~ - - ->  growth of t rees 
(tree) (growth) 
~(~ 0) ~U,~ - - ->  advantage of interaction

This indicates that: 
if '~ '  is used as a noun a~ifier 
and the case relation between '9};' and the governor is 'RATerial' 
then the translation equivalent is 'wooden', else 'tree'.

The semant ic  re la t ionsh ips  are not  su f f i c ient  for 
se lec t ing  such prepos J  t ions  appropr ia te ly .  Same 
postpos i t iona l  case par t i c les  shou ld  be t rans la ted  
into d i f fe rent  p repos i t ions ,  even though the deep  
semantic re lat ionships in Japanese are the same (thai: 
is, J apanese  nat ive  speakers  cannot  in tu i t i ve ly

Engl ish native speakers can c lear ly  d i s t ingu ish  the 
semant ic  re la t ionsh ip  of 'results'  and 'ef fects  ~ 
(GOAL or OB JECT  case) f rom that of 'family' and 
'duty' (BENEF IC IARY case), whereas  in Japanese  the 
same postpos i t iona l  case par t i c les  are used and so 
the dist inct ion of the semant ic  re lat ionships is not 
so clear for Japanese natives. We cannot, therefore, 
even expect the stabi l i ty of semant ic  relat ionships 
across the two languages.

(3) Co lumn D : Transfer  based on Col locat ions wi th  
Predicates (Fig. 6) 
Certain combinat ions  of nouns and predicates (verbs, 
ad jec t ives ,  etc.) in Japanese  are t rans la ted  into  
s ing le  words  in Eng l i sh  : the combinat ions  are 
lexical ized by single English words, combinat ions  of 
nouns  and  ad jec t ives ,  fo r  example ,  a re  o f ten  
\].exicalized by single Engl ish adjectives. 
Ex-5. ~ ~{ ~ . . . .  > lustrous 
( luster) (to exist)  
~g ~ ~ .... > ef f i c ient  
(ef f ic iency)  (to be high) 
These combinat ions  can appear in the posit ion of an 
embedded clause and cause structural  changes between 
two languages(Fig.7). Combinat ions  of verbs and their 
case e lements  may also correspond to single Engl ish 
verbs. 
Ex-6. ~ ,~ % ~ . . . . .  > focus 
(focus) (to adjust) 
It also happens that Japanese verbs w i th  wide ranges 
of meaning should be translated into certain Engl ish 
verbs  when co l located  w i th  spec i f i c  nouns. Ru les  
wh ich  choose appropriate Engl ish verbs by referr ing 
to semant ic  class:ifications of case e lements  (nouns) 
are defJ ned as \].exical ru les  in the verb  d ic t ionary  
(See Sect ion  4). However ,  cer ta in  co l locat ions  of 
verbs  and nouns  are so spec i f i c  that cho ices  of 
appropr iate target verbs cannot be expressed by the 
lex ica\ ]  ru les  of verbs  of this type. co lumn D in the 
form-or iented dict ionary of nouns is used to specify 
such col locat ions between nouns and verbs. 
Ex-7. Ih~ll~ %1 ~b W ~ . . . . . . .  > leave a space 
(space) (??) 
The descr ipt ion of this co lumn is not only expanded 
into \ ]ex ica \ ]  ru les  of the nouns  but  a l so  in to  the 
property (J-DIC-DER:V) of those nouns. The values of 
this p roper ty  is a set  of Japanese  pred icates  wh ich  
require special t reatments when they are col located 
wi th  the nouns. When node X ill Fig. 2 is a predicate, 
the ru les  in the main  grammar  check  whether  there  
ex is ts  a dependent  node  whose  proper ty  J-DIC-D\]'\]RIV 
conta ins  the pred icate ,  and i f such a node  exists ,  
they invokes the lexical rules of the corresponding 
nouns. 
In the  dependency  s t ruc tures  produced  by the 
Japanese  ana lys i s  g rammar ,  s imp le  mod i f i ca t ion  of 
nouns by adject ives such as 
Ex-8. ~ i~J . . . . . .  > heavy ra in 
(to be strong, (rain)  
to be b ig,  
to be heavy, etc.) 
are a l so  represented  as embedded c lauses  (Fig. 8), 
and so co lumn D is used to choose  ad jec t ives  in 
English. Note that most  of the combinat ions between 
nouns  and  appropr ia te  ad jec t ives  are  h igh ly  
convent iona l i zed  in each language and so it is hard  
to imagine the conceptual pr imi t ives  for adjectives 
that could be language independent.

Modif iers 
We have severa l  words  of minor  par ts -o f - speech  in 
Japanese  wh ich  rough ly  cor respond to determiners ,  
quantif iers, etc. Jn English. A lmost  the same kind of 
in format ion as column D is specif ied in this column 
for these words. 
4 The Form-Or iented Dict ionary and Lexical  Transfer 
of Verbs 
When the node  X in Fig. 2 is a verb  or  an ad jec t ive ,  
the transfer g rammar  for predicates is invoked. If it 
dose not exist:, the other rule in the grammar  invokes 
the lex ica l  ru les  der ived  f rom the fo rm-or iented  
dict ionary of the predicate (node X). By examin ing the 
annotat ion parts of that node and its dependents, the 
lexJcal rules of a predicate may determine 
(\]) the trans\].ation equivalent in Engl ish 
(2) the deep case re lat ionship and surface ease maker  
of those  dependents  s t r i c t ly  governed  by the 
predicate. 
If a Japanese  pred icate  is rea l ly  ambiguous ,  a 
separate  case f rame is p rov ided  for each of its 
meanings. The Japanese analysis g rammar  d isambiguates  
the meaning and a separate lexical entry is prepared 
in the bi l ingual  dictionary, i.e. di f ferent meanings 
of a predicate are treated as di f ferent lexica\], items 
99 
in the transfer phase. However, the real prob lems in 
t rans la t ion  is not  caused  by ~mbigu i ty  such  as th i s  
but by vagueness of meaning. When we treat a language 
pa i r  such  as Japanese  and  Eng l i sh ,  it is not  
except ional  but rather usual that a verb of SL has to 
be t rans la ted  in to  d i f fe rent  ta rget  lex ica l  
i tems,  even  though the nat ive  speakers  of  SL cannot  
clearly real ize the meaning difference. 
Ex-8. ~ ~ J z~ . . . .  > ~ the performance 
(performance) 
9~ ~ _L~ . . . .  > increase the speed 
(speed) 
~K~i~ ~ \ ] zC f~ .... > raise the water surface 
(water sur face)  
The above  three  usages  of the verb ' ~  ' are 
cont inuous  in the sense  that  al l  of them have the 
core mean ing  in common.  If we cons idered  them as 
di f ferent meanings, the Japanese verb ' ~ '  wou ld  
have p lenty  of d i f fe rent  mean ings  and be a h igh ly  
ambiguous word. Note that the Engl ish verb 'to wear' 
shou ld  be t rans la ted  into more  than  f ive d i f fe rn t  
Japanese  verbs  depend ing  on what  is to be worn.  'To 
wear  shoes', 'to wear a watch', 'to wear spectacles', 
etc. shou ld  al l  be t rans la ted  d i f fe rent ly .  These  
facts show that it is impossible to establ ish the set 
of lex ica l  i tems of the in ter l ingua .  In our system,  
then, these 'translationally ambiguous' lexical i tems 
are treated in the transfer phase. 
The form-or iented dict ionary of verbs is shown in

Fig.10 shows that the schemat ic  construct ion of the 
MTP. The subst ructure  governed  by the node X is 
t ransferred recurs ively  by an appropriate subgrammar,  
depend ing  on the proper t ies  of that  node. For  
simplicity, only the subgrammars  for ma in  clauses and 
noun phrases  are  shown in deta i l .  The  b locks  
sur rounded by bo ld  l ines  in th i s  f igure  are those  
wh ich  are per fo rmed by lex ica l  ru les  descr ibed  in 
sect ion  3 and 4. The lex ica l  ru les  are invoked  at 
the beg inn ing  of the subgrammars ,  because  they are 
the ru les  for t reat ing  id iosyncrat i c  phenomena 
specif ic to lexical i tems and are appl ied before the 
other, moregenera l  rules are applied. Constra ints  on 
some of the dependent nodes such as syntact ic forms 
(a prepos i t iona l  phrase  w i th  a spec i f i c

The genera l  ru les  are fu r ther  d iv ided  in to  the 
fo l lowing two categor ies : 
(i) Ru les  in the case when the deep case  
re la t ion  between the node Wi and the governor  (the 
node X) is un ique ly  determined by the ana lys i s  
g rammar  : They determine the surface prepos i t ion  of 
Engl ish by referr ing to the deep case interpretation, 
the surface case marker of Japanese, and the lexica\] 
item and the semant ic  markers at tached to the node W. 
1 
(55 semant ic  markers  are used in our sys tem to 
classify Japanese nouns) . 
(2) Rules in the case when the deep case re lat ion is 
not uniquely determined in the analysis phase : They 
determine  the prepos i t ion  jus t  by re fer r ing  to the 
sur face  case marker  of Japanese .  The prepos i t ion  
rough ly  cor respond ing  t:O the Japanese  sur face  case  
marker  is selected. 
The above  two categor ies  of ru les  are jus t  rough 
c \ ]ass i f icat \ [ons and, in reality, more detai led rules 
are prepared  for each Japanese  case marker .  In 
particular, there are several type 2 rules for each 
surface case marker  which  take into account the set 
of poss ib le  case  in terpretat ions  g iven  by the 
ana lys i s  phase. 
Thus ,  tl~e dependent  nodes  of a pred icate  are  
transferred by several kinds of rules with di f fer ing 
pre ferences  in o rder  to u t i l i ze  as much of the

express ions is highly dependent on language pairs and 
so should be treated in the transfer phase. 
7 The Structural  Transfer 
The MTP t rans fers  Japanese  s t ructures  in to  
cor respond ing  Eng l i sh  s t ructures  recurs ive \ ]y  by 
t ravers ing  the Sapanese  ana lys i s  t rees  (dependerlcy 
trees) f rom the top te tbe bot tom.  The order  of 
process ing is })re-determined by the dependency trees 
given by the analysis phase. If the substructures are 
changed unexpectedly  durLng the recursion, the upper 
\]eve\] of recursi ve process ing cannot respond to the 
change ; if it could,  tee ru les  wh ich  cbeck  the 
results of the transfer of the substructures and take 
appropr iate act ions wou ld  need ko be provided, mak ing  
the const ruct ion  of subgrammars  unnecessar i l y  
complicated.

There  are pa i rs  of s te reotyp iba l  sentence  sty\] es J n 
the two  languages  wh ich  cannot  be t rans la ted  by 
phrase- to -phrase  trans\]ation.

in Engl J  sh. Ru les  are prepared  in Pre-TP,  wh ich

constructions. 
Ex-11AtZW$~a~12t~<,  B_~. . . .8~6 
-- -> not only h is ~ but also B is "o" 
Because  the c lues  of such s tereotyp ica l  sentence  
pat terns  are embedded deep ly  in the ana lys i s  t rees  
(see Fig.14) and resu l tant  t ree  s t ruc tures  of the 
transfer phase become quite di f ferent from those of 
the analysis phase, it is dif f icult  for the recursive 
processing in MTP to treat them. 
The two phases, Pre-TP and Post-TP, are provided for 
such global structural  changes. In these two phases, 
each rule traverses the whole tree independently in 
order to find where the rule is applicable. 
8 Pre-Transfer  Phase 
In this phase, certain structures in Japanese which 
do not  have  d i rec t  Eng l i  sh equ iva lents  a re  
t rans formed in to  more  Eng l i sh -or iented  structures. 
For example, the fo l lowing structural t ransformat ion 
(Fig. 12) is taken  p lace ,  because  Japanese  
quant i f ie rs  such  as ~b ~ (many,  much) ,  ~f~b~ (few, 
l i tt le) etc. can be  used as pred icates  but Eng l i sh  
quant i f ie rs  cannot.

Fur thermore ,  the fo l low ing  s t ruc tures  in Japanese  
are treated.  
(i) Subordinate clauses which should be expressed by 
adverbs or preposit ional  phrases in Engl ish : 
Ex-13 
(to pay attention to) (machine) (to control) 
. . . . . . . . . . . .  > to control (the) machine carefully 
A subord inate  c lause  w i th  a pred icate  of 'TE'- form 
(~, \ [~7\ [  - to pay attent ion to) is usual ly expressed 
in Engl lsh as a subordinate clause w i th  a conjunct ion 
such as 'while', 'when' etc. or  a par t i c ip le  c lause.  
However, when the predicate of the subordinate clause 
is a verb of a certain type, the clause expresses the 
'manner'  case of the main  c lause  and it shou ld  be 
Such s t ruc tura l  t rans format ions  are often required 
in the t rans la t ion  of Japanese  into Engl ish .  Some 
complex expressions which contain subordinate clauses 
or embedded c lauses  are used in Japanese  only for 
expressing deep case relationships. 
(A with a subject  marker)(cause) (to become) 
. . . . .  > (d i rect  t rans la t  ion) 
Because 'A' becomes the cause . . . . . . .  
(deep interpretation) 
'h '  f i l l s  the deep case 'cause' of 
the main c lause --> 'by'  
Because  d i rec t  t rans la t ions  of these  express ions  
result in c lumsy English, they are reduced into much 
simpler structures in the transfer phase (Fig. 13).

two  languages  such  as g iven  in Ex - l l  cannot  be
