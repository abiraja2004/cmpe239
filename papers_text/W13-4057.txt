Abstract
The demo shows Wikipedia-based open-
domain information access dialogues with
a talking humanoid robot. The robot uses
face-tracking, nodding and gesturing to
support interaction management and the
presentation of information to the partner.
1 Introduction
The demo shows open-domain information access
dialogues with the WikiTalk system on a Nao
humanoid robot (Jokinen and Wilcock, 2012b).
An annotated video of the demo can be seen

The WikiTalk system can be viewed from two
complementary perspectives: as a spoken dialogue
system or as a question-answering (QA) system.
Viewed as a spoken dialogue system, WikiTalk
supports constructive interaction for talking about
interesting topics (Jokinen and Wilcock, 2012a).
However, using Wikipedia as its knowledge source
instead of a finite database means that WikiTalk
is completely open-domain. This is a significant
breakthrough compared with traditional closed-
domain spoken dialogue systems.
Viewed as a QA system, WikiTalk provides
Wikipedia-based open-domain knowledge access
(Wilcock, 2012). However, by using sentences
and paragraphs from Wikipedia, the system is able
to talk about the topic in a conversational manner,
thus differing from a traditional QA system.
The Nao robot prototype version of WikiTalk
was implemented by Csapo et al (2012) during
eNTERFACE 2012, the 8th International Summer
Workshop on Multimodal Interfaces at Supe?lec in
Metz (Figure 1). The humanoid robot uses face-
tracking, nodding and gesturing to support interac-
tion management and the presentation of new in-
formation to the partner (Han et al, 2012; Meena
et al, 2012).

2 Outline of the system
At the heart of the system (Figure 2) is a conver-
sation manager based on a finite state machine.
However, the states are not based on the domain-
specific tasks and utterences for a fixed domain.
In WikiTalk, the states function at a more abstract
dialogue management level dealing for example
with topic initiation, topic continuation, and topic
switching. Further details of this approach are
given by Wilcock (2012).
The finite state machine also has extensions that
store various parameters of past interactions and
influence the functionality of the state machine.
The conversation manager communicates with a
Wikipedia manager to obtain information from
Wikipedia, and a Nao manager to map its states
onto the actions of the robot.
To enable the robot to react to various events
while getting information from Wikipedia, the
Nao manager registers events and alerts the appro-
priate components of the system when anything of
interest occurs either on the inside or the outside
of the system. Figure 2 shows three examples of

event handling within the Nao Talk module which
drives the robot?s speech functionality. The func-
tions isSaying(), startOfParagraph(),
and endOfSentence() are called periodically
by the Nao manager, and return True whenever the
robot is talking, reaches the start of a paragraph, or
finishes a sentence, respectively. Whenever such
events occur, the Nao manager can trigger appro-
priate reactions, for example, through the Gestures
module which drives the robot?s nodding and ges-
turing functionalities.
The history of the user?s interactions is stored in
a statistics dictionary in the conversation manager.
Using a set of simple heuristics, it is possible to
create more interesting dialogues by ensuring that
the robot does not give the same instructions to the
user in the same way over and over again, and by
varying the level of sophistication in terms of the
functionalities that are introduced to the user by
the robot. For example, at first the robot gives sim-
ple instructions, allowing the user to practice and
understand the basic functionalities of the system.
For more advanced users, the system suggests new
kinds of use cases which may not have previously
been known to the user.
A corpus of videos of user trials with the system
(Figure 3) was collected at the eNTERFACE 2012
workshop. The user trials and user questionnaires
were used for system evaluation, which is reported
by Anastasiou et al (2013).
3 Outline of the demo
The demo is deliberately live, unscripted, and im-
provised. However, it typically starts with the
robot in a sitting position. The robot stands up and
greets the user, then asks what topic the user wants
to hear about. The robot suggests some of its own
favourite topics.
When the user selects a topic, the system gets
information about the topic from Wikipedia and
divides it into chunks suitable for spoken dialogue
contributions. The system then manages the spo-
ken presentation of the chunks according to the
user?s reactions. If the user asks for more, or oth-
erwise shows interest in the topic, the system con-
tinues with the next chunk.
Crucially, the system makes smooth topic shifts
by following the hyperlinks in Wikipedia when-
ever the user repeats the name of one of the
links. For example, if the system is talking about
Shakespeare and says ?Shakespeare was born in
Stratford-upon-Avon?, the user can say ?Stratford-
upon-Avon?? and the system smoothly switches
topics and starts talking about Stratford-upon-
Avon using the Wikipedia information about this
new topic.
The user can ask for any chunk to be repeated,
or go back to the previous chunk. The user can
also interrupt the current chunk and ask to skip to
another chunk on the same topic.

Figure 3: Testing spoken interaction with Nao.
The user can interrupt the robot at any time by
touching the top of the robot?s head. The robot
stops talking and explicitly acknowledges the in-
terruption by saying ?Oh sorry!? and waiting for
the user?s input. The user can then tell it to con-
tinue, to go back, to skip to another chunk, or to
switch to a new topic.
The dialogue is open-domain and typically
wanders freely from topic to topic by smooth topic
shifts following the links in Wikipedia. However,
if the user wants to jump to an entirely unrelated
topic, an awkward topic shift can be made by say-
ing the command ?Alphabet!? and spelling the
first few letters of the new topic using a spelling
alphabet (Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, etc.).
As well as talking about topics selected by the
user, the robot can take the initiative by suggesting
potentially interesting new topics. One way to do
this is by using the ?Did you know ...?? sections
from Wikipedia that are new every day.
The demo ends when the user tells the robot to
stop. The robot thanks the user and sits down.

IEEE International Conference on Cognitive Info-
communications (CogInfoCom 2012).
