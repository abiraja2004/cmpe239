Abstract
Noun phrases (NP) in a product review are
always considered as the product attribute
candidates in previous work. However, this
method limits the recall of the product at-
tribute extraction. We therefore propose
a novel approach by generalizing syntactic
structures of the product attributes with two
strategies: intuitive heuristics and syntactic
structure similarity. Experiments show that
the proposed approach is effective.
1 Introduction
Product attribute extraction is a fundamental task of
sentiment analysis. It aims to extract the product at-
tributes from a product review, such as ?picture qual-
ity? in the sentence ?The picture quality of Canon is
perfect.? This task is usually performed in two steps:
product attribute candidate extraction and candidate
classification.
Almost all the previous work pays more attention
to the second step, fewer researchers make in-depth
research on the first step. They simply choose the
NPs in a product review as the product attribute can-
didates (Hu and Liu, 2004; Popescu and Etzioni,
2005; Yi et al, 2003). However, this method lim-
its the recall of the product attribute extraction for
two reasons. First, there exist other structures of the
product attributes except NPs. Second, the syntactic
parsing is not perfect, especially for the Non-English
languages, such as Chinese. Experiments on three
Chinese datasets1 show that nearly 15% product at-
tributes are lost, when only using NPs as the can-
didates. Obviously, if using the candidate classifi-
cation techniques on these NP candidates, it would

lead to poor performance (especially for recall) for
the final product attribute extraction.
Based on the above discussion, it can be observed
that product attribute candidate extraction is well
worth studying. In this paper, we propose an ap-
proach by generalizing the syntactic structures of the
product attributes to solve this problem. Figure 1
lists some syntactic structure samples from an an-
notated corpus, including the special forms of NPs
in Figure 1(a) and other syntactic structures, such as
VP or IP in Figure 1(b). We can find that the syntac-
tic structures can not only cover more phrase types
besides NP, but also describe the detailed forms of
the product attributes.

In order to exploit more and useful syntactic struc-
tures, two generalization strategies: intuitive heuris-
tics and syntactic structure similarity are used. Ex-
periments on three Chinese domain-specific datasets
show that our approach can significantly improve the
recall of the product attribute candidate extraction,
and furthermore, improve the performance of the fi-
nal product attribute extraction.

2 Approach
The standard syntactic structures of the product at-
tributes can be collected from a training set2. Then
a simple method of exact matching can be used to
select the product attribute candidates from the test
set. In particular, for a syntactic structure3 T in
the test set, if T exactly matches with one of the
standard syntactic structures, then its corresponding
string can be treated as a product attribute candidate.
However, this method fails to handle similar syn-
tactic structures, such as the two structures in Fig-
ure 2. Besides, this method treats the syntactic struc-
ture as a whole during exact matching, without con-
sidering any structural information. Therefore, it is
difficult to describe the syntactic structure informa-
tion explicitly. All of these prevent this method from
generalizing unseen data well.
To overcome the above problems, two generaliza-
tion strategies are proposed in this paper. One is to
generalize the syntactic structures with two intuitive
heuristics. The other is to deeply mine the syntactic
structure by decomposing it into several substruc-
tures. Both strategies will be introduced in the fol-
lowing subsections.
2.1 Intuitive Heuristics
Two intuitive heuristics are adopted to generalize the
syntactic structures.
Heu1: For the near-synonymic grammar tags in
syntactic structures, we can generalize them by a
normalized one. Such as the red boxes in Figure 2,
the POSs ?NNS? and ?NN? show the same syntactic
meaning, we can generalize ?NNS? with ?NN?. The
near-synonymic grammar tags are listed in Table 1.

one. The reason is that the sequential grammar tags
always describe the same syntactic function as one
grammar tag. Such as the blue circles in Figure 2.
2.2 Syntactic Structure Similarity
The heuristic generalization strategy is too restric-
tive to give a good coverage. Moreover, after this
kind of generalization, the syntactic structure is used
as a whole in exact matching all the same. Thus,
as an alternative to the exact matching, tree kernel
based methods can be used to implicitly explore the
substructures of the syntactic structure in a high-
dimensional space. This kind of methods can di-
rectly calculate the similarity between two substruc-
ture vectors using a kernel function. Tree kernel
based methods are effective in modeling structured
features, which are widely used in many natural
language processing tasks, such as syntactic pars-
ing (Collins and Duffy, 2001) and semantic role la-
beling (Che et al, 2008) and so on.

Figure 3: Substructures from a syntactic structure.
In this paper, the syntactic structure for a product
attribute can be decomposed into several substruc-
tures, such as in Figure 3. Correspondingly, the syn-
tactic structure T can be represented by a vector of
integer counts of each substructure type:
?(T ) = (?1(T ), ?2(T ), ..., ?n(T ))
= (# of substructures of type 1,
= # of substructures of type 2,
...,
= # of substructures of type n)
378
After syntactic structure decomposition, we can
count the number of the common substructures as
the similarity between two syntactic structures. The
commonly used convolution tree kernel is applied in
this paper. Its kernel function is defined as follows:
K(T1, T2) = ??(T1),?(T2)?
=
?
i(?i(T1) ? ?i(T2))
Based on these, for a syntactic structure T in the
test set, we can compute the similarity between T
and all the standard syntactic structures by the above
kernel function. A similarity threshold thsim4 is set
to determine whether the string from T is a correct
product attribute candidate.
3 Experiments
3.1 Datasets and Evaluation Metrics
Three domain-specific datasets are used in the ex-
periments, which is from an official Chinese Opin-
ion Analysis Evaluation 2008 (COAE2008) (Zhao et
al., 2008). Table 2 shows the statistics of the three
datasets, each of which is divided into training, de-
velopment and test data in a proportion of 2:1:1.

Car 2,166 2,504
Phone 2,196 2,293
Table 2: The datasets for three product domains.
Two evaluation metrics, recall and noise ratio, are
designed to evaluate the performance of the prod-
uct attribute candidate extraction. Recall refers to
the proportion of correctly identified attribute candi-
dates in all standard product attributes. Noise ratio
refers to the proportion of incorrectly identified at-
tribute candidates in all candidates.
3.2 Comparative methods
We choose the method, which considers NPs as the
product attribute candidates, as the baseline (shown
as NPs based).
Besides, in order to assess the two generaliza-
tion strategies? effectiveness, four experiments are
designed as follows:
4In the experiments, thsim is set to 0.7, which is tuned on
the development set.
SynStru based: It refers to the syntactic struc-
ture exact matching method, which is implemented
without the two proposed generation strategies.
SynStru h: It refers to the strategy only using the
first generalization.
SynStru kernel: It refers to the strategy only us-
ing the second generalization.
SynStru h+kernel: It refers to the strategy us-
ing both two generalizations, i.e., it refers to our ap-
proach in this paper.
3.3 Results
Table 3 lists the comparative performances on the
test data between our approach and the comparative
methods for product attribute candidate extraction.

Table 3: Comparisons between our approach and the
comparative methods for product attribute candidate ex-
traction.
Analyzing the recalls in Table 3, we can find that:
1. The performance of SynStru based method
is better than NPs based method for each domain.
This can illustrate that syntactic structures can cover
more forms of the product attributes. However, the
recall of SynStru based method is not high, either.
2. The two generalization strategies, SynStru h
and SynStru kernel can both significantly improve
the performance for each domain, comparing to the
SynStru based method. This can illustrate that our
two generalization strategies are helpful.
3. Our approach SynStru h+kernel achieves the
best performance. This can illustrate that the two
generalization strategies are complementary to each
379
other. And further, mining and generalizing the syn-
tactic structures is effective for candidate extraction.
However, the noise ratio for each domain is in-
creasing when employing our approach. That?s be-
cause, more kinds of syntactic structures are consid-
ered, more noise is added. However, we can easily
remove the noise in the candidate classification step.
Thus in the next section, we will assess our candi-
date extraction approach by applying it to the prod-
uct attribute extraction task.
4 Application in Product Attribute
Extraction
For the extracted product attribute candidates, we
train a maximum entropy (ME) based binary clas-
sifier to find the correct product attributes. Several
commonly used features are listed in Table 4.

(Y/N) Is there an English word or number in the PA?
Table 4: The feature set for product attribute extraction.
Table 5 shows the product attribute extraction per-
formances on the test data. We can find that the
performance (F1) of our approach is better than
NPs based method for each domain. We discuss the
results as follows:
1. Comparing to the NPs based method, the re-
call of our approach increases a lot for each domain.
This demonstrates that generalized syntactic struc-
tures can cover more forms of product attributes.
2. Comparing to the NPs based method, the pre-
cision of our approach also increases for each do-
main. That?s because syntactic structures are more
specialized than the phrase forms (such as NP, VP)
in the previous work, which can filter some noises
from the phrase(NP) candidates.

extract the product attribute candidates from product

that our approach is promising. In future, we will try
more syntactic structure generalization strategies.
