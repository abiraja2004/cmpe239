Abstract
Stylometric analysis of prose is typically lim-
ited to classification tasks such as authorship
attribution. Since the models used are typi-
cally black boxes, they give little insight into
the stylistic differences they detect. In this
paper, we characterize two prose genres syn-
tactically: chick lit (humorous novels on the
challenges of being a modern-day urban fe-
male) and high literature. First, we develop
a top-down computational method based on
existing literary-linguistic theory. Using an
off-the-shelf parser we obtain syntactic struc-
tures for a Dutch corpus of novels and measure
the distribution of sentence types in chick-lit
and literary novels. The results show that liter-
ature contains more complex (subordinating)
sentences than chick lit. Secondly, a bottom-up
analysis is made of specific morphological and
syntactic features in both genres, based on the
parser?s output. This shows that the two gen-
res can be distinguished along certain features.
Our results indicate that detailed insight into
stylistic differences can be obtained by com-
bining computational linguistic analysis with
literary theory.
1 Introduction
The gap between literary theory and computational
practice is still great. Despite pleas for a more inte-
grated approach (e.g., Ramsay, 2003), and sugges-
tions from literary theorists (e.g., Roque, 2012), lit-
erary theory is more often used for illustrative or
explicative purposes, rather than as a basis for com-
putational analysis. The hermeneutic nature of most
literary theory is a valid cause for caution, as it is not

easy to ?translate? discursive arguments into the strict
rules a computer needs. Too many intermediary steps
are required, if a translation is possible at all.
We therefore take a different approach in this paper.
Instead of building on hermeneutic theory, we use a
literary-linguistic theory about syntactic structures
as a basis for developing a computational method
for prose genre analysis; in this paper we will focus
on chick-lit and literary novels. Because of this tight
connection between theory and method, these usually
separate sections are combined. In addition to this
top-down approach, we report bottom-up findings
based on syntactic features encountered in the data.
These complementary results will be used to further
analyze and interpret genre differences, as opposed
to author style. Our aim is not text categorization,
but to describe the genres from a syntactic point of
view.
We have chosen the genres of chick lit and litera-
ture, because many readers have intuitive notions on
differences between them. In this paper we want to
find out whether it is possible to retrace these notions
72
in syntactic properties of the texts, by addressing the
following questions: (i) are there differences in the
distribution of sentence types between chick lit and
literary novels, (ii) is the intuitive notion that chick lit
is easier to read reflected in a tendency towards sim-
ple sentence structures rather than complex ones? In
answering these questions, two methodological goals
are achieved simultaneously: we discover how a spe-
cific literary-linguistic theory can be transformed to
a computational method and we explore how well
the output of a statistical parser facilitates such an
investigation.
This study is a first exploration in a project called
The Riddle of Literary Quality,1 which aims to find
patterns in the texts of Dutch current-day novels,
that relate to the distinction between high-brow and
low-brow literature. Deep syntactic structures as re-
searched in the present paper are an important aspect
of this investigation.
2 Theory and method
According to linguists Leech and Short (1981) syn-
tactic structure is one of the grammatical features
that can be taken into account when analyzing the
style of prose texts. To this end, they make a divi-
sion between six basic sentence types, from simple
to parenthetic.
Toolan (2010) applies their theory by close-reading
a paragraph from a short story by Alice Munro. He
suggests that the six sentence types are part of a hi-
erarchy of increasing complexity, a notion we will
explore further by taking a distant reading approach,
namely syntactically analyzing a prose corpus. In
recent computational work on syntactic stylistics by
Feng et al (2012) and van Cranenburgh (2012) com-
putational explorations of deep syntactic structures in
academic and literary writing styles are undertaken
on a similar scale. They make use of a machine learn-
ing methodology in which the results are evaluated
on objective criteria, in this case authorship.
In line with this previous research we want to ex-
amine whether the use of certain types of sentence
structures can inform our understanding of the dif-
ference between two prose genres, chick lit and lit-
erature. As opposed to Feng et al (2012) however,
we do not rely on black box machine learning ap-
1Cf. http://literaryquality.huygens.knaw.nl
proaches. And instead of extracting arbitrary syntac-
tic patterns as in van Cranenburgh (2012), we target
specific syntactic features, based partially on literary-
linguistic theory as well as manual exploration of the
data. To be more specific, the computational tools we
employ deliver syntactic structures by querying the
structures for certain syntactic features. During the
development of our method, we continually verify
our intuitions against the actual data.
To categorize the sentences into types, we devise
two classifications, based on a combination of the
theory developed by Leech and Short (1981) and
Toolan (2010) and computational tests in Feng et al
(2012).
Class I
1. Simple: one main clause, no subordination
on any level in the parse tree
2. Compound: coordination of sentence-level
clauses, no subordination on any level
3. Complex: subordination anywhere in the
sentence, no top-level coordination
4. Complex-compound: coordination on top-
level and subordination
Leech and Short?s definition does not specify whether
non-finite or relative clauses that modify noun
phrases count towards being a complex sentence. Ac-
cording to the ANS (2013), the Dutch standard ref-
erence work on grammar, all sentences with more
than one connection between a subject and predicate
are ?composed,? thus not ?singular? or simple. We
therefore choose to count all subordinating clauses
as making a sentence complex.
See (1)?(4) for examples of each sentence type.2
An (L) indicates a sentence from the literature corpus,
and a (C) a sentence from the chick lit corpus.
Simple sentence:
(1) a. Sjaak schraapte zijn keel. (L)
Sjaak cleared his throat.
b. Mijn kniee?n voelen als pudding. (C)
My knees feel like jelly.
Compound sentence:
(2) Ik had dood kunnen zijn en niemand deed iets. (C)
I could have died and no one did anything.
2These are examples from the novels in our corpus; cf. ta-
ble 1.
73
Complex sentence:
(3) Ik weet ook niet waarom ik op van die hoge hakken
ga shoppen. (C)
I really don?t know why I go shopping on such high
heels.
Complex-compound sentence:
(4) Suzan had een vaag gezoem gehoord terwijl ze bezig
was in de keuken en had voor de zekerheid de deur
opengedaan. (L)
Suzan had heard a vague buzzing while she was busy
in the kitchen and had opened the door to be safe.
The second classification describes the distribution
of several types of complex sentences, based on
Toolan?s hierarchical ordering of complex sentence
types. This concerns sentences consisting of a depen-
dent and main clause at the top level:
Class II
1. Trailing: main clause followed by subordi-
nating clause
2. Anticipatory: subordinating clause fol-
lowed by main clause
3. Parenthetic: subordinating clause interrupt-
ing a main clause
Toolan argues that the complex sentences, especially
the anticipatory and parenthetic ones, are more de-
manding to process than the simple and compound
sentences, because of a disruption in the linear clause-
by-clause processing (Toolan, 2010, p. 321).
This can be explained by two principles: (1)
the principle that theme precedes rheme (originally
called ?Behaghel?s second law?) and (2) the ?complex-
ity principle? (originally ?Law of increasing terms?)
(Behaghel, 1909). The first principle concerns the
content: the less informative or important elements
are placed before what is important or new. Usually,
the new information is introduced by the subordinate
clause and is therefore placed after the main clause.
The second principle argues that generally the more
complex and longer elements??heavier? constituents
containing more words and elaborate syntax?tend to
be placed at the end of the sentence (Behaghel, 1909;
Bever, 1970). These principles also apply to Dutch;
cf. Haeseryn (1997, p. 308) and ANS (2013). With
respect to the content and syntactic dependency, sub-
ordinate clauses are more demanding and complex,
thus at best in this final position.
Trailing sentence
(5) Bo is te dik, omdat Floor hem macaroni voert.
Bo is too fat, because Floor feeds him macaroni.
Anticipatory sentence
(6) Omdat Floor Bo macaroni voert, is hij te dik.
Because Floor feeds Bo macaroni, he is too fat.
Parenthetic sentence
(7) Bo is, omdat Floor hem macaroni voert, te dik.
Bo, because Floor feeds him macaroni, is too fat.
We parse the corpus with the Alpino parser (Bouma
et al, 2001; van Noord, 2006) to obtain syntactic
parse trees (e.g., figure 1). The output of Alpino is in
the form of dependency trees, containing both syn-
tactic categories and grammatical functions. In order
to work with tools based on constituency trees, we
convert any non-local dependencies to discontinuous
constituents, and apply the transformation described
by Boyd (2007) to resolve discontinuities. For exam-
ple, the Dutch equivalent of a phrasal verb such as
?Wake [NP] up? might be parsed as a discontinuous
VP constituent, but will be split up into two sepa-
rate constituents VP*0 and VP*1, bearing an implicit
relation encoded in the label.
In order to categorize the parsed sentences in Class
I and II, we build two different sets of queries: one
for the trees wherein the main clause is a direct child
of the TOP-node, and another for the parsed trees
that introduce an extra node (DU) between the TOP
and the main clause. The former are the ?regular?
sentences that comprise approximately 67 % of the
corpus, the latter are the so-called ?discourse units?
(DUs) that comprise 33 %. DUs incorporate exten-
sions to the sentence nucleus; cf. (8a) and (8b), con-
structions which depend on discourse relations (8c),
and implicit conjunctions (8d).
(8) a. [DU [SMAIN-NUCL dat verbaast me ] , [SAT dat je dat
nog weet ] ]
that surprises me, that you still remember that
b. [DU [SMAIN-TAG Hij verklaarde ] : [SMAIN-NUCL ?Ik
kom niet? ] ]
He declared: ?I won?t come?
c. [DU dus [SMAIN-NUCL Jan gaat naar huis. ] ]
So Jan is going home.
d. (welke kranten lees jij?) [DU [DU-DP bij de lunch de
Volkskrant ] ; [DU-DP s avonds de NRC ]
(which newspapers do you read?) at lunch the Volkskrant;
at night the NRC

Table 1: The corpus
The translation of Alpino-tags into queries is as fol-
lows (van Noord et al, 2011):
1. Categories for main clauses: SMAIN (declaratives), SV1
(verb initial: imperatives, polar questions) and WHQ (wh-
questions).
2. Categories for finite subordinate clauses: SSUB (V-final),
WHSUB (constituent questions), and (WH)REL (relative
clauses).
3. Categories for non-finite subordinate clauses: PPART (per-
fect tense), INF (bare infinitives), TI (to-infinitives), and
OTI (?om te? + inf) when accompanied by the BODY-
function. Without BODY, PPART and INF can also be
part of a simple sentence.
4. Functions used with DU: DP (discourse part), NUCL (sen-
tence nucleus) SAT (?satellite? of the sentence, compa-
rable with subordinate clauses)3 and TAG (tag questions:
?isn?t it??, ?you know??, dialogue markers: ?he said?, etc.)
The query language used is TGrep2 (Rohde, 2005).
For example, we identify simple sentences using the
following query:
TOP !< DU < ( /SMAIN|SV1|WHQ/ !< /CONJ/ )
!<< /WHSUB|SSUB|(PPART|TI|INF)-BODY/
This query matches a TOP node which does not have
a DU child, but does have a SMAIN, SV1, or WHQ
child. This child, in turn, must not have one of the
categories signifying a conjunction or subordinate
clause, at any level.

nucleus and satellite, originally from Rhetorical Structure The-
ory (Mann and Thompson, 1988).

3 Data
Our corpus is composed of 32 Dutch novels, equally
divided between the genres chick lit and literature,
and published between 1991 and 2011, cf. table 1.
These novels were selected from a collection of
ebooks; the number of each set was restricted by
the number of chick-lit novels available. Female and
male writers should ideally be equally represented,
to avoid gender being a possible confounding factor.
Since the chick-lit novels at our disposal were all writ-
ten by women, this was not possible for that genre.
The genre distinctions are based on classifications

by the publisher and reviews on www.chicklit.nl.
For selecting literature we employed an additional
criterion: the writer of the literary novel(s) has had to
be accredited by winning at least one Dutch national
literary prize.
Table 2 lists basic surface characteristics of the
genres. A salient detail is that the literary novels took
significantly longer to parse than the chick-lit nov-
els (p = 0.0001), which cannot be attributed solely
to longer sentence length, because the difference re-
mains when correcting for the cubic time complexity
of parsing?viz. O(nm3), with n the number of sen-
tences, and m average sentence length.
4 Results on sentence types
Table 3 shows the results for Class I. The queries
could classify approximately 60 % out of the 67 %
regular sentences and 24.5 % out of the of 33 %
discourse units into one of these four basic sentence
types. Since DU-sentences often contain multiple
main clauses without an explicit form of conjunction,
it is difficult to define when a sentence is a compound
rather than a complex sentence. Therefore we do not
distinguish between compound and non-compound
for complex DU-sentences, cf. ?DU complex? in
table 3.
The remaining 15.5 % of the sentences in our cor-
pus cannot be classified by our queries and would
therefore fall into a residual category. This is (proba-
bly) due to single-word and verbless sentence frag-
ments that do not fit into any of the categories and
are therefore not captured by any of the formulated
queries.

Figure 2: Overview of sentence tests.
The Class I identification shows that chick-lit au-
thors tend to use more simple sentence structures and
literary writers prefer complex ones, in both regular
and DU-type sentences.4 Although this difference is
not significant for regular sentences, this may have
been caused by the relatively small size of the cor-
pus. In the discourse type-sentences DU complex
(both with and without coordination) does show a
significant difference. DU complex predicts genre
adequately (p = 0.003; cf. figure 4), indicating that
dialogue sentences might be a better predictor for
genre differences than narrative sentences.
The results for Class II identification can be found
in table 4. Although the difference is not signifi-
cant, in chick lit we do find a tendency towards the
use of more trailing sentences, as opposed to more
anticipatory sentences in literary novels. The dif-
ference in use of parenthetic structure is significant
4When taking a closer look at the constituents, the TI, OTI
and BODY-INF clauses are the exception, because they are more
often used in chick-lit novels. TI and OTI introduce to-infinitives,
e.g., I want to sleep, and the BODY-INFs are bare infinitive
clauses. These three are the least complex of the subordinating
clauses.

(p = 0.014), but because of the negligible number of
occurrences, this is not a reliable predictor. Relating
these results to Toolan?s theory that sentence types of
Leech and Short are ordered according to increasing
complexity?i.e., that anticipatory and parenthetic
sentences are more demanding to process and there-
fore more complex?this tendency could be an indi-
cator of a measurably higher syntactic complexity in
literary novels.
In sum, although not significantly different for reg-
ular sentences, the Class I and II identification show
that the genres tend to differ in the distribution of
sentence types and complexity. With more data, the
other tests may show significant differences as well.
Especially the complex discourse units are good pre-
dictors of the two genres. This is crucial as DUs in
general appear to be characteristic of narrative text,
which typically contain extensive dialogue and infor-
mal speech. However, not all dialogue is identified as
a discourse unit, because we did no preprocessing to
identify all sentences in quoted speech as being part
of dialogue. Therefore, the actual amount of dialogue
per novel remains unclear.
5 Results on morphosyntactic features
In addition to to the deep syntactic results based on
the top-down approach, we take a closer look at the
syntactic categories in the generated trees. The re-
sults can be found in figure 3 and table 5.
5.1 Relative clauses
Figure 5 shows a substantial difference in the num-
ber of relative clauses used in literature and chick lit
(p=0.0005). Relative clauses modify noun phrases
to describe or identify them. Therefore the relative
clause makes the NP ?heavier?. The syntax prefers
the relative clause to be placed directly after the NP,

although they may be extraposed for pragmatic rea-
sons. When the NP is a subject, this causes the head
noun of the NP to be distant from the main verb:
(9) De mensen [REL die even eerder nog zo rustig op de vloer
hadden zitten mediteren ], sprongen nu dansend en schree-
uwend om elkaar heen. (L)
The people who just moments before had been meditating
quietly on the floor, were now jumping around each other
dancing and screaming.
The relative clause interrupts the relation between the
subject and the predicate, but to a lesser extent than in
a parenthetic sentence structure. With relative clauses
there is also a disruption of the expected information
flow, and this contributes to making such sentences
more complex to process (Gibson, 1998).
Furthermore, the higher number of relative clauses
in the literary novels makes the sentences more elab-
orate. In Chick lit: the new woman?s fiction Wells
argues a similar point to make a distinction between
the genres:
?[T]he language of chick-lit novels is unremark-
able, in a literary sense. Richly descriptive or poetic
passages, the very bread and butter of literary nov-
els, both historical and contemporary, are virtually
nonexistent in chick lit.? (Wells, 2005, p. 65)
5.2 Prepositional phrases
Given the longer average sentence length of literature,
it is to be expected that the prepositional phrases (PPs;
as well as noun phrases; NPs) occur more frequently
in literary novels than in chick lit (p = 0.0044 and

p = 0.0015, respectively). The aforementioned argu-
ment by Wells that chick lit is less descriptive than
literature is reflected in the results of the PPs and NPs
as well. PPs, especially PP-adjuncts?grammatically
optional constituents that function as modifiers of
other constituents?are also indicative of descriptive
language. Example (10) shows liberal use of preposi-
tional phrases, including the first two PP-MODs that
modify the same constituent?although the latter was
not attached correctly by the parser.
(10) Ineens had ik zin om te schreeuwen en de gerookte zalm
en quiches van tafel te slaan, [PP-MOD maar [MWU-HD in
plaats daarvan]] troostte ik me [PP-PC met de wietzolder
[PP-MOD van [N-OBJ1 Emiel]], [PP-MOD met [NP-OBJ1
de gedachte dat ik nog meer geheimen had en dat het be-
haaglijk kon zijn]] [NP-OBJ1 het slappe geklets [PP-MOD
van [N-OBJ1 anderen]] te verachten] (L)
Suddenly I felt an urge to scream and throw the smoaked
salmon and quiches off the table, but instead I consoled
myself with the weed attic of Emiel, with the idea that I
had yet more secrets and that it could be comfortable to
despise the petty banter of others.
In sum, both the relative clauses and the PPs dif-
ferentiate between literature and chick lit and point
towards more descriptive language in literature.
5.3 Diminutives
Another marker for the distinction between chick
lit and literature is the use of diminutives (almost
significant, p=0.055). In Dutch, the diminutive is
a productive part of the language and is typically
formed by the suffix ?-je?. Alpino marks such words
with the morphological feature ?dim.? The frequent
use of the diminutive is a common element in col-
loquial speech, and aside from the literal meaning
of smallness diminutives are also used to express
endearment, intimacy, and familiarity:
(11) Ik draai me om en pak mijn telefoontje. (C)
I turn around and take my telephone-dim.
This may indicate that language in chick lit is closer
to real-life speech than that of literature and could be
explored further when the speech-narrative distinc-
tion is operationalized.
6 Discussion
A starting point for further exploration is offered by
our finding that the complex DU-sentences clearly
differentiate between chick lit and literature. Some-
thing similar is suggested by Egbert (2012), who uses
Multi-Dimensional analysis to explore literary styles.
He identifies stylistic variation in the dimensions of
Thought Presentation versus Description, and Dia-
logue versus Narrative. This finding supports our con-
clusion that it would be fruitful to pursue an intratex-
tual distinction of regular versus dialogue sentences.
In future research the method could for instance be
expanded by using a discourse analyzer to identify all
dialogue sentences. This will require some notion of
a text grammar (Nunberg, 1990; Power et al, 2003),
to recognize the different ways in which dialogue can
be represented in text.
In order to assess the fitness of statistical parsers
for literary investigations, a more comprehensive
study of the quality of the parse trees is in order. The
trees we have inspected were overall of good qual-
ity, especially concerning the elements we analyze.
These consist mostly of overtly marked syntactic con-
stituents, and do not hinge on correct attachments,
which are often difficult to get right for statistical
parsers.
Furthermore, we would like to investigate Toolan?s
claims about the complexity of sentence types, and
on more specific morphosyntactic features. Unfor-
tunately, little theory exists on syntactic aspects of
literature, let alne its complexity. This could be
improved by using results from psycholinguistics on
what kinds of syntactic constructions are perceived
as complex. Related to this is the work concerning
readability measures, such as the Flesch and Kin-
caid scales, which can be obtained with the style
program (Cherry and Vesterman, 1981).
Finally, in future work we would like to combine
our computational results with literary interpretation.
This requires attending to the context of the syntactic
features in question.
7 Conclusion
We have operationalized a literary-linguistic theory
by employing several computational tools and found
specific syntactic features that characterize the two
prose genres. Especially the Discourse Units showed
79
a marked difference between the genres: chick lit
uses more compound sentences, whereas literature
contains more complex sentences. The bottom-up
tests showed that chick-lit writers use significantly
more diminutives, whereas literary writers employ
more prepositional phrases and relative clauses which
results in more descriptive language.
Although these findings agree with intuitive no-
tions that literature employs more complex syntac-
tic constructions than chick lit, computational anal-
ysis has proven its added value. The distant reading
method of sifting through large amounts of text can
reveal patterns too subtle or diffused to spot without
computational tools; the distribution of the specific
sentence structures we have investigated here would
have been cumbersome to extract manually.
Our approach of analyzing syntactic features
yields promising results on characterizing prose
genre and explaining the syntactic differences. The
positive results mean that the method that we have
applied can be developed further in the context of
the project The Riddle of Literary Quality to find
out whether syntactic complexity correlates with the
perceived aesthetic quality of the texts as well.
