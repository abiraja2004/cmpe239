Abstract1 
This paper presents a semi-supervised ap-
proach to reduce human effort in building an 
annotated Chinese corpus. One of the disad-
vantages of many statistical Chinese named 
entity recognition systems is that training data 
may be in short supply, and manually building 
annotated corpus is expensive. In the proposed 
approach, we construct an 80M hand-
annotated corpus in three steps: (1) 
Automatically annotate training corpus; (2) 
Manually refine small subsets of the automati-
cally annotated corpus; (3) Combine small 
subsets and whole corpus in a bootstrapping 
process. Our approach is tested on a state-of-
the-art Chinese word segmentation system 
(Gao et al, 2003, 2004). Experiments show 
that only a small subset of hand-annotated 
corpus is sufficient to achieve a satisfying per-
formance of the named entity component in 
this system.  
1 Introduction 
The success of applying statistical methods to 
natural language processing tasks depends to a 
large degree upon the quality and amount of avail-
able training data.  
This paper presents our method of creating train-
ing data for the statistical Chinese word segmenter 
proposed in Gao et al (2003). The segmenter is 
based on improved source-channel models, which 
are trained on a large amount of annotated training 
data. Whereas the hand-annotation is a very expen-
sive task, creating the training data automatically 
remains an open research problem. Our approach 
falls somewhere between the two extremes of the 
spectrum. We try to minimize the human effort 
while keeping the quality of the annotation rea-
sonably good for model estimation.  The method to 
be presented has been discussed briefly in Gao et 
al. (2003). This paper presents an extended de-
scription with more details and experimental re-
sults.

Microsoft Research Asia. 
The training data refer to a set of Chinese sen-
tences where word boundaries and types have been 
annotated. Our basic solution is the bootstrapping 
approach described in Gao et al (2002). It consists 
of three steps: (1) Initially, we use a greedy word 
segmenter to annotate the corpus, and obtain initial 
models based on the initial annotated corpus; (2) 
We re-annotate the corpus using the obtained mod-
els; (3) Re-train the models using the re-annotated 
corpus. Steps 2 and 3 are iterated until the per-
formance of the system converges. 
In this approach, the quality of the resulting 
models depends to a large degree upon the quality 
of the initial annotated corpus. Because there are 
many named entities that are not stored in a dic-
tionary, traditional dictionary-based forward 
maximum matching (FMM) algorithm is not suffi-
cient to create a good initial corpus. We thus 
manually annotate named entities on a small subset 
(call seed set) of the training data. Then, we obtain 
a model on the seed set (called seed model). We 
thus improve the initial model which is trained on 
the initial annotated training corpus by interpolat-
ing it with the seed model. Our experiments show 
that a relatively small seed set (e.g., 10 million 
characters, which takes approximately three weeks 
for 4 persons to annotate the NE tags) is enough to 
get a good improved model for initialization. 
The remainder of this paper is organized as fol-
lows: Section 2 summarizes the related work. Sec-
tion 3 deals with our approach to improve model 
estimation for Chinese word segmentation. The 
experiments are presented at Section 4. Finally we 
conclude in Section 5. 
2 Related work 
Traditional statistical approaches use a paramet-
ric model with maximum likelihood estimation 
(MLE), usually with smoothing methods to deal 
with data sparseness problems. These approaches 
have been introduced for the task of Chinese word 
segmentation. According to the training data used 
(word-segmented or not), the Chinese word seg-
mentation can be achieved in a supervised or unsu-
pervised manner. 
As an example of unsupervised training, Ge et al 
(1999) presents a simple zero-th order Markov 
model of the words in Chinese text. They devel-
oped an efficient algorithm to train their model on 
an unsegmented corpus. Their basic assumption is 
that Chinese words are usually 1 to 4 characters 
long. They however did not take into account a 
large amount of named entities (e.g. Chinese or-
ganization name, transliterate name and some per-
son names) most of which are longer than 4 char-
acters (e.g., ??????? Microsoft Research 
Asia, ????? California, ?????  a 
woman?s name which puts her husband?s surname 
ahead). 
An and Wong used Hidden Markov Models 
(HMM) for segmentation. Their system is solely 
trained on a corpus which has been manually anno-
tated with word boundaries and Part-of-Speech 
tags. Wu (2003) also used the training data to tune 
the segmentation parameters of their MSR-NLP 
Chinese system. He used the annotated training 
data to deal with the morphologically derived 
words. 
In this paper we present a semi-supervised train-
ing method where we use both an auto-segmented 
training corpus and a small hand-annotated subset 
of it. Comparing to unsupervised approaches, our 
approach leads to a better segmenter that can 
identify much more named entities which are not 
in the dictionary. Comparing to supervised ap-
proaches, our method requires much less human 
effort for data annotation. 
The Chinese word segmenter used in this study 
is described in Gao et al (2003). The segmenter 
provides a unified approach to word segmentation 
and named entity (NE) recognition. This unified 
approach is based on the improved source-channel 
models of Chinese sentence generation, with two 
components: a source model and a set of channel 
models. For each word class (e.g. a person name), 
there is a channel model (referred to as class model 
afterwards) that estimates the generative probabil-
ity of a character string given the word type. The 
source model is used to estimate the generative 
probability of a word sequence, in which each 
word belongs to one word class (e.g. a word in a 
lexicon or a named entity). In another word, it in-
dicates, given a context, how likely a word occurs. 
So the source model is also referred to as context 
model afterwards. This paper focuses the discus-
sion on how to create annotated corpus for context 
model estimation. 
3 A semi-supervised approach to improve 
context model estimation 
In this study the context model is a trigram 
model which estimates the probability of a word 
class. 
Ideally, given an annotated corpus, where each 
sentence is segmented into words which are tagged 
by their word types, the trigram word class prob-
abilities can be calculated using MLE, together 
with a backoff schema (Katz, 1987) to deal with 
the sparse data problem. Unfortunately, building 
such annotated training corpora is very expensive. 
Our basic solution is the bootstrapping approach 
described in Gao et al (2002). It consists of three 
steps: (1) Initially, a greedy word segmenter (i.e. 
FMM) is used to annotate the corpus, and an initial 
context model is obtained based on the initial an-
notated corpus; (2) Re-annotate the corpus using 
the obtained models; (3) Re-train the context 
model using the re-annotated corpus. Steps 2 and 3 
are iterated until the performance of the system 
converges. 
In the above approach, the quality of the context 
model depends to a large degree upon the quality 
of the initial annotated corpus, which is however 
not satisfied due to the fact that many named enti-
ties cannot be identifying using the greedy word 
segmenter which is based on the dictionary. As a 
consequence, the above approach achieves a low 
accuracy in detecting Chinese named entities. 
A straightforward solution to the above problem 
is to obtain large amount of high-quality annotated 
corpus for context model estimation. Unfortunately, 
manually creating such annotated corpus  is very 
expensive. For example, Douglas (1999) pointed 
out that at least up to about 1.2 million words of 
training data are necessary to train an HMM name 
recognizer. To guarantee a high degree of accuracy 
(e.g. 90% F-measure), it requires about 800 hours, 
or 20 person*weeks of labor to annotate and check 
the amount of data. This is almost certainly more 
time than would be required by a skilled rule writer 
to write a rule-based name recognizer achieving 
the same level of performance, assuming all the 
necessary resources, such as lexicons and name 
lists, are already available. 
Our training data contains approximately 80 
million Chinese characters from various domains 
of text. We are facing three questions in annotating 
the training data. (1) How to generate a high qual-
ity hand-annotated corpus? (2) How to best use the 
valuable hand-annotated corpus so as to achieve a 
satisfying performance? (3) What is the optimal 
size of the hand-annotated corpus, considering the 
tradeoff between the cost of human labor and the 
performance of the resulting segmenter? 
We leave the answers to the first and third ques-
tions to Section 4. In what follows, we describe our 
method of using small set of human-annotated cor-
pus to boost the quality of the annotation of the 
entire corpus. It consists of 6 steps. 
Step 1: Manually annotate named entities on a 
small subset (call seed set) of the training data. 
Step 2: Obtain a context model on the seed set 
(called seed model). 
Step 3: Re-annotate the training corpus using the 
seed model and then train an improved context 
model using the re-annotated corpus. 
Step 4: Manually annotate another small subset 
of the training data. Repeat Steps (2) and (3) until 
the entire training data have been annotated. 
Step 5: Repeat steps 1 to 4 using different seed 
sets (we used three seed sets in our experiments, as 
we shall describe in Section 4). 
Step 6: Combine all context models obtained in 
step 5 via linear interpolation: 
P(xyz) =? ?i? Pi(xyz) (1)
Here Pi(xyz) is the trigram probability of the i-th 
context model. ?s is the interpolation weights 
which vary from 0 to 1. 
4 Experiments 
In this section, we first present our experiments 
on the generation and evaluation of hand-annotated 
corpus to answer the first two questions. Then, the 
answer to the third question is given in subsection 
4.2. 
4.1 The generation and evaluation of hand-
annotated corpus 
4.1.1 The generation of hand-annotated corpus 
Four students, whose major is Chinese language, 
annotate the corpus according to a pre-defined 
MSRA?s guideline of Chinese named entities. We 
find that we have to revise the guideline when they 
were annotating the corpus. For example, Chinese 
character string ? ? ? ? ? ? (Shanghai 
Exposition)?can be tagged as either ?[L ?]???
?? or ?[L ??]????. Here ??? is the abbre-
viation of ???(Shanghai)?. ??? is the abbrevia-
tion of ???(city)?. L is the tag of location name. 
It is not clearly described in the guideline where 
the named entity?s right boundary is. 
We obtain in total three manually annotated sub-
sets (i.e. seed sets) by the following process: 
1. Annotate the training data using a greedy 
word segmenter. Highlight the NEs and their 
tags. 
2. Randomly select 10 million characters from 
the annotated training data and then ask the 
students to manually refine these 10 million 
characters. The refinement includes correcting 
the wrong NE tags and adding missing NE 
tags.  
3. Repeat the second step, and then combine the 
obtained new 10-million-character subset with 
the first one. Hence, a 20-million-character 
subset of the training data is obtained. 
4. Repeat the second step, and then combine the 
obtained new 10-million-character subset with 
the 20-million-character subset. Hence, a 30-
million-character subset of the training data is 
obtained. 
A manually annotated test set was developed as 
well. The text corpus contains approximately a half 
million Chinese characters that have been proof-
read and balanced in terms of domain, styles, and 
times. 
4.1.2 The evaluation of hand-annotated corpus 
To evaluate the quality of our annotated corpus, 
we trained a context model using the method de-
scribed in Section 3, with the first-obtained 10-
million-character seed set. We then compare the 
performance of the resulting segmenter with those 
of other state-of-the-art segmenters and the FMM 
segmenter. 
4.1.2.1 Evaluation metrics

and recall (R).

4.1.2.2 Segmenters in Comparison 
1. The MSWS system is one of the best 
available products. It is released by Micro-
soft? (as a set of Windows APIs). MSWS first 
conducts the word-breaking using MM (aug-
mented by heuristic rules for disambiguation), 
and then conducts factoid detection and NER 
using rules. 
2. The LCWS system is one of the best re-
search systems in mainland China. It is re-
leased by Beijing Language University. The 
system works similarly to MSWS, but has a 
larger dictionary containing more PNs and 
LNs. 
3. The PBWS system is a rule-based Chinese 
parser which can also output the word seg-
mentation results. It explores high-level lin-
guistic knowledge, such as syntactic structure 
for Chinese word segmentation and NER. 
4.1.2.3 Results 
The performance of the resulting segmenter is 
compared with those of three state-of-the-art seg-
menters and FMM segmenter in Table 1. Here PN, 
LN and ON stand for person name, location name 
and organization name respectively. The first col-
umn lists the segmenters. 
As can be seen from Table 1, the resulting seg-
menter (SSSC.10m) achieves comparable results 
with those of the other three state-of-the-art word 
segmenters. From Table 1 we also find that our 
semi-supervised approach makes a 2.4%-49% im-
provement over FMM.

Table 1: Results on different Chinese word seg-
menters 
The results show a moderate amount of hand-
annotated corpus leads our segmenter to a state-of-
the-art performance. 
4.2 The optimal size of the hand-annotated 
corpus 
Regarding the third question: what is the optimal 
size of the hand-annotated subset, considering the 
tradeoff between the cost of human labor and the 
performance of the resulting segmenter? We obtain 
a series of results using 10-30-million-character 
subsets as seed sets, and then plot three graphs 
showing the relationship between the performances 
and their corresponding human efforts of 
constructing the seed set. 
4.2.1 Baselines 
We use two baselines. 
One is the FMM method, which does not use 
annotated training data. It is used to evaluate the 
performances using 10-30-million-character sub-
sets (see Figure 1). 
The other is to use all the human effort of anno-
tating the whole training data, which takes about 
1920 person*hours human effort. It is used to cal-
culate how much labor we would save by using the 
semi-supervised approach described in section 3.  
4.2.2 Results 
The relationship between the performances and 
their corresponding human efforts of constructing 
the seed sets is shown in Figure 1. The X-axes give 
the human efforts on building 10, 20, and 30-
million-character subsets. They are 360, 720, and 
1080 person*hours. The Y-axes show the recall 
and precision results on person name, location 
name and organization name, separately.

Figure 1: The relationship between the perform-
ances and their corresponding human efforts 
We observe that both the recall and precision re-
sults first go upwards, and level off after the use of 
720 person*hours, which is the corresponding hu-
man effort of constructing 20 million characters. 
This means that 20 million characters is a satura-
tion point, because more human effort does not 
lead to any improvement in performance, and less 
human effort leads to lower performance. 
From the fact that manually annotating the 
whole training data costs 1920 person*hours, we 
indicate that by using our semi-supervised ap-
proach we save 62.5% human labor in corpus an-
notation. 
5 Conclusion 
This paper presents a semi-supervised method to 
save human effort in building annotated corpus. 
This method uses a small set of human-annotated 
corpus to boost the quality of the annotation of the 
entire corpus. We test this method on Gao?s Chi-
nese word segmentation system, which achieves a 
state-of-the-art performance on SIGHAN backoff 
data sets (Gao et al 2004). 
Several conclusions can be drawn from our ex-
periments: 
z The obtained corpus is of high quality. 
z 20-million-characters is the optimal size of 
hand-annotated subset to boost the 80-million-
character training data, considering the trade-
off between the cost of human labor and the 
performance of the resulting segmenter. 
z We save 62.5% human labor in corpus anno-
tation.
