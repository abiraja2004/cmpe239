Abstract
In the field of referring expression gener-
ation, while in the static domain both in-
trinsic and extrinsic evaluations have been
considered, extrinsic evaluation in the dy-
namic domain, such as in a situated col-
laborative dialog, has not been discussed
in depth. In a dynamic domain, a cru-
cial problem is that referring expressions
do not make sense without an appropriate
preceding dialog context. It is unrealistic
for an evaluation to simply show a human
evaluator the whole period from the be-
ginning of a dialog up to the time point
at which a referring expression is used.
Hence, to make evaluation feasible it is
indispensable to determine an appropriate
shorter context. In order to investigate the
context necessary to understand a referring
expression in a situated collaborative dia-
log, we carried out an experiment with 33
evaluators and a Japanese referring expres-
sion corpus. The results contribute to find-
ing the proper contexts for extrinsic evalu-
tion in dynamic domains.
1 Introduction
In recent years, the NLG community has paid sig-
nificant attention to the task of generating referring
expressions, reflected in the seting-up of several
competitive events such as the TUNA and GIVE-
Challenges at ENLG 2009 (Gatt et al, 2009; By-
ron et al, 2009).
With the development of increasingly complex
generation systems, there has been heightened in-
terest in and an ongoing significant discussion on
different evaluation measures for referring expres-
sions. This discussion is carried out broadly in the
field of generation, including in the multi-modal
domain, e.g. (Stent et al, 2005; Foster, 2008).

Figure 1: Overview of recent work on evaluation
of referring expressions
Figure 1 shows a schematic overview of recent
work on evaluation of referring expressions along
the two axes of evaluation method and domain in
which referring expressions are used.
There are two different evaluation methods cor-
responding to the bottom and the top of the verti-
cal axis in Figure 1: intrinsic and extrinsic eval-
uations (Sparck Jones and Galliers, 1996). In-
trinsic methods often measure similarity between
the system output and the gold standard corpora
using metrics such as tree similarity, string-edit-
distance and BLEU (Papineni et al, 2002). Intrin-
sic methods have recently become popular in the
NLG community. In contrast, extrinsic methods
evaluate generated expressions based on an exter-
nal metric, such as its impact on human task per-
formance.
While intrinsic evaluations have been widely
used in NLG, e.g. (Reiter et al, 2005), (Cahill
and van Genabith, 2006) and the competitive 2009
TUNA-Challenge, there have been a number of
criticisms against this type of evaluation. (Reiter
and Sripada, 2002) argue, for example, that gener-
ated text might be very different from a corpus but
still achieve the specific communicative goal.
An additional problem is that corpus-similarity
metrics measure how well a system reproduces
what speakers (or writers) do, while for most NLG
systems ultimately the most important considera-
tion is its effect on the human user (i.e. listener
or reader). Thus (Khan et al, 2009) argues that
?measuring human-likeness disregards effective-
ness of these expressions?.
Furthermore, as (Belz and Gatt, 2008) state
?there are no significant correlations between in-
trinsic and extrinsic evaluation measures?, con-
cluding that ?similarity to human-produced refer-
ence texts is not necessarily indicative of quality
as measured by human task performance?.
From early on in the NLG community, task-
based extrinsic evaluations have been considered
as the most meaningful evaluation, especially
when having to convince people in other commu-
nities of the usefulness of a system (Reiter and
Belz, 2009). Task performance evaluation is rec-
ognized as the ?only known way to measure the ef-
fectiveness of NLG systems with real users? (Re-
iter et al, 2003). Following this direction, the
GIVE-Challenges (Koller et al, 2009) at INLG
2010 (instruction generation) also include a task-
performance evaluation.
In contrast to the vertical axis of Figure 1, there
is the horizontal axis of the domain in which refer-
ring expressions are used. Referring expressions
can thus be distinguished according to whether
they are used in a static or a dynamic domain, cor-
responding to the left and right of the horizontal
axis of Figure 1. A static domain is one such as the
TUNA corpus (van Deemter, 2007), which col-
lects referring expressions based on a motionless
image. In contrast, a dynamic domain comprises a
constantly changing situation where humans need
context information to identify the referent of a re-
ferring expression.
Referring expressions in the static domain have
been evaluated relatively extensively. A recent ex-
ample of an intrinsic evaluation is (van der Sluis
et al, 2007), who employed the Dice-coefficient
measuring corpus-similarity. There have been a
number of extrinsic evaluations as well, such as
(Paraboni et al, 2006) and (Khan et al, 2009), re-
spectively measuring the effect of overspecifica-
tion on task performance and the impact of gener-
ated text on accuracy as well as processing speed.
They belong thus in the top-left quadrant of Fig-
ure 1.
Over a recent period, research in the generation
of referring expressions has moved to dynamic do-
mains such as situated dialog, e.g. (Jordan and
Walker, 2005) and (Stoia et al, 2006). However,
both of them carried out an intrinsic evaluation
measuring corpus-similarity or asking evaluators
to compare system output to expressions used by
human (the right bottom quadrant in Figure 1).
The construction of effective generation sys-
tems in the dynamic domain requires the imple-
mentation of an extrinsic task performance evalu-
ation. There has been work on extrinsic evalua-
tion of instructions in the dynamic domain on the
GIVE-2 challenge (Byron et al, 2009), which is a
task to generate instructions in a virtual world. It is
based on the GIVE-corpus (Gargett et al, 2010),
which is collected through keyboard interaction.
The evaluation measures used are e.g. the number
of successfully completed trials, completion time
as well as the numbers of instructions the system
sent to the user. As part of the JAST project, a
Joint Construction Task (JCT) puzzle construction
corpus (Foster et al, 2008) was created which is
similar in some ways in its set-up to the REX-
J corpus which we use in the current research.
There has been some work on evaluating gener-
ation strategies of instructions for a collaborative
construction task on this corpus, both considering
intrinsic as well as extrinsic measures (Foster et
al., 2009). Their main concern is, however, the in-
teraction between the text structure and usage of
referring expressions. Therefore, their ?context?
was given a priori.
However, as can be seen from Figure 1, in the
field of referring expression generation, while in
the static domain both intrinsic and extrinsic eval-
uations have been considered, the question of re-
alizing an extrinsic evaluation in the dynamic do-
main has not been dealt with in depth by previous
work. This paper addresses this shortcoming of
previous work and contributes to ?filling in? the
missing quadrant of Figure 1 (the top-right).
The realization of such an extrinsic evaluation
faces one key difficulty. In a static domain, an ex-
trinsic evaluation can be realized relatively easily
by showing evaluators the static context (e.g. any
image) and a referring expression, even though
this is still costly in comparison to intrinsic meth-
ods (Belz and Gatt, 2008).
In contrast, an extrinsic evaluation in the dy-
namic domain needs to present an evaluator with
the dynamic context (e.g. a certain length of the
recorded dialog) preceding a referring expression.
It is clearly not feasible to simply show the whole
preceding dialog; this would make even a very
small-scale evaluation much too costly. Thus, in
order to realize a cost-effective extrinsic evalua-
tion in a dynamic domain we have to deal with the
additional parameter of time length and content of
the context shown to evaluators.
This paper investigates the context necessary for
humans to understand different types of referring
expressions in a situated domain. This work thus
charts new territory and contributes to developing
a extrinsic evaluation in a dynamic domain. Sig-
nificantly, we consider not only linguistic but also
extra-linguistic information as part of the context,
such as the actions that have been carried out in the
preceding interaction. Our results indicate that, at
least in this domain, extrinsic evaluation results
in dynamic domains can depend on the specific
amount of context shown to the evaluator. Based
on the results from our evaluation experiments, we
discuss the broader conclusions to be drawn and
directions for future work.
2 Referring Expressions in the REX-J
Corpus
We utilize the REX-J corpus, a Japanese corpus
of referring expressions in a situated collaborative
task (Spanger et al, 2009a). It was collected by
recording the interaction of a pair of dialog partic-
ipants solving the Tangram puzzle cooperatively.
The goal of the Tangram puzzle is to construct a
given shape by arranging seven pieces of simple
figures as shown in Figure 2
!"#$%&'#()
*"+,-.!%#+)#
Figure 2: Screenshot of the Tangram simulator
In order to record the precise position of every
piece and every action by the participants, we im-
plemented a simulator. The simulator displays two
areas: a goal shape area, and a working area where
pieces are shown and can be manipulated.
We assigned different roles to the two partici-
pants of a pair: solver and operator. The solver
can see the goal shape but cannot manipulate the
pieces and hence gives instructions to the opera-
tor; by contrast, the operator can manipulate the
pieces but can not see the goal shape. The two
participants collaboratively solve the puzzle shar-
ing the working area in Figure 2.
In contrast to other recent corpora of refer-
ring expressions in situated collaborative tasks
(e.g. COCONUT corpus (Di Eugenio et al, 2000)
and SCARE corpora (Byron et al, 2005)), in
the REX-J corpus we allowed comparatively large
real-world flexibility in the actions necessary to
achieve the task (such as flipping, turning and
moving of puzzle pieces at different degrees), rel-
ative to the task complexity. The REX-J corpus
thus allows us to investigate the interaction of lin-
guistic and extra-linguistic information. Interest-
ingly, the GIVE-2 challenge at INLG 2010 notes
its ?main novelty? is allowing ?continuous moves
rather than discrete steps as in GIVE-1?. Our work
is in line with the broader research trend in the
NLG community of trying to get away from sim-
ple ?discrete? worlds to more realistic settings.
The REX-J corpus contains a total of 1,444 to-
kens of referring expressions in 24 dialogs with a
total time of about 4 hours and 17 minutes. The
average length of each dialog is 10 minutes 43
seconds. The asymmetric data-collection setting
encouraged referring expressions from the solver
(solver: 1,244 tokens, operator: 200 tokens). We
exclude from consideration 203 expressions refer-
ring to either groups of pieces or whose referent
cannot be determined due to ambiguity, thus leav-
ing us 1,241 expressions.
We identified syntactic/semantic features in the
collected referring expressions as listed in Table 1:
(a) demonstratives (adjectives and pronouns), (b)
object attribute-values, (c) spatial relations and (d)
actions on an object. The underlined part of the
examples denotes the feature in question.
3 Design of Evaluation Experiment
The aim of our experiment is to investigate the
?context? (content of the time span of the recorded

interaction prior to the uttering of the referring ex-
pression) necessary to enable successful identifi-
cation of the referent of a referring expression.
Our method is to vary the context presented to
evaluators and then to study the impact on human
referent identification. In order to realize this, for
each instance of a referring expression, we vary
the length of the video shown to the evaluator.

Figure 3: The interface presented to evaluators
The basic procedure of our evaluation experi-
ment is as follows:
(1) present human evaluators with speech and
video from a dialog that captures shared
working area of a certain length previous to
the uttering of a referring expression,
(2) stop the video and display as text the next
solver?s utterance including the referring ex-
pression (shown in red),
(3) ask the evaluator to identify the referent
of the presented referring expression (if the
evaluator wishes, he/she can replay the video
as many times as he likes),
(4) proceed to the next referring expression (go
to (1)).
Figure 3 shows a screenshot of the interface pre-
pared for this experiment.
The test data consists of three types of referring
expressions: DPs (demonstrative pronouns),
AMEs (action-mentioning expressions), and
OTHERs (any other expression that is neither a
DP nor AME, e.g intrinsic attributes and spatial
relations). DPs are the most frequent type of
referring expression in the corpus. AMEs are
expressions that utilize an action on the referent
such as ?the triangle you put away to the top
right? (see Table 1)1. As we pointed out in our
previous paper (Spanger et al, 2009a), they are
also a fundamental type of referring expression in
this domain.
The basic question in investigating a suitable
context is what information to consider about the
preceding interaction; i.e. over what parameters to
vary the context. In previous work on the gener-
ation of demonstrative pronouns in a situated do-
main (Spanger et al, 2009b), we investigated the
role of linguistic and extra-linguistic information,
and found that time distance from the last action
(LA) on the referent as well as the last mention
(LM) to the referent had a significant influence on
the usage of referring expressions. Based on those
results, we focus on the information on the refer-
ent, namely LA and LM.
For both AMEs and OTHERs, we only consider
two possibilities of the order in which LM and LA
appear before a referring expression (REX), de-
pending on which comes first. These are shown in
Figure 4, context patterns (a) LA-LM and (b) LM-
LA. Towards the very beginning of a dialog, some
referring expressions have no LM and LA; those
expressions are not considered in this research.
All instances of AMEs and OTHERs in our test
data belong to either the LA-LM or the LM-LA
1An action on the referent is usually described by a verb
as in this example. However, there are cases with a verb el-
lipsis. While this would be difficult in English, it is natural
and grammatical in Japanese.

pattern. For each of these two context patterns,
there are three possible contexts2: Both (including
both LA and LM), LA/LM (including either LA or
LM) and None (including neither). Depending on
the order of LA and LM prior to an expression,
only one of the variations of LA/LM is possible
(see Figure 4 (a) and (b)).
In contrast, DPs tend to be utilized in a deic-
tic way in such situated dialogs (Piwek, 2007).
We further noted in (Spanger et al, 2009b), that
DPs in a collaborative task are also frequently used
when the referent is under operation. While they
belong neither to the LA-LM nor the LM-LA pat-
tern, it would be inappropriate to exclude those
cases. Hence, for DPs we consider another situa-
tion where the last action on the referent overlaps
with the utterance of the DP (Figure 4 (c) LM-LA?
pattern). In this case, we consider an ongoing op-
eration on the referent as a ?last action?. Another
peculiarity of the LM-LA? pattern is that we have
no None context in this case, since there is no way
to show a video without showing LA (the current
operation).
Given the three basic variations of context, we
recruited 33 university students as evaluators and
2To be more precise, we set a margin at the beginning of
contexts as shown in Figure 4.
divided them equally into three groups, i.e. 11
evaluators per group. As for the referring ex-
pressions to evaluate, we selected 60 referring ex-
pressions used by the solver from the REX-J cor-
pus (20 from each category), ensuring all were
correctly understood by the operator during the
recorded dialog. We selected those 60 instances
from expressions where both LM and LA ap-
peared within the last 30 secs previous to the re-
ferring expression. This selection excludes initial
mentions, as well as expressions where only LA
or only LM exists or they do not appear within 30
secs. Hence the data utilized for this experiment
is limited in this sense. We need further experi-
ments to investigate the relation between the time
length of contexts and the accuarcy of evaluators.
We will return to this issue in the conclusion.
We combined 60 referring expressions and the
three contexts to make the test instances. Follow-
ing the Latin square design, we divided these test
instances into three groups, distributing each of
the three contexts for every referring expression
to each group. The number of contexts was uni-
formly distributed over the groups. Each instance
group was assigned to each evaluator group.
For each referring expression instance, we
record whether the evaluator was able to correctly
identify the referent, how long it took them to
identify it and whether they repeated the video
(and if so how many times).
Reflecting the distribution of the data available
in our corpus, the number of instances per context
pattern differs for each type of referring expres-
sion. For AMEs, overwhelmingly the last action
on the referent was more recent than the last men-
tion. Hence we have only two LA-LM patterns
among the 20 AMEs in our data. For OTHERs, the
balance is 8 to 12, with a slight majority of LM-
LA patterns. For DPs, there is a strong tendency to
use a DP when a piece is under operation (Spanger
et al, 2009b). Of the 20 DPs in the data, 2 were
LA-LM, 5 were LM-LA pattern while 13 were of
the LM-LA? pattern (i.e. their referents were under
operation at the time of the utterance). For these
13 instances of LM-LA? we do not have a None
context.
The average stimulus times, i.e. time period of
presented context, were 7.48 secs for None, 11.04
secs for LM/LA and 18.10 secs for Both.

4 Results and Analysis
In this section we discuss the results of our evalua-
tion experiment. In total 33 evaluators participated
in our experiment, each solving 60 problems of
referent identification. Taking into account the ab-
sence of the None context for the DPs of the LM-
LA? pattern (see (c) in Figure 4), we have 1,815
responses to analyze. We focus on the impact of
the three contexts on the three types of referring
expressions, considering the two context patterns
LA-MA and LM-LA.
4.1 Overview of Results
Table 2 shows the micro averages of the accura-
cies of referent identification of all evaluators over
different types of referring expressions with differ-
ent contexts. Accuracies increase with an increase
in the amount of information in the context; from
None to Both by between 13.2% (OTHERs) and
35.9% (AMEs). The average increase of accuracy
is 27.4%.
Overall, for AMEs the impact of the context is
the greatest, while for OTHERs it is the smallest.
This is not surprising given that OTHERs tend to
include intrinsic attributes of the piece and its spa-
tial relations, which are independent of the pre-
ceding context. We conducted ANOVA with the
context as the independent variable, testing its ef-
fect on identification accuracy. The main effect
of the context was significant on accuracy with
F (2, 1320) = 9.17, p < 0.01. Given that for
DPs we did not have an even distribution between
contexts, we only utilized the results of AMEs and
OTHERs.
There are differences between expression types
in terms of the impact of addition of LM/LA into
the context, which underlines that when studying
context, the relative role and contribution of LA
and LM (and their interaction) must be looked at in
detail for different types of referring expressions.
Over all referring expressions, the addition into
a None context of LM yields an average increase
in accuracy of 9.1% for all referring expression
types, while for the same conditions the addition
of LA yields an average increase of 21.3%. Hence,
interestingly for our test data, the addition of LA
to the context has a positive impact on accuracy by
more than two times over the addition of LM.
It is also notable that even with neither LA nor
LM present (i.e. the None context), the evaluators
were still able to correctly identify referents in be-
tween 50?68.6% (average: 62.9%) of the cases.
While this accuracy would be insufficient for the
evaluation of machine generated referring expres-
sions, it is still higher than one might expect and
further investigation of this case is necessary.
4.2 Demonstrative Pronouns
For DPs, there is a very clear difference between
the two patterns (LM-LA and LA-LM) in terms of
the increase of accuracy with a change of context.
While accuracy for the LA-LM pattern remains at
a high level (over 90%) for all three contexts (and
there is only a very small increase from None to
Both), for the LM-LA pattern there is a strong in-
crease from None to Both of 38.8%.
The difference in accuracy between the two
context patterns of DPs in the None context might
come from the mouse cursor effect. The two ex-
pressions of LA-LM pattern happened to have a
mouse cursor on the referent, when they were
used, resulting in high accuracy. On the other
hand, 4 out of 5 expressions of LM-LA pattern did
not have a mouse cursor on the referent. We have
currently no explanation for the relation between
context patterns and the mouse position. While
we have only 7 expressions in the None context
for DPs and hence cannot draw any decisive con-
clusions, we note that the impact of the mouse po-
sition is a likely factor.
For the LM-LA pattern, there is an increase
in accuracy of 32.8% from None to the LA-
context. Overwhelmingly, this represents in-
stances in which the referents are being operated
at the point in time when the solver utters a DP
(this is in fact the LM-LA? pattern, which has no
None context). For those instances, the current
operation information is sufficient to identify the
referents. In contrast, addition of LM leads only
to a small increase in accuracy of 5.6%. This re-
sult is in accordance with our previous work on the
generation of DPs, which stressed the importance
of extra-linguistic information in the framework of
considering the interaction between linguistic and
extra-linguistic information.
4.3 Action-mentioning Expressions
While for AMEs the number of instances is very
uneven between patterns (similar to the distribu-
tion for DPs), there is a strong increase in accuracy
from the None context to the Both context for both
patterns (between 30% to almost 50%). However,
there is a difference between the two patterns in
terms of the relative contribution of LM and LA to
this increase.
While for the LA-LM pattern the impact of
adding LM and LA is very similar, for the LM-LA
pattern the major increase in accuracy is due to
adding LA into the None context. This indicates
that for AMEs, LA has a stronger impact on ac-
curacy than LM, as is to be expected. The strong
increase for AMEs of the LM-LA pattern when
adding LA into the context is not surprising, given
that the evaluators were able to see the action men-
tioned in the AME.
For the opposite reason, it is not surprising that
AMEs show the lowest accuracy in the None con-
text, given that the last action on the referent is
not seen by the evaluators. However, accuracy
was still slightly over 50% in the LM-LA pattern.
Overall, of the 18 instances of AMEs of the LM-
LA pattern, in the None context a majority of eval-
uators correctly identified 9 and erred on the other
9. Further analysis of the difference between cor-
rectly and incorrectly identified AMEs led us to
note again the important role of the mouse cursor
also for AMEs.
Comparing to the LM-LA pattern, we had very
low accuracy even with the Both context. As we
mentioned in the previous section, we had very
skewed test instances for AME, i.e. 18 LM-LA
patterns vs. 2 LA-LM patterns. We need further
investigation on the LA-LM pattern of AME with
more large number of instances.
Of the 18 LM-LA instances of AMEs, there are
14 instances that mention a verb describing an ac-
tion on the referent. The referents of 6 of those
14 AMEs were correctly determined by the evalu-
ators and in all cases the mouse cursor played an
important role in enabling the evaluator to deter-
mine the referent. The evaluators seem to utilize
the mouse position at the time of the uttering of the
referring expression as well as mouse movements
in the video shown. In contrast, for 8 out of the
9 incorrectly determined AMEs no such informa-
tion from the mouse was available. There was a
very similar pattern for AMEs that did not include
a verb. These points indicate that movements and
the position of the mouse both during the video as
well as the time point of the uttering of the refer-
ring expression give important clues to evaluators.
4.4 Other Expressions
There is a relatively even gain in identification ac-
curacy from None to Both of between about 10?
15% for both patterns. However, there is a simi-
lar tendency as for AMEs, since there is a differ-
ence between the two patterns in terms of the rel-
ative contribution of LM and LA to this increase.
While for the LA-LM pattern the impact of adding
LM and LA is roughly equivalent, for the LM-LA
pattern the major increase in accuracy is due to
adding LM into the LA-context.
For this pattern of OTHERs, LM has a stronger
impact on accuracy than LA, which is exactly the
opposite tendency to AMEs. For OTHERs (e.g.
use of attributes for object identification), seeing
the last action on the target has a less positive im-
pact than listening to the last linguistic mention.
Furthermore, we note the relatively high accuracy
in the None context for OTHERs, underlining the
context-independence of expressions utilizing at-
tributes and spatial relations of the pieces.
4.5 Error Analysis
We analyzed those instances whose referents were
not correctly identified by a majority of evalua-
tors in the Both context. Among the three expres-
sion types, there were about 13?16% of wrong an-
swers. In total for 7 of the 60 expressions a ma-
jority of evaluators gave wrong answers (4 DPs, 2
AMEs and 1 OTHER). Analysis of these instances
indicates that some improvements of our concep-
tion of ?context? is needed.
For 3 out of the 4 DPs, the mouse was not over
the referent or was closer to another piece. In addi-
tion, these DPs included expressions that pointed
to the role of a piece in the overall construction of
the goal shape, e.g. ?soitu ga atama (that is the
head)?, or where a DP is used as part of a more
complex referring expression, e.g. ?sore to onazi
katati . . . (the same shape as this)?, intended to
identify a different piece. For a non-participant
of the task, such expressions might be difficult to
understand in any context. This phenomenon is
related to the ?overhearer-effect? (Schober et al,
1989).
The two AMEs that the majority of evaluators
failed to identify in the Both context were also
misidentified in the LA context. Both AMEs were
missing a verb describing an action on the referent.
While for AMEs including a verb the accuracy in-
creased from None to Both by 50%, for AMEs
without a verb there was an increase by slightly
over 30%, indicating that in the case where an
AME lacks a verb, the context has a smaller pos-
itive impact on accuracy than for AMEs that in-
clude a verb. In order to account for those cases,
further work is necessary, such as investigating
how to account for the information on the distrac-
tors.
5 Conclusions and Future Work
In order to address the task of designing a flexi-
ble experiment set-up with relatively low cost for
extrinsic evaluations of referring expressions, we
investigated the context that needs to be shown to
evaluators in order to correctly determine the ref-
erent of an expression.
The analysis of our results showed that the con-
text had a significant impact on referent identifi-
cation. The impact was strongest for AMEs and
DPs and less so for OTHERs. Interestingly, we
found for both DPs and AMEs that including LA
in the context had a stronger positive impact than
including LM. This emphasizes the importance of
taking into account extra-linguistic information in
a situated domain, as considered in this study.
Our analysis of those expressions whose refer-
ent was incorrectly identified in the Both context
indicated some directions for improving the ?con-
text? used in our experiments, for example look-
ing further into AMEs without a verb describing
an action on the referent. Generally, there is a
necessity to account for mouse movements during
the video shown to evaluators as well as the prob-
lem for extrinsic evaluations of how to address the
?overhearer?s effect?.
While likely differing in the specifics of the set-
up, the methodology in the experiment design dis-
cussed in this paper is applicable to other domains,
in that it allows a low-cost flexible design of eval-
uating referring expressions in a dynamic domain.
In order to avoid the additional effort of analyzing
cases in relation to LM and LA, in the future it will
be desirable to simply set a certain time period and
base an evaluation on such a set-up.
However, we cannot simply assume that a
longer context would yield a higher identification
accuracy, given that evaluators in our set-up are
not actively participating in the interaction. Thus
there is a possibility that identification accuracy
actually decreases with longer video segments,
due to a loss of the evaluator?s concentration. Fur-
ther investigation of this question is indicated.
Based on the work reported in this paper, we
plan to implement an extrinsic task-performance
evaluation in the dynamic domain. Even with
the large potential cost-savings based on the re-
sults reported in this paper, extrinsic evaluations
will remain costly. Thus one important future task
for extrinsic evaluations will be to investigate the
correlation between extrinsic and intrinsic evalua-
tion metrics. This in turn will enable the use of
cost-effective intrinsic evaluations whose results
are strongly correlated to task-performance eval-
uations. This paper made an important contribu-
tion by pointing the direction for further research
in extrinsic evaluations in the dynamic domain.
