Abstract
The correct identification of metonymies
is not normally a problem for most peo-
ple. For computers, things are different,
however. In Natural Language Processing,
metonymy recognition is therefore usu-
ally addressed with complex algorithms
that rely on hundreds of labelled train-
ing examples. This paper investigates two
approaches to metonymy recognition that
dispense with this complexity, albeit in
different ways. The first, an unsuper-
vised approach to Word Sense Discrimi-
nation, does not require any labelled train-
ing instances. The second, Memory-Based
Learning, replaces the complexity of cur-
rent algorithms by a ?lazy? learning phase.
While the first approach is often able to
identify a metonymical and a literal clus-
ter in the data, it is the second in particular
that produces state-of-the-art results.
1 Introduction
In the last few years, metonymy has emerged as
an important focus of research in many areas of
linguistics. In Cognitive Linguistics, it is often de-
fined as ?a cognitive process in which one con-
ceptual entity, the vehicle, provides mental access
to another conceptual entity, the target, within the
same domain, or idealized cognitive model (ICM)?
(Ko?vecses, 2002, p.145). In example (1), for in-
stance, China and Taiwan provide mental access
to the governments of the respective countries:
(1) China has always threatened to use force
if Taiwan declared independence. (BNC)
This paper is concerned with algorithms that au-
tomatically recognize such metonymical country
names. These are extremely relevant in Natural
Language Processing, since any system that auto-
matically builds semantic representations of utter-
ances needs to be able to recognize and interpret
metonymical words.
Early approaches to metonymy recognition,
such as Pustejovsky?s (1995), identified a word as
metonymical when it violated certain selectional
restrictions. Indeed, in example (1), China and
Taiwan both violate the restriction that threaten
and declare require an animate subject, and thus
have to be interpreted metonymically. This view
is present in the psycholinguistic literature, too.
Some authors argue that a figurative interpreta-
tion of a word typically comes about when all lit-
eral interpretations fail; see Gibbs (1994) for an
overview. This failure is often due to the violation
of selectional restrictions.
However, in psycholinguistics as well as in
computational linguistics, this approach has lost
much of its appeal. It has become clear to re-
searchers in both fields that many metonymies
do not violate any restrictions at all. In to like
Shakespeare, for instance, there is no explicit lin-
guistic trigger for the metonymical interpretation
of Shakespeare. Rather, it is our world knowl-
edge that pre-empts a literal reading of the au-
thor?s name. Examples like this one demonstrate
that metonymy recognition should not be based on
rigid rules, but rather, on information about the se-
mantic class of the target word and the semantic
and grammatical context in which it occurs. In
psycholinguistics, this insight (among others) has
given rise to theories claiming that a figurative in-
terpretation does not follow the failure of a literal
one, but that both processes occur in parallel (Fris-
son and Pickering, 1999). In computational lin-
guistics, it has led to the development of statisti-
25
cal, corpus-based approaches to metonymy recog-
nition.
This view was first put into computational prac-
tice by Markert and Nissim (2002a). Their key
to success was the realization that metonymy
recognition is a sub-problem of Word Sense
Disambiguation (WSD). They found that most
metonymies in the same semantic class belong to
one of a limited number of metonymical patterns
that can be defined a priori. The task of metonymy
recognition thus consists of the automatic assign-
ment of one of these readings to a target word.
Since all words in the same semantic class may
undergo the same semantic shifts, there only has
to be one classifier per class (and not per word, as
in classic WSD).
In this paper I will be concerned with the
automatic identification of metonymical location
names. More particularly, I will test two new
approaches to metonymy recognition on the basis
of Markert and Nissim?s (2002b) corpora of 1,000
mixed country names and 1,000 instances of
the country name Hungary.1 The most impor-
tant metonymical patterns in these corpora are
place-for-people, place-for-event
and place-for-product. In addition, there
is a label mixed for examples that have two
readings, and othermet for examples that do
not belong to any of the pre-defined metonymical
patterns.
On the mixed country data, Nissim and Mark-
ert?s (2003) classifiers achieved an accuracy of
87%. This was the result of a combination of
both grammatical and semantic information. Their
grammatical information included the function of
a target word and its head. The semantic informa-
tion, in the form of Dekang Lin?s (1998) thesaurus
of semantically similar words, allowed the classi-
fier to search the training set for instances whose
head was similar, and not just identical, to that of
a test instance.
Markert and Nissim?s (2002a) and Nissim and
Markert?s (2003) study is the only one to approach
metonymy recognition from a data-driven, statisti-
cal perspective. However, it also has a number of
disadvantages. First, it requires the annotation of
a large number of training and test instances. This
compromises its possible application to a wide va-
riety of metonymical patterns across a large num-

ber of semantic categories. Second, its algorithms
are rather complex. In the training phase, they
calculate smoothed probabilities on the basis of
a large annotated training corpus and in the test
phase, they iteratively search through a thesaurus
of semantically similar words. This leads to the
question if this complexity is indeed necessary in
metonymy recognition.
This paper investigates two approaches that
each tackle one of these problems. The unsuper-
vised algorithm in section 2 has the intuitive ap-
peal of not requiring any annotated training in-
stances. I will show that it is nevertheless often
able to distinguish between two data clusters that
correlate with the two target readings. In section 3,
I will again take recourse to a supervised learn-
ing method, but one that explicitly incorporates
a much simpler learning phase than its competi-
tors in the literature ? Memory-Based Learning. I
will demonstrate that this algorithm of ?lazy learn-
ing? gives state-of-the-art results in metonymy
recognition. Moreover, although their psychologi-
cal validity is not a focus of the present investiga-
tion, the two studied algorithms have clear links to
models of human behaviour.
2 An unsupervised approach to
metonymy recognition
2.1 Background
Unsupervised machine learning algorithms do
not need any labelled training examples. In-
stead, the machine itself has to try and group
the training instances into a pre-defined number
of clusters, which ideally correspond to the im-
plicit target labels. The approach studied here
is Schu?tze?s (1998) Word Sense Discrimination,
which uses second-order co-occurrence in order to
identify clusters of senses.
Schu?tze?s (1998) algorithm first maps all words
in the training corpus onto word vectors, which
contain frequency information about the word?s
first-order co-occurrents. It then builds a vector
representation for each of the contexts of the target
by adding up the word vectors of the words in this
context. These second-order context vectors get
clustered (often after some form of dimensionality
reduction), and each of the clusters is assumed to
correspond to one of the senses of the target. The
classification of a test word, finally, proceeds by
assigning it to the cluster whose centroid lies near-
est to its context vector. Schu?tze showed that, with
26
about 8,000 training instances on average, this al-
gorithm obtains very promising results.
This unsupervised algorithm is not just attrac-
tive from a computational point of view; it is also
related to human behaviour. First, it was inspired
by Miller and Charles? (1991) observation that hu-
mans rely on contextual similarity in order to de-
termine semantic similarity. Schu?tze (1998) there-
fore hypothesized that there must be a correla-
tion between contextual similarity and word mean-
ing as well: ?a sense is a group of contextually
similar occurrences of a word? (Schu?tze, 1998,
p.99). Second, this algorithm lies at the basis of
Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA). Although the
psycholinguistic merits of LSA are an object of
debate, its performance in several language tasks
compares well to that of humans (Landauer and
Dumais, 1997). Let us therefore investigate if it is
able to tackle metonymy recognition as well.
Schu?tze?s (1998) approach has been imple-
mented in the SenseClusters program (Purandare
and Pedersen, 2004)2, which also incorporates
some interesting variations on and extensions to
the original algorithm. First, Purandare and Ped-
ersen (2004) defend the use of bigram features in-
stead of simple word features. Bigrams are ?or-
dered pairs of words that co-occur within five po-
sitions of each other? (Purandare and Pedersen,
2004, p.2) and will be used throughout this pa-
per. Second, they also found that the hybrid algo-
rithm of Repeated Bisections performs better than
Schu?tze?s (1998) clustering algorithm ? at least
for sparse data ? so I will use it here, too. Finally,
as with all word sense discrimination techniques,
evaluation proceeds indirectly: SenseClusters au-
tomatically finds the alignment of senses and clus-
ters that leads to the fewest misclassifications ?
the confusion matrix that maximizes the diagonal
sum.
2.2 Experiments
On the basis of Markert and Nissim?s location
corpora, I tested if unsupervised learning can be
applied to metonymy recognition. 60% of the
instances were used as training data, 40% as test
data, and the number of pre-defined clusters was
set to two. The experiments were designed with
five specific research questions in mind:
2This software package is freely available and can be
downloaded from http://senseclusters.sourceforge.net.
? Does unsupervised clustering work better
with one-word sets?
Since the unsupervised WSD approach stud-
ied here uses lexical features only, I antici-
pated it to work better with the Hungary data
than with the mixed country set. After all, we
can expect one word to have fewer typical co-
occurrences than an entire semantic class, so
its contexts may be easier to cluster.
? Should a stoplist be used?
Unsupervised clustering on the basis of co-
occurrences usually ignores a number of
words that are thought to be uninforma-
tive about the reading of the target. Exam-
ples of such words are prepositions and ex-
tremely frequent verbs (be, give, go, . . . ). In
metonymy recognition, however, these words
may be much more useful than in classic
WSD. If a location name occurs in a preposi-
tional phrase with in, for instance, it is prob-
ably used literally. Similarly, verbs such as
give and go determine the interpretation of a
possibly metonymical word in contexts like
give sth. to a country (metonymical) and go
to a country (literal). Stoplists may therefore
be less useful in metonymy recognition.
? Are smaller context windows better than
large ones?
Markert and Nissim (2002a) discovered that,
with co-occurrence features, the reduction of
window sizes from 10 to about 3 led to a rad-
ical improvement in precision (from 25% to
above 50%) and recall (from 4% to above
20%). Schu?tze?s (1998) original algorithm,
however, used context windows of 25 words
on either side of the target.
? Does Singular Value Decomposition result
in better performance?3
Schu?tze (1998) found that his algorithm per-
forms better with SVD than without. SVD is
said to abstract away from word dimensions,
and to discover topical dimensions instead.
This helps tackle vocabulary issues such as
synonymy and polysemy, and moreover ad-
dresses data sparseness. However, as Mark-
ert and Nissim (2002a) argue, the sense dis-
tinctions between the literal and metonymi-
cal meanings of a word are not of a topical
3With SVD, I set the number of dimensions to 300, as in
Purandare & Pedersen (2004).

nature. Word dimensions may thus lead to
better performance.
? Should features be selected on the basis of
a statistical test?4
Purandare and Pedersen (2004) used a log-
likelihood test to select their features, prob-
ably because of the intuition that ?candidate
words whose occurrence depends on whether
the ambiguous word occurs will be indica-
tive of one of the senses of the ambiguous
word and hence useful for disambiguation?
(Schu?tze, 1998, p.102). Schu?tze, in con-
trast, found that statistical selection is outper-
formed by frequency-based selection when
SVD is not used.
Like Nissim and Markert (2003), I used four
measures to evaluate the experimental results: pre-
cision, recall and F-score for the metonymical cat-
egory, and overall accuracy. They are defined in
the following way:
? Overall accuracy is the total number of in-
stances that is classified correctly.
? Precision for the metonymical category is the
percentage of metonymical labels that the
classifier assigns correctly.
? Recall for the metonymical category is the
percentage of metonymies that the classifier
recognizes.
4I again followed Purandare & Pedersen (2004) by select-
ing bigrams with a log-likelihood score of 3.841 or more.
? F-score is the harmonic mean between preci-
sion and recall:
F = 2? P ?RP +R(2)
Let us use the confidence matrix below to illustrate
these measures:
LIT MET
LIT 208 86
MET 37 39
If the rows represent the correct labels and the
columns the labels returned by the classifier, we
get the following results:
Acc = 208 + 39208 + 86 + 37 + 39 = 66.76%(3)
P = 3939 + 86 = 31.20%(4)
R = 3939 + 37 = 51.32%(5)
F = 2? 31.20%? 51.32%31.20% + 51.32% = 38.81%(6)
In engineering terms, a WSD system is only use-
ful when its accuracy beats the so-called majority
baseline. This is the accuracy of a system that sim-
ply gives the same, most frequent, label to all test
instances. Such a classifier reaches an accuracy of
79.46% on the test corpus of mixed country names
and of 77.35% on the test corpus with instances of
Hungary.

2.3 Experimental results
Compared to this majority baseline, the results of
the unsupervised approach fall below the mark.
None of the accuracy values in tables 1, 2 and 3
lies above this baseline. With baselines of almost
80%, however, this result comes as no surprise.
Moreover, the classifier?s failure to beat the ma-
jority baseline does not necessarily mean that it is
unable to identify a ?metonymical? and a ?literal?
cluster in the data. This ability should be inves-
tigated with a ?2-test instead, which helps us de-
termine if there is a correlation between a test in-
stance?s cluster on the one hand and its label on
the other. If we compare the results with this ?2-
baseline, it emerges that in many cases, the iden-
tified clusters indeed significantly correlate with
the reading of the target words. The default (+LL
+SVD) algorithm, for instance, typically identifies
a metonymical and a literal cluster in the mixed
country data (table 1). It also becomes clear that
the best algorithms are not those with the highest
accuracy values. After all, an accuracy close to the
baseline often results from the identification of one
huge ?literal? cluster that covers most metonymies
as well.
Let us now evaluate the algorithms with respect
to the five research questions I mentioned above.
First, a comparison between the results on the
mixed country data in table 1 and the Hungary
data in table 2 shows that the former are more con-
sistent than the latter. The (+LL +SVD) algorithm
in particular is very successful on the country data.
There is thus no sign of the anticipated difficulty
with sets of mixed target words.
Second, when the algorithm is applied to the set
of mixed country names, it should not use a sto-
plist. Not a single time did the resulting clusters
correlate significantly with the target labels ? the
results were therefore not included here. A possi-
ble reason may be that the useful co-occurrences
in this data tend to be words on the stoplist, but it
should be studied more carefully if this is indeed
the case.
On the Hungary data, the use of a stoplist has a
different effect. Overall success rate remains more
or less the same (although F-scores with a stoplist
are slightly lower on average), but the results dis-
play a different pattern. Broadly speaking, a sto-
plist is most beneficial when feature selection pro-
ceeds on the basis of frequency and when large
contexts are used. Smaller contexts are more suc-
cessful without a stoplist. There is a logic to this:
as I observed above, stoplist words may be infor-
mative about the reading of a possibly metonymi-
cal word, but their usefulness increases when they
are closer to the target. If go occurs within three
words of a country name, it may point towards
a literal reading; if it occurs within a context of
twenty words, it is less likely to do so. This ex-
plains why stoplists work best in combination with
bigger contexts.
Overall, the influence of context is hard to de-
termine. Small windows of three words on either
29
side of the target are generally most successful, but
the context size that should be chosen depends on
other characteristics of the algorithm. The same
is true for dimensionality reduction and statisti-
cal feature selection. In general, the anticipated
negative effects of dimensionality reduction were
not observed, and frequency-based feature selec-
tion clearly benefited algorithms with a stoplist on
the Hungary data. However, the algorithms should
be applied to more data sets in order to investigate
the precise effect of these factors.
In short, although the investigated unsupervised
algorithms never beat the majority baseline for
Markert and Nissim?s (2002b) data, they are often
able to identify two clusters of data that correlate
with the two possible readings. This is true for
the set with one target word as well as for the set
with mixed country names. In general, the algo-
rithms that incorporate both statistical feature se-
lection and Singular Value Decomposition lead to
the best results, except for the Hungary data when
no stoplist is used. In this last case, statistical fea-
ture selection is best dropped and a large context
window should be chosen.
3 Memory-based metonymy recognition
3.1 Background
Memory-Based Learning (MBL), which is imple-
mented in the TiMBL classifier (Daelemans et al,
2004)5 rests on the hypothesis that people inter-
pret new examples of a phenomenon by comparing
them to ?stored representations of earlier experi-
ences? (Daelemans et al, 2004, p.19). It is thus
related to Case-Based reasoning, which holds that
?[r]eference to previous similar situations is often
necessary to deal with the complexities of novel
situations? (Kolodner, 1993, p.5). As a result of
this learning hypothesis, an MBL classifier such as
TiMBL eschews the formulation of complex rules
or the computation of probabilities during its train-
ing phase. Instead it remembers all training vec-
tors and gives a test vector the most frequent label
of the most similar training vectors.
TiMBL implements a number of MBL algo-
rithms. In my experiments, the so-called IB1-IG
algorithm (Daelemans and Van den Bosch, 1992)
proved most successful. It computes the distance
between two vectors X and Y by adding up the

weighted distances ? between their corresponding
feature values, as in equation (7):
?(X,Y ) =

?
i=1
wi?(xi, yi)(7)
By default, TiMBL determines the weights for each
feature on the basis of the feature?s Information
Gain (the increase in information that the knowl-
edge of that feature?s value brings with it) and the
number of values that the feature can have. The
precise equations are discussed in Daelemans et
al. (2004) and need not concern us any further
here.
3.2 Experiments
I again applied this IB1-IG algorithm to Mark-
ert and Nissim?s (2002b) location corpora. In or-
der to make my results as comparable as possi-
ble to Markert and Nissim?s (2002a) and Nissim
and Markert?s (2003), I made two changes in the
evaluation process. First, evaluation was now per-
formed with 10-fold cross-validation. Second, in
the calculation of accuracy, I made a distinction
between the several metonymical labels, so that a
misclassification within the metonymical category
was penalized as well.
I conducted two rounds of experiments. The
first used only grammatical features: the grammat-
ical function of the word (subj, obj, iobj, pp, gen,
premod, passive subj, other), its head, the pres-
ence of a second head, and the second head (if
present). Such features can be expected to iden-
tify metonymies with a high precision, but since
metonymies may have a wide variety of heads,
performance will likely suffer from data sparse-
ness (Nissim and Markert, 2003). I therefore con-
ducted a second round of experiments, in which I
added semantic information to the feature sets, in
the form of the WordNet hypernym synsets of the
head?s first sense.
WordNet is a machine-readable lexical database
that, among other things, structures English verbs,
nouns and adjectives in a hierarchy of so-called
?synonym sets? or synsets (Fellbaum, 1998). Each
word belongs to such a group of synonyms, and
each synset ?is related to its immediately more
general and more specific synsets via direct hyper-
nym and hyponym relations? (Jurafsky and Mar-
tin, 2000, p.605). Fear, for instance, belongs to
the synset fear, fearfulness, fright, which has emo-
tion as its most immediate, and psychological fea-

ture as its highest hypernym. This tree structure
of synsets thus corresponds to a hierarchy of se-
mantic classes that can be used to add semantic
knowledge to a metonymy recognition system.
My experiments investigated a few constella-
tions of semantic features. The simplest of these
used the highest hypernym synset of the head?s
first sense as an extra feature. A second approach
added to the feature vector the head?s highest hy-
pernym synsets, with a maximum of ten. If the
head did not have 10 hypernyms, its own synset
would fill the remaining features. The result of
this last approach is that the MBL classifier first
looks for heads within the same synset as the test
head. If it does not find a word that shares all hy-
pernyms with the test instance, it gradually climbs
the synset hierarchy until it finds the training in-
stances that share as many hypernyms as possi-
ble. Obviously, this approach is able to make more
fine-grained semantic distinctions than the previ-
ous one.
3.3 Experimental results
The experiments with grammatical information
showed that TiMBL is able to replicate Nissim and
Markert?s (2003) results. The obtained accuracy
and F-scores for the mixed country names in ta-
ble 4 are almost identical to Nissim and Mark-
ert?s figures. The results for the Hungary data in
table 5 lie slightly lower, but again mirror Nis-
sim and Markert?s figures closely (Katja Markert,
personal communication). This is all the more
promising since my results were reached without
any semantic information. Remember that Nis-
sim and Markert?s algorithm, in contrast, used
Dekang Lin?s (1998) clusters of semantically sim-
ilar words in order to deal with data sparseness.
Memory-Based Learning does not appear to need
this semantic information to arrive at state-of-the-
art performance. Instead, it tackles possible data
sparseness by its automatic back-off to the gram-
matical role if the target?s head is not found among
the training data.

Of course, the grammatical role of a target
word is often not sufficient for determining its lit-
eral or metonymical status. Therefore my second
round of experiments investigated if performance
can still be improved by the addition of seman-
tic information. This does not appear to be the
case. Although F-scores for the metonymical cat-
egory tended to increase slightly (as a result of
higher recall values), the system?s accuracy hardly
changed. In order to check if this was due to
the automatic selection of the head?s first Word-
Net sense, I manually disambiguated all heads in
the data. This showed that the first WordNet sense
was indeed often incorrect, but the selection of the
correct sense did not improve performance. The
reason for the failure of WordNet information to
give higher results must thus be found elsewhere.
A first possible explanation is the mismatch be-
tween WordNet?s synsets and our semantic labels.
Many synsets cover such a wide variety of words
that they allow for several readings of the target,
while others are too specific to make generaliza-
tion possible. A second possible explanation is the
predominance of prepositional heads in the data,
for which extra semantic information is useless.
In short, the experiments above demonstrate
convincingly that Memory-Based Learning is a
simple but robust approach to metonymy recog-
nition. This simplicity is a major asset, and is
in stark contrast to the competing approaches to
metonymy recognition in the literature. It should
be studied, however, if there are other features that
can further increase the classifier?s performance.
Attachment information is one such source of in-
formation that certainly deserves further attention.
4 Conclusions
This paper has investigated two computational ap-
proaches to metonymy recognition that both in
their own way are less complex than their com-
petitors in the literature. The unsupervised algo-
rithm in section 2 does not need any labelled train-
ing data; the supervised algorithm of Memory-
Based Learning incorporates an extremely simple
learning phase. Both approaches moreover have
a clear relation to models of human behaviour.

Schu?tze?s (1998) approach is related to LSA, a
model whose output correlates with human perfor-
mance on a number of language tasks. Memory-
Based Learning is akin to Case-Based Reasoning,
which holds that people approach a problem by
comparing it to similar instances in their memory.
Rather than presenting a psycholinguistic cri-
tique of these approaches, this paper has investi-
gated their ability to recognize metonymical loca-
tion names. Not surprisingly, it was shown that
the unsupervised approach is not yet a good basis
for a robust metonymy recognition system. Nev-
ertheless, it was often able to distinguish two clus-
ters in the data that correlate with the literal and
metonymical readings. It is striking that this is
also the case for a set of mixed target words from
the same category ? a type of data set that, to
my knowledge, this algorithm had not yet been ap-
plied to. Memory-Based Learning, finally, proved
to be a reliable way of recognizing metonymi-
cal words. Although this approach is much sim-
pler than many competing algorithms, it produced
state-of-the-art results, even without semantic in-
formation.
