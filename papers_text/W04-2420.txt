Abstract
In this study, we try to apply SVMs to the se-
mantic role labeling task, which is one of the
multiclass problems. As a result, we propose a
two-phase semantic role labeling model which
consists of the identification phase and the clas-
sification phase. We first identify semantic ar-
guments, and then assign semantic roles to the
identified semantic arguments. By taking the
two-phase approach, we can alleviate the un-
balanced class distribution problem, and select
the features appropriate for each task.
1 Introduction
A semantic role in a language is a semantic relation-
ship between a syntactic constituent and a predicate. The
shared task of CoNLL-2004 relates to recognize seman-
tic roles in English (X. Carreras, 2004). Given a sentence,
the task is to analyze a proposition expressed by a target
verb of a sentence. Especially, for each target verb, all
constituents in a sentence which fill semantic roles of the
verb have to be recognized. This task is based only on
partial parsing information, avoiding use of a full parser
and external lexico-semantic knowledge base. According
to previous results of the CoNLL shared task, the POS
tagged, chunked, clause identified, and named-entity rec-
ognized sentences are given as an input (Figure 1).
SVM is a well-known machine learning algorithm with
high generalization performance in high dimensional fea-
ture spaces (H. Yamada, 2003). Also, learning with com-
bination of multiple features is possible by virtue of poly-
nomial kernel functions. However, since it is a binary
classifier, we are often confronted with the unbalanced
class distribution problem in a multiclass classification
task. The larger the number of classes, the more severe
the problem is. The semantic role labeling can be formu-
lated as a multiclass classification problem. If we try to
apply SVMs in the semantic role labeling problem, we
have to find a method of resolving the unbalanced class
distribution problem.
Conceptually, semantic role labeling can be divided
into two subtasks: the identification task which finds
the boundary of semantic arguments in a given sentence,
and the classificiation task which determines the seman-
tic role of the argument. This provides us a hint of using
SVMs with less severe unbalanced class distribution. In
this paper, we present a two-phase semantic role label-
ing method which consists of an identification phase and
a classification phase. By taking two phase model based
on SVMs, we can alleviate the unbalanced class distri-
bution problem. That is, since we find only the bound-
ary of an argument in the identification phase, the num-
ber of classes is decreased into two (ARG, NON-ARG)
or three (B-ARG, I-ARG, O). Therefore, we have to build
only one or three SVM classifiers. We can alleviate the
unbalanced class distribution problem by decreasing the
number of negative examples, which is much larger than
the number of positive exampels without two-phase mod-
eling. In the classification phase, we classify only the
identified argument into a proper semantic role. This en-
ables us to reduce the computational cost by ignoring the
non-argument constitutents.
Since features for identifying arguments are different
from features for classifying a role, we need to determine
different feature sets appropriate for the tasks. For iden-
tification, we focus on the features to detect the depen-
dency between a constituent and a predicate because the
arguments are dependent on the predicate. For seman-
tic role labeling, we consider both the syntactic and the
semantic information such as the sentential form of the
target predicate, the head of a constituent, and so on. In
the following sections, we will explain the two phase se-
mantic role labeling method in detail and show some ex-
perimental results.

2 Two Phase Semantic Role Labeling
based on SVMs
We regard the semantic role labeling as a classification
problem of a syntactic constituent. However, a syntac-
tic constituent can be a chunk, or a clause. Therefore, we
have to identify the boundaries of semantic arguments be-
fore we assign roles to the arguments.
2.1 Semantic Argument Identification
This phase is the step of finding the boundary of seman-
tic arguments. A sequence of chunks or a subclause in
the immediate clause of a predicate can be a semantic ar-
gument of the predicate. A chunk or a subclause of the
predicate becomes a unit of the constituent of an argu-
ment. The chunks within the subclause are ignored.
For identifying the semantic arguments of a target
predicate, it is necessary to find the dependency rela-
tion between each constituent and a predicate. Identify-
ing a dependency relation is important for identifying a
subject/object relation (S. Buchholz, 2002) and also for
identifying the semantic arguments of a target predicate.
Therefore, the features for finding dependency relations
are implicitly represented in the feature set for the identi-
fication task.
For implementing the method based on the SVMs, we
represent a constituent of an argument with B/I/O nota-
tion, and assign one of the following classes to each con-
stituent: B-ARG class representing the beginning of se-
mantic argument, I-ARG class representing a part of a
semantic argument, or O class indicating that the con-
stituent does not belong to the semantic arguments.
Because we decide the unit of a constituent as a chunk
or a subclause, words except the predicate in the target
phrase 1 do not belong to constituent. Therefore, these
words have to be handled independently. In the training
data, we often observed that the beginning of semantic
arguments starts from the word right after the predicate.
For the agreement with the chunk boundary, we regard
the word following a predicate as the beginning word of
a new chunk. Namely, when the beginning of chunk tag
is I, we change I to B. Also, the words located in front of
the predicate in the target phrase are post-processed by 4
hand-crafted rules 2 and 211 automated rules 3 based on
frequency in the training data.
In order to restrict the search space in terms of the con-
stituents, we use the clause boundaries. The left search
boundary for identifying the semantic argument is set to
the left boundary of the second upper clause, and the right
search boundary is set to the right boundary of the imme-
diate clause.
2.1.1 Features for Identifying Semantic Argument
For this phase, we use 29 features for representing syn-
tactic and semantic information related to constituent and
predicate. Table1 shows a set of features employed. The
features can be described as follows:
? position: This is a binary feature identifying
whether the constituent is before (-1) or after (1) the
predicate in the immediate clause. The feature value
1The chunk containing a predicate is referred to as target
phrase.
2For example, if a word in target phrase is n?t, not or Not,
and POS tag of the word is RB and the distance between the
word and the predicate is less than 4, then the semantic role is
AM-NEG.
3For example, if a word in target phrase is already, and POS
tag of the word is RB, then the semantic role is AM-TMP.

Table 1: Features for Identifying a semantic argument
Figure 2: Two-phase semantic role labeling procedure using the example sentence presented in Figure 1. (P means the
target phrase containing the predicate deliver, and C means the constituent such as a chunk (e.g. Under) or a subclause
(e.g. Rockwell said))
(-2) means that the constituent is out of the immedi-
ate clause.
? distance: The distance is measured by the number
of chunks between the predicate and the constituent.
? # of VP, NP, SBAR: These are numeric features rep-
resenting the number of the specific chunk types be-
tween the predicate and the constituent.
? # of POS [CC], [,], [:]: These are numeric features
representing the number of the specific POS types
between the predicate and the constituent.
? POS [?] & POS [?]: This is used as a feature rep-
resenting the difference between # of POS[?] and #
of POS[?] counted in the range from the predicate
to the constituent. In Table 1, the feature value (-1)
means that # of POS[?] is larger than # of POS[?].
The feature value (1) conversly means that # of
POS[?] is larger than # of POS[?]. The featue value
(0) means that # of POS[?] is equal to # of POS[?].
? path: This is the syntactic path from the predicate to
the constituent, and is a symbolic feature comprising
all the elements (chunk or subclause) between the
predicate and the constituent.
? beginning word?s POS: In the target phrase, these
values appear only with VPs and represent the POS
of the syntactic head (MD, TO, VB, VBD, VBG,
VBN, VBP, VBZ). This represents the property of the
target phrase, for example, the feature value TO in-
dicates that the target phrase is to-infinitive.
? context: These are information for the predicate it-
self, the left context of the predicate, the constituent
itself, and the left and right context of the con-
stituent. In Table 1, - means the left context, and +
means the right context. In case that the constituent
is the subclause, the chunk type of the constituent is
set to the first chunk type of the subclause.
2.2 Semantic Role Assignment
In this phase, we assign appropriate semantic roles to the
identified semantic arguments. For learning SVM classi-
fiers, we consider not all semantic roles, but only 18 se-
mantic roles based on frequency in the training data (Ta-
ble 2). The (AM-MOD, AM-NEG) are post-processed by
hand-crafted rules. As we decrease the number of SVM
classifiers to be learned in the training data, the training
cost of classifiers can be reduced. Furthermore, we can
alleviate the unbalanced class distribution problem by ex-
semantic role

2.2.1 Features for Assigning Semantic Role
This phase also uses all features applied in the seman-
tic argument identification phase, except for # of POS [:]
and POS[?] & POS[?]. In addition, we use the following
feature.
? voice: This is a binary feature identifying whether
the target phrase is active or passive.
In Figure 2, we show two-phase semantic role labeling
procedure using the example sentence in Figure 1.
3 Experiments
For experiments, we utilized the SVM light package (T.
Joachims, 2002). In both the semantic argument identifi-
cation and the semantic role assignment phase, we used a
polynomial kernel (degree 2) with the one-vs-rest classi-
fication method. Table 3 shows the experimental results
on the test set and Table 4 shows the experimental results
on the development set. Table 4 also shows the perfor-
mance of each phase.
For improving the performance, we try to select the
discrminative features for each subtask. Especially, since
the performance of the identification phase is critical
to the total performance, we concentrate on improving
the identification performance. Our system obtains a F-
measure of 74.08 in the identification phase, as present-
eded in Table 4. For the argument classification task, the
our system obtains a classification accuracy (A) of 85.45.
4 Conclusion
In this paper, we present a method of two phase seman-
tic role labeling based on the support vector machines.
We found that SVM is useful to incorporate the hetero-
geneous features for the semantic role labeling. Also, by
applying the two phase model, we can alleviate the unbal-
anced class distribution problem caused by the the nega-
tive examples. Experimental results show that our system
obtains a F-measure of 63.99 on the test set and 65.78 on
the development set.
