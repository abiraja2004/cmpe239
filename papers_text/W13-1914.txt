Abstract
Child language narratives are used for lan-
guage analysis, measurement of language
development, and the detection of lan-
guage impairment. In this paper, we ex-
plore the use of Latent Dirichlet Alloca-
tion (LDA) for detecting topics from nar-
ratives, and use the topics derived from
LDA in two classification tasks: automatic
prediction of coherence and language im-
pairment. Our experiments show LDA is
useful for detecting the topics that corre-
spond to the narrative structure. We also
observed improved performance for the
automatic prediction of coherence and lan-
guage impairment when we use features
derived from the topic words provided by
LDA.
1 Introduction
Language sample analysis is a common technique
used by speech language researchers to measure
various aspects of language development. These
include speech fluency, syntax, semantics, and co-
herence. For such analysis, spontaneous narratives
have been widely used. Narrating a story or a per-
sonal experience requires the narrator to build a
mental model of the story and use the knowledge
of semantics and syntax to produce a coherent nar-
rative. Children learn from a very early age to nar-
rate stories. The different processes involved in
generating a narrative have been shown to provide
insights into the language status of children.
There has been some prior work on child lan-
guage sample analysis using NLP techniques. Sa-
hakian and Snyder (2012) used a set of linguistic
features computed on child speech samples to cre-
ate language metrics that included age prediction.
Gabani et al (2011) combined commonly used
measurements in communication disorders with
several NLP based features for the prediction of
Language Impairment (LI) vs. Typically Develop-
ing (TD) children. The features they used included
measures of language productivity, morphosyntac-
tic skills, vocabulary knowledge, sentence com-
plexity, probabilities from language models, stan-
dard scores, and error patterns. In their work, they
explored the use of language models and machine
learning methods for the prediction of LI on two
types of child language data: spontaneous and nar-
rative data.
Hassanali et al (2012a) analyzed the use of
coherence in child language and performed auto-
matic detection of coherence from child language
transcripts using features derived from narrative
structure such as the presence of critical narrative
components and the use of narrative elements such
as cognitive inferences and social engagement de-
vices. In another study, Hassanali et al (2012b)
used several coherence related features to auto-
matically detect language impairment.
LDA has been used in the field of narrative anal-
ysis. Wallace et al (2012) adapted LDA to the task
of multiple narrative disentanglement, in which
the aim was to tease apart narratives by assigning
passages from a text to the subnarratives that they
belong to. They achieved strong empirical results.
In this paper, we explore the use of LDA for
child narrative analysis. We aim to answer two
questions: Can we apply LDA to children nar-
ratives to identify meaningful topics? Can we
represent these topics automatically and use them
for other tasks, such as coherence detection and
language impairment prediction? Our results are
promising. We found that using LDA topic model-
ing can infer useful topics, and incorporating fea-
tures derived from such automatic topics improves
the performance of coherence classification and
language impairment detection over the previously
reported results.

2 Data
For the purpose of the experiments, we used the
Conti-Ramsden dataset (Wetherell et al, 2007a;
Wetherell et al, 2007b) from the CHILDES
database (MacWhinney, 2000). This dataset con-
sists of transcripts belonging to 118 adolescents
aged 14 years. The adolescents were given the
wordless picture story book ?Frog, where are
you?? and asked to narrate the story based on the
pictures. The storybook is about the adventures of
a boy who goes searching for his missing pet frog.
Even though our goal is to perform child narrative
analysis, we used this dataset from adoloscents
since it was publicly available, and was annotated
for language impairment and coherence. Of the
118 adolescents, 99 adolescents belonged to the
TD group and 19 adolescents belonged to the lan-
guage impaired group. Hassanali et al (2012a)
annotated this dataset for coherence. A transcript
was annotated as coherent, as long as there was no
difficulty in understanding the narrative, and in-
coherent otherwise. Table 1 gives the TD and LI
distribution on a 2-scale coherence level. Figure
1 shows an example of a transcript produced by a
TD child.

3 Narrative Topic Analysis Using LDA
Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) (Blei et al,
2003) has been used in NLP to model topics within
a collection of documents. In this study, we use
LDA to detect topics in narratives. Upon exam-
ining the transcripts, we observed that each topic
was described in about 3 to 4 utterances. We there-
fore segmented the narratives into chunks of 3 ut-
terances, with the assumption that each segment
corresponds roughly to one topic.
We used the software by Blei et al1 to perform
LDA. Prior to performing LDA, we removed the
stop words from the transcripts. We chose ? to
be 0.8 and K to be 20, where ? is the parameter
of the Dirichlet prior on the per-document topic
distributions and K denotes the number of topics
considered in the model.
We chose to use the transcripts of TD children
for generating the topics, because the transcripts of
TD children have fewer disfluencies, incomplete
utterances, and false starts. As we can observe
from Table 1, a higher percentage of TD children
produced coherent narratives when compared to
children with LI.
Table 2 gives the topic words for the top 10
topics extracted using LDA. The topics in Table
2 were manually labeled after examination of the
topic words extracted using LDA. We found that
some of the topics extracted by LDA corresponded
to subtopics. For example, searching for the frog
in the house has subtopics of the boy searching
for the frog in room and the dog falling out of the
window, which were part of the topics covered by
LDA. The subtopics are marked in italics in Table
2.
The following narrative components were iden-
tified as important features for the automatic pre-
diction of coherence by Hassanali et al (2012a).
1. Instantiation: introduce the main characters
of the story: the boy, the frog, and the dog,
and the frog goes missing
2. 1st episode: search for the frog in the house
3. 2nd episode: search for the frog in the tree
4. 3rd episode: search for the frog in the hole in
the ground
5. 4th episode: search for the frog near the rock
6. 5th episode: search for the frog behind the
log
7. Resolution: boy finds the frog in the river and
takes a frog home
Upon examining the topics extracted by LDA, we
observed that all the components mentioned above

topics corresponded to a picture or two in the sto-
rybook.
4 Using LDA Topics for Coherence and
Language Impairment Classification
We extended the use of LDA for two tasks,
namely: the automatic evaluation of coherence
and the automatic evaluation of language impair-
ment. For the experiments below, we used the
WEKA toolkit (Hall et al, 2009) and built sev-
eral models using the naive Bayes, Bayesian net
classifier, Logistic Regression, and Support Vec-
tor Machine (SVM) classifier. Of all these classi-
fiers, the naive Bayes classifier performed the best,
and we report the results using the naive Bayes
classifier in Tables 3 and 4. We performed all the
experiments using leave-one-out cross-validation,
wherein we excluded the test transcript that be-
longed to a TD child from the training set when
generating topics using LDA.
4.1 Automatic Evaluation of Coherence
We treat the automatic evaluation of coherence
as a classification task. A transcript could either
be classified as coherent or incoherent. We use
the results of Hassanali et al (2012a) as a base-
line. They used the presence of narrative episodes,
and the counts of narrative quality elements such
as cognitive inferences and social engagement de-
vices as features in the automatic prediction of co-
herence. We add the features that we automati-
cally extracted using LDA.
We checked for the presence of at least six of
the ten topic words or their synonyms per topic in
a window of 3 utterances. If the topic words were
present, we took this as a presence of a topic; oth-
erwise we denoted it as an absence of a topic. In
total, there were 20 topics that we extracted using
LDA, which is higher compared to the 8 narrative
structure topics that were annotated for by Has-
sanali et al (2012a).
Table 3 gives the results for the automatic clas-
sification of coherence. As we observe in Table
3, there is an improvement in performance over
the baseline. We attribute this to the inclusion of
subtopics that were extracted using LDA.
4.2 Automatic Evaluation of Language
Impairment
We extended the use of LDA to create a summary
of the narratives. For the purpose of generating the
summary, we considered only the narratives gen-
erated by TD children in the training set. We gen-
erated a summary, by choosing 5 utterances cor-
responding to each topic that was generated using
LDA, thereby yielding a summary that consisted
of 100 utterances.
We observed that different words were used to
represent the same concept. For example, ?look?
and ?search? were used to represent the concept
of searching for the frog. Since the narration was
based on a picture storybook, many of the children
used different terms to refer to the same animal.
For example, ?the deer? in the story has been inter-
preted to be ?deer?, ?reindeer?, ?moose?, ?stag?,
?antelope? by different children. We created an
extended topic vocabulary using Wordnet to in-
clude words that were semantically similiar to the
topic keywords. In addition, for an utterance to be

Table 3: Automatic classification of coherence on a 2-scale coherence level
in the summary, we put in the additional constraint
that neighbouring utterances within a window of
3 utterances also talk about the same topic. We
used this summary for constructing unigram and
bigram word features for the automatic prediction
of LI.
The features we constructed for the prediction
of LI were as follows:
1. Bigrams of the words in the summary
2. Presence or absence of the words in the sum-
mary regardless of the position
3. Presence or absence of the topics detected by
LDA in the narratives
4. Presence or absence of the topic words that
were detected using LDA
We used both the topics detected and the pres-
ence/absence of topic words as features since the
same topic word could be used across several top-
ics. For example, the words ?frog?, ?dog?, ?boy?,
and ?search? are common across several topics.
We refer to the above features as ?new features?.
Table 4 gives the results for the automatic pre-
diction of LI using different features. As we can
observe, the performance improves to 0.872 when
we add the new features to Gabani?s and the nar-
rative structure features. When we use the new
features by themselves to predict language impair-
ment, the performance is the worst. We attribute
this to the fact that other feature sets are richer
since these features take into account aspects such
as syntax and narrative structure.
We performed feature analysis on the new fea-
tures to see what features contributed the most.
The top scoring features were the presence or ab-
sence of the topics detected by LDA that corre-
sponded to the introduction of the narrative, the
resolution of the narrative, the search for the frog
in the room, and the search for the frog behind
the log. The following bigram features generated
from the summary contributed the most: ?deer

5 Conclusions
In this paper, we explored the use of LDA in the
context of child language analysis. We used LDA
to extract topics from child language narratives
and used these topic keywords to create a sum-
mary of the narrative and an extended vocabu-
lary. The topics extracted using LDA not only
covered the main components of the narrative but
also covered subtopics too. We then used the LDA
topic words and the summary to create features
for the automatic prediction of coherence and lan-
guage impairment. Due to higher coverage of the
LDA topics as compared to manual annotation, we
found an increase in performance of both auto-
matic prediction of coherence and language im-
pairment with the addition of the new features. We
conclude that the use of LDA to model topics and
extract summaries is promising for child language
analysis.
