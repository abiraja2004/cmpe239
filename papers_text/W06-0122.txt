Abstract 
In sequence labeling tasks, applying dif-
ferent machine learning models and fea-
ture sets usually leads to different results. 
In this paper, we exploit two ensemble 
methods in order to integrate multiple 
results generated under different condi-
tions. One method is based on majority 
vote, while the other is a memory-based 
approach that integrates maximum en-
tropy and conditional random field clas-
sifiers. Our results indicate that the 
memory-based method can outperform 
the individual classifiers, but the major-
ity vote method cannot. 
1 Introduction 
Sequence labeling and segmentation tasks have 
been studied extensively in the fields of computa-
tional linguistics and information extraction. Sev-
eral tasks, including, word segmentation, and 
semantic role labeling, provide rich information 
for various applications, such as segmentation in 
Chinese information retrieval and named entity 
recognition in biomedical literature mining.  
Probabilistic state automata models, such as the 
Hidden Markov model  (HMM) [6] and condi-
tional random fields (CRF) [5] are some of best, 
and therefore most popular, approaches for se-
quence labeling tasks. Both HMM and CRF con-
sider that the state transition and the state 
prediction are conditional on the observation of 
data. The advantage of the CRF model is that 
richer feature sets can be considered, because, 
unlike HMM, it does not make a dependence as-
sumption. However, the obvious drawback of the 
CRF model is that it needs more computing re-
sources, so we can not apply all the features of 
the model. One possible way to resolve this prob-
lem is to effectively combine the results of vari-
ous individual classifiers trained with different 
feature sets. In this paper, we use two ensemble 
methods to combine the results of the classifiers. 
We also combine the results generated by two 
machine learning models: maximum entropy 
(ME) [1] and CRF. One ensemble method is 
based on the majority vote [3], and the other is 
the memory based learner [7]. Although the en-
semble methods have been applied in some se-
quence labeling tasks [2],[3], similar work in 
Chinese named entity recognition is scarce. 
Our Chinese named entity tagger uses a charac-
ter-based model. For English named entity tasks, 
a character-based NER model proposed by Dan 
Klein [4] proves the usefulness of substrings 
within words. In Chinese NER, the character-
based model is more straightforward, since there 
are no spaces between Chinese words and each 
Chinese character is actually meaningful.  An-
other reason for using a character-based model is 
that it can avoid the errors sometimes made by a 
Chinese word segmentor.  
The remainder of this paper is organized as fol-
lows. In the Section 2, we introduce the machine 
learning models, the features we apply in the ma-
chine learning models, and the ensemble methods. 
In Section 3, we briefly describe the experimental 
data and the experiment results. Then, in Section 
4, we present our conclusions.. 
2 Method 
2.1 Machine Learning Models 
In this section, we introduce ME and CRF.
Maximum Entropy 
ME[1] is a statistical modeling technique used 
for estimating the conditional probability of a 
target label based on given information. The 
technique computes the probability p(y|x), where 
y denotes all possible outcomes of the space, and 
x denotes all possible features of the space. The 
computation of p(y|x) depends on a set of fea-
142
tures in x; the features are helpful for making 
predictions about the outcomes, y. 
Given a set of features and a training set, the ME 
estimation process produces a model, in which 
every feature fi has a weight ?i. The ME model 
can be represented by the following formula: 
( ) ( ) ( )???
?
???
?= ?
i
ii yxfxz
xyp ,exp| ?1
, 
( ) ( )? ? ???
?
???
?=
y i
ii yxfxz ,exp ?
.  
The probability is derived by multiplying the 
weights of the active features (i.e., those fi (y,x) = 
1). 
Conditional Random Field 
A conditional random field (CRF)[5] can be seen 
as an undirected graph model in which the nodes 
corresponding to the label sequence y are condi-
tional on the observed sequence x. The goal of 
CRF is to find the label sequence y that has the 
maximized probability, given an observation se-
quence x. The formula for the CRF model can be 
written as: 
( ) ( ) ( )( )xyxxy ,exp1| jj j FZP ?= ? ,  
where ?j is the parameter of a corresponding fea-
ture Fj , Z(x) is an normalizing factor, and Fj can 
be written as:   
( ) (? = ?= ni iiij iyyfF 0 1 ,,,, xxy ), 
where i means the relative position in the se-
quence, and yi-1 and yi denote the label at position 
i-1 and i respectively. In this paper, we only con-
sider linear chain and first-order Markov assump-
tion CRFs. In NER applications, a feature 
function fj (yi-1, yi, x, i) can be set to check 
whether x is a specific character, and whether yi-1 
is a label (such as Location) and yi is a label (such 
as Others).   
2.2 Chinese Named Entity Recognition 
In this section, we present the features applied in 
our CRF and ME models, namely, characters, 
words, and chuck information. 
Character Features 
The character features we apply in the CRF 
model and the ME model are presented in Tables 
1 and 2 respectively. The numbers listed in the 
feature type column indicate the relative position 
of a character in the sliding window. For example, 
-1 means the previous character of the target 
character. Therefore, the characters in those posi-
tions are applied in the model. The numbers in 
parentheses mean that the feature includes a 
combination of the characters in those positions. 
The unigrams in Tables 1 and 2 indicate that the 
listed features only consider to their own labels, 
whereas the bigram model considers the combi-
nation of the current label and the previous label. 
Since ME does not consider multiple states in a 
single feature, there are only unigrams in Table 2. 
In addition, as ME can handle more features than 
CRF, we apply extra features in the ME model

Word Information  
Because of the limitations of the closed task, we 
use the NER corpus to train the segmentors based 
on the CRF model. To simulate noisy word in-
formation in the test corpus, we use a ten-fold 
method for training segmentors to tag the training 
corpus. The word features we apply in our NER 
systems are presented in Tables 3 and 4. 
In addition to the word itself, chuck information, 
i.e., the relative position of a character in a word, 
is also valuable information. Hence, we also add 
chuck information to our models. As the diversity 
of Chinese words is greater than that of Chinese 
characters, the number of features that can be 
used in CRF is much lower than the number that 
can be used in ME.

2.3 Ensemble Methods 
Majority vote 
We can not put all the features into the CRF 
model because of its limited resources. Therefore, 
we train several CRF classifiers with different 
feature sets so that we can use as many features 
143
as possible. Then, we use the following simple, 
equally weighted linear equation, called majority 
vote, to combine the results of the CRF classifi-
ers.   
( ) ( )? == Ti i xyCxyS 0 ,, , 
where S(y,x) is the score of a label y and a char-
acter x respectively; T denotes the total number 
of CRF models; and the value of Ci(y,x) is 1 if 
the decision of the result of the ith CRF model is 
y, otherwise it is zero. The highest score of y is 
chosen as the label of x. The results are incorpo-
rated into the Viterbi algorithm to search for the 
path with the maximum scores. 
In this paper, the first step in the majority vote 
experiment is to train three CRF classifiers with 
different feature sets. Then, in the second step, 
we use the results obtained in the first step to 
generate the voting scores for the Viterbi algo-
rithm. 
Memory Based learner 
The memory-based learning method memorizes 
all examples in a training corpus. If a word is 
unknown, the memory-based classifier uses the 
k-nearest neighbors to find the most similar ex-
ample as the answer. Instead of using the com-
plete algorithm of the memory-based learner, we 
do not handle unseen data. In our memory- based 
combination method, the learner remembers all 
named entities from the results of the various 
classifiers and then tags the characters that were 
originally tagged as ?Other?. For example, if a 
character x is tagged by one classifier as ?0? 
(?Others? tag) and if the memory-based classifier 
learns from another classifier that this character 
is tagged as PER, then x will be tagged as ?B-
PER? by the memory-based classifier. 
The obvious drawback of this method is that the 
precision rate might decrease as the recall rate 
increases. Therefore, we set the following three 
rules to filter out samples that are likely to have a 
high error rate.  
1. Named entities can not be tagged as differ-
ent named entity tags by different classifiers. 
2. We set an absolute frequency threshold to 
filter out examples that occur less than the 
threshold. 
3. We set a relative frequency threshold to 
filter out examples that occur less than the 
threshold. For example, if a word x appears 
10 times in the corpus, then half of the in-
stances of x have to be tagged as named en-
tities; otherwise, x will be filtered out of the 
memory classifier. 
In our experiment, we used the memory-based 
learner to memorize the named entities from the 
tagging results of an ME classifier and a CRF 
classifier, and then tagged the tagging results of 
the CRF classifier.   
3 Experiments 
3.1 Data 
We selected the corpora of City University of 
Hong Kong (CityU) and Microsoft Research 
(MSRA) corpora to evaluate our methods. CityU 
is a Traditional Chinese corpus, and MSRA is 
Simplified Chinese corpus. 
3.2 Results 
Table 5 shows the results of several methods ap-
plied to the MSRA corpus. The memory-based 
ensemble method, which combines the results of 
a maximum entropy model and those of a CRF 
classifier, achieves the best performance. The 
majority vote combined with the results of three 
CRF models based on different feature sets has 
the worst performance.

CRF 86.23 77.40 81.58 
 
The results obtained on Cityu, presented in Table 
6, show that the single CRF classifier achieved 
the best performance. None of the ensemble 
methods can outperform the non-ensemble meth-
ods.

CRF 92.01 85.45 88.61 
 
Tables 7 and 8 show the results of the memory-
based ensemble methods under different rules. 
We set the frequency threshold as 2 and the rela-
tive frequency threshold as 0.5. The results show 
that the relative frequencies rule effectively re-
duces the loss of precision caused by more enti-
ties being tagged by the memory-based classifier. 
The memory-based ensemble method works well 
on the MSRA corpus, but not on the CityU cor-
pus. In the MSRA corpus, the memory-based 
144
ensemble method outperforms the individual 
CRF model by approximately 0.4 % in FB1. We 
found that the memory-based classifier can not 
achieve a better performance than the CRF model 
because it misclassifies many organizations? 
names. Therefore, we chose another strategy that 
restricts the memory-based classifier to tagging 
person names only. Under this restriction, the 
performance of the memory-based classifier im-
proves FB1 by approximately 0.2%.

4 Conclusion  
In this paper, we use ME and CRF models to 
train a Chinese named entity tagger. Like previ-
ous researchers, we found that CRF models out-
perform ME models. We also apply two 
ensemble methods, namely, majority vote and 
memory-based approaches, to the closed NER 
shared task. Our results show that integrating 
individual classifiers as the majority vote ap-
proach does not outperform the individual classi-
fiers. Furthermore, a memory-based combination 
only seems to work when we restrict the mem-
ory-based classifier to handling person names.
