Since the guidance given to the panel was more provocative than regulative, I 
have organized my statement around just one of the questions: 
What is special about Text Generation relative to NL Understanding? 
This breaks down conveniently into parts: 
1. Are there foundational ideas that generation and understanding work share? 
2. What are the technical distinctives of generation? 
3. Are those distinctives real? 
4. What are the special characteristics of generation as a research task? 
1 Shared  Foundat ions  
While there are considerable differences in the tasks to be solved in Text 
Generation and NL Understanding, the two areas of research draw on a significant 
number of shared ideas and knowledge. 2 They constitute an account of what the facts 
and phenomena of natural language are. Moving from fine-grained to coarse-grained 
phenomena, they include: 
1. Lexicon: Most work in both understanding and generation assumes a 
taxonomy of basic word classes, a notion of the semantic senses of words and 
a morphology. Also in both, there is currently a strong trend toward 
recognizing many sorts of lexical complexities: idioms, collocations, lexical 
functions (in several senses) and other inter-item interactions. 
2. Grammar: Ther are shared descriptions of the types of constructions that are 
available in a specific language. At a minimum, a language processing

program includes a grammar, some specification of a set of syntactic 
patterns. 
. Discourse Phenomena: Descriptions of various discourse phenomena are 
important in both lines of work. Anaphora is particularly prominent. A 
cluster of phenomena identified with terms such as theme, focus and topic is 
also basic. There is also a general recognition that ordinary language does 
not make explicit everything that is being conveyed, and that the 
non-explicit material is just as important as the explicit material in effective 
language use. It seems likely that there will be substantial cross-fertilization 
from these two lines of current work on discourse, partly because the 
available descriptions of discourse are still not well agreed upon. 
. Situational Phenomena: The situation in which the language is used, 
including a description of the language user and the task at hand, are 
acknowledged as important and actively studied. Goal pursuit by the 
language user(s) is regarded as an important orienting notion. 
Both generation and understanding are working hard on all of these. Inevitably, 
there is some complemenarity (see Section 3.) But although the descriptive foundations 
are shared in a loose way, we will see that the sorts of problems addressed differ 
sharply. 
More substantial sharing occurs in the areas of knowledge representation and 
inference. Here the problems and solutions, not just the recognition of phenomena, are 
shared. There is hope for convergence, for one all-sufficient underlying representational 
form, and for a non-directional view of language. It is often suggested that an adequate 
text generator must have an understander inside to check its work. Still, the research 
activity is dominated by the differences rather than the shared elements. 
2 Techn ica l  D is t inc t ives  o f  Text  Generat ion  
Just observing work on understanding and generation, it's clear that the people 
working and writing on these topics are usually not writing about the same things. To 
start to understand the situation we can look at the technical differences and then later 
judge how fundamental these differences are. 
What  are the apparent differences? One class consists of problems which are 
major sources of difficulty in NL Understandin~ but which are minor or absent in NL 
Generation: 
1. Coverin~ all the ways to say thin~s is not a problem. These days it's 
sufficient (and difficult enough) to have one way to say everything, with just 
enough perturbations to get sufficiently fluent text.

Goal identification is not a problem. A generation system can know its own 
goals easily. Of course, coming up with the right goals is still a problem. 
Vocabulary coverage is not a problem. The lexicon of a generator can be 
created in correspondence with available knowledge; the user's unbounded 
number of other ways of expressing the knowledge do not have an impact. 
Ambiguity is a secondary problem. People, operating in context with a rich 
knowledge of the subject matter, can disambiguate generated language very 
well. 
Another class consists of problems which are important in Generation but minor 
or absent in Understanding: 
. Deciding how much to say, and what things to not say, are problems. This 
involves maintaining brevity, avoiding saying what is too obvious, and yet 
providing sufficient background information to make the generated text 
comprehensible. 
. Design of text structure is a problem. This is sometimes taken to be the 
coherence problem as well: text must be coherent, and appropriate structure 
makes it so. Structure design has many identifiable subproblems: 
a? Structure building includes addin~ material to make presentation of 
the basic sub iect matter work. For example, it is often necessary to 
add evidence, concessives, circumstantials, antithesis, contrast and 
other supporting material. 
b. Structurin~ a text causes assertion-like effects in addition to the 
expected effects of  individual clauses. Controlling these effects, and 
taking advantage of them as a resource, is a problem. 
c. Orderin~ the material for presentation is very consequential. 
d. Various sorts of text carry the expectation of special patterns and 
formulaic text: titles, abstracts, salutations, origination dates, 
authorship notes and acknowledgments. 
e.  Makin~ the text smooth flowin~ and easy to comprehend involves 
leading the reader's attention. There are many particular techniques 
which contribute. This requirement constrains structure design and 
requires extra work at the structural and sentential levels. 
3. Even after creating a detailed text plan, with all clauses identified, there are 
substantial additional technical issues in carrying out the plan. 
a. Presuming that the plan is in terms of a sequence of (effects of) 
229 
clauses, the sentence boundaries are not determined. Which clauses 
should be combined into sentences? What relations need to be 
expressed by conjunctions? What conjunction uses can be reduced to 
noun conjunction or some other lower rank? 
b. Decidin~ when to use anaphora is a problem. 
C. 
d. 
Lexical selection is a problem. Related, there are many varieties of 
idioms and lexical colocations whose restricted character is important 
only for generation, not understanding. 
English has rather elaborate provisions which enable the reader's 
attention to flow smoothly over the material. These include emphasis 
devices, and also various kinds of theme control (including 
passivization as one of many kinds). These must be controlled in order 
to create high quality running text. 
3 The  A l te rnat ive  View: The Differences in the Tasks  are  Unrea l  
The claim has been made that there are really no underlying language problems 
that are unique to either generation or understanding. Rather, every evident problem 
has a counterpart which may or may not be evident on the other side of the fence. So, 
for example, the counterpart of (Generation: deciding how much to say) is 
(Understanding: identify the selectivity involved in saying just this much.) The 
counterpart of (Generation: lexical selection) is (Understanding: drawing conclusions 
from the fact that this particular term was used rather than alternative terms.) And so 
forth. The underlying claim is that if a process is used in generation, it has effects 
which may be discernible, interpretable, ven significant. The earliest use of this claim 
that I know was by Chip Bruce, in the presentation of \[Bruce 75\]. 
As a statement of what sorts of effects can (in principle) be found, this has a 
certain plausibility, and may be technically correct. Nevertheless, it does not represent 
the state of the art in terms of problems actually worked on. Instead, the lists of 
problems being addressed by generation and understanding research differ substantially, 
and will remain different for a long time to come. This is because the problems that 
limit the achievable quality of performance~ the problems that pace progress, differ 
strongly between ~eneration and understanding. 
4 D is t inct ives  of Text  Generat ion  as a Research  Task  
There are non-technical factors that make research into text generation very 
different from text understanding research: 
1. In both duration and number of workers, there has been far less activity in 
~eneration than in understanding. In spite of much recent expansion in 
230 
. 
. 
generation work (see \[Kempen S6\] for a representative collection) there are 
far fewer precedents and established results in generation. Work in 
generation is less known, so much so that some people habitually conceive of 
all AI language research as NLU (natural anguage understanding.) (See, for 
example, the IJCAI87 call for papers.) 
It is easier to control a ~eneration task, since it is not subject to an 
uncontrolled input source (the user.) There is inherently more control over 
vocabulary, lexical phenomena, syntactic range and semantic diversity in 
generation. 
Generation and understanding need to be understood in terms of an overall 
model of human communication. The nature of language and the 
constraints on its use come from its role in communication. If investigation 
of communication is taken as the underlyin~ task, then ~eneration ~ives 
much better access to that task~ just because it is much easier to develop 
methods and programs that work with whole discourses rather than being 
restricted to tiny numbers of sentences. 
5 Conc lus ions  
The set of technical problems that limit the quality of generated text is very 
different from the corresponding set of problems that limits the quality of natural 
language understanding. While the problems might, in principle, be problems of both 
understanding and generation, they are not so in practise. 
Generation provides ome important advantages over understanding as a research 
subject, because it does not require coping with an uncontrolled language-user. As a 
result, research into computational models of communication can sometimes be made 
more efficient by studying generation.
