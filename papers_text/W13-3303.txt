Abstract
Explicit discourse connectives in a source
language text are not always translated to
comparable words or phrases in the tar-
get language. The paper provides a corpus
analysis and a method for semi-automatic
detection of such cases. Results show
that discourse connectives are not trans-
lated into comparable forms (or even any
form at all), in up to 18% of human refer-
ence translations from English to French
or German. In machine translation, this
happens much less frequently (up to 8%
only). Work in progress aims to cap-
ture this natural implicitation of discourse
connectives in current statistical machine
translation models.
1 Introduction
Discourse connectives (DCs), a class of frequent
cohesive markers, such as although, however, for
example, in addition, since, while, yet, etc., are es-
pecially prone to ?translationese?, i.e. the use of
constructions in the target language (TL) that dif-
fer in frequency or position from how they would
be found in texts born in the language. That is,
?translationese? makes DCs prone to being trans-
lated in ways that can differ markedly from their
use in the source language. (Blum-Kulka, 1986;
Cartoni et al, 2011; Ilisei et al, 2010; Halverson,
2004; Hansen-Schirra et al, 2007; Zufferey et al,
2012). For cohesive markers and DCs, Koppel and
Ordan (2011) and Cartoni et al (2011) have shown
that they may be more explicit (increased use) or
less explicit (decreased use) in translationese. The
paper focuses on the latter case, but the same de-
tection method can be applied in reverse, in order
to find increased use (explicitation) as well.
In English about 100 types of explicit DCs have
been annotated in the Penn Discourse TreeBank,
or PDTB (Prasad et al, 2008) (We say more about
this in Section 3.1). The actual set of markers or
connectives is however rather open-ended (Prasad
et al, 2010). DCs signal discourse relations that
connect two spans of text and can be ambiguous
with respect to the discourse relation they convey.
Moreover, the same DC can simultaneously con-
vey more than one discourse relation. For exam-
ple, while can convey contrast or temporality, or
both at the same time. On the other hand, dis-
course relations can also be conveyed implicitly,
without an explicit DC.
Human translators can chose to not translate a
SL DC with a TL DC, where the latter would be re-
dundant or where the SL discourse relation would
more naturally be conveyed in the TL by other
means (cf. Section 2). We will use the term ?zero-
translation? or ?implicitation? for a valid transla-
tion that conveys the same sense as a lexically ex-
plicit SL connective, but not with the same form.
As we will show, current SMT models either learn
the explicit lexicalization of a SL connective to
a TL connective, or treat the former as a ran-
dom variation, realizing it or not. Learning other
valid ways of conveying the same discourse rela-
tion might not only result in more fluent TL text,
but also help raise its BLEU score by more closely
resembling its more implicit human reference text.
The paper presents work in progress on a cor-
pus study where zero-translations of DCs have
been semi-automatically detected in human refer-
ence and machine translations from English (EN)
to French (FR) and German (DE) (Section 3).
Two types of discourse relations that are very fre-
quently omitted in FR and DE translations are
studied in detail and we outline features on how
these omissions could be modeled into current
SMT systems (Section 4).

2 Implicitation of connectives in
translation
Figure 1 is an extract from a news article in the
newstest2010 data set (see Section 3.2). It con-
tains two EN connectives ? as and otherwise ?
that were annotated in the PDTB1. Using the set of
discourse relations of the PDTB, as can be said to
signal the discourse relation CAUSE (subtype Rea-
son), and otherwise the discourse relation ALTER-
NATIVE. This is discussed further in Section 3.1.

still needing a chauffeur, 1. as the town was still
unknown to him. 2. Otherwise he could have
driven himself ? 3. after all, no alcohol was
involved and the 55-year-old was not drunk.

Figure 1: Examples of EN source connectives
translated as zero or by other means in human ref-
erence translations.
The human reference translations do not trans-
late the first connective as explicitly. In FR there
is no direct equivalent, and the reason why the
man needed a driver is given with a relative clause:
...dans la ville qui... (lit.: in the town that was still
foreign to him). In DE as is realized by means of
a preposition, wegen (lit.: because of). The sec-
ond EN connective otherwise, maintains its form
in translation to the target connective autrement in
FR and ansonsten in DE.
On the other hand, baseline SMT systems for

that was not annotated in the PDTB, and our data as a whole
contains other possible connectives not yet annotated there,
including given that and at the same time. We did not analyse
such possible connectives in the work described here.
EN/FR and EN/DE (Section 3.2) both translated
the two connectives as and otherwise explicitly by
the usual target connectives, in FR: comme, sinon
and in DE wie, sonst.
3 Semi-automatic detection of
zero-translations
3.1 Method
The semi-automatic method that identifies zero- or
non-connective translations in human references
and machine translation output is based on a list
of 48 EN DCs with a frequency above 20 in the
Penn Discourse TreeBank Version 2.0 (Prasad et
al., 2008). In order to identify which discourse re-
lations are most frequently translated as zero, we
have assigned each of the EN DCs the level-2 dis-
course relation that it is most frequently associated
with in the PDTB corpus. The total list of EN con-
nectives is given in Table 1.
For every source connective, we queried its
most frequent target connective translations from
the online dictionary Linguee2 and added them to
dictionaries of possible FR and DE equivalents.
With these dictionaries and Giza++ word align-
ment (Och and Ney, 2003), the SL connectives
can be located and the sentences of its transla-
tion (reference and/or automatic) can be scanned
for an aligned occurrence of the TL dictionary
entries. If more than one DC appears in the
source sentence and/or a DC is not aligned with a
connective or connective-equivalent found in the
dictionaries, the word position (word index) of
the SL connective is compared to the word in-
dexes of the translation in order to detect whether
a TL connective (or connective-equivalent from
the dictionaries) appears in a 5-word window to
its left and right.3. This also helps filtering out
cases of non-connective uses of e.g. separately
or once as adverbs. Finally, if no aligned entry
is present and the alignment information remains
empty, the method counts a zero-translation and
collects statistics on these occurrences.
After a first run where we only allowed for ac-
tual connectives as translation dictionary entries,
we manually looked through 400 cases for each,
FR and DE reference translations, that were output
2http://www.linguee.com
3The method extends on the ACT metric (Hajlaoui and
Popescu-Belis, 2013) that measures MT quality in terms of
connectives in order to detect more types of DCs and their
equivalents.

as zero-translations (in the newtest2012 data, see
Section 3.2). We found up to 100 additional cases
that actually were not implicitations, but conveyed
the SL connective?s meaning by means of a para-
phrase, e.g. EN: if ? FR: dans le cas ou` (lit.: in
case where) ? DE: im Falle von (lit.: in case of).
For example, the EN connective otherwise ended
up with the dictionary entries in Figure 3.

3.2 Data
For the experiments described here, we con-
catenated two data sets, the newstest2010 and
newstest2012 parallel texts as publicly available
by the Workshop on Machine Translation4. The
texts consist of complete articles from various
daily news papers that have been translated from
EN to FR, DE and other languages by translation
agencies.
In total, there are 5,492 sentences and 117,799
words in the SL texts, of which 2,906 are tokens
4http://www.statmt.org/wmt12/
of the 48 EN connectives. See Table 1 for the con-
nectives and their majority class, which aggregate
to the detailed statistics given in Table 2.

course connectives (2,906 tokens) from the
newstest2010+2012 corpora, whose majority
sense conveys one of the 10 PDTB level-2 dis-
course relations (Rel.) listed here.
To produce machine translations of the same
data sets we built EN/FR and EN/DE base-
line phrase-based SMT systems, by using the
Moses decoder (Koehn et al, 2007), with the Eu-
roparl corpus v7 (Koehn, 2005) as training and
newtest2011 as tuning data. The 3-gram language
model was built with IRSTLM (Federico et al,
2008) over Europarl and the rest of WMT?s news
data for FR and DE.
3.3 Results
In order to group the individual counts of zero-
translations per DC according to the discourse re-
lation they signal, we calculated the relative fre-
quency of zero-translations per relation as percent-
ages, see Figures 2 for EN/FR, and 4 for EN/DE.
21
Figure 4: Percentage of zero-translations in newstest2010+2012 for EN/DE per discourse relation and
translation type: human reference (Ref) or MT output (MT).
The total percentage of zero-translations in the ref-
erences and the baseline MT output is given in
Table 3.
A first observation is that an MT system seems
to produce zero-translations for DCs significantly
less often than human translators do. Human FR
translations seem to have a higher tendency to-
ward omitting connectives than the ones in DE.
Figures 2 and 4 also show that the discourse re-
lations that are most often rendered as zero are de-
pendent on the TL. In the FR reference transla-
tions, SYNCHRONY, ALTERNATIVE and CONCES-
SION account for most implicitations, while in the
DE reference translations, CONDITION, ALTER-
NATIVE and CONCESSION are most often left im-
plicit.

man references (Ref) and MT output (MT) over
newstest2010+2012.
The results are to some extent counterintuitive
as one would expect that semantically dense dis-
course relations like CONCESSION would need to
be explicit in translation in order to convey the
same meaning. Section 4 presents some non-
connective means available in the two TLs, by
which the discourse relations are still established.
We furthermore looked at the largest implicita-
tion differences per discourse relation in the hu-
man reference translations and the MT output. For
EN/FR for example, 13.8% of all CONDITION re-
lations are implicitated in the references, by mak-
ing use of paraphrases such as dans le moment
ou` (lit.: in the moment where) or dans votre cas
(lit.: in your case) in place of the EN connective
if. The MT system translates if in 99.4% of all
cases to the explicit FR connective si. Similarly,
for INSTANTIATION relations and the EN connec-
tive for instance in the references, the translators
made constrained use of verbal paraphrases such
as on y trouve (lit.: among which we find). MT on
the other hand outputs the explicit FR connective
par exemple in all cases of for instance.
For EN/DE, there is the extreme case, where
ALTERNATIVE relations are, in human reference
translations, quite often implicitated (in 23.3% of
all cases), whereas the MT system translates all
the instances explicitly to DE connectives: wenn
(unless), sonst (otherwise) and statt, stattdessen,
anstatt (instead). The translators however make
use of constructions with a sentence-initial verb in
conditional mood (cf. Section 4.2) for otherwise
and unless, but not for instead, which is, as with
MT, always explicitly translated by humans, most
often to the DE connective statt. The very op-
posite takes place for the RESTATEMENT relation
22
and the EN connective in fact. Here, MT leaves
implicit just as many instances as human transla-
tors do, i.e. 14.3% of all cases. Translators use
paraphrases such as in Wahrheit (lit.: in truth) or
u?brigens (lit.: by the way), while the translation
model tends to use im Gegenteil (lit.: opposite),
which is not a literal translation of in fact (usually
in der Tat or tatsa?chlich in DE), but reflects the
contrastive function this marker frequently had in
the Europarl training data of the baseline MT sys-
tem.
4 Case studies
4.1 Temporal connectives from EN to FR
The most frequent implicitated discourse relation
for EN/FR translation is SYNCHRONY, i.e. con-
nectives conveying that their arguments describe
events that take place at the same time. However,
since the situations in which SYNCHRONY rela-
tions are implicitated are similar to those in which
CONTRAST relations are implicitated, we discuss
the two together.
We exemplify here cases where EN DCs that
signal SYNCHRONY and/or CONTRAST are trans-
lated to FR with a ?en/Preposition + Verb in
Gerund? construction without a TL connective.
The EN source instances giving rise to such im-
plicitations in FR are usually of the form ?DC +
Verb in Present Continuous? or ?DC + Verb in Sim-
ple Past?, see sentences 1 and 2 in Figure 5.
Out of 13 cases of implicitations for while in the
data, 8 (61.5%) have been translated to the men-
tioned construction in FR, as illustrated in the first
example in Figure 5, with a reference and machine
translation from newstest2010. The DC while here
ambiguously signals SYNCHRONY and/or CON-
TRAST, but there is a second temporal marker
(at the same time, a connective-equivalent not yet
considered in this paper or in the PDTB), that dis-
ambiguates while to its CONTRAST sense only or
to the composite sense SYNCHRONY/CONTRAST.
The latter is conveyed in FR by en me?prisant, with
CONTRAST being reinforced by tout (lit.: all).
In Example 2, from newstest2012, the sentence-
initial connective when, again signaling SYN-
CHRONY, is translated to the very same construc-
tion of ?en/Preposition + Verb in Gerund? in the
FR reference.
In the baseline MT output for Example 1, nei-
ther of the two EN DCs is deleted, while is literally
translated to alors que and at the same time to dans
1. EN: In her view, the filmmaker ?is asking
a favour from the court, while at the same time
showing disregard for its authority?.
FR-REF: Pour elle, le cine?aste ?demande une
faveur a` la cour, tout en/Prep me?prisant/V/Ger
son autorite??.
FR-MT*: Dans son avis, le re?alisateur de
?demande une faveur de la cour, alors que dans
le me?me temps une marque de me?pris pour son
autorite??.
2. EN: When Meder looked through the
weather-beaten windows of the red, white and
yellow Art Nouveau building, she could see
weeds growing up through the tiles.
FR-REF: En/Prep jetant/V/Ger un coup
d??il par la fene?tre de l?immeuble-art nou-
veau en rouge-blanc-jaune, elle a observe?
l?e?panouissement des mauvaises herbes entre les
carreaux.
FR-MT*: Lorsque Meder semblait weather-
beaten a` travers les fene?tres du rouge, jaune et
blanc de l?art nouveau ba?timent, elle pourrait
voir les mauvaises herbes qui grandissent par les
tuiles.
Figure 5: Translation examples for the EN tempo-
ral connectives while and when, rendered in the FR
reference as a ?preposition + Verb in Gerund? con-
struction. MT generates the direct lexical equiva-
lents alors que and lorsque.
le me?me temps. While the MT output is not totally
wrong, it sounds disfluent, as dans le me?me temps
after alors que is neither necessary nor appropri-
ate.
In the baseline MT output for Example 2, the di-
rect lexical equivalent for when ? lorsque is gen-
erated, which is correct, although the translation
has other mistakes such as the wrong verb sem-
blait and the untranslated weather-beaten.
To model such cases for SMT one could use
POS tags to detect the ?DC + Present Continu-
ous/Simple Past? in EN and apply a rule to trans-
late it to ?Preposition + Gerund? in FR. Further-
more, when two DCs follow each other in EN,
and both can signal the same discourse relations,
a word-deletion feature (as it is available in the
Moses decoder via sparse features), could be used
to trigger the deletion of one of the EN connec-
tives, so that only one is translated to the TL. We
23
will examine in future work whether there are sys-
tematic patterns in the translation of such ?dou-
ble? connectives in SL and TL. Another possibility
would be to treat cases like while at the same time
as a multi-word phrase that is then translated to the
corresponding prepositional construction in FR.
4.2 Conditional connectives from EN to DE
Out of the 41 cases involving a CONDITION re-
lation (10.5% of all DE implicitations), 40 or
97.6% were due to the EN connective if not be-
ing translated to its DE equivalents wenn, falls,
ob. Instead, in 21 cases (52.5%), the human
reference translations made use of a verbal con-
struction which obviates the need for a connec-
tive in DE when the verb in the if -clause is
moved to sentence-initial position and its mood
is made conditional, as in Figure 6, a refer-
ence translation from newstest2012, with the DE
verb wa?re (lit.: were) (VMFIN=modal finite verb,
Konj=conditional). This construction is also avail-
able in EN (Were you here, I would...), but seems
to be much more formal and less frequent than in
DE where it is ordinarily used across registers. In
the baseline MT output for this sentence, if was
translated explicitly to the DE connective wenn,
which is in principle correct, but the syntax of the
translation is wrong, mainly due to the position of
the verb tun, which should be at the end of the sen-
tence.
The remaining 19 cases of EN if were either
translated to DE prepositions (e.g. bei, wo, lit.: at,
where) or the CONDITION relation is not expressed
at all and verbs in indicative mood make the use of
a conditional DE connective superfluous.
Of the 21 tokens of if whose reference transla-
tions used a verbal construction in DE, 14 (66.7%)
were tokens of if whose argument clause explic-
itly referred to the preceding context ? e.g., if they
were, if so, if this is true etc. These occurrences
could therefore be identified in EN and could be
modeled for SMT as re-ordering rules on the ver-
bal phrase in the DE syntax tree after constituent
parsing in syntax-based translation models.
5 Conclusion
This study showed that human translators do not
translate explicit EN discourse connectives as FR
or DE discourse connectives in up to 18% of all
cases. In MT output this happens about 3 times
less often. We thus plan to examine how to pro-
EN: If not for computer science, they would be
doing amazing things in other fields.

duce higher-scoring translations without a target
language connective but with some other syntactic
pattern that conveys the same source language dis-
course relation. Depending on the features identi-
fied, movements of syntactical constituents or re-
ordering of POS tags at the phrase and/or sub-tree
level will be implemented for hierarchical syntac-
tic or phrase-based SMT models.
