Abstract
There has been a recent surge of interest in
semantic machine translation, which stan-
dard automatic metrics struggle to evalu-
ate. A family of measures called MEANT
has been proposed which uses semantic
role labels (SRL) to overcome this prob-
lem. The human variant, HMEANT, has
largely been evaluated using correlation
with human contrastive evaluations, the
standard human evaluation metric for the
WMT shared tasks. In this paper we claim
that for a human metric to be useful, it
needs to be evaluated on intrinsic proper-
ties. It needs to be reliable; it needs to
work across different language pairs; and
it needs to be lightweight. Most impor-
tantly, however, a human metric must be
discerning. We conclude that HMEANT
is a step in the right direction, but has
some serious flaws. The reliance on verbs
as heads of frames, and the assumption
that annotators need minimal guidelines
are particularly problematic.
1 Introduction
Human evaluation is essential in machine transla-
tion (MT) research because it is the ultimate way
to judge system quality. Furthermore, human eval-
uation is used to evaluate automatic metrics which
are necessary for tuning system parameters. Un-
fortunately, there is no clear consensus on which
evaluation strategy is best. Humans have been
asked to judge if translations are correct, to grade
them and to rank them. But it is often very difficult
to decide how good a translation is, when there are
so many possible ways of translating a sentence.
Another problem is that different types of evalua-
tion might be useful for different purposes. If the
MT is going to be the basis of a human transla-
tor?s work-flow, then post-editing effort seems like
a natural fit. However, for people using MT for
gisting, what we really want is some measure of
how much meaning has been retained.
We clearly need a metric which tries to answer
the question, how much of the meaning does the
translation capture. In this paper, we explore the
use of human evaluation metrics which attempt
to capture the extent of this meaning retention.
In particular, we consider HMEANT (Lo and Wu,
2011a), a metric that uses semantic role labels
to measure how much of the ?who, why, when,
where? has been preserved. For HMEANT evalua-
tion, annotators are instructed to identify verbs as
heads of semantic frames. Then they attach role
fillers to the heads and finally they align heads
and role fillers in the candidate translation with
those in a reference translation. In a series of pa-
pers, Lo and Wu (2010, 2011b,a, 2012) explored a
number of questions, evaluating HMEANT by us-
ing correlation statistics to compare it to judge-
ments of human adequacy and contrastive evalu-
ations. Given the drawbacks of those evaluation
measures, which we discuss in Sec. 2, they could
just as well have been evaluating the human ade-
quacy and contrastive judgements using HMEANT.
Human evaluation metrics need to be judged on
other intrinsic qualities, which we describe below.
The aim of this paper is to evaluate the effec-
tiveness of HMEANT, with the goal of using it to
judge the relative merits of different MT systems,
for example in the shared task of the Workshop on
Machine Translation.
In order to be useful, an MT evaluation metric
must be reliable, be language independent, have
discriminatory power, and be efficient. We address
each of these criteria as follows:
52
Reliability We produce extensive IAA (Inter-
annotator agreement) for HMEANT, breaking it
down into the different stages of annotation. Our
experimental results show that whilst the IAA for
HMEANT is acceptable at the individual stages of
the annotation, the compounding effect of dis-
agreement at each stage of the pipeline greatly re-
duces the effective overall IAA ? to 0.44 on role
alignment for German, and, only slightly better,
0.59 for English. This raises doubts about the reli-
ability of HMEANT in its current form.
Discriminatory Power We consider output of
three types of MT system (Phrase-based, Syntax-
based and Rule-based) to attempt to gain insight
into the different types of semantic information
preserved by the different systems. The Syntax-
based system seems to have a slight edge overall,
but since IAA is so low, this result has to be taken
with a grain of salt.
Language Independence We apply HMEANT
to both English and German translation outputs,
showing that the guidelines can be adapted to the
new language.
Efficiency Whilst HMEANT evaluation will
never be as fast as, for example, the contrastive
judgements used for the WMT shared task,
it is still reasonably efficient considering the
fine-grained nature of the evaluation. On average,
annotators evaluated about 10 sentences per hour.
2 Related Work
Even though the idea that machine translation re-
quires a semantic representation of the translated
content is as old as the idea of computer-based
translation itself (Weaver, 1955), it has not been
until recently that people have begun to combine
statistical models with semantic representations.
Jones et al (2012), for example, represent mean-
ing as directed acyclic graphs and map these to
PropBank (Palmer et al, 2005) style dependen-
cies. To evaluate such approaches properly, we
need evaluation metrics that capture the accuracy
of the translation.
Current automatic metrics of machine trans-
lation, such as BLEU (Papineni et al, 2002),
METEOR (Lavie and Denkowski, 2009) and
TER (Snover et al, 2009b), which have greatly
accelerated progress in MT research, rely on shal-
low surface properties of the translations, and
only indirectly capture whether or not the trans-
lation preserves the meaning. This has meant that
potentially more sophisticated translation models
are pitted against the flatter phrase-based mod-
els, based on metrics which cannot reflect their
strengths. Callison-Burch et al (2011) provide ev-
idence that automatic metrics are inconsistent with
human judgements when comparing rule-based
against statistical machine translation systems.
Automatic evaluation metrics are evaluated and
calibrated based on their correlation with human
judgements. However, after more than 60 years
of research into machine translation, there is still
no consensus on how to evaluate machine transla-
tion based on human judgements. (Hutchins and
Somers, 1992; Przybocki et al, 2009).
One obvious approach is to ask annotators to
rate translation candidates on a numerical scale.
Under the DARPA TIDES program, the Linguistic
Data Consortium (2002) developed an evaluation
scheme that relies on two five-point scales repre-
senting fluency and adequacy. This was also the
human evaluation scheme used in the annual MT
competitions sponsored by NIST (2005).
In an analysis of human evaluation results for
the WMT ?07 workshop, however, Callison-Burch
et al (2007) found high correlation between flu-
ency and adequacy scores assigned by individual
annotators, suggesting that human annotators are
not able to separate these two evaluation dimen-
sions easily. Furthermore these absolute scores
show low inter-annotator agreement. Instead of
giving absolute quality assessments, annotators
appeared to be using their ratings to rank trans-
lation candidates according to their overall prefer-
ence for one over the other.
In line with these findings, Callison-Burch et al
(2007) proposed to let annotators rank translation
candidates directly, without asking them to assign
an absolute quality assessment to each candidate.
This type of human evaluation has been performed
in the last six Workshops on Statistical Machine
Translation.
Although it is useful to have a score or a rank
for a particular sentence, especially for evaluat-
ing automatic metrics, these ratings are necessar-
ily a simplification of the real differences between
translations. Translations can contain a large num-
ber of different types of errors of varying severity.
Even if we put aside difficulties with selecting one
preferred sentence, ranking judgements are diffi-
cult to generalise. Humans are shown five transla-
tions at a time, and there is a high cognitive cost to
ranking these at once. Furthermore, these repre-
53
sent a subset of the competing systems, and these
rankings must be combined with other annotators
judgements on five other system outputs to com-
pute an overall ranking. The methodology for in-
terpreting the contrastive evaluations has been the
subject of much recent debate in the community
(Bojar et al, 2011; Lopez, 2012).
There has been some effort to overcome these
problems. HTER (Snover et al, 2009a) is a met-
ric which counts the number of edits needed by a
human to convert the machine translation so as to
convey the same meaning as the reference. This
type of evaluation is of some use when one is us-
ing MT to aid human translation (although the re-
lationship between number of edits and actual ef-
fort is not straightforward (Koponen, 2012)), but
it is not so helpful when one?s task is gisting. The
number of edits need not correlate with the sever-
ity of the semantic differences between the two
sentences. The loss of a negative, for instance, is
only one edit away from the original, but the se-
mantics change completely.
Alternatively, HyTER (Dreyer and Marcu,
2012) is an annotation tool which allows a user
to create an exponential number of correct trans-
lations for a given sentence. These references are
then efficiently exploited to compare with machine
translation output. The authors argue that the cur-
rent metrics fail simply because they have access
to sets of reference translations which are simply
too small. However, the fact is that even if one
does have access to large numbers of translations,
it is very difficult to determine whether the refer-
ence correctly captures the essential semantic con-
tent of the references.
The idea of using semantic role labels to evalu-
ate machine translation is not new. Gime?nez and
Ma`rquez (2007) proposed using automatically as-
signed semantic role labels as a feature in a com-
bined MT metric. The main difference between
this application of semantic roles and MEANT is
that arguments for specific verbs are taken into ac-
count, instead of just applying the subset agent,
patient and benefactor. This idea would probably
help human annotators to handle sentences with
passives, copulas and other constructions which
do not easily match the most basic arguments. On
the other hand, verb specific arguments are lan-
guage dependent.
Bojar and Wu (2012), applying HMEANT to
English-to-Czech MT output, identified a number
of problems with HMEANT, and suggested a vari-
ety of improvements. In some respects, this work
is very similar, except that our goal is to evaluate
HMEANT along a range of intrinsic properties, to
determine how useful the metric really is to evalu-
ation campaigns such as the workshop on machine
translation.
3 Evaluation with HMEANT
3.1 Annotation Procedure
The goal of the HMEANT metric is to capture es-
sential semantic content, but still be simple and
fast. There are two stages to the annotation, the
first of which is semantic role labelling (SRL).
Here the annotator is directed to select the actions,
or frame heads, by marking all the verbs in the sen-
tence except for auxilliaries and modals. The roles
(or slot fillers) within the frame are then marked
and each is linked with a unique action. Each role
is given a type from an inventory of 11 (Table 1),
and an action with its collection of corresponding
roles is known as a frame. In the role annotation
the idea is to get the annotator to recognise who
did what to who, when, where and why in both the
references and the MT outputs.
who what whom when where
agent patient benefactive temporal locative
why how
purpose degree, manner, modal, negation, other
Table 1: Semantic roles
The second stage in the annotation is alignment,
where the annotators match elements of the SRL
annotation in the reference with that in the MT
output. The annotators link both actions and roles,
and these alignments can be matched as ?Correct?
or ?Partial? matches, depending on how well the
action or role is translated. The guidelines for the
annotators are deliberately minimalistic, with the
argument being that non-experts can get started
quickly. Lo and Wu (2011a) claim that unskilled
annotators can be trained within 15 minutes.
In all such human evaluation, there is a trade-
off between simplicity and accuracy. Clearly when
evaluating bad machine translation output, we do
not want to label too much. However, sometimes
having so little choice of semantic roles can lead
to confusion and slow down the annotator when
more complicated examples do not fit the scheme.
Therefore, common exceptions need to be handled
either in the roles provided, or in the annotator
guidelines.

3.2 Calculation of Score
The overall HMEANT score for MT evaluation
is computed as the f-score from the counts of
matches of frames and their role fillers between
the reference and the MT output. Unmatched
frames are excluded from the calculation together
with all their corresponding roles.
In recognition that preservation of some types
of semantic relations may be more important than
others for a human to understand a sentence, one
may want to weight them differently in the com-
putation of the HMEANT score. Lo and Wu (2012)
train weights for each role filler type to optimise
correlation with human adequacy judgements. As
an unsupervised alternative, they suggest weight-
ing roles according to their frequency as approxi-
mation to their importance.
Since the main focus of the current paper is the
annotation of the actions, roles and alignments that
HMEANT depends on, we do not explore such dif-
ferent weight-setting schemes, but set the weights
uniformly, with the exception of a partial align-
ment, which is given a weight of 0.5. HMEANT is
thus defined as follows:
Fi = # correct or partially correct fillers
for PRED i in MT
MTi = total # fillers for PRED i in MT
REFi = total # fillers for PRED i in REF
P =

Rtotal =
Pcorrect + 0.5Ppartial

HMEANT = 2 ? Ptotal ?RtotalPtotal +Rtotal
3.3 Automating HMEANT
One of the main directions taken by the authors of
HMEANT is in creating a fully automated version
of the metric (MEANT) in (Lo et al, 2012). The
metric combines shallow semantic parsing with a
simple maximum weighted bipartite matching al-
gorithm for aligning semantic frames. They use
approximate matching schemes (Cosine and Jac-
card similarity) for matching roles, with the lat-
ter producing better alignments (Tumuluru et al,
2012). They demonstrate that MEANT corre-
lates with human adequacy judgements better than
other commonly used automatic metrics. In this
paper we focus on human evaluation, as it is es-
sential for building better automatic metrics, and
therefore a more fundamental problem.
4 Experimental Setup
4.1 Systems and Data Sets
We performed HMEANT evaluation on three
systems selected from 2013 WMT evaluation1.
The systems we selected were uedin-wmt13,
uedin-syntax and rbmt-3, which were cho-
sen to provide us with a high performing phrase-
based system, a high performing syntax-based
system and the top performing rule-based system,
respectively. The cased BLEU scores of the three
systems are shown in Table 2.
System Type de-en en-de
uedin-wmt13 Phrase 26.6 20.1
uedin-syntax Syntax 26.3 19.4
rbmt-3 Rule 18.8 16.5
Table 2: Cased BLEU on the full newstest2013
test set for the systems used in this study
We randomly selected sentences from the en-de
and de-en newstest2013 tasks, and extracted
the corresponding references and system outputs
for these sentences. For the en-de task, 75% of our
selected sentences were selected from the section
of newstest2013 that was originally in Ger-
man, with the other 25% from the section that was
originally in English. The sentence selection for
the de-en task was performed in a similar man-
ner. For presentation to the annotators, the sen-
tences were split into segments of 12. We found
that with practice, annotators could complete one
of these segments in around 100-120 minutes. In
total, with close to 70 hours of annotator effort,
we evaluated 142 sentences of German, and 72
sentences of English. The annotation for each
sentence includes 1 reference, 3 system outputs,
and their corresponding alignments. Apart from 5
singly-annotated German sentences, and 1 singly-
annotated English sentence, all sentences were an-
notated by exactly 2 annotators.

4.2 Annotation
The annotation for English was performed by 3
different annotators (E1, E2 and E3), and the Ger-
man annotation by 2 annotators (D1 and D2).
All the English annotators were machine transla-
tion researchers, with E1 and E2 both native En-
glish speakers whereas E3 is not a native speaker,
but lives and works in an English-speaking coun-
try. The two German annotators were both native
speakers of German, with no background in com-
putational linguistics, although D2 is a teacher of
German as a second language and has had linguis-
tic training.
The HMEANT evaluation task was carried out
following the framework described in Lo and Wu
(2011a) and Bojar and Wu (2012). For each sen-
tence in the evaluation set, the annotators were first
asked to mark the semantic frames and roles (i.e.,
slot fillers within the frame) in a human reference
translation of the respective sentence. They were
then presented with the output of several machine
translation systems for the same source sentence,
one system at a time, with the reference transla-
tion and its annotations visible in the left half of
the screen (cf. Fig. 1). For each system, the an-
notators were asked to annotate semantic frames
and slot fillers in the translation first, and then
align them with frame heads and slot fillers in
the human reference translation. Annotations and
alignment were performed with Edi-HMEANT2,
a web-based annotation tool for HMEANT that
we developed on the basis of Yawat (Germann,
2008). The tool allows the alignment of slots from
different semantic frames, and the alignment of
slots of different types; however, such alignments
are not considered in the computation of the final
HMEANT score.
The annotation guidelines were essentially
those used in Bojar and Wu (2012), with some ad-
ditional English examples, and a complete set of
German examples. For ease of comparison with
prior work, we used the same set of semantic role
labels as Bojar and Wu (2012), shown in Table 1.
Given the restriction that the head of a frame can
consist of only one word, a convention was made
that all other verbs attached to the main verb such
as modals, auxiliaries or separable particles for
German verbs, would be labelled as modal. This
was the only change we made to the HMEANT

scheme.
5 Results and Discussion
5.1 Inter-Annotator Agreement
We first measured IAA on role identification, as
in Lo and Wu (2011a), except that we use exact
match on word spans as opposed to the approx-
imate match employed in that reference. Whilst
exact match is a harsher measure, penalising dis-
agreements related to punctuation and articles, us-
ing any sort of approximate match would mean
having to deal with N:M matches. IAA is defined
as follows:
IAA = 2 ? P ?RP +R
Where P is defined as the number of labels (ei-
ther heads, roles, or alignments) that match be-
tween annotators, divided by the total number of
labels given by annotator 1. And R is defined the
same way for annotator 2. This is similar to an
F-measure (f1), where we consider one of the an-
notators as the gold standard. The IAA for role
identification is shown in Table 3.

Table 3: IAA for role identification. This is calcu-
lated by considering exact endpoint matches on all
spans (predicates and arguments).
The agreements in Table 3 are not too differ-
ent from those reported in earlier work. We note
that the IAA for the German annotators drops for
the MT system outputs, but this may be because
the English annotators (as MT researchers) are less
bothered by bad MT output than their counterparts
working on the German texts.
Next we looked at the IAA on role classifica-
tion, the other IAA figure provided by Lo and Wu
(2011a). We only considered roles where both an-
notators had marked the same span in the same
frame, with the frame being identified by its ac-
tion. The IAA for role classification is shown in
Table 4.
Again, we show similar levels of IAA to those
reported in (Lo and Wu, 2011a). Examining the
disagreements in more detail, we produced counts
of the most common role type disagreements, by

In order to shed more light on the role type dis-
agreements, we examined a random sample of 10
of the English annotations where the annotators
had disagreed about ?Agent? versus ?Experiencer-
Patient?. In 7 of these cases, there was a definite
correct answer, according to the annotation guide-
lines. Of the other 3, there were 2 cases of poor
MT output making the semantic interpretation dif-
ficult, and one case of existential ?there?. Of the 7
cases where one annotator appears in error, 3 were
passive, 1 was a copula, and 1 involved the verb

?receive?. For the other 2 there was no clear rea-
son for the error. From this small sample, we sug-
gest that passive constructions are still difficult to
annotate semantically.
The last of elements of the semantic frames to
be considered for IAA are the actions, i.e. the
frame heads or predicates. In this case identifying
a match was straightforward as actions are identi-
fied by a single token. The IAA for action identi-
fication is shown in Table 7.

Table 7: IAA for action identification.
We see fairly high IAA for actions, which seems
encouraging, but given the importance of actions
in HMEANT, we probably need the scores to be
higher. Most of the problems with the identifica-
tion of actions centre around multiple-verb con-
structions and participles.
We now turn our attention to the second stage
of the annotation process where the annotators
marked alignments between slots and roles. These
provide the relevant statistics for the calculation of
the HMEANT score so it is important that they are
annotated reliably.
Firstly, we consider the alignment of actions. In
this case, we use pipelined statistics, in that if one
annotator marks actions in the reference and hy-
pothesis, then aligns them, whilst the other anno-
tator does not mark the corresponding actions, we
still count this as an action alignment mismatch.
This creates a harsher measure on action align-
ment, but gives a better idea of the overall relia-
bility of the annotation task. In Table 8 we show
the IAA (as F1) on action alignments. Comparing
Tables 8 and 7 we see that, for English at least, the

tial and full alignment
agreement on action alignment is not much lower
than that on action identification, indicating that if
annotators agree on the actions then they generally
agree on how they align. For German, however,
the IAA on action alignment is a bit lower, ap-
parently because one of the annotators was much
stricter about which actions they aligned.
In order to calculate the IAA on role align-
ments, we only consider those alignments that
connect two roles in aligned frames, of the same
type, since these are the only role alignments that
count for computing the HMEANT score. This
means that if one of the annotators does not align
the frames, then all the contained role alignments
are counted as mismatches. We do not consider
the spans when calculating the agreement on role
alignments, meaning that if one annotator has an
alignment between roles of type T in frame F ,
and the other annotator also aligns the same types
of roles in the same frame, then they are consid-
ered as a match. This is done because it is only the
counts of alignments that are relevant for HMEANT
scoring. The IAA on the role alignments is quite

low, dipping below 0.5 for German. This is mainly
because of the pipelining effect, where annota-
tion disagreements at each stage are compounded.
Since the final HMEANT score is computed essen-
tially by counting role alignments, this level of
IAA causes problems for this score calculation.
We computed HMEANT and BLEU scores for the
hypotheses annotated by each annotator pair. The
HMEANT scores were calculated as described in
Section 3.2. The two metrics are calculated for
each sentence (we apply +1 smoothing for BLEU),
then averaged across all sentences. Table 10 shows
the scores organised by annotator pair and sys-
tem type. The agreement in the overall scores is
not good, but really just reflects the compounded

5.2 Overall Scores
In this section we report the overall HMEANT
scores of the three systems whose output we an-
notated. Our main focus on this paper was on the
annotation task, so we do not wish to emphasise
the scoring, but it is nevertheless an important end-
product of the HMEANT annotation process. The
overall scores (HMEANT and +1 smoothed sen-
tence BLEU, averaged across sentences and anno-
tators) are given in Table 11.

Table 11: Comparison of mean HMEANT and
(smoothed sentence) BLEU for the three systems.
From the table we can observe that, whilst
BLEU shows similar scores for the phrase-based
and syntax-based systems, with lower scores for
the rule-based system, HMEANT shows the syntax-
based system as being ahead, with the other two
showing similar performance. We would caution
against reading too much into this, considering the
relatively small number of sentences annotated,
58
and the issues with IAA exposed in the previous
section, but it is an encouraging results for syntax-
based MT.
5.3 Discussion
Machine translation research needs a reliable
method for evaluating and comparing different
machine translation systems. The performance of
HMEANT as shown in the previous section is dis-
appointing. The fact that the final role IAA, in Ta-
ble 9, is 0.442 for German and 0.596 for English,
demonstrates that there are fundamental problems
with the scheme. One of the areas of greatest con-
fusion is between what seems like one of the eas-
iest role types to distinguish: agent and patient.
Here is an example of a passive where one anno-
tator has marked ?tea? wrongly as agent, and the
other annotator correctly labelled it as patient:
Reference: In the kitchen, tea is prepared for
the guests
ACTION prepared
LOCATIVE In the kitchen
AGENT / PATIENT tea
MODAL is
BENEFICIARY for the guests
We would argue that the most important change
to HMEANT must be in creating more comprehen-
sive annotation guidelines, with examples of diffi-
cult cases. Bojar and Wu (2012) listed a number of
problems and improvements to HMEANT, which
we largely agree with. We list the most important
limitations of HMEANT that we have encountered:
? Single Word Heads Verbal predicates often
consist of multiple words, which can be split.
For example: ?Take him up on his offer?.
? Heads being limited to verbs The semantics
of verbs can often be carried by an equivalent
noun and should be allowed by HMEANT. For
example ?My father broke down and cried .?,
the verb ?cried? is correctly paraphrased in
?My father collapsed in tears .?
? Copular Verbs These do not fit in to the lim-
ited list of role types. For example forcing
this sentence ?The story is plausible?, to have
and agent and patient is confusing.
? Prepositional Phrases attaching to a noun
These can greatly affect the semantics of a
sentence, but HMEANT has no way of captur-
ing this.
? Semantics not on head This frequently oc-
curs with light verbs, for example ?Bouson
did the review of the paper? is equivalent to
?Bouson reviewed the paper?.
? Hierarchy of frames There are often frames
which are embedded in other frames, for ex-
ample in reported speech. It is not clear
whether errors at the lowest level should be
marked wrong just at that point, or whether
they should be marked wrong all the way up
the semantic tree. For example: ?Arafat said
?Isreal suffocates such a hope in the germ? ?.
The frame headed by ?said? is largely cor-
rect, but the reported speech is not. The pa-
tient role of the verb ?said? could be aligned
as correct, as the error is already captured in
relation to the verb ?suffocates?.
? No discourse markers These are impor-
tant for capturing the relationships between
frames and should be labelled.
6 Conclusion
HMEANT represents an attempt to create a human
evaluation for machine translation which directly
measures the semantic content preserved by the
MT. It partly succeeds. However we have cast
doubt on the claim that HMEANT can be reliably
annotated with minimal annotator training and
guidelines. In the most extensive study of inter-
annotator agreement yet performed for HMEANT,
across two language pairs, we have shown that the
disagreements between annotators make it diffi-
cult to reliably compare different MT systems with
HMEANT scores.
Furthermore, the fact that HMEANT is restricted
to annotating purely verbal predicates results in
some important disadvantages. Ideally we need a
more general definition of a frame, not restricted
to purely verbal predicates, and we would like
to be able to link frames. We should explore
the feasibility of a semantic framework which at-
tempts to overcome reliance on syntactic proper-
ties such as Universal Conceptual Cognitive An-
notation (Abend and Rappoport, 2013).
