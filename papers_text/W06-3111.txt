Abstract
In statistical machine translation, large
numbers of parallel sentences are required
to train the model parameters. However,
plenty of the bilingual language resources
available on web are aligned only at the
document level. To exploit this data,
we have to extract the bilingual sentences
from these documents.
The common method is to break the doc-
uments into segments using predefined
anchor words, then these segments are
aligned. This approach is not error free,
incorrect alignments may decrease the
translation quality.
We present an alternative approach to ex-
tract the parallel sentences by partitioning
a bilingual document into two pairs. This
process is performed recursively until all
the sub-pairs are short enough.
In experiments on the Chinese-English
FBIS data, our method was capable of
producing translation results comparable
to those of a state-of-the-art sentence
aligner. Using a combination of the two
approaches leads to better translation per-
formance.
1 Introduction
Current statistical machine translation systems use
bilingual sentences to train the parameters of the
translation models. The exploitation of more bilin-
gual sentences automatically and accurately as well
as the use of these data with the limited computa-
tional requirements become crucial problems.
The conventional method for producing parallel
sentences is to break the documents into sentences
and to align these sentences using dynamic program-
ming. Previous investigations can be found in works
such as (Gale and Church, 1993) and (Ma, 2006).
A disadvantage is that only the monotone sentence
alignments are allowed.
Another approach is the binary segmentation
method described in (Simard and Langlais, 2003),
(Xu et al, 2005) and (Deng et al, 2006), which
separates a long sentence pair into two sub-pairs re-
cursively. The binary reordering in alignment is al-
lowed but the segmentation decision is only opti-
mum in each recursion step.
Hence, a combination of both methods is ex-
pected to produce a more satisfying result. (Deng
et al, 2006) performs a two-stage procedure. The
documents are first aligned at level using dynamic
programming, the initial alignments are then refined
to produce shorter segments using binary segmen-
tation. But on the Chinese-English FBIS training
corpus, the alignment accuracy and recall are lower
than with Champollion (Ma, 2006).
We refine the model in (Xu et al, 2005) using
a log-linar combination of different feature func-
tions and combine it with the approach of (Ma,
2006). Here the corpora produced using both ap-
proaches are concatenated, and each corpus is as-
signed a weight. During the training of the word
alignment models, the counts of the lexicon entries
78
are linear interpolated using the corpus weights. In
the experiments on the Chinese-English FBIS cor-
pus the translation performance is improved by 0.4%
of the BLEU score compared to the performance
only with Champollion.
The remainder of this paper is structured as fol-
lows: First we will briefly review the baseline statis-
tical machine translation system in Section 2. Then,
in Section 3, we will describe the refined binary seg-
mentation method. In Section 4.1, we will introduce
the methods to extract bilingual sentences from doc-
ument aligned texts. The experimental results will
be presented in Section 4.
2 Review of the Baseline Statistical
Machine Translation System
In this section, we briefly review our translation sys-
tem and introduce the word alignment models.
In statistical machine translation, we are given
a source language sentence fJ1 = f1 . . . fj . . . fJ ,
which is to be translated into a target language sen-
tence eI1 = e1 . . . ei . . . eI . Among all possible tar-
get language sentences, we will choose the sentence
with the highest probability:
e?I?1 = argmax
I,eI1
{Pr(eI1|fJ1 )
}
= argmax
I,eI1
{Pr(eI1) ? Pr(fJ1 |eI1)
} (1)
The decomposition into two knowledge sources in
Equation 1 allows independent modeling of tar-
get language model Pr(eI1) and translation model
Pr(fJ1 |eI1)1. The translation model can be further
extended to a statistical alignment model with the
following equation:
Pr(fJ1 |eI1) =
?
aJ1
Pr(fJ1 , aJ1 |eI1)
The alignment model Pr(fJ1 , aJ1 |eI1) introduces a
?hidden? word alignment a = aJ1 , which describes a
mapping from a source position j to a target position
aj .
1The notational convention will be as follows: we use the
symbol Pr(?) to denote general probability distributions with
(nearly) no specific assumptions. In contrast, for model-based
probability distributions, we use the generic symbol p(?).

Figure 1: Two Types of Alignment
The IBM model 1 (IBM-1) (Brown et al, 1993)
assumes that all alignments have the same probabil-
ity by using a uniform distribution:
p(fJ1 |eI1) =
1
IJ ?
J?
j=1
I?
i=1
p(fj |ei) (2)
We use the IBM-1 to train the lexicon parameters
p(f |e), the training software is GIZA++ (Och and
Ney, 2003).
To incorporate the context into the translation
model, the phrase-based translation approach (Zens
et al, 2005) is applied. Pairs of source and tar-
get language phrases are extracted from the bilin-
gual training corpus and a beam search algorithm is
implemented to generate the translation hypothesis
with maximum probability.
3 Binary Segmentation Method
3.1 Approach
Here a document or sentence pair (fJ1 , eI1) 2 is repre-
sented as a matrix. Every element in the matrix con-
tains a lexicon probability p(fj |ei), which is trained
on the original parallel corpora. Each position di-
vides a matrix into four parts as shown in Figure 1:
the bottom left (C), the upper left (A), the bottom
right (D) and the upper right (B). We use m to de-
note the alignment direction, m = 1 means that the
alignment is monotone, i.e. the bottom left part is
connected with the upper right part, and m = 0
means the alignment is non-monotone, i.e. the upper
left part is connected with the bottom right part, as
shown in Figure 1.
3.2 Log-Linear Model
We use a log-linear interpolation to combine differ-
ent models: the IBM-1, the inverse IBM-1, the an-
2Sentences are equivalent to segments in this paper.
79
chor words model as well as the IBM-4. K denotes
the total number of models.
We go through all positions in the bilingual sen-
tences and find the best position for segmenting the
sentence:
(?i, j?, m?) = argmax
i,j,m
{ K?
k=1
?khk(j, i,m|fJ1 , eI1)
}
,
where i ? [1, I ? 1] and j ? [1, J ? 1] are posi-
tions in the source and target sentences respectively.
The feature functions are described in the follow-
ing sections. In most cases, the sentence pairs are
quite long and even after one segmentation we may
still have long sub-segments. Therefore, we separate
the sub-segment pairs recursively until the length of
each new segment is less than a defined value.
3.3 Normalized IBM-1
The function in Equation 2 can be normalized by
the source sentence length with a weighting ? as de-
scribed in (Xu et al, 2005):
The monotone alignment is calculated as
h1(j, i, 1|fJ1 , eI1) = log(p(f j1 |ei1)??
1
j+(1??) (3)
?p(fJj+1|eIi+1)??
1
J?j+(1??)),
and the non-monotone alignment is formulated in
the same way.
We also use the inverse IBM-1 as a feature, by ex-
changing the place of ei1 and f j1 its monotone align-
ment is calculated as:
h2(j, i, 1|fJ1 , eI1) = log(p(ei1|f j1 )??
1
i+(1??) (4)
?p(eIi+1|fJj+1)??
1
I?i+(1??))
3.4 Anchor Words
In the task of extracting parallel sentences from
the paragraph-aligned corpus, selecting some anchor
words as preferred segmentation positions can ef-
fectively avoid the extraction of incomplete segment
pairs. Therefore we use an anchor words model to
prefer the segmentation at the punctuation marks,
where the source and target words are identical:
h3(j, i,m|fJ1 , eI1) =
{ 1 : fj = ei ? ei ? A
0 : otherwise
A is a user defined anchor word list, here we use
A={.,??;}. If the corresponding model scaling factor
?3 is assigned a high value, the segmentation posi-
tions are mostly after anchor words.
3.5 IBM-4 Word Alignment
If we already have the IBM-4 Viterbi word align-
ments for the parallel sentences and need to retrain
the system, for example to optimize the training pa-
rameters, we can include the Viterbi word align-
ments trained on the original corpora into the binary
segmentation. In the monotone case, the model is
represented as
h4(j, i, 1|fJ1 , eI1) =
log
(
N(f j1 , ei1) +N(fJj+1, eIi+1)
N(fJ1 , eI1)
)
,
where N(f j1 , ei1) denotes the number of the align-
ment links inside the matrix (1, 1) and (j, i). In the
non-monotone case the model is formulated in the
same way.
3.6 Word Alignment Concatenation
As described in Section 2, our translation is based on
phrases, that means for an input sentence we extract
all phrases matched in the training corpus and trans-
late with these phrase pairs. Although the aim of
segmentation is to split parallel text into translated
segment pairs, but the segmentation is still not per-
fect. During sentence segmentation we might sep-
arate a phrase into two segments, so that the whole
phrase pair can not be extracted.
To avoid this, we concatenate the word align-
ments trained with the segmentations of one sen-
tence pair. During the segmentation, the position of
each segmentation point in the sentence is memo-
rized. After training the word alignment model with
the segmented sentence pairs, the word alignments
are concatenated again according to the positions of
their segments in the sentences. The original sen-
tence pairs and the concatenated alignments are then
used for the phrase extraction.

4 Translation Experiments
4.1 Bilingual Sentences Extraction Methods
In this section, we describe the different methods to
extract the bilingual sentence pairs from the docu-
ment aligned corpus.
Given each document pair, we assume that the
paragraphs are aligned one to one monotone if both
the source and target language documents contain
the same number of paragraphs; otherwise the para-
graphs are aligned with the Champollion tool.
Starting from the parallel paragraphs we extract
the sentences using three methods:
1. Binary segmentation
The segmentation method described in Sec-
tion 3 is applied by treating the paragraph pairs
as long sentence pairs. We can use the anchor
words model described in Section 3.4 to prefer
splitting at punctuation marks.
The lexicon parameters p(f |e) in Equation 2
are estimated as follows: First the sentences are
aligned roughly using the dynamic program-
ming algorithm. Training on these aligned sen-
tences, we get the initial lexicon parameters.
Then the binary segmentation algorithm is ap-
plied to extract the sentences again.
2. Champollion
After a paragraph is divided into sentences at
punctuation marks, the Champollion tool (Ma,
2006) is used, which applies dynamic program-
ming for the sentence alignment.
3. Combination
The bilingual corpora produced by the binary
segmentation and Champollion methods are
concatenated and are used in the training of the
translation model. Each corpus is assigned a
weight. During the training of the word align-
ment models, the counts of the lexicon en-
tries are linearly interpolated using the corpus
weights.
4.2 Translation Tasks
We will present the translation results on two
Chinese-English tasks.
1. On the large data track NIST task (NIST,
2005), we will show improvements using the
refined binary segmentation method.

2. On the FBIS corpus, we will compare the dif-
ferent sentence extraction methods described in
Section 4.1 with respect to translation perfor-
mance. We do not apply the extraction meth-
ods on the whole NIST corpora, because some
corpora provided by the LDC (LDC, 2005) are
sentence aligned but not document aligned.
4.3 Corpus Statistics
The training corpora used in NIST task are a set of
individual corpora including the FBIS corpus. These
corpora are provided by the Linguistic Data Consor-
tium (LDC, 2005), the domains are news articles.
The translation experiments are carried out on the
NIST 2002 evaluation set.
As shown in Table 1, there are 8.6 million sen-
tence pairs in the original corpora of the NIST task.
The average sentence length is about 25. After seg-
mentation, there are twice as many sentence pairs,
i.e. 17.9 million, and the average sentence length
is around 12. Due to a limitation of GIZA++, sen-
tences consisting of more than one hundred words
are filtered out. Segmentation of long sentences cir-
cumvents this restriction and allows us include more
data. Here we were able to add 8% more Chinese
and 8.2% more English running words to the train-
ing data. The training time is also reduced.
Table 2 presents statistics of the FBIS data. Af-
ter the paragraph alignment described in Section 4.1
we have nearly 81 thousand paragraphs, 8.6 million
Chinese and 10.1 million English running words.
One of the advantages of the binary segmentation is
that we do not loose words during the bilingual sen-
tences extraction. However, we produce sentence
pairs with very different lengths. Using Champol-
lion we loose 10.8% of the Chinese and 3.1% of the
English words.
4.4 Segmentation Parameters
We did not optimize the log-linear model scaling
factors for the binary segmentation but used the fol-
lowing fixed values: ?1 = ?2 = 0.5 for the IBM-1
models in both directions; ?3 = 108, if the anchor
words model is is used; ?4 = 30, if the IBM-4 model
is used. The maximum sentence length is 25.
4.5 Evaluation Criteria
We use four different criteria to evaluate the transla-
tion results automatically:
? WER (word error rate):
The WER is computed as the minimum num-
ber of substitution, insertion and deletion oper-
ations that have to be performed to convert the
generated sentence into the reference sentence,
divided by the reference sentence length.
? PER (position-independent word error rate):
A shortcoming of the WER is that it requires a
perfect word order. The word order of an ac-
ceptable sentence can be differ from that of the
target sentence, so that the WER measure alone
could be misleading. The PER compares the
words in the two sentences ignoring the word
order.
? BLEU score:
This score measures the precision of unigrams,

bigrams, trigrams and fourgrams with a penalty

? NIST score:
This score is similar to BLEU, but it uses
an arithmetic average of N-gram counts rather
than a geometric average, and it weights more
heavily those N-grams that are more informa-
tive. (Doddington, 2002).
The BLEU and NIST scores measure accuracy,
i.e. larger scores are better. In our evaluation the
scores are measured as case insensitive and with re-
spect to multiple references.
4.6 Translation Results
For the segmentation of long sentences into short
segments, we performed the experiments on the
NIST task. Both in the baseline and the segmenta-
tion systems we obtain 4.7 million bilingual phrases
during the translation. The method of alignment
concatenation increases the number of the extracted
bilingual phrase pairs from 4.7 million to 4.9 mil-
lion, the BLEU score is improved by 0.1%. By
including the IBM-4 Viterbi word alignment, the
NIST score is improved. The training of the base-
line system requires 5.9 days, after the sentence seg-
mentation it requires only 1.5 days. Moreover, the
segmentation allows the inclusion of long sentences
that are filtered out in the baseline system. Using
the added data, the translation performance is en-
hanced by 0.3% in the BLEU score. Because of
the long translation period, the translation parame-
ters are only optimized on the baseline system with
respect to the BLEU score, we could expect a further
improvement if the parameters were also optimized
on the segmentation system.
Our major objective here is to introduce another
approach to parallel sentence extraction: binary seg-
mentation of the bilingual texts recursively. We use
the paragraph-aligned corpus as a starting point. Ta-
ble 4 presents the translation results on the train-
ing corpora generated by the different methods de-
scribed in Section 4.1. The translation parameters
are optimized with the respect to the BLEU score.
We observe that the binary segmentation methods
are comparable to Champollion and the segmenta-
tion with anchors outperforms the one without an-
chors. By combining the methods of Champol-
lion and the binary segmentation with anchors, the
BLEU score is improved by 0.4% absolutely.
We optimized the weightings for the binary seg-
mentation method, the sum of the weightings for
both methods is one. As shown in Figure 2, using
one of the methods alone does not produce the best
result. The maximum BLEU score is attained when
both methods are combined with equal weightings.
5 Discussion and Future Work
We successfully applied the binary sentence seg-
mentation method to extract bilingual sentence pairs
from the document aligned texts. The experiments
on the FBIS data show an enhancement of 0.4% of
the BLEU score compared to the score obtained us-
ing a state-of-art sentence aligner. In addition to the
encouraging results obtained, further improvements
could be achieved in the following ways:
1. By extracting bilingual paragraphs from the
documents, we lost running words using Cham-
pollion. Applying the segmentation approach
to paragraph alignment might avoid the loss of
this data.
2. We combined a number of different models in
the binary segmentation, such as IBM-1, and
anchor words. The model weightings could be
optimized with respect to translation quality.

3. In the binary segmentation method, an incor-
rect segmentation results in further mistakes
in the segmentation decisions of all its sub-
segments. An alternative method (Wu, 1997)
makes decisions at the end but has a high com-
putational requirement. A restricted expansion
of the search space might better balance seg-
mentation accuracy and the efficiency.
