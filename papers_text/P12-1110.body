Abstract
We propose the first joint model for word segmen-
tation, POS tagging, and dependency parsing for
Chinese. Based on an extension of the incremental
joint model for POS tagging and dependency pars-
ing (Hatori et al., 2011), we propose an efficient
character-based decoding method that can combine
features from state-of-the-art segmentation, POS
tagging, and dependency parsing models. We also
describe our method to align comparable states in
the beam, and how we can combine features of dif-
ferent characteristics in our incremental framework.
In experiments using the Chinese Treebank (CTB),
we show that the accuracies of the three tasks can
be improved significantly over the baseline models,
particularly by 0.6% for POS tagging and 2.4% for
dependency parsing. We also perform comparison
experiments with the partially joint models.
1 Introduction
In processing natural languages that do not include
delimiters (e.g. spaces) between words, word seg-
mentation is the crucial first step that is necessary
to perform virtually all NLP tasks. Furthermore, the
word-level information is often augmented with the
POS tags, which, along with segmentation, form the
basic foundation of statistical NLP.
Because the tasks of word segmentation and POS
tagging have strong interactions, many studies have
been devoted to the task of joint word segmenta-
tion and POS tagging for languages such as Chi-
nese (e.g. Kruengkrai et al. (2009)). This is because
some of the segmentation ambiguities cannot be re-
solved without considering the surrounding gram-
matical constructions encoded in a sequence of POS
tags. The joint approach to word segmentation and
POS tagging has been reported to improve word seg-
mentation and POS tagging accuracies by more than
1% in Chinese (Zhang and Clark, 2008). In addition,
some researchers recently proposed a joint approach
to Chinese POS tagging and dependency parsing (Li
et al., 2011; Hatori et al., 2011); particularly, Ha-
tori et al. (2011) proposed an incremental approach
to this joint task, and showed that the joint approach
improves the accuracies of these two tasks.
In this context, it is natural to consider further
a question regarding the joint framework: how
strongly do the tasks of word segmentation and de-
pendency parsing interact? In the following Chinese
sentences:
S? ?sV  ?s ? ?s
current peace-prize and peace operation related
The current peace prize and peace operations are related.
S? ?s V ?s ? ?s ?S
current peace award peace operation related group
The current peace is awarded to peace-operation-related groups.
the only difference is the existence of the last word
?S; however, whether or not this word exists
changes the whole syntactic structure and segmen-
tation of the sentence. This is an example in which
word segmentation cannot be handled properly with-
out considering long-range syntactic information.
Syntactic information is also considered ben-
eficial to improve the segmentation of out-of-
vocabulary (OOV) words. Unlike languages such
as Japanese that use a distinct character set (i.e.
katakana) for foreign words, the transliterated words
in Chinese, many of which are OOV words, fre-
quently include characters that are also used as com-
mon or function words. In the current systems, the
existence of these characters causes numerous over-
segmentation errors for OOV words.
Based on these observations, we aim at build-
ing a joint model that simultaneously processes
word segmentation, POS tagging, and dependency
parsing, trying to capture global interaction among
1045
these three tasks. To handle the increased computa-
tional complexity, we adopt the incremental parsing
framework with dynamic programming (Huang and
Sagae, 2010), and propose an efficient method of
character-based decoding over candidate structures.
Two major challenges exist in formalizing the
joint segmentation and dependency parsing task in
the character-based incremental framework. First,
we must address the problem of how to align com-
parable states effectively in the beam. Because the
number of dependency arcs varies depending on
how words are segmented, we devise a step align-
ment scheme using the number of character-based
arcs, which enables effective joint decoding for the
three tasks.
Second, although the feature set is fundamen-
tally a combination of those used in previous works
(Zhang and Clark, 2010; Huang and Sagae, 2010), to
integrate them in a single incremental framework is
not straightforward. Because we must perform de-
cisions of three kinds (segmentation, tagging, and
parsing) in an incremental framework, we must ad-
just which features are to be activated when, and
how they are combined with which action labels. We
have also found that we must balance the learning
rate between features for segmentation and tagging
decisions, and those for dependency parsing.
We perform experiments using the Chinese Tree-
bank (CTB) corpora, demonstrating that the accura-
cies of the three tasks can be improved significantly
over the pipeline combination of the state-of-the-art
joint segmentation and POS tagging model, and the
dependency parser. We also perform comparison ex-
periments with partially joint models, and investi-
gate the tradeoff between the running speed and the
model performance.
2 Related Works
In Chinese, Luo (2003) proposed a joint con-
stituency parser that performs segmentation, POS
tagging, and parsing within a single character-based
framework. They reported that the POS tags con-
tribute to segmentation accuracies by more than 1%,
but the syntactic information has no substantial ef-
fect on the segmentation accuracies. In contrast,
we built a joint model based on a dependency-based
framework, with a rich set of structural features. Us-
ing it, we show the first positive result in Chinese
that the segmentation accuracies can be improved
using the syntactic information.
Another line of work exists on lattice-based pars-
ing for Semitic languages (Cohen and Smith, 2007;
Goldberg and Tsarfaty, 2008). These methods first
convert an input sentence into a lattice encoding
the morphological ambiguities, and then conduct
joint morphological segmentation and PCFG pars-
ing. However, the segmentation possibilities consid-
ered in those studies are limited to those output by
an existing morphological analyzer. In addition, the
lattice does not include word segmentation ambigu-
ities crossing boundaries of space-delimited tokens.
In contrast, because the Chinese language does not
have spaces between words, we fundamentally need
to consider the lattice structure of the whole sen-
tence. Therefore, we place no restriction on the seg-
mentation possibilities to consider, and we assess the
full potential of the joint segmentation and depen-
dency parsing model.
Among the many recent works on joint segmen-
tation and POS tagging for Chinese, the linear-time
incremental models by Zhang and Clark (2008) and
Zhang and Clark (2010) largely inspired our model.
Zhang and Clark (2008) proposed an incremental
joint segmentation and POS tagging model, with an
effective feature set for Chinese. However, it re-
quires to computationally expensive multiple beams
to compare words of different lengths using beam
search. More recently, Zhang and Clark (2010) pro-
posed an efficient character-based decoder for their
word-based model. In their new model, a single
beam suffices for decoding; hence, they reported that
their model is practically ten times as fast as their
original model. To incorporate the word-level fea-
tures into the character-based decoder, the features
are decomposed into substring-level features, which
are effective for incomplete words to have compara-
ble scores to complete words in the beam. Because
we found that even an incremental approach with
beam search is intractable if we perform the word-
based decoding, we take a character-based approach
to produce our joint model.
The incremental framework of our model is based
on the joint POS tagging and dependency parsing
model for Chinese (Hatori et al., 2011), which is an
extension of the shift-reduce dependency parser with
dynamic programming (Huang and Sagae, 2010).
They specifically modified the shift action so that it
assigns the POS tag when a word is shifted onto the
stack. However, because they regarded word seg-
mentation as given, their model did not consider the
1046
interaction between segmentation and POS tagging.
3 Model
3.1 Incremental Joint Segmentation, POS
Tagging, and Dependency Parsing
Based on the joint POS tagging and dependency
parsing model by Hatori et al. (2011), we build our
joint model to solve word segmentation, POS tag-
ging, and dependency parsing within a single frame-
work. Particularly, we change the role of the shift ac-
tion and additionally use the append action, inspired
by the character-based actions used in the joint seg-
mentation and POS tagging model by Zhang and
Clark (2010).
The list of actions used is the following:
? A: append the first character in the queue to the
word on top of the stack.
? SH(t): shift the first character in the input queue
as a new word onto the stack, with POS tag t.
? RL/RR: reduce the top two trees on the stack,
(s0, s1), into a subtree sy0 s1 / s
x
0 s1, respectively.
Although SH(t) is similar to the one used in Hatori
et al. (2011), now it shifts the first character in the
queue as a new word, instead of shifting a word. Fol-
lowing Zhang and Clark (2010), the POS tag is as-
signed to the word when its first character is shifted,
and the word?tag pairs observed in the training data
and the closed-set tags (Xia, 2000) are used to prune
unlikely derivations. Because 33 tags are defined in
the CTB tag set (Xia, 2000), our model exploits a
total of 36 actions.
To train the model, we use the averaged percep-
tron with the early update (Collins and Roark, 2004).
In our joint model, the early update is invoked by
mistakes in any of word segmentation, POS tagging,
or dependency parsing.
3.2 Alignment of States
When dependency parsing is integrated into the task
of joint word segmentation and POS tagging, it is
not straightforward to define a scheme to align (syn-
chronize) the states in the beam. In beam search, we
use the step index that is associated with each state:
the parser states in process are aligned according to
the index, and the beam search pruning is applied
to those states with the same index. Consequently,
for the beam search to function effectively, all states
with the same index must be comparable, and all
terminal states should have the same step index.
We can first think of using the number of shifted
characters as the step index, as Zhang and Clark
(2010) does. However, because RL/RR actions can
be performed without incrementing the step index,
the decoder tends to prefer states with more de-
pendency arcs, resulting more likely in premature
choice of ?reduce? actions or oversegmentation of
words. Alternatively, we can consider using the
number of actions that have been applied as the step
index, as Hatori et al. (2011) does. However, this
results in inconsistent numbers of actions to reach
the terminal states: some states that segment words
into larger chunks reach a terminal state earlier than
other states with smaller chunks. For these reasons,
we have found that both approaches yield poor mod-
els that are not at all competitive with the baseline
(pipeline) models1.
To address this issue, we propose an indexing
scheme using the number of character-based arcs.
We presume that in addition to the word-to-word de-
pendency arcs, each word (of length M ) implicitly
has M ? 1 inter-character arcs, as in: AxBxC ,
AxB x C , and A x B x C (each rectangle de-
notes a word). Then we can define the step index as
the sum of the number of shifted characters and the
total number of (inter-word and intra-word) depen-
dency arcs, which thereby meets all the following
conditions:
(1) All subtrees spanning M consecutive characters
have the same index 2M ? 1.
(2) All terminal states have the same step index 2N
(including the root arc), where N is the number
of characters in the sentence.
(3) Every action increases the index.
Note that the number of shifted characters is also
necessary to meet condition (3). Otherwise, it allows
an unlimited number of SH(t) actions without incre-
menting the step index. Figure 1 portrays how the
states are aligned using the proposed scheme, where
a subtree is denoted as a rectangle with its partial
index shown inside it.
In our framework, because an action increases the
step index by 1 (for SH(t) or RL/RR) or 2 (for A), we
need to use two beams to store new states at each
step. The computational complexity of the entire
process is O(B(T + 3) ? 2N), where B is the beam
1For example, in our preliminary experiment on CTB-5, the
step indexing according to the number of actions underperforms
the baseline model by 0.2?0.3% in segmentation accuracy.

3.3 Features
The feature set of our model is fundamentally a com-
bination of the features used in the state-of-the-art
joint segmentation and POS tagging model (Zhang
and Clark, 2010) and dependency parser (Huang and
Sagae, 2010), both of which are used as baseline
models in our experiment. However, we must care-
fully adjust which features are to be activated and
when, and how they are combined with which ac-
tion labels, depending on the type of the features be-
cause we intend to perform three tasks in a single
incremental framework.
The list of the features used in our joint model
is presented in Table 1, where S01?S05, W01?
W21, and T01?05 are taken from Zhang and Clark
(2010), and P01?P28 are taken from Huang and
Sagae (2010). Note that not all features are always
considered: each feature is only considered if the
action to be performed is included in the list of ac-
tions in the ?When to apply? column. Because S01?
S05 are used to represent the likelihood score of
substring sequences, they are only used for A and
SH(t) without being combined with any action la-
bel. Because T01?T05 are used to determine the
POS tag of the word being shifted, they are only ap-
plied for SH(t). Because W01?W21 are used to de-
termine whether to segment at the current position
or not, they are only used for those actions involved
in boundary determination decisions (A, SH(t), RL0,
and RR0). The action labels RL0/RR0 are used to
denote the ?reduce? actions that determine the word
boundary2, whereas RL1/RR1 denote those ?reduce?
actions that are applied when the word boundary has
already been fixed. In addition, to capture the shared
nature of boundary determination actions (SH(t),
RL0/RR0), we use a generalized action label SH? to
represent any of them when combined with W01?
W21. We also propose to use the features U01?U03,
which we found are effective to adjust the character-
level and substring-level scores.
Regarding the parsing features P01?P28, because
we found that P01?P17 are also useful for segmen-
tation decisions, these features are applied to all ac-
tions including A, with an explicit distinction of ac-
tion labels RL0/RR0 from RL1/RR1. On the other
hand, P18?P28 are only used when one of the parser
actions (SH(t), RL, or RR) is applied. Note that P07?
P09 and P18?P21 (look-ahead features) require the
look-ahead information of the next word form and
POS tags, which cannot be incorporated straightfor-
wardly in an incremental framework. Although we
have found that these features can be incorporated
using the delayed features proposed by Hatori et al.
(2011), we did not use them in our current model
because it results in the significant increase of com-
putational time.
3.3.1 Dictionary features
Because segmentation using a dictionary alone
can serve as a strong baseline in Chinese word seg-
mentation (Sproat et al., 1996), the use of dictio-
naries is expected to make our joint model more ro-
bust and enables us to investigate the contribution of
the syntactic dependency in a more realistic setting.
Therefore, we optionally use four features D01?D04
associated with external dictionaries. These features
distinguish each dictionary source, reflecting the fact
that different dictionaries have different characteris-
tics. These features will also be used in our reimple-
mentation of the model by Zhang and Clark (2010).
3.4 Adjusting the Learning Rate of Features
In formulating the three tasks in the incremental
framework, we found that adjusting the update rate
depending on the type of the features (segmenta-
tion/tagging vs. parsing) crucially impacts the final
performance of the model. To investigate this point,
we define the feature vector ~? and score ? of the
2A reduce action has an additional effect of fixing the bound-
ary of the top word on the stack if the last action was A or SH(t).

,
where ~?st corresponds to the segmentation and tag-
ging features (those starting with ?U?, ?S?, ?T?, or
?D?), and ~?p is the set of the parsing features (start-
ing with ?P?). Then, if we set ?p to a number smaller
than 1, perceptron updates for the parsing features
will be kept small at the early stage of training be-
cause the update is proportional to the values of the
feature vector. However, even if ?p is initially small,
the global weights for the parsing features will in-
crease as needed and compensate for the small ?p
as the training proceeds. In this way, we can con-
trol the contribution of syntactic dependencies at the
early stage of training. Section 4.3 shows that the
best setting we found is ?p = 0.5: this result sug-
gests that we probably should resolve remaining er-
rors by preferentially using the local n-gram based
features at the early stage of training. Otherwise,
the premature incorporation of the non-local syntac-
tic dependencies might engender overfitting to the
training data.
4 Experiment
4.1 Experimental Settings
We use the Chinese Penn Treebank ver. 5.1, 6.0,
and 7.0 (hereinafter CTB-5, CTB-6, and CTB-7)
for evaluation. These corpora are split into train-
ing, development, and test sets, according to previ-
ous works. For CTB-5, we refer to the split by Duan
et al. (2007) as CTB-5d, and to the split by Jiang
et al. (2008) as CTB-5j. We also prepare a dataset
for cross validation: the dataset CTB-5c consists of
sentences from CTB-5 excluding the development
and test sets of CTB-5d and CTB-5j. We split CTB-
5c into five sets (CTB-5c-n), and alternatively use
four of these as the training set and the rest as the
test set. CTB-6 is split according to the official split
1049
described in the documentation, and CTB-7 is split
according to Wang et al. (2011). The statistics of
these splits are shown in Table 2. As external dic-
tionaries, we use the HowNet Word List3, consist-
ing of 91,015 words, and page names from the Chi-
nese Wikipedia4 as of Oct 26, 2011, consisting of
709,352 words. These dictionaries only consist of
word forms with no frequency or POS information.
We use standard measures of word-level preci-
sion, recall, and F1 score, for evaluating each task.
The output of dependencies cannot be correct unless
the syntactic head and dependent of the dependency
relation are both segmented correctly. Following the
standard setting in dependency parsing works, we
evaluate the task of dependency parsing with the un-
labeled attachment scores excluding punctuations.
Statistical significance is tested by McNemar?s test
(? : p < 0.05, ? : p < 0.01).
4.2 Baseline and Proposed Models
We use the following baseline and proposed models
for evaluation.
? SegTag: our reimplementation of the joint seg-
mentation and POS tagging model by Zhang and
Clark (2010). Table 5 shows that this reimple-
mentation almost reproduces the accuracy of their
implementation. We used the beam of 16, which
they reported to achieve the best accuracies.

2010) and dependency parsing (Huang and Sagae,
2010). Therefore, we can investigate the contribu-
tion of the joint approach through comparison with
the pipeline and joint models.
4.3 Development Results
We have some parameters to tune: parsing feature
weight ?p, beam size, and training epoch. All these
parameters are set based on experiments on CTB-5c.
For experiments on CTB-5j, CTB-6, and CTB-7, the
training epoch is set using the development set.
Figure 2 shows the F1 scores of the proposed
model (SegTagDep) on CTB-5c-1 with respect to the
training epoch and different parsing feature weights,
where ?Seg?, ?Tag?, and ?Dep? respectively denote
the F1 scores of word segmentation, POS tagging,
and dependency parsing. In this experiment, the ex-
ternal dictionaries are not used, and the beam size
of 32 is used. Interestingly, if we simply set ?p to
1, the accuracies seem to converge at lower levels.
The ?p = 0.2 setting seems to reach almost identi-
cal segmentation and tagging accuracies as the best
setting ?p = 0.5, but the convergence occurs more
slowly. Based on this experiment, we set ?p to 0.5
throughout the experiments in this paper.
Table 3 shows the performance and speed of the
full joint model (with no dictionaries) on CTB-5c-1
with respect to the beam size. Although even the
beam size of 32 results in competitive accuracies
for word segmentation and POS tagging, the depen-
dency accuracy is affected most by the increase of
the beam size. Based on this experiment, we set the
beam size of SegTagDep to 64 throughout the exper-

4.4 Main Results
In this section, we present experimentally obtained
results using the proposed and baseline models. Ta-
ble 4 shows the segmentation, POS tagging, and
dependency parsing F1 scores of these models on
CTB-5c. Irrespective of the existence of the dic-
tionary features, the joint model SegTagDep largely
increases the POS tagging and dependency pars-
ing accuracies (by 0.56?0.63% and 2.34?2.44%);
the improvements in parsing accuracies are still
significant even compared with SegTag+Dep? (the
pipeline model with the look-ahead features). How-
ever, when the external dictionaries are not used
(?wo/dict?), no substantial improvements for seg-
mentation accuracies were observed. In contrast,
when the dictionaries are used (?w/dict?), the seg-
mentation accuracies are now improved over the
baseline model SegTag consistently (on every trial).
Although the overall improvement in segmentation
is only around 0.1%, more than 1% improvement is
observed if we specifically examine OOV6 words.
The difference between ?wo/dict? and ?w/dict? re-
sults suggests that the syntactic dependencies might
work as a noise when the segmentation model is in-
sufficiently stable, but the model does improve when
it is stable, not receiving negative effects from the
syntactic dependencies.
The partially joint model SegTag+TagDep is
shown to perform reasonably well in dependency
parsing: with dictionaries, it achieved the 2.02% im-
provement over SegTag+Dep, which is only 0.32%
lower than SegTagDep. However, whereas Seg-
Tag+TagDep showed no substantial improvement in
tagging accuracies over SegTag (when the dictionar-
ies are used), SegTagDep achieved consistent im-
provements of 0.46% and 0.58% (without/with dic-
6We define the OOV words as the words that have not seen in
the training data, even when the external dictionaries are used.

tionaries); these differences can be attributed to the
combination of the relieved error propagation and
the incorporation of the syntactic dependencies. In
addition, SegTag+TagDep has OOV tagging accura-
cies consistently lower than SegTag, suggesting that
the syntactic dependency has a negative effect on the
POS tagging accuracy of OOV words7. In contrast,
this negative effect is not observed for SegTagDep:
both the overall tagging accuracy and the OOV accu-
racy are improved, demonstrating the effectiveness
of the proposed model.

binations. Although SegTagDep takes a few times
longer to achieve accuracies comparable to those of
SegTag+Dep/TagDep, it seems to present potential
7This is consistent with Hatori et al. (2011)?s observation
that although the joint POS tagging and dependency parsing im-
proves the accuracy of syntactically influential POS tags, it has
a slight side effect of increasing the confusion between general
and proper nouns (NN vs. NR).

for greater improvement, especially for tagging and
parsing accuracies, when a larger beam can be used.
4.5 Comparison with Other Systems
Table 5 and Table 6 show a comparison of the seg-
mentation and POS tagging accuracies with other
state-of-the-art models. ?Kruengkrai+ ?09? is a
lattice-based model by Kruengkrai et al. (2009).
?Zhang ?10? is the incremental model by Zhang and
Clark (2010). These two systems use no external re-
sources other than the CTB corpora. ?Sun+ ?11? is a
CRF-based model (Sun, 2011) that uses a combina-
tion of several models, with a dictionary of idioms.
?Wang+ ?11? is a semi-supervised model by Wang
et al. (2011), which additionally uses the Chinese
Gigaword Corpus.
Our models with dictionaries (those marked with
?(d)?) have competitive accuracies to other state-of-
the-art systems, and SegTagDep(d) achieved the best
reported segmentation and POS tagging accuracies,
using no additional corpora other than the dictio-
naries. Particularly, the POS tagging accuracy is
more than 0.4% higher than the previous best sys-
tem thanks to the contribution of syntactic depen-
dencies. These results also suggest that the use of
readily available dictionaries can be more effective
than semi-supervised approaches.
5 Conclusion
In this paper, we proposed the first joint model
for word segmentation, POS tagging, and depen-
dency parsing in Chinese. The model demonstrated
substantial improvements on the three tasks over
the pipeline combination of the state-of-the-art joint
segmentation and POS tagging model, and depen-
dency parser. Particularly, results showed that the

accuracies of POS tagging and dependency pars-
ing were remarkably improved by 0.6% and 2.4%,
respectively corresponding to 8.3% and 10.2% er-
ror reduction. For word segmentation, although
the overall improvement was only around 0.1%,
greater than 1% improvements was observed for
OOV words. We conducted some comparison ex-
periments of the partially joint and full joint mod-
els. Compared to SegTagDep, SegTag+TagDep per-
forms reasonably well in terms of dependency pars-
ing accuracy, whereas the POS tagging accuracies
are more than 0.5% lower.
In future work, probabilistic pruning techniques
such as the one based on a maximum entropy model
are expected to improve the efficiency of the joint
model further because the accuracies are apparently
still improved if a larger beam can be used. More
efficient decoding would also allow the use of the
look-ahead features (Hatori et al., 2011) and richer
parsing features (Zhang and Nivre, 2011).
