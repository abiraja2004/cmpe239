Abstract
This paper describes the statistical ma-
chine translation (SMT) systems developed at
RWTH Aachen University for the translation
task of the NAACL 2012 Seventh Workshop on
Statistical Machine Translation (WMT 2012).
We participated in the evaluation campaign
for the French-English and German-English
language pairs in both translation directions.
Both hierarchical and phrase-based SMT sys-
tems are applied. A number of different tech-
niques are evaluated, including an insertion
model, different lexical smoothing methods,
a discriminative reordering extension for the
hierarchical system, reverse translation, and
system combination. By application of these
methods we achieve considerable improve-
ments over the respective baseline systems.
1 Introduction
For the WMT 2012 shared translation task1 RWTH
utilized state-of-the-art phrase-based and hierarchi-
cal translation systems as well as an in-house sys-
tem combination framework. We give a survey of
these systems and the basic methods they implement
in Section 2. For both the French-English (Sec-
tion 3) and the German-English (Section 4) language
pair, we investigate several different advanced tech-
niques. We concentrate on specific research direc-
tions for each of the translation tasks and present the
respective techniques along with the empirical re-
sults they yield: For the French?English task (Sec-
tion 3.1), we apply a standard phrase-based system.

translation-task.html
For the English?French task (Section 3.2), we aug-
ment a hierarchical phrase-based setup with a num-
ber of enhancements like an insertion model, dif-
ferent lexical smoothing methods, and a discrimina-
tive reordering extension. For the German?English
(Section 4.3) and English?German (Section 4.4)
tasks, we utilize morpho-syntactic analysis to pre-
process the data (Section 4.1) and employ sys-
tem combination to produce a consensus hypothesis
from normal and reverse translations (Section 4.2) of
phrase-based and hierarchical phrase-based setups.
2 Translation Systems
2.1 Phrase-Based System
The phrase-based translation (PBT) system used
in this work is an in-house implementation of the
state-of-the-art decoder described in (Zens and Ney,
2008). We use the standard set of models with
phrase translation probabilities and lexical smooth-
ing in both directions, word and phrase penalty,
distance-based distortion model, an n-gram target
language model and three binary count features. The
parameter weights are optimized with minimum er-
ror rate training (MERT) (Och, 2003).
2.2 Hierarchical Phrase-Based System
For our hierarchical phrase-based translation
(HPBT) setups, we employ the open source trans-
lation toolkit Jane (Vilar et al., 2010; Stein et
al., 2011; Vilar et al., 2012), which has been
developed at RWTH and is freely available for
non-commercial use. In hierarchical phrase-based
translation (Chiang, 2007), a weighted synchronous
context-free grammar is induced from parallel text.
304
In addition to contiguous lexical phrases, hierar-
chical phrases with up to two gaps are extracted.
The search is carried out with a parsing-based
procedure. The standard models integrated into our
Jane systems are: phrase translation probabilities
and lexical smoothing probabilities in both trans-
lation directions, word and phrase penalty, binary
features marking hierarchical phrases, glue rule,
and rules with non-terminals at the boundaries,
four binary count features, and an n-gram language
model. Optional additional models comprise IBM
model 1 (Brown et al., 1993), discriminative word
lexicon (DWL) models and triplet lexicon models
(Mauser et al., 2009), discriminative reordering ex-
tensions (Huck et al., 2011a), insertion and deletion
models (Huck and Ney, 2012), and several syntactic
enhancements like preference grammars (Stein
et al., 2010) and string-to-dependency features
(Peter et al., 2011). We utilize the cube pruning
algorithm (Huang and Chiang, 2007) for decoding
and optimize the model weights with MERT.
2.3 System Combination
System combination is used to produce consen-
sus translations from multiple hypotheses generated
with different translation engines. The basic concept
of RWTH?s approach to machine translation system
combination is described in (Matusov et al., 2006;
Matusov et al., 2008). This approach includes an
enhanced alignment and reordering framework. A
lattice is built from the input hypotheses. The trans-
lation with the best score within the lattice according
to a couple of statistical models is selected as con-
sensus translation.
2.4 Other Tools and Techniques
We employ GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003) to train
word alignments. The two trained alignments are
heuristically merged to obtain a symmetrized word
alignment for phrase extraction. All language mod-
els (LMs) are created with the SRILM toolkit (Stol-
cke, 2002) and are standard 4-gram LMs with in-
terpolated modified Kneser-Ney smoothing (Kneser
and Ney, 1995; Chen and Goodman, 1998). We
evaluate in truecase, using the BLEU (Papineni et al.,
2002) and TER (Snover et al., 2006) measures.

3 French-English Setups
We trained phrase-based translation systems for
French?English and hierarchical phrase-based
translation systems for English?French. Corpus
statistics for the French-English parallel data are
given in Table 1. The LMs are 4-grams trained on
the provided resources for the respective language
(Europarl, News Commentary, UN, 109, and mono-
lingual News Crawl language model training data).2
For French?English we also investigate a smaller
English LM on Europarl and News Commentary
data only. For English?French we experiment with
additional target-side data from the LDC French Gi-
gaword Second Edition (LDC2009T28), which is an
archive of newswire text data that has been acquired
over several years by the LDC.3 The LDC French
Gigaword v2 is permitted for constrained submis-
sions in the WMT shared translation task. As a de-
velopment set for MERT, we use newstest2009 in all
setups.
3.1 Experimental Results French?English
For the French?English task, the phrase-based
SMT system (PBT) is set up using the standard mod-
els listed in Section 2.1. We vary the training data
we use to train the system and compare the results.

It should be noted that these setups do not use any
English LDC Gigaword data for LM training at all.
Our baseline system uses the Europarl and News
Commentary data for training LM and phrase table.
Corpus statistics are shown in the ?EP+NC? section
of Table 1. This results in a performance of 24.7
points BLEU on newstest2011. Then we add the 109
as well as UN data and more monolingual English
data from the News Crawl corpus to the data used
for training the language model. This system ob-
tains a score of 27.7 points BLEU on newstest2011.
Our final system uses Europarl, News Commentary,
109 and UN data and News Crawl monolingual data
for LM training and the Europarl, News Commen-
tary and 109 data (Table 1) for phrase table training.
Using these data sets the system reaches 29.1 points
BLEU.
The experimental results are summarized in Ta-
ble 2.
3.2 Experimental Results English?French
For the English?French task, the baseline system is
a hierarchical phrase-based setup including the stan-
dard models as listed in Section 2.2, apart from the
binary count features. We limit the recursion depth
for hierarchical rules with a shallow-1 grammar (de
Gispert et al., 2010).
In a shallow-1 grammar, the generic non-terminal
X of the standard hierarchical approach is replaced
by two distinct non-terminals XH and XP . By
changing the left-hand sides of the rules, lexical
phrases are allowed to be derived from XP only, hi-
erarchical phrases from XH only. On all right-hand
sides of hierarchical rules, the X is replaced by XP .
Gaps within hierarchical phrases can thus solely be
filled with purely lexicalized phrases, but not a sec-
ond time with hierarchical phrases. The initial rule
is substituted with
S ? ?XP?0,XP?0?
S ? ?XH?0,XH?0? ,
(1)
and the glue rule is substituted with
S ? ?S?0XP?1, S?0XP?1?
S ? ?S?0XH?1, S?0XH?1? .
(2)
The main benefit of a restriction of the recursion
depth is a gain in decoding efficiency, thus allow-
ing us to set up systems more rapidly and to explore
more model combinations and more system config-
urations.
306
The experimental results for English?French are
given in Table 3. Starting from the shallow hi-
erarchical baseline setup on Europarl and News
Commentary parallel data only (but Europarl, News
Commentary, 109, UN, and News Crawl data for LM
training), we are able to improve translation qual-
ity considerably by first adopting more parallel (109
and UN) and monolingual (French LDC Gigaword
v2) training resources and then employing several
different models that are not included in the baseline
already. We proceed with individual descriptions of
the methods we use and report their respective effect
in BLEU on the test sets.
109 and UN (up to +2.5 points BLEU) While the
amount of provided parallel data from Europarl
and News Commentary sources is rather lim-
ited (around 2M sentence pairs in total), the
UN and the 109 corpus each provide a substan-
tial collection of further training material. By
appending both corpora, we end up at roughly
35M parallel sentences (cf. Table 1). We utilize
this full amount of data in our system, but ex-
tract a phrase table with only lexical (i.e. non-
hierarchical) phrases from the full parallel data.
We add it as a second phrase table to the base-
line system, with a binary feature that enables
the system to reward or penalize the application
of phrases from this table.
LDC Gigaword v2 (up to +0.5 points BLEU)
The LDC French Gigaword Second Edition
(LDC2009T28) provides some more monolin-
gual French resources. We include a total of
28.2M sentences from both the AFP and APW
collections in our LM training data.
insertion model (up to +0.4 points BLEU) We add
an insertion model to the log-linear model com-
bination. This model is designed as a means to
avoid the omission of content words in the hy-
potheses. It is implemented as a phrase-level
feature function which counts the number of in-
serted words. We apply the model in source-to-
target and target-to-source direction. A target-
side word is considered inserted based on lexi-
cal probabilities with the words on the foreign
language side of the phrase, and vice versa for
a source-side word. As thresholds, we compute
individual arithmetic averages for each word
from the vocabulary (Huck and Ney, 2012).
noisy-or lexical scores (up to +0.4 points BLEU) In
our baseline system, the tNorm(?) lexical scor-
ing variant as described in (Huck et al., 2011a)
is employed with a relative frequency (RF) lex-
icon model for phrase table smoothing. The
single-word based translation probabilities of
the RF lexicon model are extracted from word-
aligned parallel training data, in the fashion
of (Koehn et al., 2003). We exchange the base-
line lexical scoring with a noisy-or (Zens and
Ney, 2004) lexical scoring variant tNoisyOr(?).
DWL (up to +0.3 points BLEU) We augment
our system with phrase-level lexical scores
from discriminative word lexicon (DWL) mod-
els (Mauser et al., 2009; Huck et al., 2011a)
in both source-to-target and target-to-source di-
rection. The DWLs are trained on News Com-
mentary data only.
IBM-1 (up to +0.1 points BLEU) On News Com-
mentary and Europarl data, we train IBM
model-1 (Brown et al., 1993) lexicons in both
translation directions and also use them to com-
pute phrase-level scores.
discrim. RO (up to +0.4 points BLEU) The modi-
fication of the grammar to a shallow-1 version
restricts the search space of the decoder and is
convenient to prevent overgeneration. In order
not to be too restrictive, we reintroduce more
flexibility into the search process by extending
the grammar with specific reordering rules
XP ? ?XP?0XP?1,XP?1XP?0?
XP ? ?XP?0XP?1,XP?0XP?1? .
(3)
The upper rule in Equation (3) is a swap rule
that allows adjacent lexical phrases to be trans-
posed, the lower rule is added for symmetry
reasons, in particular because sequences as-
sembled with these rules are allowed to fill gaps
within hierarchical phrases. Note that we apply
a length constraint of 10 to the number of ter-
minals spanned by an XP . We introduce two
binary indicator features, one for each of the
two rules in Equation (3). In addition to adding

these rules, a discriminatively trained lexical-
ized reordering model is applied (Huck et al.,
2012).
4 German-English Setups
We trained phrase-based and hierarchical transla-
tion systems for both translation directions of the
German-English language pair. Corpus statistics for
German-English can be found in Table 4. The lan-
guage models are 4-grams trained on the respective
target side of the bilingual data as well as on the pro-
vided News Crawl corpus. For the English language
model the 109 French-English, UN and LDC Giga-
word Fourth Edition corpora are used additionally.
For the 109 French-English, UN and LDC Gigaword
corpora we apply the data selection technique de-
scribed in (Moore and Lewis, 2010). We examine
two different language models, one with LDC data
and one without. All German?English systems are
optimized on newstest2010. For English?German,
we use newstest2009 as development set. The news-
test2011 set is used as test set and the scores for new-
stest2008 are included for completeness.
4.1 Morpho-Syntactic Analysis
In order to reduce the source vocabulary size for
the German?English translation, the German text
is preprocessed by splitting German compound
words with the frequency-based method described in
(Koehn and Knight, 2003). To further reduce trans-
lation complexity of PBT, we employ the long-range
part-of-speech based reordering rules proposed by
Popovic? and Ney (2006).
4.2 Reverse Translation
For reverse translations we need to change the word
order of the bilingual corpus. For example, if we re-
verse both source and target language, the original
training example ?der Hund mag die Katze . ? the
dog likes the cat .? is converted into a new training
example ?. Katze die mag Hund der? . cat the likes
dog the?. We call this type of modification of source
or target language reversion. A system trained of
this data is called reverse. This modification changes
the corpora and hence the language model and align-
ment training produce different results.
4.3 Experimental Results German?English
Our results for the German?English task are shown
in Table 5. For this task, we apply the idea of reverse
translation for both the phrase-based and the hierar-
chical approach. It seems that the reversed systems
perform slightly worse. However, when we em-
ploy system combination using both reverse trans-
lation setups (PBT reverse and HPBT reverse) and
both baseline setups (PBT baseline and HPBT base-
line), the translation quality is improved by up to 0.4
points in BLEU and 1.0 points TER compared to the
best single system.
The addition of LDC Gigaword corpora (+GW)
to the language model training data of the baseline
setups shows improvements in both BLEU and TER.
Furthermore, with the system combination including
these setups, we are able to report an improvement
of up to 0.7 points BLEU and 1.0 points TER over the
best single setup. Compared to the system combina-
tion based on systems which are not using the LDC
Gigaword corpora, we gain 0.3 points in BLEU and
0.4 points in TER.
4.4 Experimental Results English?German
Our results for the English?German task are shown
in Table 6. For this task, we first compare sys-
tems using one, two or three language models of
different parts of the data. The language model
for systems with only one language model is cre-
ated with all monolingual and parallel data. A lan-
guage model with all monolingual data and a lan-
guage model with all parallel data is created for the
systems with two language models. For the systems
with three language models, we also split the parallel
data in two parts consisting of either only Europarl
data or only News Commentary data. For PBT the
system with two language models performs best for
all test sets. Further, we apply the idea of reverse

translation for both the phrase-based and the hier-
archical approach. The PBT reverse 2 LM systems
perform slightly worse compared to PBT baseline 2
LM. The HPBT reverse 2 LM performs better com-
pared to HPBT baseline 2 LM. When we employ
system combination using both reverse translation
setups (PBT reverse 2 LM and HPBT reverse 2 LM)
and both baseline setups (PBT baseline 2 LM and
HPBT baseline 2 LM), the translation quality is im-
proved by up to 0.2 points in BLEU and 2.1 points in

5 Conclusion
For the participation in the WMT 2012 shared trans-
lation task, RWTH experimented with both phrase-
based and hierarchical translation systems. Several
different techniques were evaluated and yielded con-
siderable improvements over the respective base-
line systems as well as over our last year?s setups
(Huck et al., 2011b). Among these techniques are
an insertion model, the noisy-or lexical scoring vari-
ant, additional phrase-level lexical scores from IBM
model 1 and discriminative word lexicon models, a
discriminative reordering extension for hierarchical
translation, reverse translation, and system combi-
nation.
