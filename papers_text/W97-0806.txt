Abstract 
Automatic text categorization is a complex 
and useful task for manynatural language 
processing applications. Recent approaches to 
textcategorization focus more on algorithms 
than on resources involved in thisoperation. In
contrast o this trend, we present an approach 
based on the integration of widely available 
resources aslexical databases and training 
collections to overcome current limitationsof 
the task. Our approach ~makes use of Word- 
Net synonymy information toincrease evi- 
dence for bad trained categories. When testing 
a direct categorization, a WordNet basedone, a 
training algorithm, and our integrated ap- 
proach, the latter exhibitsa better perfomance 
than any of the others. Incidentally, WordNet 
based approach perfomance is comparable 
with the trainingapproach one. 
1 In t roduct ion  
Text categorization (TC) is the classification ofdocu- 
ments with respect to a set of one or more pre-existing 
categories. TCis a hard and very useful operation fre- 
quently applied to the assignment of subject categories 
to documents, toroute and filter texts, or as a part of 
natural anguage processingsystems. 
In this paper we present an automatic TC approach 
based on theuse of several inguistic resources. Nowa- 
days, many resources like trainingcollections and lexi- 
cal databases have been successfully employed for text 
classificationtasks \[Boguraev and Pustejovsky, 1996\], 
but always in an isolated way. Thecurrent trend in the 
TC field is to pay more attention to algorithms thanto 
resources. We believe that the key idea for the im- 
provement of text categorization is increasing 
theamount of information a system makes use of, 
through the integration ofseveral resources. 
We have chosen the Information Retrieval vector 
space model for ourapproach. Term weight vectors are 
computed for documents and categoriesemploying the
lexical database WordNet and the training subset of 
the testcollection Reuters-22173. We calculate the 
weight vectors for:

_ A direct approach, 
_ a Wordnet based approach, 
_ a training collection approach, 
_ and finally, a technique for integrating WordNet 
and a training collection. 
Later, we compare document-category similarity by 
means of a cosine-basedfunction. We have driven a 
series of experiments on the test subset of Reuters- 
22173, which yields two conclusions. First, the inte- 
grated approach performs better than any of the other 
ones, confirming thehypothesis that the more informed 
a text classification system is, thebetter it performs. 
Secondly, the lexical database oriented technique can 
rival with the training approach, avoiding the necessity 
ofcost-expensive building of training collections for 
any domain andclassification task. 
2 Task  Descr ipt ion 
Given a set of documents and a set of categories, the 
goal of acategorization system is to decide whether 
any document belongs to anycategory ornot. The sys- 
tem makes use of the information contained in adocu- 
ment to compute a degree of pertainance of the docu- 
ment to each category. Categories are usually subject 
labels likeart or military, but other categories like text 
genres are also interesting\[Karlgren a d Cutting, 
1994\]. Documents can be news stories, e- 
mailmessages, reports, and so forth. 
The most widely used resource for TC is the training 
collection. Attaining collection is a set of manually 
classified documents that allowsthe system to guess 
clues on how to classify new unseen documents. 
Thereare currently several TC test collections, from 
which a training subset and a test subset can be ob- 
tained. Forinstance, the huge TREC collection 
\[Harman, 1996\], OHSUMED \[Hersh etal, 1994\] and 
Reuters-22173 \[Lewis, 1992\] have been collected for 
thistask. We have selected Reuters because it has been 
used in other work,facilitating the comparison of re- 
suits. 
Lexical databases have been rarely employed in TC, 
but severalapproaches ave demonstrated their useful- 
ness for term classification operations like word sense 
disambiguation\[Resnik, 1995; Agirre and Rigau, 
1996\]. A lexical database is a referencesystem that 
accumulates information on the lexical items of one o 
39 
several anguages In this view,machine readable dic- 
tionaries can also be regarded as primitive lexicaldata- 
bases. Current lexical databases include WordNet 
\[Miller, 1995\], EDR\[Yokoi, 1995\] and Roget's The- 
saurus. WordNet's large coverage and frequent utili- 
zation has led us touse it for our experiments. 
We organize our work depending on the kind and 
number ofresources involved. First, a direct approach 
in which only the categoriesthemselves are the terms 
used in representation has been tested. Secondly, 
WordNet by itself has been usedfor increasing the 
number of terms and so, the amount of predictingin- 
formation. Thirdly, we have made use of the training 
subset of Reuters toobtain the categories representa- 
tives. Finally, we have employed both WordNet and 
Reuters to get a betterrepresentation of undertramed 
categories 
3 Integrat ing Resources in the Vector 
SpaceModel  
The Vector Space Model (VSM) \[Salton and McGill, 
1983\] is a very suitableenvironment for expressing our 
approaches to TC: it is supported by many experiences 
in textretrieval \[Lewis, 1992; Salton, 1989\];' it allows 
the seamless integratlonof multiple knowledge sources 
for text classification, and it makes it easyto identify 
the role of every knowledge source involved in the 
classification operation In the nextsections we present 
a straightforward adaptation of the VSM for TC, and 
theway we use the chosen resources for calculating 
several model elements. 
3.1 Vector SpaceModei for Text Catego- 
r izat ion 
The bulk of the VSM for Information Retrieval (IR) is 
representing naturallanguage xpressions as term 
weight vectors. Each weight measures theimportance 
of a term in a natural anguage xpression, which can 
be adocument or a query. Semantic loseness between 
documents and queries is computed by the cosine of 
the anglebetween document and query vectors. 
Exploiting an obvious analogy between queries and 
categories,the latters can be represented by term 
weight vectors Then, a category canbe assigned to a 
document when the cosine similarity between them 
exceeds acertaln threshold, or when the category is 
highly ranked. In a closer look,and given three sets of 
N terms, M documents and Lcategories, the weight 
vector for document j is (wdl.l,Wd2j ..... wdNl) and the 
weight vector for category k is (WC-lk, WC2k-,. ,WCNk). 
The similarity between document j and category k is 
obtained with the formula: 
8lm(dj,Ck)= 
N 
wdv ? WC,k 
t=l 
Ewc 
t=l 
Term weights for document vectors can be computed 
making use of wellknown formulae based on term 
frequency. We use the following one from\[Salton, 
1989\]: 
M wd v = ~ " log2 ~-  
Where ~/ i s  the frequency of term t in documentj, and 
dfl is the-number of documents m which term : occurs 
Now, only weights for category vectors are to be ob- 
tained. Next we will show how to do it depending on 
the resource used. 
3.2 Direct Approach 
This approach to TC makes no use of any resource 
apart to the documents tobe classified It tests the in- 
tuition that the name of content-basedcategories is a 
good predictor for the occurrence of these categories. 
For instance, the occurrence of the word "barley" in 
adocument suggests that this one should be classified 
in the barley z category. All the following examples 
are taken from the Reuters categoryset and involve 
words that actually occur in the documents, category. 
Wehave taken exactly the categories names, although 
classification in moregeneral categories like strategtc- 
metal should rather relay on the occurrence of more 
specificwords like '"gold" or "zinc." 
In this approach, the terms used for the representa- 
tion are justthe categories themselves. The weight of 
term t m the vector forcategory j is 1 tf i = j and 0 in 
other cases. Multiword categories imply the use of 
multiwordterms. For example, the expression "balance 
of payments" is considered as one term. When catego- 
ries consist of several synonyms(like zron-steel), all of 
them are used in the representation. Since the number 
ofcategories m Reuters is 135, and two of them are 
composite, these approachproduces 137-component 
vectors .  
3.3 WordNet based Approach 
Lexical databases contain many kinds of information 
(concepts; synonymy andother lexical relations; hy- 
ponymy and other conceptual relations; etc.),For in- 
stance, WordNet represents concepts as synonyms sets, 
or synsets. We haveselected this synonymy informa- 
tion, performing a "categoryexpansion" simdar to 
query expansion in IR. For any category,the synset it 
belongs to is selected, and any other term belonging to 
it is added to therepresentation. This technique in- 
creases the amount of evidence used topredict category 
occurrence. 
Unfortunately, the disambiguation of categories 
with respect oWordNet concepts is required. We have 
performed this task manually, becausethe small num- 
ber of categories in the test collection made it afford- 
able. We are currently designing algorithms for auto- 
mating this operation. 
After locating categories in WordNet, a term set 
containing allthe category's synonyms has been built. 
For the 135 categories used in thisstudy, we have pro- 
duced 368 terms. Although some meaningless terms 
2 All the following examples are taken from the Reuters 
category set, andthey anvolve words that actually occur m 
the documents 
40 
occur and could bedeleted, we have developed no 
automatic riteria for this at the moment. 
Let us take a look to one example. The fuel category 
hasdriven us to the addition of the terms 
"combustible" and "combustible material," since they 
belong to the same synset in WordNet. In general, the 
termweight vector for category k Is 1 for every syno- 
nym of the category an0 for any other term. 
3.4 Training Col lect ion Approach 
The key asumption when using a training collection is 
that a term often occurring within a category and 
rarely within others is a good predictorfor that cate- 
gory. A set of predictors is typically computed from 
term tocategory co-ocurrence statistics, as a training 
step. The computation depends on the approach and 
algorithmselected. As Lewis \[1992\] has done before, 
we have replicated in the VSMearly Bayesian experi- 
ments that had reported good results. 
Terms are selected according to the number of times 
they occur withincategories. Those terms which co- 
occur at least with the 1% and at mostwith the 10% of 
the categories are taken. Among them, those 286 with- 
highest document frequency are selected. We work the 
weights out in the same way as in documents vectors: 
= O~k "log2 ~-  WCtk 
Where t~k is the number of times that term zoccurs 
within documents assigned to category k, and cfiis the 
number of categories within term # occurs. For exam- 
ple, aRer selecting and weighting categories, the high- 
frequency term" export" shows its largest weight for 
category trade, but it also shows large weights for 
grain or wheat, andsmall weights for belgtan-franc 
and wool. A less frequent erm typically provides evi- 
dence for asmaller number of categories. For example, 
"private" has a large weight only for acq (acquisition), 
and medium for earn (earnings) and trade. 
3.5 Integrat ing WordNet  and a Train- 
ingCol leet ion 
Several ways of integrating WordNet and Reuters have 
occurred to us. Asensible one is to use concepts in- 
stead of terms as representatives.However, and al- 
though promising, Voorhees \[1993\] reported no im- 
provements with this idea.On the other side, we have 
realized that the shortcomings in training canbe cor- 
rected using WordNet to provide better forecast of low 
frequencycategories. 
In general, we have linked WordNet weight vectors 
to training weigth vectors. First we have removed 
those WordNet terms not ocurring in thetraining col- 
lection. Then we have normahzed both WordNet vec- 
tors andtraining vectors to separately add up across 
each category. This way we have smoothed training 
weights (much larger than WordNetones), giving equal 
influence to each kind of term weight. This tech- 
niqueresults in 461 term weights vectors, 185 coming 
from WordNet, and 286 fromtraining. Weights for 
terms ocurring in both sets have been 
summed.Examples of terms coming from training are 
"import" or"government," with high weights for 
highly frequent categories, like acq. Examplesof terms 
coming from WordNet are "petroleum" or" peanut," 
with wezghts only for the correspondingcategories 
crude and groundnut respectively. 
We can clearly identify the role of each resource in 
this TCapproach. WordNet supplies information on the 
semantic relatedness of termsand categories when 
training data is no longer available or reliable It di- 
rectly contributes with part of the terms used in the 
vector representation. On the other side, the training 
collection supplies terms for those categories that are 
better trained The problem of unavailabilityof training 
data is then overcome through the use of an extern 
resource. 
4 Eva luat ion  
Evaluation of TC and other text classification opera- 
tions exhibits greatheterogeneity. Several metrics and 
test collections have been used fordifferent approaches 
or works. This results in a lack of comparability 
among the approaches,forcing to replicate xperiments 
from other researchers. Trying to minimize this prob- 
lem, we havechosen a set of very extended metrics and 
a frequently used free testcollection for our work. The 
metrics are recall and precision, and the testcollection 
is, as introduced before, Reuters-22173. Before step- 
ping into the actual results, we provide acloser look to 
these elements. 
4.1 Evaluat ion metrics 
The VSM promotes recall and precision based evalua- 
tion, but there are several ways of calculating or even 
defining them. Wefocus on recall, being the discussion 
analogous for precismn. First,definition can be given 
regarding categories or documents \[Larkey andCroft, 
1996\]. Second, computation can be done macro- 
averaging or micro-averaging \[Lewis, 1992\]. 
_ Recall can be defined as the number of correctly as- 
signed documents to a category over the number of 
documents to becorrectly assigned to the category. 
But a document-oriented definition is also possible: 
the number of correctly assigned categories to 
adocument over the number of correct categories to 
be assigned to thedocument. This later definition is 
more coherent with the task, but theformer allows 
to identify the most problematic categories. 
_ Macro-averaging consists of computing recall and 
precision for every item (document or category) in 
one of both previous ways, and averaging aRer it. 
Micro-averaging is adding up all numbers of cor- 
rectly assigned items, items assigned, and items to 
be assigned, and calculate only one value of recall 
and precision. When micro-averaging, no distinc- 
tion about document or category orientation can be 
made. Macro-averaging assigns equal weight to 
every category, while micro-averaging is influenced 
by most frequent categories. 
Evaluation depends finally on the category assignment 
strategy: probabihty thresholding, k-per-doe assign- 
ment, etc. Strategies define the way to produce re- 
call/precision tables. For instance, if similarities are 
normalized to the \[0,1\] interval, eleven levels of prob-

ability threshold can be set to0.0, 0.1, and so. When 
the system performs k-per-doe assignment, he value 
of k is ranged from 1 to a reasonable maximum. 
Figure 1 
We must assign an unknown number of categories to 
each document in Reuters. So, the probabdity thresh- 
olding approach seems the most sensible one. We have 
then computed recall and precision for eleven ,levels of 
threshold, both macro and micro-averaging. When 
macro-averaging, we have used the category-oriented 
definition of recall and precision. After that, we have 
calculated averages of those eleven values in order to 
get single figures for comparison. 
4.2 The Test  Co l lec t ion  
The Reuters-22173 collection consists of 22,173 
newswire articles from Reuters collected uring 1987. 
Documents in Reuters deal with financial topics, and 
were classified in several sets of financial categories 
by personnel from Reuters Ltd. and Carnegie Group 
Inc. Documents vary in length and number of catego- 
ries assigned, from 1 line to more than 50, and from 
none categories to more than 8. There are five sets of 
categories: TOPICS, ORGANIZATIONS, 
EXCHANGES, PLACES, and PEOPLE. As others 
before, we have selected the 135TOPICS for our ex- 
periments. An example of  news article classified in 
bop (balance of payments) and trade is shown in Fig- 
ure 1. Some spurious formatting has been removed 
from it. 
eral partitions have been suggested for Reuters \[Lewis, 
1992\], among which ones we have opted for the most 
general and difficult one. First 21,450news stories are 
used for training, and last 723 are kept for testing. We 
summarize significant differences between test and 
training sets in Table 2. These differences can bring 
noise into categorization, because training relies on 
similarity between training and test documents. Nev- 
ertheless, this 21,450/723 partition has been used be- 
fore \[Lewis, 1992; Hayes and Weinstein, 1990\] and 
involves the general case of documents with no cate- 
gories assigned. 
We have worked with raw data provided in the 
Reuters distribution. Control characters, numbers and 
several separators like"/" have been removed, and 
categories different from the TOPICS set have been 
ignored. For disambiguating categories with respect o 
WordNet senses, we first had to acquire their meaning, 
not always self-evident This task has been performed 
by direct examination of training documents. 
4.3 Resu l ts  and In terpretat ion  
The results of our first series of experiments are sum- 
marized in Table 3.This table shows recall and preci- 
sion averages calculated both macro and micro- 
averaging for a threshold-based assignment strategy. 
Values for the integrated approach show some general 
advantage over WordNet and training approaches, but 
results are not decisive. Training results are compara- 
ble with those from Lewis \[1992\], and the WordNet 
approach is roughly equivalent to the training one.

)erlments 
On one hand, the integrated approach shows a better 
performance than the WordNet one in general, al- 
though a problem of precision is detected when macro- 
averaging. The influence of low precision training has 
produced this effect. We are planning to strengthen 
42 
WordNet influence to overcome this problem. On the 
other hand, the integrated approach reports better gen- 
eral performance than the training approach. 
As expected, WordNet and training both beat the 
direct approach. When comparing WordNet and train- 
ing approaches, we observe that the former produces 
better esults with categories of low frequency, while 
the latter performs better in highly frequent categories. 
However, both exhibit the same overall behaviour. 
Differences in categories are noticed by the fact that 
micro-averaging is influenced by highly frequent ele- 
ments, while macro-averaging depends on the results 
of many elements of low frequency. 
5 Related Work 
Text categorization has emerged as a very active field 
of research in the recent years. Many studies have 
been conducted to test the accuracy of training meth- 
ods, although much less work has been developed in 
lexical database methods. However, lexical databases 
and especially WordNet have been often used for other 
text classification tasks, like word sense disambigua- 
tion. 
Many different algorithms making use of a training 
collection have been used for TC, including k-nearest- 
neighbor algorithms \[Masand et al, 1992\], Bayesian 
classifiers \[Lewis, 1992\], learning algorithms based in 
relevance feedback \[Lewis et al, 1996\] or in decision 
trees \[Apte t al., 1994\], or neural networks \[Wiener et 
al., 1995\]. Apart from Lewis \[1992\], the closest ap- 
proach to ours is the one from Larkey and Croft 
\[1996\], who combine k-nearest-neighbor, Bayesian 
independent and relevance feedback classifiers, 
showing improvements over the separated approaches. 
Although they do not make use of several resources, 
their approach tends to increase the information avail- 
able to the system, in the spirit of our hypothesis. 
To our knowledge, lexical databases have been used 
only once in TC. Hearst \[1994\] adapted a disambigua- 
tion algorithm by Yarowsky using WordNet to recog- 
nize category occurrences. Categories are made of 
WordNet erms, which is not the general case of stan- 
dard or user-defined categories. It is a hard task to 
adapt WordNet subsets to pre-existing categories, 
especially when they are domain dependent. Hearst's 
approach shows promising results confirmed by the 
fact that our WordNet -based approach performs at 
least equally to a simple training approach. 
Lexical databases have been employed recently in 
word sense disarnbiguation. For example, Agirre and 
Rigan \[1996\] make use of a semantic distance that 
takes into account structural factors in WordNet for 
achieving good results for this task. Additionally, 
Resnik \[1995\] combines the use of WordNet and a text 
collection for a definition of a distance for disambigu- 
ating noun groupings. Although the text collection is 
not a training collection (in the sense of a collection of 
manually labeled texts for a pre-defined text process- 
ing task), his approach can be regarded as the most 
similar to ours in the disambiguation task. Finally, Ng 
and Lee \[1996\] make use of several sources of infor- 
mation inside a training collection (neighborhood, part 
of speech, morphological form, etc.) to get good re- 
sults in disambiguating unrestricted text. 
We can see, then, that combining resources in TC is 
a new and promising approach supported by previous 
research in this and other text classification operations. 
With more information extracted from WordNet and 
better training algorithms, automatic TC integrating 
several resources could compete with manual indexing 
in qua!ity, and beat it in cost and efficiency. 
6 Conclusions and Future Work 
In this paper, we have presented a multiple resource 
approach for TC. This approach integrates the use of a 
lexical database and a training collection in a vector 
space model for TC. The technique is based on im- 
proving the language of representation construction 
through the use of the lexical database, which over- 
comes training deficiencies. We have tested our ap- 
proach against training algorithms and lexical database 
algorithms, reporting better esults than both of these 
techniques. We have also acknowledged that a lexical 
database algorithm can rival training algorithms in real 
world situations. 
Two main work lines are open: first, we have to 
conduct new series of experiments ocheck the lexical 
database and the combined approaches with other 
more sophisticated training approaches; econd, we 
will extend the multiple resource technique to other 
text classification tasks, like text routing or relevance 
feedback in text retrieval.
