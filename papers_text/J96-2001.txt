Given a form that is previously unseen in a sufficiently large training corpus, and that is mor- 
phologically n-ways ambiguous (serves n different lexical functions) what is the best estimator 
for the lexical prior probabilities for the various functions of the form? We argue that the best 
estimator is provided by computing the relative frequencies of the various functions among the 
hapax legomena--the forms that occur exactly once in a corpus; in particular, a hapax-based 
estimator isbetter than one based on the proportion of the various functions among words of all 
frequency ranges. As we shall argue, this is because when one computes an overall measure, one is 
including high-frequency words, and high-frequency words tend to have idiosyncratic properties 
that are not at all representative ofthe much larger mass of(productively formed) low-frequency 
words. This result has potential importance for various kinds of applications requiring lexical 
disambiguation, i cluding, in particular, stochastic taggers. This is especially true when some 
initial hand-tagging ofa corpus is required:for predicting lexical priors for very low-frequer~cy 
morphologically ambiguous types (most of which would not occur in any given corpus), one 
should concentrate on tagging a good representative sample of the hapax legomena, rather than 
extensively tagging words of all frequency ranges. 
1. Introduction 
As a number of writers on morphology have noted (most recently and notably Beard 
\[1995\]), it is common to find that a particular affix or other morphological marker 
serves more than one function in a language. For example, in many morphologically 
complex languages it is often the case that several slots in a paradigm are filled with 
the same form; put in another way, it is common to find that a particular morphologi- 
cal form is in fact ambiguous between several distinct functions. This phenomenon-- 
which in the domain of inflectional morphology is termed syncretism---can be illus- 
trated by a Dutch example such as lopen 'walk', which can either be the infinitive form 
('to walk') or the finite plural (present tense) form ('we, you, or they walk'). In some 
cases, syncretism is completely systematic: for example the case cited in Dutch, where 
the -en suffix can always function in the two ways cited; or in Latin, where the plural 
dative and ablative forms of nouns and adjectives are always identical, no matter what 
paradigm the noun belongs to. In other cases, a particular instance of syncretism ay 
be displayed only in some paradigms: for example, Russian feminine norms, such as 
loshad' 'horse' (Cyrillic aoma~b), have the same form for both the genitive singular

- -  loshadi (Cyrillic aoma~i4) - -  and the nominative plural, whereas masculine nouns 
typically distinguish these forms. In still other cases, the syncretism ay be partial in 
that two forms may be identical at one level of representation - -  say, orthography - -  
but not another - -  say, pronunciation. For example the written form goroda in Rus- 
sian (Cyrillic ropo~a) may either be the nominative plural or the genitive singular of 
'city'. In the genitive singular, the stress is on the first syllable (/g%rodA/), whereas 
in the nominative plural the stress resides on the final syllable (/gorAd~a/); note that 
the difference in stress results in very different vowel qualities for the two forms, as 
indicated in the phonetic transcriptions. 
Syncretism and related morphological ambiguities present a problem for many 
NL applications where lexical disambiguation is important; cases where the ortho- 
graphic form is identical but the pronunciations of the various functions differ are 
particularly important for speech applications, such as text-to-speech, since appro- 
priate word pronunciations must be computed from orthographic forms that under- 
specify the necessary information. Ideally one would like to build models that use 
contextual information to perform lexical disambiguation (Yarowsky 1992, 1994), but 
such models must be trained on specialized tagged corpora (either hand-generated 
or semi-automatically generated) and such training corpora are often not available, at 
least in the early phases of constructing a particular application. Lacking good contex- 
tual models, one is forced to fall back on estimates of the lexical prior probabilities for 
the various functions of a form. Following standard terminology, a lexical prior can be 
defined as follows: Imagine that a given form is n-ways ambiguous; the lexical prior 
probability of sense i of this form is simply the probability of sense i independent of 
the context in which the particular instantiation of the form occurs. Assuming one 
has a tagged corpus, one can usually get reasonable stimates of the lexical priors 
for the frequent forms (such as Dutch lopen 'walk') by simply counting the number 
of times the form occurs in each of its various functions and dividing by the total 
number of instances of the form (in any function). This yields the Maximum Like- 
lihood Estimate (MLE) for the lexical prior probability. But for infrequent or unseen 
forms, it is less clear how to compute the estimate. Consider another Dutch example 
like aanlokken 'entice, appeal'. This form occurs only once, as an infinitive, in the Uit 
den Boogaart (henceforth UdB) corpus (Uit den Boogaart 1975); in other words it is a 
hapax legomenon (< Greek hapax 'once', legomenon 'said') in this corpus. Obviously 
the lexical prior probability of this form expressing the finite plural is not zero, the 
MLE is a poor estimate in such cases. When one considers forms that do not occur 
in the training corpus (e.g., bedraden 'to wire') the situation is even worse. The prob- 
lem, then, is to provide a more reasonable stimate of the relative probabilities of the 
various potential functions of such forms. 1 
2. Estimating the Lexical Priors for Rare Forms 
For a common form such as lopen 'walk' a reasonable stimate of the lexical prior 
probabilities i  the MLE, computed over all occurrences of this form. So, in the UdB 
corpus, lopen occurs 92 times as an infinitive and 43 times as a finite plural, so the MLE 
1 Even models of disambiguation that make use of context, such as statistical n-gram taggers, often 
presume some estimate of lexical priors, in addition to requiring estimates of the transition 
probabilities of sequences of lexical tags (Church 1988; DeRose 1988; Kupiec 1992), and this again 
brings up the question of what to do about unseen or low-frequency forms. In working taggers, a
common approach is simply to apply a uniform small probability to the various senses of unseen or 
low-frequency forms: this was done in the tagger discussed in Church (1988), for example.

log frequency class 
Relative frequency of Dutch infinitives versus finite plurals in the Uit den Boogaart corpus, as 
a function of the (natural) log of the frequency of the word forms. The horizontal solid line 
represents he overall MLE, the relative frequency of the infinitive as computed over all 
tokens; the horizontal dashed line represents he relative frequency of the infinitive among the 
hapax legomena. The solid curve represents a locally weighted regression smoothing 
(Cleveland 1979). 
estimate of the probability of the infinitive is 0.68. For low-frequency forms such as 
aanlokken or bedraden, one might consider basing the MLE on the aggregate counts of all 
ambiguous forms in the corpus. In the UdB corpus, there are 21,703 infinitive tokens, 
and 9,922 finite plural tokens, so the MLE for aanlokken being an infinitive would be 
0.69. Note, however, that the application of this overall MLE presupposes that the 
relative frequencies of the various functions of a particular form are independent of
the frequency of the form itself. For the Dutch example at hand, this presupposition 
predicts that if we were to classify -en forms according to their frequency, and then for 
each frequency class thus defined, plot the relative frequency of infinitives and finite 
plurals, the regression line should have a slope of approximately zero. 
2.1 Dutch Verb Forms in -en 
Figure 1 shows that this prediction is not borne out. This scatterplot shows the relative 
frequency of the infinitive versus the finite plural, as a function of the log-frequency 
of the -en form. At the left-hand edge of the graph, the relative frequency of the in- 
finitives for the hapax legomena is shown. This proportion is also highlighted by the 
dashed horizontal line. As we proceed to the right, we observe that there is a general 
downward curvature representing a lowering of the proportion of infinitives for the 
157

higher-frequency words. This trend is captured by the solid nonparametric regression 
line; an explanation for this trend will be forthcoming in Section 3. (It will be noted that 
in Figure 1 the variance is fairly small for the lower-frequency ranges, higher for the 
middle ranges, and then small again for the high-frequency ranges; anticipating some- 
what, we note the same trends in Figures 2 and 3. This variance pattern follows from 
the high variability in the absolute numbers of types realized, especially in the middle 
log-frequency classes, in combination with the assumption that for any log-frequency 
class, the proportion for that class is itself a random variable.) The solid horizontal line 
represents the proportion of infinitives calculated over all frequency classes, and the 
dashed horizontal line represents the proportion of infinitives calculated over just the 
hapax legomena. The two horizontal lines can be interpreted as MLEs for the proba- 
bility of an -en form being an infinitive: the solid line or overall MLE clearly provides 
an estimate based on the whole population, whereas the dashed line or hapax-based 
MLE provides an estimate for the hapaxes. The overall MLE computes a lower rel- 
ative frequency for the infinitives, compared to the hapax-based MLE. The question, 
then, is: Which of these MLEs provides a better estimate for low-frequency t pes? In 
particular, for types that have not been seen in the training corpus, and for which we 
therefore have no direct estimate of the word-specific prior probabilities, we would 
like to know whether the hapax-based or overall MLE provides a better estimate. 
To answer this question we compared the accuracy of the overall and hapax-based 
MLEs using tenfold cross-validation. We first randomized the list of -en tokens from 
the UdB corpus, then divided the randomized list into ten equal-sized parts. Each of 
the ten parts was held out as the test set, and the remaining nine-tenths was used as 
the training set over which the two MLE estimates were computed. The results are 
shown in Table 1. In this table, No(inf) and No(pl) represent the observed number of 
tokens of infinitives and plurals in the held-out portion of the data, representing types 
that had not been seen in the training data. The final four rows compare the estimates 
for these numbers of tokens given the overall MLE (EoINo(infl\] and Eo\[No(pl)\]), versus 
the hapax-based MLE (Eh\[No(inf)\] and Eh\[No(pl)\]). For all ten runs, the hapax-based 
MLE is clearly a far better predictor than the overall MLE. 2 
2.2 English Verb Forms in -ed 
The pattern that we have observed for the Dutch infinitive-plural ambiguity can be 
replicated for other cases of morphological ambiguity. Consider the case of English 
verbs ending in -ed, which are systematically ambiguous between being simple past 
tenses and past participles. The upper panel of Figure 2 shows the distribution of 
the relative frequencies of the two functions, plotted against the natural log of the 
frequency for the Brown corpus (Francis and Kucera 1982). (All lines, including the 
nonparametric regression line are interpretable as in Figure 1.) Results of a tenfold 
cross-validation are shown in Table 2. Clearly, in this case the magnitude of the dif- 
ference between the overall MLE and the hapax-based MLE is smaller than in the 
previous example: indeed in cross validations 6, 8, and 9, the overall MLE is superior. 
Nonetheless, the hapax-based MLE remains a significantly better predictor overall. 3
2 A paired t-test on the ratios No(inf)/No(pl) versus Eo\[No(inf)\]/Eo\[No(pl)\] reveals a highly significant 
difference (t9 = 13.4, p < 0.001 ); conversely a comparison of No (inf)/No (pl) and E h \[No (inf)\]/Eh \[No (pl)\] 
reveals no difference (t9 = 0.96,p > 0.10). 
3 A paired t-test on the ratios No(vbn)/No(vbd) versus Eo\[No(vbn)\]/Eo\[No(vbd)\] reveals a significant 
difference (t9 -~ 2.47,p < 0.05); conversely a comparison of No(vbn)/No(vbd ) and 
Eh\[No(vbn)\]/E h\[No (vbd)\] reveals no difference (t 9 = 0.48, p > 0.10).

2.3 Dutch Words in -en:  A More General Problem 
In the two examples we have just considered, the hapax-based MLE, while being a 
better predictor of the a priori lexical probability for unseen cases than the overall 
MLE, does not actually yield a different prediction as to which function of a form is 
more likely. This does not hold generally, however, and the bottom panel of Figure 2 
presents a case where the hapax-based MLE does yield a different prediction as to 
which function is more likely. In this plot we consider Dutch word forms from the 
UdB corpus ending in -en. As we have seen, Dutch -en is used as a verb marker: it 
marks the infinitive, present plural, and for strong verbs, also the past plural; it is 
also used as a marker of noun plurals. The case of noun plurals is somewhat different 
from the preceding two cases since it is not, strictly speaking, a case of morphological 
syncretism. However, it is a potential source of ambiguity in text analysis, since a low 
frequency form in -en, where one may not have seen the stem of the word, could 
potentially be either a noun or a verb. Also, systematic ambiguity exists among cases 
of noun-verb conversion: for examplefluiten is either a noun meaning 'flutes' or a verb 
meaning 'to play the flute'; spelden means either 'pins' or 'to pin'; and ploegen means 
either 'ploughs' or 'to plough'. Results for a tenfold cross-validation for these data are 
shown in Table 3. 4 Lrl this case, the overall MLE would lead one to predict that for 
an unseen form in -en, the verbal function would be more likely. Contrariwise, the 
hapax-based MLE predicts that the nominal function would be more likely. Again, it 
is the hapax-based MLE that proves to be superior. 
4 A paired t-test on the ratios No(v)/No(n) versus Eo\[No(v)\]/Eo\[No(n)\] reveals ahighly significant 
difference (t9 = 95.95,p <~ 0.001); conversely a comparison ofNo(v)/No(n) and Eh\[No(v)\]/Eh\[No(n)\] 
reveals no difference (t 9 = 0.12,p > 0.10).

2.4 Disyl labic Dutch Words Ending in -er 
One final example--also not a case of syncretism--concerns the ambiguity of the 
sequence -er in Dutch, which occurs word-finally in monomorphemic nouns (moeder, 
'mother'),  adjectives (donker, 'dark'), and proper names (Pieter, 'Peter'), but which 
is also used as a suffix to form comparatives ( neller, 'faster') and "agentive" nouns 
(schrijver, 'writer'). Since monomorphemic nouns and adjectives in this class are mostly 
disyllabic, we will restrict our attention to the disyllabic instances of words ending 
in -er. Again we find that the hapax-based MLE is superior to the overall MLE for 
predicting to which of these five categories an unseen disyllabic word belongs. 
Table 4 lists the overall MLE, the hapax-based MLE and the statistics on which 
these estimates are based; Figure 3 plots the corresponding proportions as a function of 
log-frequency. Table 4 also lists the results of tenfold cross-validation by specifying, for 
each category, its contribution to the X2-statistic summing Over the ten cross-validation 
runs. (A more condensed format was chosen for this table than for the previous tables, 
since here we are dealing with a fivefold ambiguity; the previous format would have 
resulted in a rather large table in the present case.) Clearly, predictions based on the

hapax-based MLE are superior to those based on the overall MLE (X~36) = 462.97, p < 
.001 for the overall MLE, X 2 = 33.50, p > .5 for the hapax-based MLE). In particular, (36) 
proper names in -e r  have a much higher probability of occurrence than the overall 
MLE would suggest. Of course, in orthography-based applications, one can rely to 
some extent on capitalization to indicate proper names, so one might want to eliminate 
those from consideration here on this basis. Removing the category of proper names 
from the analysis, a cross-validation test again reveals significantly better predictions 
for the hapax-based MLE (X~27) = 43.61, p = .023) than for the overall MLE (X~27) = 
120.03,p < .001). 
2.5 Summary 
We have demonstrated with four separate xamples that the hapax-based MLE is su- 
perior to the overall MLE in predicting the proportions, among unseen forms, of the 
various functions of morphologically ambiguous categories. Could an even better es- 
timator be obtained by taking not only the proport ion for the hapax legomena into 
account but also the proportions for other low-log-frequency lasses? To answer this 
question, note that the scatterplot in the bottom panel of Figure 2 reveals a down- 
ward curvature at the very left-hand side: even for the lowest-log-frequency classes, 
the likelihood of a word being a verb decreases with decreasing log-frequency. This 
suggests that for this particular example the hapax legomena lone should be used to 
estimate the probability that an unseen word is a noun or verb, rather than the hapax 
legomena in combination with other low-frequency classes (the words occurring twice, 
three times, etc.). Interestingly, the top panel of Figure 2 does not reveal even a hint of 
a trend among the lowest-log-frequency classes, and in Figure 1 the observed propor- 
tions for log-frequency less than 2 also do not reveal a clear pattern. For Figure 3, clear 
trends for the lower-log-frequency lasses seem to obtain in all cases except he plot 
showing the proportion of simplex adjectives. Taken jointly, these observations suggest 
informally that an MLE based on the hapax legomena will never be inferior to MLEs 
that take additional log-frequency classes at the lower end of the log-frequency range 
into account. At the same time, the example of Dutch verb and noun forms in -en  
suggests that the hapax-based MLE can be superior to such MLEs-- in this particular 
case, inclusion of these lower-frequency lasses would bring the adjusted MLE more 
in line with the overall MLE, resulting in a loss of accuracy. These considerations lead 
us to conclude that the hapax-based MLE is to be preferred to an adjusted MLE that 
includes other low-log-frequency lasses.

As we have seen in the four examples discussed above, the MLE computed over hapax 
legomena yields a better prediction of lexical prior probabilities for unseen cases than 
does an MLE computed over the entire training corpus. We now have to consider 
why this result holds. As we shall see, the reasons are different from case to case, but 
nonetheless share a commonality: in all four cases, idiosyncratic lexical properties of 
high-frequency words dominate the statistical properties of the high-frequency ranges, 
thus making the overall MLE a less reliable predictor of the properties of the low- 
frequency and unseen cases. 
First let us discuss the final case, that of -er ambiguity in Dutch, beginning with the 
derived and underived nouns. The hapax-based MLE estimate for derived nouns in 
-er is somewhat higher than the overall MLE; for underived nouns, the hapax-based 
MLE is significantly lower - -  half - -  of the overall MLE. This can be explained by 
the observation that a good many of the underived nouns in -er are high-frequency 
words such as moeder 'mother'  and vader 'father'. Such words contribute to the overall 
proportional mass of the underived nouns, thus boosting the estimate of the overall 
MLE for this class. A similar argument holds for the derived and underived adjectives. 
Turning to proper names, we see that the hapax-based MLE is much larger than the 
overall MLE. Proper names differ from ordinary words in that there are relatively few 
163 
Computational Linguistics Volume 22, Number 2 
proper names that are highly frequent, in comparison with words in general, but there 
are large numbers of types of names that occur rarely. Thus, we expect an imbalance 
of the kind we observe. 
Consider next the ambiguity in Dutch between -en verb forms and -en plural 
nouns. Ceteris paribus, plural nouns are less frequent han singular nouns; on the 
other hand, -en for verbs serves both the function of marking plurality and of marking 
the infinitive. High-frequency verbs include some very common word forms, such as 
the auxiliaries hebben 'have', zullen 'will', kunnen 'can', and moeten 'must'. Thus, for the 
high-frequency ranges, the data is weighted heavily towards verbs. On the other hand, 
while both nouns and verbs are open classes, nouns are far more productive as a class 
than are verbs (Baayen and Lieber 1991), and this pattern becomes predominant in the 
low-frequency ranges: among low-frequency t pes, most tokens are nouns. Hence, for 
the low-frequency ranges, the data is weighted towards nouns. These two opposing 
forces conspire to yield a downward trend in the percentage of verbs as we proceed 
from the high- to the low-frequency ranges. 
Next, consider the English past tense versus past participle ambiguity. One of the 
important functions of the past participle form is as an adjectival modifier or predicate; 
for example, the parked car. In this function the past participle has a passive meaning 
with transitive verbs, and a perfective meaning with unaccusative intransitive verbs; 
see Levin (1993, 86-88) for details. For reasons that are not clear to us, a predomi- 
nant number of the high-frequency verbs cannot felicitously be used as prenominal 
adjectives. These verbs include unergative intransitives like walk, for which one would 
not expect o find the adjectival usage, given the above characterization; but they also 
include clear transitives like move, try, and ask, and unaccusative intransitives like ap- 
pear, which are not generally felicitous in this usage. Consider: ?a moved car, ?a tried 
approach, ?an asked question, ?an appeared ad; but contrast: an oft-tried approach, afrequently 
asked question, a recently appeared ad, where an adverbial modifier enders the examples 
felicitous. 5 Among the low-frequency verbs, including accentuate, bottle and incense, the 
predominate types are those in which the past participle usage is preferred. What is 
clear from the plot in the top panel of Figure 2 is that the downward trend in the 
regression curve to the right of the plot is due to the lexical properties of a relatively 
small number of high-frequency verbs. For the greater part of the frequency range, 
there is a relatively stable proportion of participles to finite past forms. Thus, the 
hapax-based MLE yields an estimate that is uncontaminated by the lexical properties 
of individual high-frequency forms. 
Finally, consider the Dutch verb forms -en that we started with. In Figure 1 the 
strong downward trend in the regression curve at the right of the figure is due in 
large measure to the inclusion of high-frequency auxiliary verbs, examples of which 
have already been given. These verbs, while possible in the infinitival form, occur 
predominantly in the finite form. Hence, a form such as hebben 'have' is much more 
likely to be a plural finite form than it is to be an infinitive. At the low end of the 
frequency spectrum, we find a great many verbs derived with separable particles, 
such as afzeggen 'cancel'; note that separable prefixation is the most productive verb- 
forming process in Dutch. In the infinitival form, the particle is always attached to 
5 One reviewer has suggested that the infelicity of many adjectival passives relates to the fact hat the 
action denoted by the base verb is not regarded as producing an enduring result hat affects the object 
denoted by the (deep) internal argument: contrast a broken vase, where the vase is enduringly affected 
by the breaking, with ?a seen movie, where the movie is not affected. However, this cannot be the whole 
story since the object denoted by the internal argument ofkill is presumably enduringly affected by the 
killing, yet ?a killed man seems about as odd as ?a seen movie.

Baayen and Sproat Lexical Priors for Low-Frequency Forms 
the verb. However, in the finite forms in main clauses, the particle must be separated: 
for example, wij zeggen onze afspraak af 'we are cancelling our appointment'. These 
properties of Dutch separable verbs boost the likelihood of infinitival forms for the 
low-frequency ranges, but they also boost the likelihood of (higher-frequency) finite 
plural forms such as zeggen: since the separated finite plural form zeggen is identical 
to the finite plural of the underived verb zeggen 'say', any separated finite forms will 
accrue to the frequency of the generally much more common derivational base. 
What all of these cases share is that the statistical properties of the high-frequency 
ranges are dominated by lexical properties of particular sets of high-frequency words. 
This in turn biases the overall MLE and makes it a poor predictor of novel cases. 
For example, auxiliaries uch as hebben 'have' are among the most common verbs in 
Dutch, but they have rather different syntactic, and hence morphological, properties 
from other verbs; these properties in turn contaminate the high-frequency ranges and 
thus the overall MLE. In contrast, words in the low-frequency ranges, and particu- 
larly hapaxes, are heavily populated with (necessarily non-idiosyncratic) neologisms 
derived via productive morphological processes (Baayen 1989; Baayen and Renouf 
1996). Any lexical biases that are inherent in these morphological processes - -  for 
example, the fact that a low frequency Dutch word ending in -en is more likely to 
be a noun than a verb - -  are well-estimated by the hapaxes. Now, for a sufficiently 
large training corpus, we can be very confident hat an unseen complex word is non- 
idiosyncratic and formed via a productive morphological process, and this confidence 
increases as the corpus size increases (Baayen and Renouf 1996). Since the hapaxes of a 
particular morphological process mostly consist of non-idiosyncratic formations from 
that process, it makes sense that the distribution of a property among the hapaxes is 
the least contaminated estimate available for the distribution of that property among 
the unseen cases. 
The hapax-based MLE that we have proposed is not only observationally prefer- 
able to the overall MLE, it is also firmly grounded in probability theory. The probability 
of encountering an unseen word given that this word is a word in -en is estimated by: 
N1,N(-en) 
Pr(unseen\[-en) ~ N(_en) , (1) 
where N1,N(-en) denotes the number of hapax legomena in -en among the N(-en) tokens 
in -en in the training sample; see Baayen (1989), Baayen and Lieber (1991), Good (1953), 
and Church and Gale (1991). Of course, this estimate is heavily influenced by the 
highest-frequency words in -en, as these words contribute many tokens to N(-en). In our 
example, high-frequency auxiliaries uch as hebben cause the probability of sampling 
unseen types in -en to be low - -  newly sampled tokens have a high probability of 
being an auxiliary rather than some previously unseen word. Interestingly, (1) can be 
used to derive an expression for the conditional probability that a word is, say, a noun, 
given that it is an unseen type in -en (Baayen 1993): 
Pr(noun A unseen -en type) (2) 
Pr(noun \[ unseen -en type) = Pr(unseen-en type) 
NLN(-en , noun) 
N(-en) 
Nl,t~(-en ) 
N(-en) 
N1,N(-en, noun) 
N1,N(-en) 
Note that the estimator exemplified in (1) has been applied twice: once (in the de- 
165 
Computational Linguistics Volume 22, Number 2 
nominator) to the distribution of all -en words; and once (in the numerator) to the 
distribution of the -en nouns - -  after reclassifying all verbal tokens in -en as represent- 
ing one (very high-frequency) noun type in the frequency distribution. Similarly, the 
probability that an unseen word in -en is a verb is given by 
N1,N(-en, verb) 
Pr(verb I unseen -en type) ~ N1,N(-en) (3) 
Thus the proportion of verbal hapaxes in -en that we have suggested as an adjusted 
MLE estimator on the basis of the curve shown in Figure 2 is in fact an estimate of the 
conditional probability that a word is a verb, given that it is an unseen type in -en. 
The results of the analyses presented in this paper are of potential importance 
in various applications that require lexical disambiguation and where an estimate 
of lexical priors is required. For high-frequency words, one can obtain fairly reliable 
estimates of the lexical priors by tagging a corpus that gives a good coverage to words 
of various ranges. For predicting the lexical priors for the much larger mass of very 
low-frequency t pes, most of which would not occur in any such corpus, the results we 
have presented suggest hat one should concentrate on tagging a good representative 
sample of the hapaxes, rather than extensively tagging words of all frequency ranges.
