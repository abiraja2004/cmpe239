Abstract
With more than 10,000 new videos posted
online every day on social websites such as
YouTube and Facebook, the internet is be-
coming an almost infinite source of informa-
tion. One important challenge for the com-
ing decade is to be able to harvest relevant
information from this constant flow of mul-
timodal data. In this talk, I will introduce
the task of multimodal sentiment analysis, and
present a method that integrates linguistic, au-
dio, and visual features for the purpose of
identifying sentiment in online videos. I will
first describe a novel dataset consisting of
videos collected from the social media web-
site YouTube, which were annotated for senti-
ment polarity. I will then show, through com-
parative experiments, that the joint use of vi-
sual, audio, and textual features greatly im-
proves over the use of only one modality at
a time. Finally, by running evaluations on
datasets in English and Spanish, I will show
that the method is portable and works equally
well when applied to different languages.
This is joint work with Veronica Perez-Rosas
and Louis-Philippe Morency.
