Abstract
We introduce LABR, the largest sentiment
analysis dataset to-date for the Arabic lan-
guage. It consists of over 63,000 book
reviews, each rated on a scale of 1 to 5
stars. We investigate the properties of the
the dataset, and present its statistics. We
explore using the dataset for two tasks:
sentiment polarity classification and rat-
ing classification. We provide standard
splits of the dataset into training and test-
ing, for both polarity and rating classifica-
tion, in both balanced and unbalanced set-
tings. We run baseline experiments on the
dataset to establish a benchmark.
1 Introduction
The internet is full of platforms where users can
express their opinions about different subjects,
from movies and commercial products to books
and restaurants. With the explosion of social me-
dia, this has become easier and more prevalent
than ever. Mining these troves of unstructured text
has become a very active area of research with
lots of applications. Sentiment Classification is
among the most studied tasks for processing opin-
ions (Pang and Lee, 2008; Liu, 2010). In its ba-
sic form, it involves classifying a piece of opinion,
e.g. a movie or book review, into either having a
positive or negative sentiment. Another form in-
volves predicting the actual rating of a review, e.g.
predicting the number of stars on a scale from 1 to
5 stars.
Most of the current research has focused on
building sentiment analysis applications for the
English language (Pang and Lee, 2008; Liu, 2010;
Korayem et al, 2012), with much less work on
other languages. In particular, there has been
little work on sentiment analysis in Arabic (Ab-
basi et al, 2008; Abdul-Mageed et al, 2011;
Abdul-Mageed et al, 2012; Abdul-Mageed and
Diab, 2012b; Korayem et al, 2012), and very
few, considerably small-sized, datasets to work
with (Rushdi-Saleh et al, 2011b; Rushdi-Saleh et
al., 2011a; Abdul-Mageed and Diab, 2012a; Elar-
naoty et al, 2012). In this work, we try to address
the lack of large-scale Arabic sentiment analysis
datasets in this field, in the hope of sparking more
interest in research in Arabic sentiment analysis
and related tasks. Towards this end, we intro-
duce LABR, the Large-scale Arabic Book Review
dataset. It is a set of over 63K book reviews, each
with a rating of 1 to 5 stars.
We make the following contributions: (1)
We present the largest Arabic sentiment analy-
sis dataset to-date (up to our knowledge); (2)
We provide standard splits for the dataset into
training and testing sets. This will make
comparing different results much easier. The
dataset and the splits are publicly available at
www.mohamedaly.info/datasets; (3) We explore
the structure and properties of the dataset, and per-
form baseline experiments for two tasks: senti-
ment polarity classification and rating classifica-
tion.
2 Related Work
A few Arabic sentiment analysis datasets have
been collected in the past couple of years, we men-
tion the relevant two sets:
OCA Opinion Corpus for Arabic (Rushdi-Saleh
et al, 2011b) contains 500 movie reviews in Ara-
bic, collected from forums and websites. It is di-
vided into 250 positive and 250 negative reviews,
although the division is not standard in that there is
no rating for neutral reviews i.e. for 10-star rating
systems, ratings above and including 5 are con-
sidered positive and those below 5 are considered
negative.

2855 sentences of news wire stories, 5342 sen-
tences from Wikipedia talk pages, and 2532
threaded conversations from web forums.
3 Dataset Collection
We downloaded over 220,000 reviews from the
book readers social network www.goodreads.com
during the month of March 2013. These reviews
were from the first 2143 books in the list of Best
Arabic Books. After harvesting the reviews, we
found out that over 70% of them were not in Ara-
bic, either because some non-Arabic books exist in
the list, or because of existing translations of some
of the books in other languages. After filtering out
the non-Arabic reviews, and performing several
pre-processing steps to clean up HTML tags and
other unwanted content, we ended up with 63,257
Arabic reviews.
4 Dataset Properties
The dataset contains 63,257 reviews that were sub-
mitted by 16,486 users for 2,131 different books.

Table 2: Training and Test sets. B stands for bal-
anced, and U stands for Unbalanced.
Table 1 contains some important facts about the
dataset and Fig. 1 shows the number of reviews
for each rating. We consider as positive reviews
those with ratings 4 or 5, and negative reviews
those with ratings 1 or 2. Reviews with rating 3
are considered neutral and not included in the po-
larity classification. The number of positive re-
views is much larger than that of negative reviews.
We believe this is because the books we got re-
views for were the most popular books, and the
top rated ones had many more reviews than the the
least popular books.
The average user provided 3.84 reviews with the
median being 2. The average book got almost 30
reviews with the median being 6. Fig. 2 shows
the number of reviews per user and book. As
shown in the Fig. 2c, most books and users have
few reviews, and vice versa. Figures 2a-b show
a box plot of the number of reviews per user and
book. We notice that books (and users) tend to
have (give) positive reviews than negative reviews,
where the median number of positive reviews per
book is 5 while that for negative reviews is only 2
(and similarly for reviews per user).
Fig. 3 shows the statistics of tokens and sen-
tences. The reviews were tokenized and ?rough?
sentence counts were computed (by looking for
punctuation characters). The average number of
tokens per review is 65.4, the average number of
sentences per review is 5.4, and the average num-
ber of tokens per sentence is 12. Figures 3a-b
show that the distribution is similar for positive
and negative reviews. Fig. 3c shows a plot of the
frequency of the tokens in the vocabulary in a log-
log scale, which conforms to Zipf?s law (Manning
and Sch?tze, 2000).
5 Experiments
We explored using the dataset for two tasks: (a)
Sentiment polarity classification: where the goal
is to predict if the review is positive i.e. with rating
4 or 5, or is negative i.e. with rating 1 or 2; and (b)

Rating classification: where the goal is to predict
the rating of the review on a scale of 1 to 5.
To this end, we divided the dataset into separate
training and test sets, with a ratio of 8:2. We do
this because we already have enough training data,
so there is no need to resort to cross-validation
(Pang et al, 2002). To avoid the bias of having
more positive than negative reviews, we explored
two settings: (a) a balanced split where the num-
ber of reviews from every class is the same, and
is taken to be the size of the smallest class (where
larger classes are down-sampled); (b) an unbal-
anced split where the number of reviews from ev-
ery class is unrestricted, and follows the distribu-
tion shown in Fig. 1. Table 2 shows the number of
reviews in the training and test sets for each of the
two tasks for the balanced and unbalanced splits,
while Fig. 4 shows the breakdown of these num-
bers per class.
Tables 3-4 show results of the experiments for
both tasks in both balanced/unbalanced settings.
We tried different features: unigrams, bigrams,
and trigrams with/without tf-idf weighting. For
classifiers, we used Multinomial Naive Bayes,
Bernoulli Naive Bayes (for binary counts), and
Support Vector Machines. We report two mea-
sures: the total classification accuracy (percentage
of correctly classified test examples) and weighted
F1 measure (Manning and Sch?tze, 2000). All
experiments were implemented in Python using
scikit-learn (Pedregosa et al, 2011) and Qalsadi
(available at pypi.python.org/pypi/qalsadi).
We notice that: (a) The total accuracy and
weighted F1 are quite correlated and go hand-in-
hand. (b) Task 1 is much easier than task 2, which
is expected. (c) The unbalanced setting seems eas-

the unbalanced sets contain more training exam-
ples to make use of. (d) SVM does much better
in the unbalanced setting, while MNB is slightly
better than SVM in the balanced setting. (e) Using
more ngrams helps, and especially combined with
tf-idf weighting, as all the best scores are with tf-
idf.
6 Conclusion and Future Work
In this work we presented the largest Arabic sen-
timent analysis dataset to-date. We explored its
properties and statistics, provided standard splits,
and performed several baseline experiments to es-
tablish a benchmark. Although we used very sim-
ple features and classifiers, task 1 achieved quite
good results (~90% accuracy) but there is much
room for improvement in task 2 (~50% accuracy).
We plan next to work more on the dataset to
get sentence-level polarity labels, and to extract
Arabic sentiment lexicon and explore its poten-
tial. Furthermore, we also plan to explore using
Arabic-specific and more powerful features.
