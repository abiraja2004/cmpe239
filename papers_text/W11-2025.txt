Abstract 
Instructional efficacy of automated Con-
versational Agents designed to help small 
groups of students achieve higher learning 
outcomes can be improved by the use of 
social interaction strategies. These strate-
gies help the tutor agent manage the atten-
tion of the students while delivering useful 
instructional content. Two technical chal-
lenges involving the use of social interac-
tion strategies include determining the 
appropriate policy for triggering these 
strategies and regulating the amount of so-
cial behavior performed by the tutor. In this 
paper, a comparison of six different trigger-
ing policies is presented. We find that a 
triggering policy learnt from human beha-
vior in combination with a filter that keeps 
the amount of social behavior comparable 
to that performed by human tutors offers 
the most effective solution to the these 
challenges. 
1 Introduction 
While Conversational Agents have been shown to 
be an effective technology for delivering instruc-
tional content to students in a variety of learning 
domains and situations (Grasser et. al., 2005; Ku-
mar et. al., 2007; Arnott et. al., 2008), it has been 
observed that students are more likely to ignore 
and abuse the tutor in a collaborative learning set-
ting (with 2 or more students) compared to the case 
of one-on-one tutoring (Bhatt et. al., 2004; Kumar 
et. al., 2007). In our prior work (Kumar et. al., 
2010a), we have addressed this problem by em-
ploying agents that are capable of performing both 
instructional behavior as well as social behavior. In 
our initial implementation, the social behavior per-
formed by these agents was composed of eleven 
social interaction strategies that were triggered by 
a set of hand crafted rules (Kumar and Ros?, 
2010b). Section 2 provides additional details about 
these strategies. 
Comparison between the social behavior trig-
gered by our hand crafted rules and that triggered 
by a human tutor revealed significant perception 
benefits (more likeable, higher task satisfaction, 
etc.) for the human triggering policy. Also, the stu-
dents in a wizard-of-oz condition who interacted 
with the tutors whose social behaviors were trig-
gered by humans had better learning outcomes 
(0.93?) with respect to a No social behavior base-
line. The condition where students interacted with 
the rule-based automated tutors was also signifi-
cantly better (0.71?) than the No social behavior 
baseline in terms of learning outcomes. While the 
learning outcomes of the rule-based tutors was not 
significantly worse than the human tutor, in com-
bination with the perception outcomes, we see the 
potential for further improvement of conversation-
al agents by employing a better triggering policy. 
Building on these prior results, in this paper we 
explore a way to improve the effectiveness of so-
cially capable tutor agents that uses a triggering 
policy learnt from a corpus of human behavior. 
The underlying hypothesis of this approach is that 
a human-like triggering policy would lead to im-
provements in the agent?s performance and percep-
227
tion ratings compared to a rule-based triggering 
policy. As a first step towards verifying this hypo-
thesis, we learnt a collection of triggering policies 
from a corpus of human behavior. While the focus 
of this paper is to evaluate the most human-like 
triggering policy learnt from data in terms of its 
perception benefits and learning outcomes, Section 
4 summarizes our efforts on learning triggering 
policies. 
Before we discuss the details of the evaluation 
we conducted, Section 3 presents an analysis of 
mediating factors that provides insights into the 
reasons behind the effectiveness of social behavior. 
The design and procedure of the user study we 
conducted to evaluate the learnt triggering policies 
is described in Section 5. Finally, Section 6 dis-
cusses the results of this evaluation. 
2 Social Interaction Strategies 
In our prior work (Kumar et. al., 2010; Ai et. al., 
2010; Kumar et. al., 2011), we have developed and 
evaluated automated tutors for two different educa-
tional domains equipped with eleven social interac-
tion strategies. These strategies, listed in Table 1, 
correspond to three positive socio-emotional inte-
raction categories identified by Bales (1950): 
Showing Solidarity, Showing Tension Release and 
Agreeing. 
Appendix A shows excerpts of an interaction 
between three students and a tutor during a college 
freshmen mechanical engineering learning activity.  
The shaded turns demonstrate realizations of some 
of the eleven social interaction strategies. 
Turns 7-12 shows the tutor initiating and partic-
ipating in group formation using Strategy 1a (Do 
Introductions) by greeting the students and asking 
for their names. In turn 53, the tutor is employing 
Strategy 3b (Show Comprehension / Approval) in 
response to a student opinion expressed in turn 52. 
When one of the students becomes inactive in the 
interaction, the tutor uses strategy 1e (Encourage) 
realized as a targeted prompt shown in turn 122 to 
elicit a response from the inactive student. Turn 
148 demonstrates Strategy 1d (Complement / 
Praise) to appreciate student participation in a con-
ceptual tutoring episode that concluded at turn 147. 
Finally, turn 152 shows a realization of Strategy 2c 
(Express Enthusiasm, Elation, Satisfaction) which 
is tied to either the start or the end of lengthy prob-
lem solving steps in the learning activity such as 
calculating the outcome of certain design choices 
made by the students during the learning activity.

social-emotional interaction categories 
3 Effect of Social Behaviors 
We have observed the the use of social behavior in 
collaborative learning settings can help in improv-
ing learning outcomes (Kumar et. al., 2010a). This 
observation is not necessarily consistent with intui-
tion. On the one hand, we could attribute this to the 
ability to manage the user?s (student) attention to-
wards the agent (tutor) by displaying the social 
behavior. At the same time, we could argue against 
the use of social behavior by considering it as a 
potential distraction from the task. In an earlier 
experiment (Kumar et. al., 2010c), we found that it 
is important to keep the amount of social behavior 
at an optimal level in order to observe the learning 
228
benefits of the social behavior and to avoid its dis-
traction costs.

Table 2. Excerpt of a Conceptual Tutoring Episode 
 
In this section, we present a corpus analysis to 
discover an underlying model of how the social 
behavior affects learning outcomes. We used a 
corpus of collaborative learning interactions be-
tween teams of three or more students and a tutor. 
The interactions involve the teams performing a 
learning activity which lasts approximately 40 mi-
nutes. During this time, the tutors provide direc-
tions, hints and conceptual tutoring. Each team 
undergoes up to four conceptual tutoring episodes. 
An episode is a system-initiated conversation dur-
ing which the tutor leads the students through a 
directed line of reasoning to help them reflect upon 
a concept related to the learning activity. An ex-
cerpt of a tutoring episode discussing the relation-
ship between stress and safety is shown in Table 2. 
3.1 Coding Tutoring Episodes 
Each turn in all the tutoring episodes of the 32 inte-
ractions between a team of students and an auto-
mated tutor were annotated using a coding scheme 
described here. The tutor turns were categorized as 
either Respondable (TR) if the students were ex-
pected to the respond to that tutor turn or Not Res-
pondable (TU) otherwise. In Table 2, all the 
shaded turns are labeled as Respondable. 
 
 
Figure 1. Venn Diagram of Episode Turn Annotations 
 
Student Turns are categorized into one of three 
categories. Good turns (SG) identifies turns where 
the students are showing attention to a respondable 
tutor turn (e.g. Turn 2 & 3 in Table 2) or the stu-
dents are giving a correct or an incorrect response 
to a direct question by the tutor (e.g. Turns 5, 6, 7, 
12, 13 & 16). Counterproductive (Bad) student 
turns (SB) include students abusing the tutor or 
ignoring the tutor (e.g. talking to another student 
when the students are expected to respond to a tu-
tor turn). Student turns that are not categorized as 
Good or Bad are labeled as Other (SO). Turn 10 is 
an example of SO because it is a response to a tu-
tor turn (9) where no student response is expected. 
Figure 1 shows a Venn diagram of the different 
annotations. All five categories are mutually exclu-
sive. 
3.2 Structural Equation Modeling 
In order to discover an underlying model of how 
the use of social behavior affects student learning, 
we used a structural equation modeling (SEM) 
technique (Scheines et. al., 1994). 
Data: To measure learning outcomes, our data 
comprised of scores from pre-test and post-test 
administered to 88 students who were part of the 
32 teams whose data was annotated for this analy-
sis. We normalized the number of Good (SG) and 
Bad (SB) student turns by the number of Respond-
able (TR) tutor turns and included normalized SG 
(nSG) and normalized SB (nSB) as measures of 
interaction characteristics of each student in our 
dataset. Total number of social turns performed by 
the tutor in each interaction was included as a cha-
racteristic of social behavior displayed by the tutor. 
Finally, the total amount of time (in seconds) that 
229
the students spent on the tutoring episodes was 
included as a characteristic of the interaction quali-
ty during the tutoring episodes. 
Prior Knowledge: The only prior knowledge 
input to the model stated that the pre-test occurs 
before the post-test. 
Discovered Models: We used Tetrad IV to dis-
cover a structural equation model in the data com-
prising of 6 fields (PreTest, PostTest, nSG, nSB, 
SocialTurns, EpisodeDuration) for each of the 88 
students. Figure 2 shows the structural equation 
model discovered by Tetrad using the dataset de-
scribed above. p-Value of 0.46 for this model con-
firms the hypothesis used by Tetrad for its 
statistical analysis i.e. the model was not discov-
ered randomly. Note that unlike other statistical 
tests, SEM models built using Tetrad are evaluated 
as significant if the p-Value is greater than 0.05. 
The numbers on the arrows are correlation coeffi-
cients and the numbers on the boxes indicate mean 
values for each variable. 
 
 
 
Figure 2. SEM discovered using all 6 variables in our 
dataset 
 
Besides the obvious causal effect of PreTest 
score on PostTest score, we find that as the dura-
tion of the tutoring episodes (EpisodeDuration) 
increases, the learning outcomes deteriorate. We 
notice that an increase in the normalized number of 
Bad student turns increases EpisodeDuration indi-
cating that students who abuse or ignore the tutor 
are likely to not pay attention to the learning con-
tent presented during the tutoring episodes, hence 
prolonging the tutoring episode as the tutor tries to 
get the students through the instructional content. 
Furthermore, we observe that social behavior helps 
in counteracting the negative learning effect of Bad 
interaction behaviors of the students. Tutors that 
perform social behavior are capable of managing 
the student?s attention and get the students through 
the tutoring episode faster. 
3.3 Discussion 
The SEM analysis discussed in the previous sec-
tion helps us better understand the relationship be-
tween the use of social behavior and student 
learning in a collaborative learning setting. Let?s 
consider the duration of the tutoring episodes as an 
indicator of the students? attention to the tutor 
(higher duration lower attention). We see that 
social behavior helps in managing the students? 
attention, which may be affected negatively by 
counterproductive/bad interaction behavior from 
the students. 
Besides suggesting that social behavior could be 
a useful strategy for directing student attention, it 
also suggests that social behavior may not serve 
this function where counterproductive student be-
havior is not present or where it does not occur 
enough to negatively impact task behavior. This is 
because a minimum amount of time needs to be 
spent on each tutoring episode to deliver the in-
structional of the concept being discussed. In the 
absence of counterproductive student behavior, 
episode duration may be close to that minimum. 
Also, in an earlier analysis (Hua et. al., 2010) in 
a different learning domain where the social beha-
viors described in Section 2 were employed, we 
have observed that the number of abusive/negative 
comment made by the students about the tutor dur-
ing the interaction were significantly higher in a 
condition where the tutors performed a high 
amount of social behavior. This suggests that the 
relationship between the SocialTurns and Episo-
deDuration variables may not be linear in extreme 
cases and emphasizes the importance of perform-
ing an optimal amount of social behavior. 
4 Triggering Social Behavior 
Aside from designing, implementing and regulat-
ing the amount of social behavior performed by 
automated tutors, one of the challenges involved in 
the appropriate use of social interaction strategies 
is that of triggering these strategies only at the 
most appropriate moments during the interaction. 
Our initial implementation of these strategies 
(Kumar & Ros?, 2010b) achieved this using a set 
230
of hand crafted rules that used features such as re-
cent student turns, state of the tutoring plan, etc. 
Here we will summarize our efforts on building 
a better triggering policy using a data-driven ap-
proach that models the behavior of human tutors at 
triggering the social interaction strategies listed in 
Table 1. Using a corpus of 10 interactions between 
a group of students and partially automated tutors 
whose social behaviors were triggered by human 
tutors, we attempt to learn a triggering policy that 
predicts when the human tutors will trigger a social 
strategies. Currently, we focus on only learning a 
triggering policy that determines if a social beha-
vior should be performed. The choice of which 
behavior is performed when triggered by the policy 
is still based on the rules used in our earlier im-
plementation as discussed in Section 5.3. 
In order to compare the triggers generated by a 
policy, we use a binary sequence comparison me-
tric called kKappa (Neikrasz & Moore, 2010) de-
veloped for evaluating discourse segmentation 
approaches. The metric allows a soft penalty for 
misplacing a trigger (or a segment boundary) with-
in a window of k turns. 
We developed a large margin learning algo-
rithm following McDonald et. al. (2005) that itera-
tively learns the coefficients of a linear function in 
the feature space that separates turns where human 
tutors decided to trigger a social behavior from the 
rest of the turns. Instead of using an instance-based 
objective function (like square-loss), our algorithm 
maximizes the kKappa metric over a provided 
training set. The function learnt this way can be 
used as a triggering policy by using it at every turn 
during an interaction to predict if a human tutor 
would trigger a social behavior. We used a collec-
tion of automatically extractable features that 
represent the lexical and semantic content of recent 
student and tutor turns, current discourse state and 
activity levels of the students. 
While details of the objective evaluation of the 
various learnt triggering policies is beyond the 
scope of this paper, we found that the best per-
forming strategy (k-? = 0.13) was significantly bet-
ter than a random baseline (k-? = 0.01) as well as 
the rule based triggering policy (k-? = -0.09) used 
in our initial implementation. Also, the policy 
learnt by our algorithm outperformed policies 
learnt by algorithms such as Linear Regression (k-
? = 0.00) and Logistic Regression (k-? = 0.05) that 
use instance-based loss metrics (Hall et. al., 2009). 
5 User Study 
Here we will present an experiment we conducted 
to evaluate the effectiveness of various ways to 
trigger social behavior discussed in Section 4. This 
experiment is a step towards verifying the hypo-
thesis that a human-like triggering policy could 
outperform a rule-based triggering policy that was 
used in our earlier experiments (Kumar et. al., 
2010a). We use the same interactive situation for 
the experiment presented here as in our earlier 
work. Freshmen mechanical engineering students 
enrolled at an American university participate in a 
computer-aided engineering lab that is divided into 
three parts, i.e., Computer-Aided Design (CAD), 
Computer-Aided Analysis (CAA) and Computer-
Aided Manufacturing (CAM). Students practice 
the use of various engineering software packages 
for all three parts as they design, analyze and man-
ufacture an Aluminum wrench. Our experiment is 
conducted during the second part (CAA) of the lab. 
5.1 Procedure & Materials 
The Computer-Aided Analysis lab comprises of 
two activities. The first activity involves analyzing 
a wrench design given to the students by specify-
ing certain loading conditions and simulating the 
stresses and deformations in the wrench. Students 
are led by a teaching assistant during this activity. 
They spend approximately 25 minutes performing 
this activity. At the end of the analysis activity, the 
students see a simulation of the stress distribution 
in the body of the wrench. 
After the analysis activity, a pre-test is adminis-
tered. Each student spends 10 minutes working on 
the pre-test individually. The pre-test comprises of 
11 questions, 8 of which are multiple-choice ques-
tions and the other 3 are short essay type questions. 
The second activity of the CAA lab is a colla-
borative design activity. During this activity, stu-
dents work in teams of three. Student in the same 
team are seated in separate parts of the lab and can 
only communicate using a text-based chatroom 
application (M?hlpfordt and Wessner, 2005). The 
chatroom application also provides a shared work-
space in the form of a whiteboard. 
After the pre-test, students are given written in-
structions describing the collaborative design ac-
tivity. The instructions ask the students to design a 
better wrench in terms of ease of use, cost of mate-
rials and safety compared to the wrench they ana-
231
lyzed earlier. The students are expected to come up 
with three new designs in 40 minutes by varying 
parameters like dimensions and materials of the 
wrench. The instructions also include various for-
mulae and data that the students might need to use 
for their designs. Besides course credit, the instruc-
tions mention an additional giftcard for the team 
that comes up with the best design ($10 for each 
member of the winning team). 
Students are asked to log in to their respective 
team?s chatroom. They spend the next 40 minutes 
working on the collaborative design activity. Be-
sides the three students, the chatroom for each 
team includes an automated tutor. The tutor guides 
the students through the first two designs suggest-
ing potential choices for dimension and materials 
for each design. As the design activity progresses, 
the tutor initiates four conceptual tutoring episodes 
to help the students reflect upon underlying me-
chanical engineering concepts like stress, force, 
moment, safety, etc., that are relevant to the design 
activity. 
Our experimental manipulation happens during 
this 40 minute segment. The tutor in each team?s 
chatroom is configured to perform social behavior 
using different triggering policies as specified by 
the condition assigned to the team. The conditions 
are discussed in the next section. Irrespective of 
the condition, each team receives the 4 conceptual 
tutoring episodes. Every student performs all the 
steps of this procedure like all other students. 
At the end of the collaborative design activity, a 
post-test and a survey are administered. Students 
are asked to spend 15 minutes to first complete the 
test and then the survey. The post-test is the same 
test used for pre-test. The survey comprises of 15 
items shown in Appendix B. The students are 
asked to rate each item on a 7-point Likert scale 
ranging from Strongly Disagree (1) to Strongly 
Agree (7). The 15 items on the survey include 11 
items eliciting perception of the tutor. 9 of the 11 
items state positive aspects of the tutor (e.g. ?tutor 
was friendly?). The other 2 items stated negative 
aspects about the tutor (e.g. ?tutor?s responses got 
in the way?). Besides the items about the tutor, 2 
items elicited the student?s rating about the colla-
borative design activity. The last 2 items were 
about the student?s satisfaction with their perfor-
mance on the design task. 
In total, both the activities that are part of the 
CAA lab take approximately 1 hour 40 minutes. 
5.2 Experimental Design 
The teams participating in the experiment de-
scribed here were divided into six conditions. 
These conditions determined the triggering policy 
and the amount of social behavior performed by 
the automated tutors. Tutors in the None condition 
did not perform any social behavior. Tutors in the 
Rules condition used the same hand crafted rule-
based triggering policy employed in our earlier 
experiment (Kumar et. al., 2010a). Following the 
results from another experiment (Kumar & Ros?, 
2010c), the automated tutors in the Rules condition 
performed a moderate amount of social behavior 
(atmost 20% of all tutor turns). On average, the 
Rules policy triggered 25 social turns per interac-
tion. 
The RandomLow and RandomHigh condi-
tions used a random triggering policy with a social 
ratio filter to regulate the amount of social beha-
vior. In both the random conditions, the tutor 
would trigger social behavior using a random 
number generator to generate the confidence of 
triggering a social behavior after every turn (by a 
student or a tutor). In the RandomLow condition, a 
behavior would be triggered if the confidence was 
above 0.91. In the RandomHigh condition, a beha-
vior would be triggered if the confidence was 
above 0.85. On average, the RandomLow condi-
tion had 23 behaviors triggered per interaction. 
About 37 behaviors were triggered in the Ran-
domHigh condition. 
The LearntLow and LearntHigh conditions 
used the best triggering policy learnt from a corpus 
of human triggering of social behavior as discussed 
in Section 4. The same social ratio filter used in the 
random conditions was used in these two condi-
tions also. As in the case with RandomLow and 
RandomHigh, different values of a confidence pa-
rameter were used for the LearntLow and Learn-
tHigh conditions to control the number of social 
behaviors triggered. On average, the LearntLow 
condition had 22 triggers and the LearntHigh con-
dition had 28 triggers. 
5.3 Generating Behaviors 
The various triggering policies described above for 
each of our experimental conditions only deter-
mine when a tutor agent will perform a social be-
havior. In order to perform the social behavior in 
actual use, the agent must not only determine when 
232
a behavior should be triggered, but also determine 
which behavior should be performed when a trig-
ger is received. Our implementation of the tutor 
agent used in this experiment provides a conti-
nuous stream of scores for each of the eleven so-
cial interaction strategies that the tutor can 
perform. The scores are computed using hand-
crafted functions that use the same features used in 
our rule-based triggering policy (Kumar et. al., 
2010b). When a social behavior is triggered, a rou-
lette wheel selection is used to determine the strat-
egy to be performed. The circumference of the 
wheel assigned to each strategy is proportional to 
the score of each strategy. If the score of all the 
strategies is zero, a generic social prompt is per-
formed. 
6 Results 
126 students enrolled in an introductory mechani-
cal engineering course at an American university 
participated in the experiment described in this 
paper. The experiment was conducted on two sepa-
rate days separated by one week. On each day, four 
sessions of the Computer-Aided Analysis lab were 
conducted, and students attended only one as-
signed session. Session assignment was made 
based on an alphabetic split. The 126 students were 
divided into 42 teams. 20 teams participated on the 
first day of the experiment. They were evenly split 
into four conditions (None, Rules, RandomHigh & 
LearntHigh). The remaining 22 teams participated 
on the second day. Out of these, 5 teams each were 
assigned to the None and RandomLow condition. 6 
teams each were assigned to the Rules and 
LearntLow conditions. 
The rest of this section presents detailed results 
and analysis of this experiment. To summarize, we 
found that out of the six evaluated policies only the 
LearntLow policy that uses a triggering model 
learnt from human triggering data and generates a 
moderate amount of social behavior is consistently 
better than the other policies in terms of both per-
formance as well as perception outcomes. Also, the 
LearntLow policy is found to be most efficient at 
delivering the instructional content as indicated by 
the smallest EpisodeDuration in Table 5. 
6.1 Learning Outcomes 
The learning outcomes analysis presented here 
shows the advantage of using a triggering policy 
learnt from a corpus of human triggering behavior 
along with a filtering technique that regulates the 
amount of social behavior as shown in Table 3. 
We first verified that there was no significant 
difference between the six conditions on the pre-
test scores. As in the case of previous experiments 
using this learning activity, we saw that the learn-
ing activity was pedagogically beneficial to the 
students irrespective of the condition. There was a 
significant improvement in test scores between 
pre-test and post-test { p < 0.0001, F(1,250) = 
26.01, effect-size = 0.58? }. 
There was no significant effect of the condition 
assigned to each team on the total test scores. 
However, there was a significant effect on the test 
scores of short-essay type questions using the pre-
test score as a covariate and the condition as a fac-
tor { p < 0.05, F(5, 119) = 2.88 }. The adjusted 
post test scores for the short essay type questions 
and their standard deviations are shown in Table 3. 
Post-hoc analysis showed that the LearntLow con-
dition was significantly better than LearntHigh 
condition { effect-size = 0.65? }. Also, Random-
Low condition was marginally better than Learn-
tHigh condition { p < 0.07, effect-size = 0.62? }.

LearntLow 5.12 0.54 
RandomLow 5.06 0.67 
None 4.75 1.13 
RandomHigh 4.59 1.09 
Rules 4.38 0.89 
LearntHigh 3.98 1.74 
 
Table 3. Mean and Standard Deviation of Adjusted Post 
Test Scores for Short Essay Type Questions 
 
This result further supports the observation 
from our earlier experiment (Kumar & Ros?, 
2010c) which demonstrated that importance of per-
forming the right amount of social behavior. Both 
RandomLow and LearntLow conditions employ 
the non-linear social ratio filter which keeps the 
amount of allowed social behavior at a level com-
parable to the amount of social behavior performed 
by human tutors. 
Since the primary objective of the experiment 
described here was to evaluate a learnt triggering 
policy with respect to a rule-based triggering poli-
cy, we repeated the ANCOVA for the short essay 
type question using data from only the Rules, 
233
LearntLow and LearntHigh conditions. We found a 
significant effect of condition on the post-test score 
using pre-test score as a covariate { p = 0.01, 
F(2,62) = 4.98 }. A post-hoc analysis showed that 
the LearntLow condition was significantly better 
than the LearntHigh condition as above and  the 
LearntLow condition was marginally better than 
the Rules condition { p ? 0.08, effect-size = 0.84? 
}. We observe that a triggering policy learnt from 
human triggering behavior can achieve a marginal 
improvement on learning outcomes compared to 
our existing rule-based triggering policy. This is 
consistent with our hypothesis. 
6.2 Perception Ratings 
We averaged the student?s rating for the 11 items 
about the tutor into a single tutor rating measure 
used here. Rating on the two negative statements 
about the tutor were inverted (7?1, 6?2, and so 
on) for this calculation.   
 
 
Mean St.Dev. 
Rules 4.74 1.45 
LearntLow 4.56 1.58 
None 4.42 1.49 
RandomHigh 3.74 1.63 
LearntHigh 3.55 1.26 
RandomLow 3.18 0.91 
 
Table 4. Mean and Standard Deviation of Tutor Ratings 
 
We found a significant effect of condition on 
the tutor ratings { p < 0.01, F(5,120) = 3.83 }. Ta-
ble 4 shows the mean and standard deviations of 
tutor ratings for each condition. Post-hoc analysis 
showed that only the Rules condition was signifi-
cantly better than the RandomLow condition. Also, 
we found that Rules was marginally better than 
LearntHigh condition { p < 0.08 } and both Learnt-
Low and None conditions was marginally better 
than RandomLow condition { p < 0.08 }. 
While we did not see a significant improvement 
in perception due the use of a learnt triggering pol-
icy when compared to a rule-based triggering poli-
cy, we find an advantage over using a random 
triggering policy (RandomLow) which was as 
good as a learnt policy on the learning outcomes. 
The results from the tutor?s perception ratings fur-
ther support the importance of timing and regulat-
ing the amount of social behavior. 
We did not find any significant effect of condi-
tion on the ratings about the design activity or stu-
dent?s task satisfaction. 
6.3 Analysis of Tutoring Episodes 
In order to understand the results from the experi-
ment presented in this paper, we applied the struc-
tural equation model discussed earlier (Figure 2) to 
the data collected from our current experiment. 
Figure 3 shows the model for our current experi-
ment (p=0.4492). Only four variables were used 
because the annotations of good and bad student 
behavior are not available at this time.

Mean St.Dev. 
RandomHigh 540.80 49.50 
LearntHigh 534.80 61.00 
None 523.88 41.54 
Rules 519.80 102.70 
RandomLow 519.20 74.40 
LearntLow 484.00 69.80 
 
Table 5. Mean and Standard Deviation of Duration 
of Tutoring Episodes 
 
We see that most of the model parameters (p-
Value, means & correlations) are similar to para-
meters for the model shown in Figure 2. However, 
the correlation between SocialTurns and Episode-
Duration is much smaller. Also, note that the mean 
of EpisodeDuration is smaller compared to that in 
Figure 2 which indicates that lesser counterproduc-
tive behavior was displayed by the students in this 
experiment. The conceptual tutoring episodes are 
operating closer to the minimum episode duration 
which leaves a smaller room for improvement by 
234
the use of social interaction strategies. As dis-
cussed in Section 3.3, this explains the smaller cor-
relation between SocialTurns and EpisodeDuration 
in Figure 3. 
Table 5 shows the mean and standard deviations 
of the duration of tutoring episodes for each condi-
tion. Even though the differences are not signifi-
cant, the LearntLow policy has the lowest duration 
indicating higher student attention than the other 
conditions. 
7 Discussion 
Prior work in the field of human-human interaction 
and human-machine interaction in the form of di-
alog systems has emphasized the importance of 
timing the display of behavior to achieve natural 
and/or productive interactions. In general, timing 
of interactive behaviors (verbal as well as non-
verbal) has been studied in the context of joint ac-
tivities being performed by the participants. Beha-
viors are timed to achieve and maintain 
coordination between the participants (Clark, 
2005). Specifically, among other topics, timing of 
low-level (signal) interaction like turn-taking has 
been the subject of several investigations (Raux & 
Eskenazi, 2008; Takeuchi et. al., 2004). 
On the other hand, the use of social behavior by 
conversational agents to support students has been 
proposed (Veletsianos et. al., 2009; Gulz et. al., 
2010). Work in the area of affective computing and 
its application to tutorial dialog has focused on 
identification of student?s emotional states and us-
ing those to improve choice of behavior performed 
by tutors (D?Mello et. al., 2005). Our prior work 
(Kumar et. al., 2010; Kumar et. al., 2007) has 
shown that social behavior motivated from empiri-
cal research in small group communication (Bales, 
1950) can help in effectively supporting students in 
collaborative learning settings. Use of social inte-
raction in other applications of conversational 
agents besides education has been investigated 
(Bickmore et. al., 2009; Dybala et. al., 2009; Doh-
saka et. al., 2009). 
The experiments presented here bridges these 
two tracks of research specifically proposing a so-
lution to the challenge of timing social behavior in 
the context of a supporting collaborative learning. 
Compared to the work on timing signal-level joint 
activities like turn-taking, this work focuses on the 
timing of joint activities at the conversation level. 
The success of our algorithm at learning a model 
of timing conversational behaviors in the context 
of an interactive task could potentially offer a gen-
eral approach for realizing such behaviors in other 
conversational agents. 
8 Conclusion  
In this paper, we presented an experiment that 
compared the effectiveness of several social beha-
vior triggering policies. Specifically, we compared 
a triggering policy learnt from a corpus of human 
triggering behavior to a rule-based policy which 
has previously been shown to be successful at trig-
gering effective social behavior in a collaborative 
learning activity. 
The presented experiment provides further evi-
dence in support of the intuition that timing of so-
cial behavior and regulating the amount of social 
behavior are critical to improving performance and 
perception outcomes. A triggering policy based on 
human-like timing in combination with a filter that 
attempts to keep amount of social behavior at the 
same level as human tutors was shown to be mar-
ginally better than the rule-based policy on learn-
ing outcomes. Also, on perception measures, we 
found that the human-like policy is marginally bet-
ter than a random triggering policy which uses the 
same filter to control the amount of social beha-
vior.  Only the learned model provides a win both 
on learning and on perception measures. 
In order to better understand the effect of use of 
social behavior by automated tutors on student?s 
learning outcomes, we presented a structured mod-
el which suggests that social behavior helps in 
achieving higher learning outcomes by allowing 
the tutor to better manage the student?s attention. 
Following this model, we saw that a human-like 
triggering policy is able to achieve higher student 
attention as indicated by the smaller duration of 
tutoring episodes. 
We found a significant negative correlation { 
coefficient = -0.20, p < 0.05 } between the tutor?s 
perception rating and number of social behaviors 
triggered when none of the social interaction strat-
egies were applicable. As next steps, our best trig-
gering policy could be potentially further refined 
by achieving a closer integration of the triggering 
model with the social behavior generation mechan-
ism to prevent triggering when none of the eleven 
strategies could be generated.
