In this paper are described experiments on un- 
supervised learning of the domain lexicon and 
relevant phrase fragments from a dialog cor- 
pus. Suggested approach is based on using do- 
main independent words for chunking and us- 
ing semantical predictional power of such words 
for clustering and automatic extraction phrase 
fragments relevant o dialog topics. 
1 In t roduct ion  
We are interested in rapid development of spo- 
ken dialog understanding systems. We present 
experiments on unsupervised learning of the 
domain lexicon and relevant phrase fragments 
from dialog corpus. 
Pereira (1993) described a method for auto- 
matically clustering words according to their 
distribution in particular syntactic ontext, for 
example verbs and direct objects of these verbs. 
By using preexisting concepts from Wordnet 
database Resnik (1998) described how to pre- 
dict words meaning from their distributional 
context. Both mentioned methods are fully 
unsupervised and are focused only on follow- 
ing word distribution. They describe the de- 
pendences between verb and noun as a direct 
object of the verb. A new method for gather- 
ing phrases into clusters was described by Arai 
(1999). This method uses following and preced- 
ing words distribution and call-types, associated 
with each utterance, but requires at the begin- 
ning labeling and transcribing a small number 
of the utterances. 
In contrast with the mentioned methodolo- 
gies, we are interested in finding a limited set 
of domain independent words (less than 1000) 
including prepositions, adverbs and adjectives 
and using these words for unsupervised clus- 
tering and automatic extraction of the relevant 
knowledge from dialog corpus. 
2 Descr ip t ion  o f  the  a lgor i thm 
There are four main steps in our approach. 
First step is to make automatically labeling 
and to chunk each sentence from spoken dia- 
log corpus into a set of short subphrases. We 
assume that in the spoken dialog a sentence 
consists of slightly related subphrases. In our 
experiment for labeling and chunking we use 
a relatively small set of domain independent 
words such as prepositions, determiners, arti- 
cles, modals and adverbs. For example articles: 
a, an, the; prepositions: in, with,  about ,  un- 
der, for, of, to; determiners: some, many.  
The domain independent words are grouped in 
subvocabularies. For instance, subvocabulary 
<article> includes words a, an, the. Some 
subvocabularies include only one word. If a 
given sentence includes article A we'll replace it 
by the label (<article>A), article THE we'll 
replace by the label (<article>THE) and so 
on. Very important feature of our algorithm is 
that some of the words selected for tags can pre- 
dict the semantics of the followed words or sub- 
phrases. In all cases we could characterize this 
prediction as possibility. For example the word 
f rom predict semantics of the followed words 
or subphrases as a "start point", a "reason", a 
"source" or someth ing  else. For each of such tag 
words  we create separate subvocabulary. In the 
process of labeling we examine  given sentence 
f rom left to right and  replace the tag words  by 
the labels. For labeling we use tools based on 
AT&T CHRONUS system described by Levin 
(1995). 
In the process of chunking we examine the 
sentence from left to right. In one chunk we put 
83 
one tag word label or tag word labels following 
one by one and other non tag words on the right 
up to but excluding next tag word label. There 
are two examples of the chunks: 
(<what>WHAT) YPE, 
(<pronouns>I) (<article>A) FARE. 
We'll describe ach non tag word by the vector 
of the features. Every component of the vector 
corresponds to subvocabulary of the tag words 
as it is described below: 
component  1 ~ (<article>...) 
component  2 ~ (<determiner>...) 
component  3 -4 (<modal>...) 
component  4 ~ (<of>OF)  
component  5 --4 (<to>TO) 
component  n --~ (<from>FROM) 
Every component mean how many times tag 
word label was in the left context of described 
non tag word. Every component is an integer. 
Thus we have the list of non tag words and vec- 
tors of integers corresponding to this words. 
Second step is to cluster the words from all 
chunks by using the vectors of the features. 
In this step we extract from chunks the words 
which have enough semantically charged tags 
in the left context and group such words in the 
clusters. 
For clustering we take from the list the first 
non tag word and check if the number of differ- 
ent tags (number of non zero components of the 
vector) is more then threshold. The threshold 
value must be greater then the number of tag 
words having low semantical predictional power 
(articles, modals, auxiliaries, determiners). In 
our experiments we used threshold values from 
6 up to 9. If the number of different ags for 
tested vector is more than threshold we'll con- 
sider this vector as a centre of the cluster and 
then looking for other vectors neighbouring to 
tested vector. When the neighbouring vectors 
are selected we'll remove them from the list of 
vectors. This procedure we'll repeat for all vec- 
tors non selected as a member of the class. For 
this experiments we have used distance measure 
based on Hamming metrics. 
In the third step we go back to the chunks 
and extract chunks which include words from 
one cluster. In this way we generate the clusters 
of the chunks. 
In the forth step we reduce the number of the 
chunk's clusters. We make union of all chunk's 
clusters except one tested cluster and then inter- 
sect this one with chunk's union. If all chunks 
from tested cluster are inside of the union we 
delete this tested chink cluster. 
Let us consider baseline algorithm which use 
"stop words" known in information retrieval 
systems. The idea of this algorithm is to delete 
the stop words from given sentence and return 
all of the remaining words as lexicon items. 
There are some principal differences between 
baseline algorithm and suggested algorithm. 
In suggested algorithm we are looking for the 
words which have enough semantically charged 
tags in the left context and then extract chunks 
which include selected words. In the baseline al- 
gorithm we are looking for only words remaining 
after deleting "stop words". 
3 The  resu l ts  o f  exper iments  
Below we show examples of labeling and chunk- 
ing the phrases. As an example we use two 
phrase from ATIS dialog corpus which includes 
nearly 20K sentences about flights, reservations, 
tickets, prices, car rent, flight classes and others. 
WHAT TYPE OF AIRCRAFT IS 
USED FOR THIS FLIGHT 
IS A MEAL SERVED FOR THIS 
FLIGHT 
After labeling we'll have followed labeled 
phrase: 
(<what>WHAT) YPE (<of>OF)  
AIRCRAFT (<auxiliary>IS) 
USED (<for>FOR) 
(<determiner>THIS) FLIGHT 
(<auxiliary>IS) (<article>A) 
MEAL SERVED (<for>FOR)  
(<determiner>THIS) FLIGHT 
In one chunk we put the tag word label or se- 
quence of tag word labels from the left context 
and other non tag words on the right up but 
exclude the next tag word label. Below is the 
list of the chunks for those two sentences. 
(<what>WHAT) TYPE 
(<of>OF)  AIRCRAFT 
84 
(<auxiliary>IS) USED 
(<for>FOR) (<determiner>THiS) FLIGHT 
(<auxiliary>IS) 
(<article>A) MEAL SERVED 
We have divided the corpus into two parts. For 
each part we did the labeling, chunking and 
clustering by using Hamming metrics for dis- 
tance measure. Below we present the words ex- 
tracted from both parts of the corpus. 
The words extracted from the first 15K sen- 
tences. 
AIRLINE, AIRLINES, AIRPORT, 
AVAILABLE, BREAKFAST, BUSI- 
NESS, CITY, CLASS, COACH, 
COST, DAY,  DINNER, EACH, 
EARLIEST, EARLY, ECONOMY, 
FARE, FARES, FLIGHT, FLIGHTS, 
FLY, FLYING, GET, GO, GO- 
ING, GROUND, INFORMATION, 
LATEST, LESS, LUNCH, MAKE, 
MEAL, MEALS, MOST, NON- 
STOP, CLASS, NUMBER, OTHER, 
PLANE, PRICE, RENTAL, RE- 
STRICTIONS, RETURN, ROUND, 
SERVE, SERVED, SERVICE, SHOW, 
STOP, STOPS, TAKE, TIME, 
TRANSPORTATION, TRIP. 
There are 54 words. Near 80% of the words 
could be considered as having strict relations 
to the dialog topics. There are such words as 
AIRLINE, CLASS, COACH, COST, MEALS. 
To understand does this approach is robust we 
applied the same methodology for the last 5K 
sentences ofthe corpus. The words extracted in 
this experiments are: 
AIRPORT, FLY, FLIGHT. 
STOPOVER, INFORMATION. 
FLIGHTS, AIRCRAFT, CITIES 
COST, LESS, FARE, TRIP, ROUND. 
TRANSPORTATION, GROUND. 
LIST, FARES, CAR, TIMES 
NUMBER, NONSTOP, AIRLINE 
MEALS. AVAILABLE, AIRLINES. 
With exception of STOPOVER, CITIES, 
TIMES all other words are among those ex- 
tracted from first 15K sentences. 
Below we present as an example the contents 
of the chunk's cluster for word COST extracted 
from the first 15K sentences: 
LOWEST COST FARE, LIKE COST, 
FLIGHT COST, KNOW COST, 
FLIGHTS COST, LOVEST COST 
AIRFARE, LIMOUSINE COST, 
RENTAL CAR COST, LIMOUSINE 
SERVICE COST, WITHIN CITY,
