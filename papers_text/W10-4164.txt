Abstract 
Word Sense Induction (WSI) is an 
important topic in natural langage 
processing area. For the bakeoff task 
Chinese Word Sense Induction (CWSI), 
this paper proposes two systems using 
basic clustering algorithms, k-means and 
agglomerative clustering. Experimental 
results show that k-means achieves a 
better performance. Based only on the 
data provided by the task organizers, the 
two systems get FScores of 0.7812 and 
0.7651 respectively. 
1 Introduction 
Word Sense Induction (WSI) or Word Sense 
Discrimination is a task of automatically discov-
ering word senses from un-annotated text. It is 
distinct from Word Sense Disambiguation 
(WSD) where the senses are assumed to be 
known and the aim is to decide the right mean-
ing of the target word in context. WSD generally 
requires the use of large-scale manually anno-
tated lexical resources, while WSI can overcome 
this limitation. Furthermore, automatically in-
duced word senses can improve performance on 
many natural language processing tasks such as 
information retrieval (Uzuner et al, 1999), in-
formation extraction (Chai and Biermann, 1999) 
and machine translation (Vickrey et al, 2005). 
WSI is typically treated as a clustering prob-
lem. The input is instances of the ambiguous 
word with their accompanying contexts and the 
output is a grouping of these instances into 
classes corresponding to the induced senses. In 
other words, contexts that are grouped together 
in the same class represent a specific word sense. 
The task can be formally defined as a two 
stage process, feature selection and word cluster-
ing. The first stage determines which context 
features to consider when comparing similarity 
between words, while the second stage apply 
some process that clusters similar words using 
the selected features. So the simplest approaches 
to WSI involve the use of basic word co-
occurrence features and application of classical 
clustering algorithms, more sophisticated tech-
niques improve performance by introducing new 
context features, novel clustering algorithms, or 
both. (Denkowski, 2009) makes a comprehen-
sive survey of techniques for unsupervised word 
sense induction. 
Two tasks on English Word Sense Induction 
were held on SemEval2007 (Agirre and Soroa, 
2007) and SemEval2010 (Manandhar and Kla-
paftis, 2010) respectively, which greatly pro-
mote the research of English WSI. 
However, the study on Chinese Word Sense 
Induction (CWSI) is inadequate (Zhu, 2009), 
and Chinese word senses have their own charac-
teristics. The methods that work well in English 
may not work well in Chinese. So, as an explo-
ration, this paper proposes simple approaches 
utilizing basic features and basic clustering algo-
rithms, such as partitional method k-means and 
hierarchical agglomerative method. 
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. 
Section 2 briefly introduces the basic clustering 
algorithms. Section 3 describes the feature set. 
Section 4 gives experimental details and analysis. 
Conclusions and future work are given in Sec-
tion 5. 
2 Clustering Algorithms 
Partitional clustering and hierarchical clustering 
are the two basic types of clustering algorithms. 
Partitional clustering partitions a given dataset 
into a set of clusters without any explicit 
structure, while hierarchical clustering creates a 
hierarchy of clusters. 
The k-means algorithm is the most notable 
partitional clustering method. It takes a simple 
two step iterative process, data assignment and 
relocation of means, to divide the dataset into a 
specified number of clusters, k. 
Hierarchical clustering algorithms are either 
top-down or bottom-up. Bottom-up algorithms 
treat each instance as a singleton cluster at the 
beginning and then successively merge pairs of 
clusters until all clusters have been merged into 
a single cluster. Bottom-up clustering is also 
called hierarchical agglomerative clustering, 
which is more popular than top-down clustering. 
We use k-means and agglomerative algo-
rithms for the CWSI task, and compare the per-
formances of the two algorithms. 
Estimating the number of the induced clusters, 
k, is difficult for general clustering problems. 
But in CWSI, it is simplified because the sense 
number of the target word is given beforehand. 
CLUTO (Karypis, 2003), a clustering toolkit, 
is used for implementation. The similarity be-
tween objects is computed using cosine function. 
The criterion functions for k-means and agglom-
erative algorithms are I2 and UPGMA respec-
tively. Biased agglomerative approach is chosen 
in stead of the traditional agglomerative ap-
proach. 
3 Feature Set 
For each target word, instances are extracted 
from the XML data file. Then the encoding of 
the instance file is transformed from UTF-8 to 
GB2312. Word segmentation and part-of-speech 
tagging is finished with the tool ICTCLAS 1 . 
Then the following three types of features are 
extracted: 
1. The part-of-speech of the target word 
2. Words before and after the target word 
within window of size 3 with position informa-
tion 
3. Unordered single words in all the contex-
tual sentences without the target word, punctua-
tions and symbols of the part-of-speech ?nx? 
(Each word is only counted once, which is dif-

ferent from the word frequency in the bag-of-
words model) 
The target word is not necessarily a seg-
mented word. Their relations are as follows: 
1. The target word is a segmented word.  
E.g. ?/d  ?/v  ?/r  ??/n 
Don?t dial my phone. 
The target word is ??? (dial) and the seg-
mented word is also ??? (dial). So they match. 
2. The target word is inside of a segmented 
word. 
E.g.?/p  ??/n  ???/v 
       deal with media 
The target word is ??? (deal), but the seg-
mented word is ????? (deal with). Then we 
split the segmented word and specify the part-of-
speech of the target word as ?1?. 
3. The target word is the combination of two 
segmented words. 
E.g. ?/v  ?/v  ?/w  ?????/nz  ?/w 
       launching the ?Culture Revolution? 
The target word is ???? (launching), but it 
is split into two segmented words ??? (start) 
and ??? (move). Then we combine the two 
segmented words and specify the part-of-speech 
of the target word as ?2?. 
4. The target word is split into two segmented 
words. 
E.g. ?/v  ?/v  ?/u  ?/j  ??/n 
       blow up northeast wind 
The target word is ????, but it is segmented 
into two words ??? (east) and ???? (north 
wind). In this case, we specify the postion of 
first segmented word as the position of the target 
word and the part-of-speech of the target word 
as ?3?.  
If the target word occurs more than once in an 
instance, we consider the first occurrence. 
4 Experiments 
4.1 Data Sets 
Two data sets are provided. The trial set contains 
50 target words and 50 examples for each target 
word. The test set consists of 100 new target 
word and 50 examples for each target word. 
Both data sets are collected from the internet. 
Table 1 shows the distribution of sense num-
bers of the target words in the two data sets. We 
can see that two sense words dominate and three 
sense words are the second majority. The word 
??? (beat) in the trial set has 21 senses.

trial set 2314 105 68 12 2499
test set 4031 710 212 47 5000
 
As is shown in table 2, the total instance 
number in the trial set is 2499 because there is a 
target word has only 49 instances. About 7.4% 
of the instances in the trial set and 19.38% of the 
instances in the test set have mismatched target 
words and segmented words (with relation types 
2, 3 and 4). 
4.2 Evaluation Metrics 
The official performance metric for the CWSI 
task is FScore (Zhao and Karypis, 2005). Given 
a particular class Ci of size ni and a cluster Sr of 
size nr, suppose irn  examples in the class Ci be-
long to Sr. The F value of this class and cluster is 
defined to be: 
),(),(
),(*),(*2

for class Ci and cluster Sr. The FScore of class Ci 
is the maximum F value attained at any cluster, 
that is

and the FScore of the entire clustering solution 
is 
?

)(  
where c is the number of classes and n is the size 
of the clustering solution. 
Another two metrics, Entropy and Purity 
(Zhao and Karypis, 2001), are also employed in 
this paper to measure our system performance. 
Entropy measures how the various classes of 
word senses are distributed within each cluster, 
while Purity measures the extent to which each 
cluster contained word senses from primarily 
one class. The entropy of cluster Sr is defined as

The entropy of the entire clustering solution is 
then defined to be the sum of the individual clus-
ter entropies weighted according to the cluster 
size. That is 
?

The purity of a cluster is defined to be

which is the fraction of the overall cluster size 
that the largest class of examples assigned to that 
cluster represents. The overall purity of the clus-
tering solution is obtained as a weighted sum of 
the individual cluster purities and is given by 
?

)(  
In general, the larger the values of FScore and 
Purity, the better the clustering solution is. The 
smaller the Entropy values, the better the cluster-
ing solution is. 
The above three metrics are defined to evalu-
ate the result of a single target word. Macro av-
erage metrics are used to evaluate the overall 
performance of all the target words. 
4.3 Results 
The overall performance on the trial data is 
shown in table 3. From the Macro Average En-
tropy and Macro Average Purity, we can see that 
k-means works better than agglomerative 
method. The detailed results of the k-means sys-
tem are shown in table 4.

5 Conclusions and Future Work 
This paper tries to build basic systems for Chi-
nese Word Sense Induction (CWSI) task. Basic 
clustering algorithms including k-means and 
agglomerative methods are studied. No extra 
language resources are used except the data 
given by the task organizers. 
To improve the performance of CWSI sys-
tems, we will introduce new features and study 
novel clustering algorithms. We will also inves-
tigate the bakeoff data sets to find some more 
characteristics of Chinese word senses.
