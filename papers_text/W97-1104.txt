Abstract 
A deductive approach is used to predict vowel 
and consonant places of articulation. Based on 
two main criteria, viz. simple and efficient use of 
an acoustic tube, along with maximum acoustic 
dispersion, the Distinctive Regions Model 
(DRM) of speech production derives regions 
that closely correspond to established vowel and 
consonant places of articulation. 
1 Introduction 
Attempts to explain speech production data often suffer 
from circularity. That is, the classification of data tends 
to be purely descriptive without shedding light on the 
processes that give rise to them. In criticizing the data- 
based approach, Lindblom (1990) favors, instead, the 
use of substance-based approaches. Here, deductions 
are derived from specific criteria or from characteristics 
of the speech production and/or perceptual systems in 
order to explain the data. In fact, researcher have 
successfully exploited the substance-based approach in 
explaining vowel systems, using a perceptually-driven 
maximum acoustic dispersion criterion (Liljencrants 
and Lindblom, 1972; Lindblorn, 1986). But this 
approach, too, may be thought of as being circular, to 
some extent, in that the criterion used may be viewed 
as, merely, a more encompassing description of the 
vowels themselves. The crucial task then is to explain 
the characteristics of the speech perception/production 
system itself. For example, what is it about the human 
speech apparatus that yields three and not four or five 
places of articulation? Is the vocal tract designed 
primarily for feeding or does it reflect adaptations 
specialized for speech? To answer some of these 
questions, we undertook to investigate what 
deformations (i.e. vocal tract configurations/shapes) of 
a simple acoustic tube, open at one end and closed at 
the other, and modeled after a male vocal tract, will 
yield (i) a good acoustic ommunication device, and (ii) 
an acoustic repertoire that closely matches the phonetic 
richness of human speech. 
2 Criteria for building an acoustic device for 
communication 
Our approach will be based purely on physical laws 
and communication theory principles, and not on any 
specific characteristics of the human production and/or 
perception systems. The acoustic device is shown in 
Fig.1. It is a closed-open tube corresponding to the 
vocal folds at one end and to the lip opening at the 
other, respectively. Commands deform the area function 
of the acoustic tube consequently producing changes in 
the acoustic signal. These commands constitute our 
phonological repertoire and may be viewed as 
analogous to the 'gestures' proposed by Browman and 
Goldstein (1989).

The criteria used to build 
communication device are the following: 
? acoustic contrast: maximization of 
a 'good' 
the acoustic 
contrast of the sounds produced (1) in order to have 
a good signal-to-noise ratio. The spectral peaks 
(formants) having maximum energy are retained as 
acoustic parameters; 
? least effort: this refers to the efficiency of the 
articulatory-acoustic relations (2) with monotonicity 
(3) and orthogonality (4) of the relations. The use of 
an efficiency criterion corresponds to increasing the 
role of the dynamics; 
? simplicity: with respect to the commands of the 
deformation of the acoustic tube, the commands 
must be simple J(5) (straight deformations), few in 
number (6), and with a reduced number of degrees (a) 
of constriction (7). This is based on the assumption 
that fewer commands make for smaller demands on 
memory resources (8) that may be engaged in the 
learning and eventual mastery of these commands in 
the phonological cquisition process. 
An algorithm to automatically and efficiently 
deform the area function of an acoustic tube in order to 
increase or decrease the frequency of a formant or 
combination of several formants has been proposed 
elsewhere Carr6 et  al. (1994; 1995). As an example, 
figure 2 shows the automatic evolution of the area (b) 
function of the tube from a closed-open neutral 
configuration, for increasing and decreasing F2. 
Four main regions naturally emerge which are 
not of equal length. The /a/ vowel is an automatic 
consequence of a back constriction associated with a 
front cavity, and, the/ i /vowel of a front constriction 
associated with a back cavity (anti-symmetrical 
behavior), a pharynx cavity, thus, being automatically 
obtained. If, however, the initial configuration is that of 
a tube closed at both ends (i.e. closed-closed) the/u/ (c) 
vowel is automaiicaUy obtained with a central 
constriction (symmetrical behavior). A summary of the 
main conclusions that may be drawn from the above 
manipulations are as following: 
? configurations using the maximum acoustic ontrast 
criterion correspond to those for the three vowels/a, 
i, u/of  the vowe\[ triangle; 
? the deformation of the tube is minimum, because of 
the use of the sensitivity function (Fant and Pauli, 
1974) and thus efficient; (d) 
? the deformation 'commands (or gestures) are simple 
(recti-linear), limited in number (only one in the case 
of figure 2, for the making of a back constriction is 
automatically as~sociated with a front cavity and 
vice-versa, as i 9 human), and applied at specific 
places called distinctive regions.

In summary, characteristics important and 
integral to a 'good' acoustic communication device 
were obtained when an acoustic tube underwent 
specific deformations. It is this type of tube, so- 
structured in regions, that forms the basis of the 
Distinctive Region Model (DRM) (Carr6 and Mrayati, 
1992; Mrayati, et al, 1988). Deformation gestures and 
efficient places of deformation (the regions) are thus 
deduced from acoustic theory. 
3 The Distinctive Region Model (DRM) 
The DRM model proposed in 1988 (Mrayati, et al, 
1988) is structured in regions, the limits of which 
correspond to the zero-crossings of the sensitivity 
function computed on a uniform closed-open tube 
(figure 3). 
The DRM is a 2-region model when only the 
first formant is controlled. It is a 4-region model when 
the first two formants (F~ and F2) are controlled (note 
that this 4-region structure is automatically obtained 
with a maximum acoustic contrast algorithm - see 
figure 2). It is an 8-region model when the first three 
formants (F~, F2, F3) are controlled. Thus, increased 
control of the number of formants entails an increase in 
complexity and topological accuracy. Varying the 
cross-sectional rea of any one region maximizes the 
formant frequency variations, with each binary 
combination of a positive or negative formant variation 
corresponding to a specific region. Thus, it is 
hypothesized that the regions of the model could 
represent the best places of articulation for vowels and 
consonants. 
Critics of this model, may claim that defining 
regions from the sensitivity functions for a uniform tube 
AF F~ would limit the functioning domain for small 
l perturbations. But synergetic ommand of the regions 
allows one to maintain monotonic formant variations as 
well as the region structure, as shown in figure 2.

sensitivity functions (central part). Corresponding

Figure 4. Vocal tract (from Perkell (1969)) and the 
eight regions of the model. 
Note that the region boundaries correspond to a 
percentage of the total length of the tube. Since the 
physical ength of the acoustic tube is around 19.5 cm 
for the vowel /u/ and 17.5 cm for the vowel /i/, the 
place of articulation would thus move according to the 
pronounced vowel. However, it is the 'effective' length 
that one must take into account ; for, in addition to the 
physical ength, Lp, effective length incorporates the 
length, Lr, which corresponds to the radiation effect. 
Now then, Lr is imore or less proportional to the lip 
opening. For the vowel/i/, Lr=2 cm, and for the vowel 
/u/, Lr=0 cm. Thus the effective length remains almost 
constant (Mrayat i, et al, 1990) and the places of 
articulation, fixe& with region 7 always corresponding 
to the teeth (figure 4). Region 8 (with the radiation 
effect) corresponds tothe lips, regions 3, 4, 5, 6 to the 
tongue, the region 1 to the larynx. Regions 2 and 7, of 
small ength, are acoustically unimportant. 
As such, a closed-open model may not be 
employed for an/u/production because the vocal tract 
is closed at the source and more or less closed at the 
lips. A closed-close.d model would be more convenient. 
The behavior of such a model is symmetrical, allowing 
for a central constriction to be automatically derived 
(Carr6 and Mrayati, 1992).

the central constriction. For consonant production, the 
8-region model is needed (taking into account he first 
three formants). Thus, prediction of consonant 
production requires amore complex model than that for 
the vowel production (insofar as the number of degrees 
of constriction is not taken into account). 
4 Vowel  p laces  o f  a r t i cu la t ion  
The DRM model with its places of articulation was 
used to produce vowels. For example, figure 6 shows 
the execution of a command (using a closed-open DRM 
model) to pass from a front constriction to a back 
constriction along with a labial command. The acoustic 
results of these commands are also shown in the FrFz 
plane. The positions of the vowels obtained with such a 
closed-open model are given. Thus, to produce vowels 
the first two formants appear to be sufficient, the third 
one either being deduced from the first two (Ladefoged 
and Harshman, 1979) or is a speaker specific 
characteristic (Boulogne, et al, 1973).

vowel production may be predicted with the 4-region 
model (taking into account he first two formants). The

The consequences of a change from a closed- 
open to a closed-closed configuration of the DRM 
model have been studied elsewhere (for more details, 
see Carr6 and Mrayati (1995)). Intermediate places of 
articulation between central and back and central and 
front are obtained. This approach allows for a good 
prediction of vocalic systems (Cart6, 1996). 
5 Consonant places of articulation 
Figure 7 shows the formant variations associated with 
closing and opening of the eight regions of the DRM 
model with its uniform configuration. Using the places 
of articulation defined by this model (taking into 
account the first three formants), we were able to obtain 
the formant transitions measured by Ohman (1966) 
(Carri and Chennoukh, 1995). The use of the region 7 
gives rise to the production of consonants perceived as 
labial. Thus, the classification proposed by Mrayati et 
al. (1988, figure 18) has been revised. Considering the 
vowel/El as close to the neutral partly contributed to 
the misclassification. The patterns of Delattre (1955) 
corresponding to/EcE/where c is a plosive consonant 
are obtained by the model when only regions 5, 6 and 8 
are used. The regions 3 and 4 of the back part of the 
model correspond to the places of articulation of 
pharyngeal p osives (AI Dakkak, et al, 1994).

Figure 7. Variations of the first three formants

region. 
Since the regions of the DRM model can be 
obtained from the formant variations of a uniform tube 
and since these regions indeed correspond to the places 
of articulation, we may hypothesize the following: 
? the bursts (Blumstein and Stevens, 1979; Stevens 
and Blumstein, 1981) associated with the plosives 
are consequences of closure-opening actions. Indeed, 
it has beeen shown that if the bursts are important, 
they are not determinant for plosive identification i  
comparison with the formant transitions (Kewley- 
Port and Pisoni, 1983; Walley and Carrell, 1983). 
? the fricative consonants which are generally 
characterized by their noise sources and not by their 
forrnant ransitions have to be studied according to 
another criterion. 
? the third formant may be essential for differentiating 
certain consonants l ike/d/and/g/ ( the slopes of the 
first and second forrnant would not be sufficient). 
Indeed, it is noted in Harris et al (1958) that the 
consonant /d/ cannot be obtained in the vocalic 
context /i/ without the third formant. The authors 
concluded that << The effects of third formant cues 
are independent of the two-formant patterns to 
which they are added. When a third formant cue 
enhances the perception of a particular phoneme, it
typically does not do so equally at the expense of the 
other response alternatives >>. Similarly, in 
categorical perception experiments, Godfrey et al 
(1981) studied the boundary between/d /and/g /by  
changing the rate and direction of the third formant 
only, while the first two formants were changed for 
a/b/-/d/contrast. Additional experiments have to be 
undertaken tofurther explore this point. 
? the use of a uniform tube allowed for all 
combinations of formant variations (positive and 
negative), that form the basis of the DRM structure, 
to be revealed. Does this imply that perceptual 
identification is carried out with reference to a 
uniform state? This point is worth studying further. 
6 Conclusions 
The main places of articulation for vowels and plosive 
consonants can be predicted from a criterion of 
efficiency of articulatory-acoustic relations. For 
vowels, a 4-region model (taking into account he first 
two formants) is needed, and for the plosive 
consonants, an 8-region model (taking into account he 
first three formants). This has important implication for 
the role of complexity in the production of vowels 
versus consonants.

If the regions 5, 6, 8 are the best places for R. 
maximum formant variations (maximum dynamic 
acoustic contrast)fin the case of non-nasal closure- 
opening, how does: one explain the production of nasal 
consonant having the same places of articulation? For R. 
nasal consonants, !it is not evident hat the maximum 
dynamic ontrasts are preserved. Perhaps, simplicity of 
production (same iplaces of articulation) may be the 
criterion if the dynamic acoustic more important E. ? 
? I .  contrasts are sufficient? Additional experiments have to R. 
be undertaken to l know if this apparently optimal 
acoustic behavior: of the human speech apparatus 
represents adaptat!ons specialized for communication, 
i.e., is it a consequence of communication theory R. 
(ecological point of view) or is it just a coincidence? Is 
it that speech is just an overlaid function on a system 
designed primarily for feeding? The answer to this 
question will determine the importance and validity of 
our deductions. R. 
In summary, the DRM model uses as its basic 
elements, control commands, that allow one to deduce 
the places of articulation for vowels and consonants 
thereby uncovering the physical bases of phonological R. 
distinctions. Furthermore, speech synthesis using this 
model have yielded high quality results (Hill, et al, 
1995).
