0.i. As far as the present writer is aware, the Yu~o- 
s-~av Serbo-Croat/English Contrastive Analysis Project'is 
the first contrastlve analysis effort to use a large cor- 
pus of parallel texts. The corpus is made up of the Brown 
Corpus (reduced by 50%) with its Serbo-Croat translation, 
and a smaller Control Corpus (Serbo-Croat originals and 
English translation). A total, thus, of twice 500,000 
words plus twice 150,000 words, or a grand total of some 
1,300,000 words of running text. 
0.2. The Project, let us make it clear, is not exclu- 
sively based on this corpus. Compilation and confron- 
tation of grammatical statements by various authors, plus 
plain old intuition, figure prominently in the methodol- 
ogy. The insistence on a large corpus, however, is due to 
the conviction, prevailing among the Project workers, that 
only an extensive investigation of correspondences 
(original-language elements and their translations) can 
adequately reveal the less predictable patterns which ten~ 
to have a considerable contrastive analysis potential. 
0.21. The most productive method of obtaining correspon- 
dences from our corpus is to concordance separately its 
Serbo-Croat and English parts, then to merge the resulting 
KWIC concordances into a contrastive KWIC concordance 
(with English keywords and alternating English and Serbo- 
Croat lines). For the more promising patterns, the merging 
procedure will be used twice, with both English and Serbo- 
Croat keywords. 
0.22. In view of the size of the corpus, and the exten- 
sive concordancing required as a major procedure in the 
Project, the need for computer processing is obvious. It 
requires no undue strain on imagination to realize the 
soul-numbing effect of sheer physical handling of this 
mass of text if written out on slips. 
Even in its most efficient and flexible form of a 
manual concordance (a sentence-slip file with keywords 
underlined monolingually), without which no manual pairing 
of correspondences is possible, the manual handling of 
this 1,300,O00-word corpus calls for a staggering amount 
of time and effort to prepare. According to our careful 
estimate, a total of 7,100 man-hours is required to make 
such a concordance (without the 1,900 hours of transla- 
tion from English to Sarbo-Croat, and vice versa). 
0.23. The slip file thus obtained would, however, secure 
only a one-way approach: either from English or Serbo- 
Croat. A slip-file allowing a two-way approach would re- 
quire an additional effort of at least 4,500 man-hours. 
0.24. Finally, even these two manual concordances would 
still leave unfilled the need for reverse concordancing, 
go important for morphosyntactic research. To meet this 
need, two additional (though less ample) slip files would 
i~ave to be established. 
1.0____~. In view of all this, the Yugoslav Serbo-Croat/ 
English Contrastive Analysis Project has from the outset 
linked the planning of its work to the services of a local 
computer, the City of Zagreb IBM 360/30 machine~ 
1.1.._~. StaF.e 1 of computer processing. The tape with the 
full text of the Brown Corpus (purchased from Brown Uni- 
versity, ~rovidence, R.l., U.S.~.), which had been pre- 
pared on an IBM 7090 machine, had first to be converted 
from the density of 800 ~'I to 1,600 BPI, required by the 
Zagreb computer. 
1.?~__.._:_. After this, a printout Of the entire text was ob- 
tained on the Zagreb machine. The printing took about 
eight hours, with a special program~restructuring the 
original format of the Brown Corpus text. This program 
left out the location-marker column on the right-hand mar- 
gin of printout ~, and added a sequence of sentence numbers 
(from 00001 to 52533) on the left. 
1.12. The full text of the Brown Corpus was now reduced 
hy 50%, retaining, however, as closely as possible, the 
s~Lme proportions of the 15 genres (styles) contained in 
the Corpus. 
Printouts of the samples retained in this reduced 
version were then sent out to reliable translators, se- 
lected to be representative of the three major regional 
variants of Serbo-Croat (western, central and eastern). 
Their instructions were to translate at normal speed, and 
as carefully as when they do any other paid translation 
~or~. The only limitation imposed upon them was to observe 
the sentence limit in the original (English or, in the 
used for the preparation on the IBM 360/30 of a full for- 
w~rd EWIC concordance of the Serbo-Croat Corpus. 
~.~.  St~e 8. Using the same tape, we now plan to pro- 
~uc~e a reverse KWIC concordance of the Serbo-Croat text. 
Ibis concordance will be selective in the same sense that 
the English reverse concordance was (cf. Stage 4). 
Sta~e ~. With the normal and reverse KWIC concord- 
a~ce~ of both the English and Serbo-Croat corpora now ob- 
tained ~, we can move on to the final stage(s) of central 
importance to the ~roject, i.e. the merging of these mono- 
l ingual concordances to get contrastive concordances (cf. 
~ ). We have planned four such concordances, and have 
~'~empted to i l lustrate them here by short simulated sam- 
~es .  AS at the time of writ ing this no concordances of 
the Brown Corpus text (either original or translation) 
w~re available, the text used for these samples is the 
S~zbo-Croat original and its translation into English of 
the novel Povratak Filipa Latinovicz_a~ (The Return of 
ihi l ip Latinovicz) by the contemporary Croat writer Miro- 
~lav Krle~a.

Control Corpus, in Serbo-Croat). They were not to split 
the English sentence into two or more Serbo-Croat senten- 
ces, norwere  they allowed to combine two or more English 
sentences into one Serbo-Croat sentence. 
The reason for this was the need to secure a me- 
chanical palrin~ of the English (or Serbo-Croat) keyword~ 
marked by its sentence number, with the same-numbered, 
parallel, Serbo-Croat (or English) sentence in the two- 
language concordancing planned for the later Project 
stages. 
1.2..__~. Sta~e 2. A new magnetic tape will be prepared of 
the reduced Brown Corpus text, and with the sentence se- 
quence numbers interpolated. This version will be used 
for all subsequent concordancing. 
1.3. Sta~e 3. Using this magnetic tape, the IBM 360/30 
will new prepare a full forward EWIC concordance of the 
reduced Brown Corpus text~ 
1.4. ~ Now (while the reduced Brown Corpus is 
still being translated) we shall use the same tape to ob- 
tain a reverse EWIC concordance of the same text. S~nce 
all "function words" - such as of, had, most, those, did, 
etc. - were already isolated in '~he-~ev i -~ st~g-~-(in--the 
forward concordance)?this will further reduce the n~ass of 
text to be concordanced by one-half~ 
1.5. Sta~e 5. The Serbo-Croat trsnslation of the reduced 
Brown Corpus, by now in an advanced stsge, will be copied 
out on a Flexowriter in batches (as translators Rend in 
their typescripts), resulting in a paper tape. 
The same procedure can, at thiz stage, be applied 
to the 300,000 words of the Control Corpus. No time for 
translation has to be set spart here, since only already 
published English translations of Serbo-Croat originsls 
are to be used. 
1.6. Sta~e 6. Although the Serbo-Cro~t paper tapes ob- 
~-ned  in the preceding stage are immeg~ately computer- 
processable, we shell convert them to a magnetic tape, be- 
cause this medium secures an incomparably speedier proees- 
sing on the computer. 
1.61. We hope that stages 2 to 6 will not take more than 
twenty weeks (if enough personnel can be hired simulta- 
neously).

1.10. The reason why these four concordances have been 
presented under one processing stage (9) is that, first, 
~e are not sure whether we can afford the computer for 
each of them, and, second, we do not, at this point, know 
how selective each of them is going to be. A considerable 
reduction of the text to be concordanced can be achieved 
in reverse concordancing if we restrict ourselves only to 
word~, ending in a characteristic morpheme with clearly 
foreseeable contrastive analysis potential (such as -e._dd, 
-l_~! -est, -in/~, -ness, -less, etc. in English, and -ao, 
-vsl, -e--~n, -sc_..~u, -o-~, -~etc .  in Serbo-Croat). -- 
1.11. It may be pointed out here that, irrespective of 
how restrictive the selection of keywords for concordanc- 
?n~ may have to be, no concessions should be made in the 
principle of bilingual approach. Only if, in our investi- 
6ation of the contrastive potential of individual ele- 
ments, we strictly observe the approach from both the 
English and the Serbo-Croat texts, can we be certain that 
we shall hsve covered all possible contrastive description 
patterns based on correspondences in both corpora. 
2.0__._t. Once contrastive concordancing has been completed 
we shall still be facing some practical technical problems. 
2.1. Project analysts, for instance, will often have to 
be provided with slips instead of computer printout sheets. 
Only if the material being analyzed is in the form of 
slips will they be able to classify and reclassify the key 
elements swiftly and flexibly (by putting together, break- 
ing up and re-establishing batches of slips). 
2.11. Cutting up the concordance printouts to get the 
slips is not very practical in view of the varying size of 
contrasted pairs of elements with their context (cf. n. 9, 
second half). The way around this, clearly, is to have the 
pairs printed out at regular intervals with sufficient 
blank space in between. This, however, would probably 
triple the amount of printout paper required. Also, this 
is complicated further by the need for a number of copies 
for each pair (slip), because of simultaneous demands that 
may often be made upon the same slip by several Project 
analysts, approaching the same element from various des- 
criptive levels. These copies could be secured by using 
special, multiple-carbon printout paper, but this might 
prove quite expensive. 
2.2. In view of all this, the Yugoslav Serbo-Croat/ 
English Contrastive Analysis Project has envisaged the use 
of a Flexowriter here as an alternative method. This ma- 
chine has already provided us with the paper tape of the 
Serbo-Croat translation of the reduced Brown Corpus, plus 
the tapes of Serbo-Croat originals and English transla- 
tions of the Control Corpus (cf. Stage 5). The missing 
paper tape of the English text of the Brown Corpus can be 
obtained on a magtape-to-papertape converter. Once both 
paper tapes are ready, running them through the Flexo- 
writer provides us with up to 13 (some claim 20) carbons 
of each contrasted pair. An additional advantage of using 
the Flexowriter for slip duplication is in the less awk- 
ward shape of slips. Paper tapes reproduce the text in 
60-character-wide lines of the original translators' type- 
script, as opposed to the llO to 120-character streamers 
of normal computer printout (unless the concordance print- 
out was programmed for a narrower format, requiring con- 
siderably more paper). 
2.3. The resulting slip files of sentence-numbered 
English and Serbo-Croat texts, coupled with the Project's 
basic (monolingual - forward and reverse) concordances, 
can now be used as a replacement for contrastive concor- 
dances. It would work approximately like this: upon receiv- 
& 
ing an analyst's request for examples of all corresponden- 
ces in the corpus of an element under analysis, the Project 
headquarters in Zagreb would look the element up in one of 
the basic concordances, record semtence numbers of all the 
occurrences, extract slips bearing these numbers from the 
Flexowriter-produced slip file, and forward them to the 
analyst for further research.

in a different place: of under F, had under D, etc. 
7. ~uttimg the top lO0 words from the Brown Corpus Rank 
List on the exclusion list (compared to a total of some 
1SO "function words", in the present author's estimate), 
would reduce the text by 47.4 per cent, while including 
only one morphologically marked word (YEARS) and two 
lexical words (~iEW, TIME). Expanding the exclusion list 
to cover the top 200 words would probably not be econom- 
ical (though only two additional morphologically marked 
words would be included: UI~ITED and STATES), because 
the computer would be slowed down, whereas the textual 
8.

mass would be reduced by only 6 more per cent (to 53.6 
per cent. 
Which may take between 40 and 60 computer hours, as op- 
posed to an estimated 2,350 hours of manual processing 
(for only the English forward concordance at that). 
In addition to being simulations, all these concordance 
samples are in an idealized format, with the correspon- 
dences spatially parallel to the keyword. In practice, 
however, it is impossible to achieve this ideal textual 
parallelism, because there are no other formal signals 
to govern it, except the sentence sequence number which 
can only mark the sentence as a whole. 
For this reason, the actual computer concordances will, 
when ready, have the correspondence to the keyword 
printed out with the whole sentence in which it occurs, 
under the single line with the keyword. This will, natu- 
rally, increase the size of the concordance, but not 
more than about 50 per cent in our estimate. This is be- 
cause only an approximate 40 per cent of all sentences 
in the original text of the Brown Corpus are in excess 
of 20 words (which can be accommodated by the average 
printout line). A mere 6 per cent of these sentences 
are longer than 40 words, requiring, consequently, :.ore 
than two printout lines.
