Abstract 
Based on a lexicon of Portuguese MWE, this 
presentation focuses on an ongoing work that 
aims at the creation of a typology that de-
scribes these expressions taking into account 
their semantic, syntactic and pragmatic prop-
erties. We also plan to annotate each MWE-
entry in the mentioned lexicon according to 
the information obtained from that typology. 
Our objective is to create a valuable resource, 
which will allow for the automatic identifica-
tion MWE in running text and for a deeper 
understanding of these expressions in their 
context. 
1 Introduction 
As it is widely known, the lexicon does not consist 
mainly of simple lexical items but appears to be 
populated with numerous chunks, more or less 
predictable, though not fixed (Firth, 1955). In fact, 
the development of computer technologies and 
corpus-based approaches has enabled the identifi-
cation of complex patterns of word associations, 
proving that the speakers use a large number of 
preconstructed phrases that constitute single choic-
es (Sinclair, 1991:110). Several studies have also 
shown that great part of a speaker?s lexicon is 
composed by these word associations (Jackendoff, 
1997; Fellbaum, 1998). These multiword expres-
sions (MWE)1 appear in every kind of spoken and

 The term multiword expression will be used to refer to any 
sequence of words that act as a single unit, embracing all dif-
ferent types of word combinations (collocations, compound 
nouns, light verbs, institutionalized phrases, idioms, etc.). 
written discourse and, despite the fact that they 
don?t pose any problems from the speaker?s point 
of view (we easily recognize that they function as a 
single unit that may have a specific meaning), nat-
ural language processing (NLP) applications, on 
the other hand, find notorious difficulties when 
dealing with them (Sag et al, 2000). 
Bearing in mind the extreme importance of the 
study of this linguistic phenomenon for the im-
provement of NLP systems, this paper will address 
an ongoing analysis that aims to create a typology 
for MWE in Portuguese (based on a MWE lexicon 
previously extracted from a 50 million word writ-
ten corpus) that will be used to enrich that lexicon 
with extensive information regarding these expres-
sions. This annotated lexicon will be a resource 
that will allow for the annotation of these expres-
sions in running text (Hendrickx et al, 2010a). 
This presentation will briefly discuss compila-
tion of the lexicon and the methodology adopted 
for MWE selection and organization (section 2), 
the typology based on syntactic, semantic and sta-
tistic criteria (section 3), the annotation proposal of 
the lexicon (section 4) and applications of the work 
(section 5). 
2 MWE: Corpus and Lexicon 
The work we are going to present used the lexicon 
of word combinations2 that was created within the 
scope of the project COMBINA-PT ? Word Com-
binations in Portuguese Language3. The corpus 
used for their extraction was 50 million word writ-

 The MWE in the lexicon are organized in order 
to identify a main lemma (from which the MWE 
was selected) and a group lemma, which corre-
sponds to the canonical form of the MWE and 
covers all the variants that occurred in the corpus. 
Concordances lines for each MWE are also avail-
able in KIWIC format. Table 2 illustrates some 
MWE that were identified when analyzing the 
lemma fogo ?fire?.

 CRPC is a monitor corpus of 311 million words, constituted 
by sampling from several types of written and spoken text and 
comprising all the national and regional varieties of Portu-
guese (https://www.clul.ul.pt/en/research-teams/183-
reference-corpus-of-contemporary-portuguese-crpc). 
In all, the lexicon comprises 1.180 main lemmas, 
14.153 group lemmas and 48.154 word combina-
tions. 
 Mendes et al (2006) describe the criteria used 
for MWE selection: following the results of previ-
ous studies (Evert and Krenn, 2001; Pereira and 
Mendes, 2002), the authors first selected groups 
with MI5 values between 8 and 10, and, throughout 
manual validation, applied several criteria upon 
which usually relies the definition of a MWE: 
a) lexical and syntactic fixedness that can be ob-
served through the possibility of replacing ele-
ments, inserting modifiers, changing the 
syntagmatic structure or gender/number features; 
b) total or partial loss of compositional meaning, 
which means that the meaning of the expressions 
can not be predicted by the meaning of the parts; 
c) frequency of occurrence, which means that the 
expressions may be semantically compositional but 
occur with high frequency, revealing sets of fa-
voured co-occurring forms, which could tell that 
they may be in their way to a possible fixedness. 
3 Data Analysis: Towards a Typology 
In contrast to languages for which there is a wide 
range of studies regarding MWE both from a lin-
guistic and a computational point of view, for Por-
tuguese little work has been done so far. Great part 
of the existing studies had paid more attention to 
idiomatic expressions and compound nouns in 
general, relegating the analysis of other types of 
expressions to the morphossyntactic properties of 
its elements (Mac?rio Lopes, 1992; Chacoto, 1994; 
Baptista, 1994; Vilela, 2002; Ranchhod, 2003)6. 
Considering the existence of different types of 
MWE with different degrees of syntactic and se-
mantic cohesion, our analysis tries to categorize 
these expressions taking into account their lexical, 
syntactic, semantic and pragmatic properties. Thus, 
from a semantic standpoint, three major classes 
were considered: (i) expressions with composition-
al meaning (p?o de centeio ?rye bread?); (ii) ex-
pressions with partial idiomatic meaning, i.e., at 
least one of the elements keeps its literal meaning

 Some research has been carried out regarding the identifica-
tion and annotation of Complex Predicates, usually called in 
the literature Light Verb Constructions or Support Verb Con-
structions (Hendrickx et al, 2010b; Duran et al, 2011; Zeller 
and Pad?, 2012). 
88
(vontade de ferro ?iron will?); (iii) expressions with 
total idiomatic meaning (p?s de galinha ?crow?s 
feet?). 
 Note, however, that one may find notorious dif-
ficulties regarding the evaluation of the meaning of 
certain expressions that seems to be linked to two 
major factors: (i) the polysemous nature of the 
words (it is necessary to establish a boundary be-
tween compositional and figurative meanings. If 
we consider the literal meaning to be the first pro-
totypical meaning of a word, this restrictive defini-
tion will trigger us to consider a large number of 
MWE as idiomatic); (ii) the awareness of the se-
mantic motivation that had led to the idiomatic 
meanings, which depends on cultural and social 
factors. 
 This semantic criterion implies that the same 
type of MWE may occur in different classes. It is 
the case with compound nouns. Although we tried 
to accentuate the different degrees of lexicalization 
of this type of expressions, we are acutely aware 
that drawing this dividing line neither is easy nor 
allows for accurate definitions and divisions. 
 Within each of these three semantic categories, 
the expressions are also analyzed according to their 
grammatical category and lexical and syntactic 
fixedness. Regarding the latest aspect, the expres-
sions may be: (i) fixed (no variation); (ii) semi-
fixed (nominal/verbal inflection)7; (iii) with varia-
tion: lexical (permutation, replacement of ele-
ments, insertion of modifiers) and/or syntactic 
(constructions with passives, relatives, pronouns, 
extraction, adjectival vs. prepositional modifiers). 
 Our typology relies, then, on several categories, 
some of which we will briefly present. 
 
Expressions with Compositional Meaning 
 Favoured co-occurring forms ? expressions that 
occurred with high frequency in the corpus, reveal-
ing a tendency to co-occur in certain contexts (p?o 
seco ?dry bread?, desvendar o mist?rio ?unravel the 
mystery?). Expressions with full lexical and syn-
tactic variation8. 
 Compound nouns ? expressions that represent a 
single concept (noite de n?pcias ?wedding night?, 
cama de casal ?double bed?, cavalo alaz?o9 ?chest-
nut horse?, Idade do Ferro ?Iron Age?). Usually, 
                                                          
7
 Since Portuguese is a highly inflectional language, practical-
ly all the verbs and nouns that occur in MWE inflect. 
8
 More examples of variation will be included in Section 4. 
9
 ?Lexikalische Solidarit?ten? (Coseriu, 1967). 
these expressions are semi-fixed. However, we 
also observed that some combinations may occur 
in a small distributional paradigm (cama de 
solteiro ?single bed?) that allows for predicative 
constructions (a cama ? de solteiro lit. ?the bed is 
single?). Entities are fixed. 
 Institutionalized expressions ? expressions ob-
served with higher frequency than any alternative 
lexicalization of the same concept (lufada de ar 
fresco ?breath of fresh air?, condenar ao fracasso 
?doomed to failure?, abrir um precedente ?set a 
precedent?). Apart from inflection, since there are 
alternative expressions, we also observed lexical 
variation, such as substitution (rajada de ar fresco 
?rush of fresh air?), insertion of modifiers 
(condenar este projecto ao fracasso lit. ?to doom 
this project to failure?) and change in the syntag-
matic structure (o precedente foi aberto ?a prece-
dent has been set?, abertura de um precedente lit. 
?the opening of a precedent?). 
 Ligh verb constructions ? expressions where 
the noun is used in a normal sense and the verb 
meaning appears to be bleached (dar um passeio 
?take a walk?). Expressions with lexical and syn-
tactic variation (substitution, insertion of modifi-
ers, change in the syntagmatic structure). 
 proverbs (no poupar ? que est? o ganho ?profit 
is in saving?). Despite our conception of proverbs 
as frozen expressions, the fact is that speakers? lex-
ical creativity may result in the production of ex-
pressions such as no 
anunciar/atacar/descontar/esperar/comparar ? 
que est? o ganho ?profit is in announc-
ing/attacking/discounting/waiting/comparing?. 
 
Expressions with Partial Idiomatic Meaning 
 Expressions with an additional meaning that 
can not be derived from the meaning of its parts10, 
(cintur?o negro ?black belt? + martial arts expert, 
abrir a boca ?open the mouth? + to speak/to yawn, 
deitar as m?os ? cabe?a lit. ?throw the hands in the 
head? (throw one?s hands up) + despair). Nominal 
expressions are semi-fixed while verbal expres-
sions may undergo inflection and lexical variation, 
such as substitution (levar/lan?ar as m?os ? 
cabe?a lit. ?put/lay the hands in the head?) and in-
sertion of modifiers (deitou logo as m?os ? cabe?a 
lit. ?put immediately his hands in his head?). 
                                                          
10
 Quasi-phrasemes or quasi-idioms (Mel?cuk, 1998). 
89
 Compound nouns: (i) the meaning does not oc-
cur in any other combination (sorriso amarelo lit. 
?yellow smile? ? yellow = wry); (ii) the meaning 
may occur in different combinations (caf? fresco 
?fresh coffe?, p?o fresco ?fresh bread? ? fresh = 
recent); (iii) periphrastic nouns11 (continente negro 
?black continent? = Africa); (iv) entities (dama de 
ferro ?iron lady?). Apart from inflection, some ex-
pressions are subject to lexical and syntactic varia-
tion, namely insertion of modifiers (sorriso muito 
amarelo lit. ?smile very yellow?), alternation be-
tween simple elements and elements with suffixes 
(sorrisinho amarelo lit. ?little yellow smile?) and 
alternation between adjectival and prepositional 
modifiers (sil?ncio mortal ?deadly silence?, 
sil?ncio de morte ?silence of death?). Entities are 
fixed. 
 
Expressions with Total Idiomatic Meaning 
 Expressions transposed to another semantic 
field by metaphoric process (balde de ?gua fria 
?cold shower?, faca de dois gumes ?double-edge 
knife?, esticar o pernil ?kick the bucket?, deitar 
?gua na fervura ?pour oil on troubled waters?, a 
sangue frio ?in cold blood?). Adverbial expressions 
are fixed. Some of the nominal and verbal struc-
tures may undergo lexical and syntactic variation, 
such as substitution (arma/espada/pau de dois 
gumes ?double-edge weapon/sword/stick?), inser-
tion of modifiers (deitar mais ?gua na fervura 
?pour more oil on troubled waters?), permutation 
(estar de m?os e p?s atados ?bound hand and foot?, 
estar de p?s e m?os atados ?bound foot and hand? 
(helpless)) and occurrence both in negative and 
affirmative sentences (ter olhos na cara lit. ?have 
eyes in the face? (put things in perspective), n?o ter 
olhos na cara lit. ?do not have eyes in the face?). 
 Compound nouns (flor de estufa ?greenhouse 
plant? (delicate person); m?o de ferro ?iron fist?). 
Apart from inflection, we observed alternation be-
tween simple elements and elements with suffixes. 
 Proverbs (gr?o a gr?o enche a galinha o papo 
lit. ?grain by grain the hen fills its belly? (little 
strokes fell great oaks)). As in compositional prov-
erbs, we also observed lexical variation (gr?o a 
gr?o enche muita gente o papo lit. ?grain by grain 
lots of people fill their bellies?). 
 
                                                          
11
 Cf. Sanrom?n, 2000. 
 In what idiomatic expressions are concerned, it 
is important to note the fact that the transposition 
of an expression to another semantic field is a syn-
chronic process that usually implies that at some 
point in time (including the present day) the ex-
pressions may simultaneously present composi-
tional and idiomatic meanings (porto de abrigo 
?harbor?; ?safe haven?). Curiously, from a statisti-
cal point of view, our study showed that the idio-
matic meaning is the one that usually presents high 
frequency of occurrence. This information, togeth-
er with the interpretation of the context, may help 
the automatic systems to decide whether they face 
a compositional or idiomatic expression. 
 In a sweeping look at the data, we observed that 
MWE show particular properties according to their 
syntactic pattern. Thus, at the sentence level (prov-
erbs and aphorisms), MWE usually do not accept 
syntactic changes (the possible change seems to be 
lexical, when speakers substitute one or more ele-
ments), while verb phrases admit much more 
morphossyntactic variation. Noun phrases, on the 
other hand, raise specific issues. Compositional 
groups can behave as idiomatic ones and it is not 
always easy to distinguish them. The modifiers of 
the noun can express different semantic relations 
(part of, made of, used for) that may interact with 
the meaning (literal or idiomatic) of the noun. 
4 Annotation of the Lexicon 
The information presented on our typology will 
allow us to enrich the lexicon mentioned in Section 
2. Our purpose is to have each MWE entry in the 
lexicon labeled regarding: (i) canonical form of the 
expression; (ii) definition of idiomatic expressions 
through synonyms or literal paraphrases; (iii) 
grammatical category of both the expression and 
its elements; (iv) idiomatic property and additional 
meanings; (v) possible variation; (vi) function of 
MWE parts (e.g., obligatory, optional, free). 
 As we have seen before, MWE have different 
types of variation for which we have to account 
for. We will briefly discuss our proposal for han-
dling the annotation of some cases of lexical and 
syntactic variation in the lexicon. 
 
Lexical Variation 
 Insertion of modifiers ? lexical elements (usual-
ly with an emphatic function) that do not belong to 
the canonical form are not part of the MWE and 
90
are not labeled (sorriso muito amarelo lit. ?smile 
very yellow?). 
 Lexical substitution ? This variation is restrict-
ed to limited set of alternatives. This set is record-
ed in the MWE lexicon as ?obligatory parts of the 
MWE and member of a set list? (com-
er/vender/comprar/impingir/levar gato por lebre 
lit. ?eat/sell/buy/impose/take a cat instead of a 
hare? (buy a pig in a poke)). 
 Free lexical elements ? These elements are 
marked in the lexicon with, e. g., a pronoun 
(ALGU?M ?someone?, ALGUM ?something?) or a 
particular phrase (NP, PP) (estar nas m?os de 
ALGU?M  ?to be in the hands of someone?). 
There are also cases where parts of the MWE may 
freely vary, while other parts remain fixed (a 
educa??o ? a m?e de todas as civiliza??es ?educa-
tion is the mother of all civilizations?, a liberdade ? 
a m?e de todas as virtudes ?liberty is the mother of 
all virtues?). These cases are treated likewise 
(ALGO ? a m?e de todas as NOUN-PL ?something 
is the mother of all NOUN-PL?) 
Also, since creative use of language can lead to 
MWEs that only partly match the canonical MWE 
(cf. proverbs), we label these parts as 'different 
from canonical form'. 
 
Syntactic Variation 
 Pronouns/Possessives ? These elements will be 
marked up as part of the MWE, but will have an 
additional label to signal that they are optional 
(estar nas m?os dele/estar nas suas m?os ?to be in 
the hands of him?/?to be in his hands?). 
 From active to passive voice ? Auxiliary verbs 
are not labeled as part of the MWE (passar ALGO 
a pente fino/ALGO foi passado a pente fino lit. 
?pass something with a fine tooth-
comb?/?something was passed with a fine tooth-
comb? (to scrutinize)). 
 
 According to Hendrickx et al (2010a), this an-
notated lexicon could be the basis for the annota-
tion of idiomatic MWE in running text12. Each 
MWE encountered in the corpus would be annotat-
ed with a link to the corresponding entry in the 
lexicon. Linking each MWE to its canonical form 
                                                          
12
 The authors? approach is to annotate CINTIL corpus, a 1M 
word corpus of both spoken and written data from different 
sources that has been previously annotated with linguistic 
information such as part-of-speech, lemma, inflection, proper 
names, etc. (http://cintil.ul.pt/pt/). 
would allow for an easier detection of all occur-
rences of one particular MWE and check its varia-
tion in the corpus. The annotation process would 
combine automatic retrieval with manual valida-
tion in order to better account for variable expres-
sions. Without doubt, the corpus would contain 
many MWE that were not yet listed in the lexicon. 
Therefore, each sentence would need to be checked 
manually for new MWE and the newly discovered 
expression would be manually added to the lexi-
con. 
5 Conclusion 
This paper has shown the ongoing research that 
aims to describe, as detailed as possible, the syn-
tactic and semantic properties of different types of 
Portuguese MWE. During our analysis, we en-
countered two major problems: (i) the evaluation 
of the meaning of certain expressions (composi-
tional or idiomatic); (ii) the attempt to account for 
all possible lexical and syntactic variation. The 
information obtained from the typology will be 
used to annotate a MWE lexicon. Having a re-
source with such information (that includes addi-
tional meanings, possible variation that accounts 
for obligatory and optional elements, etc.) will be 
of extreme value for the development and evalua-
tion of automatic MWE identification systems.
