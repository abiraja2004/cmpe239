Abstract
Multilingual Pseudo-Relevance Feedback
(MultiPRF) is a framework to improve
the PRF of a source language by taking
the help of another language called as-
sisting language. In this paper, we ex-
tend the MultiPRF framework to include
multiple assisting languages. We consider
three different configurations to incorpo-
rate multiple assisting languages - a) Par-
allel - all assisting languages combined
simultaneously b) Serial - assisting lan-
guages combined in sequence one after
another and c) Selective - dynamically se-
lecting the best feedback model for each
query. We study their effect on MultiPRF
performance. Results using multiple as-
sisting languages are mixed and it helps in
boosting MultiPRF accuracy only in some
cases. We also observe that MultiPRF be-
comes more robust with increase in num-
ber of assisting languages.
1 Introduction
Pseudo-Relevance Feedback (PRF) (Buckley et
al., 1994; Xu and Croft, 2000; Mitra et al, 1998)
is known to be an effective technique to im-
prove the effectiveness of Information Retrieval
(IR) systems. In PRF, the top ?k? documents
from the ranked list retrieved using the initial key-
word query are assumed to be relevant. Later,
these documents are used to refine the user query
and the final ranked list is obtained using the
above refined query. Although PRF has been
shown to improve retrieval, it suffers from the
following drawbacks: (a) Lexical and Semantic
Non-Inclusion: the type of term associations ob-
tained for query expansion is restricted to only
co-occurrence based relationships in the feedback
documents and (b) Lack of Robustness: due to
the inherent assumption in PRF, i.e., relevance
of top k documents, performance is sensitive to
that of the initial retrieval algorithm and as a re-
sult is not robust. Typically, larger coverage en-
sures higher proportion of relevant documents in
the top k retrieval (Hawking et al, 1999). How-
ever, some resource-constrained languages do not
have adequate information coverage in their own
language. For example, languages like Hungarian
and Finnish have meager online content in their
own languages.
Multilingual Pseudo-Relevance Feedback
(MultiPRF) (Chinnakotla et al, 2010a) is a
novel framework for PRF to overcome the above
limitations of PRF. It does so by taking the help of
a different language called the assisting language.
Thus, the performance of a resource-constrained
language could be improved by harnessing the
good coverage of another language. MulitiPRF
showed significant improvements on standard
CLEF collections (Braschler and Peters, 2004)
over state-of-art PRF system. On the web, each
language has its own exclusive topical coverage
besides sharing a large number of common topics
with other languages. For example, information
about Saudi Arabia government policies and
regulations is more likely to be found in Arabic
language web and also information about a local
event in Spain is more likely to be covered in
Spanish web than in English. Hence, using
multiple languages in conjunction is more likely
to ensure satisfaction of the user information need
and hence will be more robust.
In this paper, we extend the MultiPRF frame-
work to multiple assisting languages. We study
70
the various possible ways of combining the mod-
els learned from multiple assisting languages. We
propose three different configurations for includ-
ing multiple assisting languages in MultiPRF - a)
Parallel b) Serial and c) Selective. In Parallel com-
bination, all the assisting languages are combined
simultaneously using interpolation. In Serial con-
figuration, the assisting languages are applied in
sequence one after another and finally, in Selec-
tive configuration, the best feedback model is dy-
namically chosen for each query. We experiment
with each of the above configurations and present
both quantitative and qualitative analysis of the re-
sults. Results using multiple assisting languages
are mixed and it helps in boosting MultiPRF ac-
curacy only in some cases. We also observe that
MultiPRF becomes more robust with increase in
number of assisting languages. Besides, we also
study the relation between number of assisting
languages, coverage and the MultiPRF accuracy.
The paper is organized as follows: Section 2,
explains the Language Modeling (LM) based PRF
approach. Section 3, describes the MultiPRF ap-
proach. Section 4 explains the various configu-
rations to extend MultiPRF for multiple assisting
languages. Section 6 presents the results and dis-
cussions. Finally, Section 7 concludes the paper.
2 PRF in the LM Framework
The Language Modeling (LM) Framework allows
PRF to be modeled in a principled manner. In the
LM approach, documents and queries are mod-
eled using multinomial distribution over words
called document language model P (w|D) and
query language model P (w|?Q) respectively. For
a given query, the document language models are
ranked based on their proximity to the query lan-
guage model, measured using KL-Divergence.
KL(?Q||D) =
?
w
P (w|?Q) ? log
P (w|?Q)
P (w|D)
Since the query length is short, it is difficult to es-
timate ?Q accurately using the query alone. In
PRF, the top k documents obtained through the
initial ranking algorithm are assumed to be rele-
vant and used as feedback for improving the es-
timation of ?Q. The feedback documents con-
tain both relevant and noisy terms from which

the feedback language model is inferred based on
a Generative Mixture Model (Zhai and Lafferty,
2001).
Let DF = {d1, d2, . . . , dk} be the top k doc-
uments retrieved using the initial ranking algo-
rithm. Zhai and Lafferty (Zhai and Lafferty, 2001)
model the feedback document setDF as a mixture
of two distributions: (a) the feedback language
model and (b) the collection model P (w|C). The
feedback language model is inferred using the EM
Algorithm (Dempster et al, 1977), which itera-
tively accumulates probability mass on the most
distinguishing terms, i.e. terms which are more
frequent in the feedback document set than in the
entire collection. To maintain query focus the fi-
nal converged feedback model, ?F is interpolated
with the initial query model ?Q to obtain the final
query model ?Final.
?Final = (1? ?) ??Q + ? ??F
?Final is used to re-rank the corpus using the
KL-Divergence ranking function to obtain the fi-
nal ranked list of documents. Henceforth, we refer
to the above technique as Model Based Feedback
(MBF).
3 Multilingual Pseudo-Relevance
Feedback (MultiPRF)
Chinnakotla et al (Chinnakotla et al, 2010a;
Chinnakotla et al, 2010b) propose the MultiPRF
approach which overcomes the fundamental limi-
tations of PRF with the help of an assisting collec-
tion in a different language. Given a query Q in
the source language L1, it is automatically trans-
lated into the assisting language L2. The docu-
ments in the L2 collection are ranked using the
query likelihood ranking function (John Lafferty
and Chengxiang Zhai, 2003). Using the top k doc-
uments, they estimate the feedback model using
MBF as described in the previous section. Simi-
larly, they also estimate a feedback model using
71
the original query and the top k documents re-
trieved from the initial ranking in L1. Let the re-
sultant feedback models be ?FL2 and ?FL1 respec-tively. The feedback model estimated in the as-
sisting language ?FL2 is translated back into lan-guage L1 using a probabilistic bi-lingual dictio-
nary t(f |e) from L2 ? L1 as follows:
P (f |?TransL1 ) =
?
? e in L2
t(f |e) ? P (e|?FL2) (1)
The probabilistic bi-lingual dictionary t(f |e) is
learned from a parallel sentence-aligned corpora
in L1 ? L2 based on word level alignments. The
probabilistic bi-lingual dictionary acts as a rich
source of morphologically and semantically re-
lated feedback terms. Thus, the translation model
adds related terms in L1 which have their source
as the term from feedback model ?FL2 . The finalMultiPRF model is obtained by interpolating the
above translated feedback model with the original
query model and the feedback model of language
L1 as given below:
?MultiL1 = (1? ? ? ?) ??Q + ? ??FL1 + ? ??TransL1(2)
In order to retain the query focus during back
translation, the feedback model in L2 is interpo-
lated with the translated query before translation
of the L2 feedback model. The parameters ? and
? control the relative importance of the original
query model, feedback model of L1 and the trans-
lated feedback model obtained from L1 and are
tuned based on the choice of L1 and L2.
4 Extending MultiPRF to Multiple
Assisting Languages
In this section, we extend the MultiPRF model
described earlier to multiple assisting languages.
Since each language produces a different feed-
back model, there could be different ways of com-
bining these models as suggested below.
Parallel: One way is to include the new assist-
ing language model using one more interpo-
lation coefficient which gives the effect of us-
ing multiple assisting languages in parallel.
Serial: Alternately, we can have a serial combi-
nation wherein language L2 is first assisted

tem is used to assist the source language L1.
Selective: Finally, we can have selective assis-
tance wherein we dynamically select which
assisting language to use based on the input
query.
Below we describe each of these systems in detail.
4.1 Parallel Combination
The MultiPRF model as explained in section 3 in-
terpolates the query model of L1 with the MBF
of L1 and the translated feedback model of the
assisting language L2. The most natural exten-
sion to this approach is to translate the query into
multiple languages instead of a single language
and collect the feedback terms from the initial re-

trieval of each of these languages. The translated
feedback models resulting from each of these re-
trievals can then be interpolated to get the final
parallel MultiPRF model. Specifically, if L1 is the
source language and L2, L3, . . . Ln are assisting
languages then final parallel MultiPRF model can
be obtained by generalizing Equation 2 as shown
below:

The schematic representation of parallel combina-
tion is shown in Figure 1.
4.2 Serial Combination
Let L1 be the source language and let L2 and L3
be two assisting languages. A serial combination
can then be achieved by cascading two MultiPRF
systems as described below:
1. Construct a MultiPRF system with L2 as
the source language and L3 as the assist-
ing language. We call this system as L2L3-
MultiPRF system.
2. Next, construct a MultiPRF system with L1
as the source language and L2L3-MultiPRF
as the assisting system.
As compared to a single assistance system where
only L2 is used as the assisting language for
L1, here the performance of language L2 is first
boosted using L3 as the assisting language. This
boosted system is then used for assisting L1. Also
note that unlike parallel assistance here we do
not introduce an extra interpolation co-efficient in
the original MultiPRF model given in Equation 2.
The schematic representation of serial combina-
tion is shown in Figure 2.
4.3 Selective Assistance
We motivate selective assistance by posing the
following question: ?Given a source language
L1 and two assisting languages L2 and L3, is
it possible that L2 is ideal for assisting some
queries whereas L3 is ideal for assisting some
other queries?? For example, suppose L2 has a
rich collection of TOURISM documents whereas
L3 has a rich collection of HEALTH documents.
Now, given a query pertaining to TOURISM do-
main one might expect L2 to serve as a better as-
sisting language whereas given a query pertaining
to the HEALTH domain one might expect L3 to
serve as a better assisting language. This intuition
can be captured by suitably changing the interpo-
lation model as shown below:
?BestL = SelectBestModel(?
F
L ,?
Trans
L1 ,?
Trans
L2 ,?
Trans
L12 )
?MultiL1 = (1? ?) ??Q + ? ??
Best
L (4)
where, SelectBestModel() gives the best
model for a particular query using the algorithm
mentioned below which is based on minimizing
the query drift as described in (?):
1. Obtain the four feedback models, viz.,
?FL ,?TransL1 ,?
Trans
L2 ,?
Trans
L12
2. Build a language model (say, LM ) using
queryQ and top-100 documents of initial re-
trieval in language L.
3. Find the KL-Divergence between LM and
the four models obtained during step 1.
4. Select the model which has minimum KL-
Divergence score from LM . Call this model
?BestL .
5. Get the final model by interpolating the
query model, ?Q, with ?BestL .

5 Experimental Setup
We evaluate the performance of our system us-
ing the standard CLEF evaluation data in six lan-
guages, widely varying in their familial relation-
ships - Dutch, German, English, French, Spanish
and Finnish. The details of the collections and
their corresponding topics used for MultiPRF are
given in Table 2. Note that, in each experiment,
we choose assisting collections such that the top-
ics in the source language are covered in the as-
sisting collection so as to get meaningful feedback
terms. In all the topics, we only use the title field.
We ignore the topics which have no relevant docu-
ments as the true performance on those topics can-
not be evaluated.
We use the Terrier IR platform (Ounis et al,
2005) for indexing the documents. We perform
standard tokenization, stop word removal and
stemming. We use the Porter Stemmer for English
and the stemmers available through the Snowball
package for other languages. Other than these,
we do not perform any language-specific process-
ing on the languages. In case of French, since
some function words like l?, d? etc., occur as pre-
fixes to a word, we strip them off during index-
ing and query processing, since it significantly im-
proves the baseline performance. We use standard
evaluation measures like MAP, P@5 and P@10
for evaluation. Additionally, for assessing robust-
ness, we use the Geometric Mean Average Preci-
sion (GMAP) metric (Robertson, 2006) which is
also used in the TREC Robust Track (Voorhees,
2006). The probabilistic bi-lingual dictionary
used in MultiPRF was learnt automatically by run-
ning GIZA++: a word alignment tool (Och and
Ney, 2003) on a parallel sentence aligned corpora.
For all the above language pairs we used the Eu-
roparl Corpus (Philipp, 2005). We use Google
Translate as the query translation system as it has
been shown to perform well for the task (Wu et
al., 2008). We use two-stage Dirichlet smooth-
ing with the optimal parameters tuned based on
the collection (Zhai and Lafferty, 2004). We tune
the parameters of MBF, specifically ? and ?, and
choose the values which give the optimal perfor-
mance on a given collection. We observe that the
optimal parameters ? and ? are uniform across
collections and vary in the range 0.4-0.48. We

the results were almost equivalent to single as-
sisting language. As shown in Table ??, selec-
tive assistance does give decent improvements in
some language pairs. An interesting point to note
in selective assistance is that it helps languages
like Spanish whose monolingual performance and
document coverage are both high.
6.1 Qualitative Comparison of Feedback
Terms using Multiple Languages
In this section, we qualitatively compare the re-
sults of MultiPRF with two assisting languages
with that of MultiPRF with single assisting lan-
guage, based on the top feedback terms obtained
by each model. Specifically, in Table 5 we com-
pare the terms obtained by MultiPRF using (i)
Only L1 as assisting language, (ii) Only L2 as as-
sisting language and (iii) Both L1 and L2 as as-
sisting languages in a parallel combination. For
example, the first row in the above table shows
the terms obtained by each model for the En-
glish query ?Golden Globes 1994?. Here, L1 is
French and L2 is Spanish. Terms like ?Gold?
and ?Prize? appearing in the translated feedback
model of L1 cause a drift in the topic towards
?Gold Prize? resulting in a lower MAP score
(0.33). Similarly, the terms like ?forrest? and
?spielberg? appearing in the translated feedback
model of L2 cause a drift in topic towards For-
rest Gump and Spielberg Oscars resulting in a
MAP score (0.5). However, when the models
from two languages are combined, terms which
cause a topic drift get ranked lower and as a result
the focus of the query is wrenched back. A sim-
ilar observation was made for the English query
?Damages in Ozone Layer? using French (L1)
and Spanish (L2) as assisting languages. Here,
terms from the translated feedback model of L1
cause a drift in topic towards ?militri bacteria?
whereas the terms from the translated feedback
model of L2 cause a drift in topic towards ?iraq
war?. However, in the combined model these
terms get lower rank there by bringing back the
focus of the query. For the Finnish query ?Lasten
oikeudet? (Children?s Rights), in German (L1),
the topic drift is introduced by terms like ?las,
gram, yhteis?. In case of Dutch (L2), the query
drift is caused by ?mandy, richard, slovakia? (L2)
and in the case of combined model, these terms
get less weightage and the relevant terms like
?laps, oikeuks, vanhemp? which are common in
both models, receive higher weightage causing an
improvement in query performance.
Next, we look at a few negative examples where
the parallel combination actually performs poorer
than the individual models. This happens when
some drift-terms (i.e., terms which can cause
topic drift) get mutually reinforced by both the
models. For example, for the German query
?Konkurs der Baring-Bank? (Bankruptcy of Bar-
ing Bank) the term ?share market? which was ac-
tually ranked lower in the individual models gets
boosted in the combined model resulting in a drift
in topic. Similarly, for the German query ?Ehren-
Oscar fu?r italienische Regisseure? (Honorary Os-
car for Italian directors) the term ?head office?
which was actually ranked lower in the individual
models gets ranked higher in the combined model
due to mutual reinforcement resulting in a topic
drift.

Table 5: Qualitative Comparison of MultiPRF Results using two assisting languages with single assisting language.
6.2 Effect of Coverage on MultiPRF
Accuracy
A study of the results obtained for MultiPRF using
single assisting language and multiple assisting
languages with different source languages showed
that certain languages are more suited to be ben-
efited by assisting languages. In particular, lan-
guages having smaller collections are more likely
to be benefited if assisted by a language having a
larger collection size. For example, Finnish which
has the smallest collection (55344 documents)
showed maximum improvement when supported
by assisting language(s). Based on this observa-
tion, we plotted a graph of the collection size of a
source language v/s the average improvement ob-
tained by using two assisting languages to see if
their exists a correlation between these two fac-
tors. As shown in Figure 3, there indeed exists a
high correlation between these two entities. At
one extreme, we have a language like Spanish
which has the largest collection (454045 docu-
ments) and is not benefited much by assisting lan-
guages. On the other extreme, we have Finnish
which has the smallest collection size and is ben-
efited most by assisting languages.

6.3 Effect of Number of Assisting Languages
on MultiPRF Accuracy
Another interesting question which needs to be
addressed is ?Whether it helps to use more than
two assisting languages?? and if so ?Is there an
optimum number of assisting languages beyond
which there will be no improvement??. To an-
swer these questions, we performed experiments
using 1-4 assisting languages with each source
language. As seen in Figure 4, in general as the
number of assisting languages increases the per-
formance saturates (typically after 3 languages).
Thus, for 5 out of the 6 source languages, the per-
formance saturates after 3 languages which is in
line with what we would intuitively expect. How-
ever, in the case of German, on an average, the

performance drops as the number of assisting lan-
guages is increased. This drop is counter intuitive
and needs further investigation.
6.4 Effect of Number of Assisting Languages
on Robustness
One of the primary motivations for including mul-
tiple assisting languages in MultiPRF was to in-
crease the robustness of retrieval through better
coverage. We varied the number of assisting lan-
guages for each source and studied the average
GMAP. The results are shown in Figure 5. We
observe that in almost all the source languages,
the GMAP value increases with number of assist-
ing languages and then reaches a saturation after
reaching three languages.
7 Conclusion
In this paper, we extended the MultiPRF frame-
work to multiple assisting languages. We pre-
sented three different configurations for including
multiple assisting languages - a) Parallel b) Serial
and c) Selective. We observe that the results are
mixed with parallel and selective assistance show-
ing improvements in some cases. We also observe
that the robustness of MultiPRF increases with
number of assisting languages. We analyzed the
influence of coverage of MultiPRF accuracy and
observed that it is inversely correlated. Finally,
increasing the number of assisting languages in-
creases the MultiPRF accuracy to some extent and
then it saturates beyond that limit. Many of the
above results (negative results of serial, selective
configurations etc.) require deeper investigation
which we plan to take up in future.
