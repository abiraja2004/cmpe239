Reference in multimodal input Human-Computer Interaction has already been studied in several experiments 
involving either simulated or implemented systems (Mignot and Carbonell 96, Huls and Bos 95) including 
cartographic application (Siroux et al 95, Cheyer and Julia 95, Oviatt 96). In this paper, we present our project 
named CARTOON (CARTography and cOOperatioN between modalities): we describe the current prototype but 
also how we plan to integrate tools providing linguistic analysis. 
1. THE CURRENT PROTOTYPE 
The current prototype enables to combine 
speech recognition, mouse pointing and 
keyboard to interact with a cartographical 
database (figure 1). Several functions are 
available such as requesting information on the 
name or location of a building, the shortest 
itinerary and the distance between two points, 
or zooming in and out. Several combinations 
are possible such as : 
? What is the name of this <pointing> 
building ? 
? What is this <pointing> ? 
? Where is the police station ? 
? Show me the hospital 
? I want to go from here <pointing> to the 
hospital Figure 1: Events detected on the three modalities (speech, 
? I am in front of the police station. How can mouse, keyboard) are displayed in the lower window as a 
I go here <pointing> ? function of time. The recognized words were: '7 want to go", 
? Show me how to go from here <pointing> "here", "here". Two mouse clicks were also detected. The 
to here <pointing>. system displayed the corresponding itinerary. 
Currently, there is no linguistic analysis. 
Events produced by the speech recognition 
system (a Vecsys Datavox) are either words or 
sequences of words ("I_want_to_go"). There 
are 38 such speech events which are 
characterized by: the recognized word, the 
time of utterance and the recognition score. 
The pointing gestures events are characterized 
by an (x, y) position and the time of detection. 
The overall architecture is described in figure 
2 : events detected on the keyboard, mouse and 
speech modalities (left-hand side) are time- 
stamped coherently by a modality server and 
then integrated in the multimodal which 
merges them and activates the application. Figure 2: current software and hardware architecture. 
The multimodal interface is based on a theoretical framework of ~ types of cooperation between modalities ~ that 
we initially presented in (Martin and B&oule 93) and that has been used by other French researchers in (Catinis 
and Caelen 95, Coutaz and Nigay 94). Our framework proposes six basic types of cooperation between 
modalities (either input or output): 
? transfer : the result of one modality is used by another modality 
? specialization : a modality is devoted to the transmission of the same type of information 
? equivalence : choice between several modalities for the transmission of a given piece of information 
? redundancy : the same piece of information is transmitted in several modalities 
? complementarity : pieces of information regarding the same command are transmitted on several modalities 
? concurrency : parallel transmission of independent information in several modalities

The combination of modalities are described in a specification language that is based on the theoretical 
framework. Three criteria of fusion are available for redundancy and complementarity: emporal coincidence, 
sequence and structural completion. The multimodal module uses Guided Propagation Networks (B&oule 1985) 
which provide what we call << multimodal recognition scores ~ incorporating the score provided by the speech 
recognizer. In the case of missing events, several commands may be activated with different recognition scores. 
The command with the highest score is selected by the system and may prompt he user for information if needed. 
More details on this multimodal framework and module can be found in (Martin et al 95). 
2. Linguistic analysis 
The multimodal module of the current prototype does not feature 
either any syntactic or semantic analysis. In the next prototype, this 
will be handled by a linguistic software engineering environment 
developed by the Language and Cognition group of LIMSI. The 
syntactic analysis, based on a chart parser uses a LFG grammar for 
French, and the semantic analysis is based on conceptual graphs. A 
chart is a graph whose nodes are positioned between the words of the 
sentence to be parsed (figure 3). They contain two types of arcs: 
active arcs (which represent beginnings of a syntactic structure) and 
completed arcs (which represent a whole syntactic structure). A great 
interest of the Chart is that it gives not only a trace of the rules 
applied while parsing a sentence, but also the possibility of analyzing 
in details the structures build at various levels which can be useful 
for interacting with the multimodal module. The current grammar 
contains about 225 rules of French simple sentences. In addition to 
these simple sentences, difficult problems are also handled: clitics, 
complex determiners, completives, various forms of questions, 
extraction and non limited dependancies, coordinations, 
comparatives. Some extensions are currently under development: 
negation, support verbs, circonstant subordinate phrases, ellipses. 
More details on these linguistic tools can be found in (Vapillon et al 
97). Figure 3: A chart resulting of the analysis 
of ~ l ara going in front of the Town Hall ~. 
3. Towards integration of multimodal and linguistic analysis 
Working with two specialized modules allows us to take advantages of each of them. The linguistic module 
provides a detailed linguistic analysis. Both modules may work in parallel but have to exchange results. For 
instance, the multimodal module may send to the linguistic module partial results (activation of multimodal units 
representing hypothesis on the types of cooperation between modalities). These pieces of information may allow 
the linguistic module to drop early (or on the other way confirm some hypothesis). Symmetrically, the results of 
the linguistic module (parts of charts and conceptual graphs) may be used by the multimodal module as events of 
a higher level of abstraction. Future directions also include extending estures to circling and trajectory gestures 
on a tactile screen, implementing dialog history and studying how the linguistic tools cop with spontaneous 
spoken language. Finally, experimental studies need to be put into place to evaluate the cooperation between 
speech and gestures that are used by the subjects when interacting with a map.
