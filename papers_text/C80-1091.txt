A MATHEMATICAL MODEL OF THE VOCABULARY-TEXT RELATION 
JuhanTuldava 
Tartu, Estonia, USSR 
A new method for calculating vo- 
cabulary size as a function of text 
length is discussed. The vocabulary 
growth is treated as a probabilistic 
process governed by the principle of 
"the restriction of variety" of lex- 
ics. Proceeding from the basic model 
of the vocabulary-text relation a 
formula with good descriptive power 
is constructed. The statistical fit 
and the possibilities of extrapola- 
tion beyond the limits of observable 
data are illustrated on the material 
of several languages belonging to dif- 
ferent typological groups. 
by deducing the relation between V and 
N from some other important quantita- 
tive characteristics of text such as 
Zipf's law and Yule's distribution 
(Kalinin, Orlov) 3. The author under- 
lines the importance of these concep- 
tions for the theory of quantitative 
linguistics on the whole, but points 
out their insufficiency in solving 
some practical linguo-statistical 
problems where greater exactness and 
reliability are needed (style-statis- 
tical analysis, text attribution, ex- 
trapolation beyond the limits of ob- 
servable data, etc.). 
i. There are a great number of at- 
tempts to construct an appropriate 
mathematical model which would ex- 
press the dependence of the size of 
the size of vocabulary (V) on the size 
of text (N). This is not only of 
practical importance for the resolu- 
tion of a series of problems in the 
automatic processing of texts, but i t  
is also connected with the theoreti- 
cal explanation of some important as- 
pects of text generation. In practice 
one often makes use of various empir- 
ical formulae which describe the 
growth of vocabulary with sufficient 
precision in the case of concrete 
texts and languages l, though such for- 
mulae do not have any general signif- 
icance. Of special interest are some 
"complex" models derived from theo- 
retical considerations, e.g., by bas- 
ing one*s considerations on the hypo- 
thesis about the lognormal distribu- 
tion of words in a text (Carroll) 2 or 
2. Instead of the "complex" mode/s 
a "direct" method is proposed where 
the relation between V and N is re- 
garded as the primary component with 
its own immanent properties in the 
statistical organization of text. The 
relation between V and N has to be 
analyzed ua the background of some es- 
sential inner factors of text genera- 
tion. The dynamics of vocabulary 
growth is considered as the result of 
the interaction of several linguistic 
and extra, linguistic factors which in 
an integral way are governed by the 
principle of "the restriction of va- 
riety" of lexics (an analogue of the 
principle of the decrease of entropy 
in self-regulating systems). The con- 
cept of the variety of lexics is de- 
fined as the relation between the size 
of vocabulary and the size of text in 
the form of V/N (type-token ratio, or 
coefficient of variety) or N/V (aver- 
age frequency of word occurrences). 
--600-- 
The coefficient of variety is sup- 
posed to be correlated with the prob- 
abilistic process of choosing "new" 
(unused) and "old" (already used in 
the text) words at each stage of text 
generation. The steady decrease of the 
degree of variety V/N = p is attended 
by the increase of its counterpart: 
(N -V) /N-  I -V /N= q (p, q -  1), 
which can be interpreted as the "pres- 
sure of recurrency" of words in real 
texts (analogous to the concept of re- 
dundancy in the theory of informa- 
tion) : 
~ I 
N- V 
3. The formulae of the relation between 
V and N are constructed from the basic 
models: V = Np or V = N(1 - q). 
For this purpose the quantitative 
changes of V/N = p depending on the 
size of text are analyzed. According 
to the initial hypothesis the rela- 
tion between V/N and N is approxi- 
mated by the power function of the 
type: V/N = aN B (a and B are con- 
stants; B < O), which leads to the 
well-known formula of G. Herdan@: 
V = aN b (where b = B + 1). A verifi- 
cation shows good agreement with em- 
pirical data in the initial stages 
of text formation (in the limits of 
about ~,OOr~ - 5,000 tokens which cor- 
respond to a short communication). 
Later on the rate of the diminishing 
of the degree of variety (V/N) grad- 
ually slows down (due to the rise of 
new themes in the course of text gen- 
eration). Accordingly the initial 
formula has to be modified and this 
can be done by logarithmization of 
the variables. The first attempt gives 
us in (V/N) = aN B, which leads to 
some variants of the Weibull distri- 
bution. This kind of distribution 
shows good agreement with the empir- 
ical data within the boundaries of a 
text of medium length, but it is not 
good for extrapolation. Only after 
balancing the initial formula by the 
logarithmization of both variables we 
obtain in (V/N) = a(ln N) B and the 
corresponding formula for expressing 
the relation between V and N: 
V = Ne -a(ln N) B 
or V = N I - a(ln N)b (where b = 
= B - l) p, which turns out to be the 
most adequate formula for solving our 
problems. The constants a and B 
(which, of course, are not identical 
with those of the previously mention- 
ed formulae) may be determined on the 
basis of linearization: lnln (N/V) = 
= A + B luln N, where A = In a, using 
the method of least squares. In prin- 
ciple it would be sufficient to have 
two empirical points for the calcula- 
tion of the values of the constants 
but for greater reliability more 
points are needed. 
4. The good descriptive power of 
the given function and the possibill- 
601 
ties of extrapolation in both direc- 
tions (from the beginning up to a text 
of about N = lO 7) has been verified on 
the basis of experimental material 
taken from several languages belonging 
to different typological groups (Esto- 
nian, Kazakh, Latvian, Russian, Po- 
lish, Czech, Rumanian, English). The 
function may be applied to the analy- 
sis of individual texts as well as 
composite homogeneous (similar) texts 
and the size of vocabulary (V) may be 
determined by counting either word 
forms of lexemes. (See Tables 1 and 2.) 
This seems to corroborate the assump- 
tion about the existence of a univer- 
sal law (presumably of phylogenetic 
origin) which governs the process of 
text formation on the quantitative 
level.
