ABSTRACT 
In optical character recognition and coni.in- 
uous speech recognition of a natural anguage, 
it has been diflicult to detect error characters 
which are wrongly deleted and inserted. \]n <>r- 
der to judge three types of the errors, which 
are characters wrongly substituted, deleted or 
inserted in a Japanese "bunsetsu" and an l';n- 
glish word, and to correct these errors, this 
paper proposes new methods using rn-th or- 
der Markov chain model for Japanese "l~anji- 
kana" characters and Fmglish alphabets, as- 
suming that Markov l)robability of a correct 
chain of syllables or "kanji-kana" characters i
greater than that of erroneous chains. 
From the results of the experiments, it is 
concluded that the methods is usefld for de- 
tecting as well as correcting these errors in 
Japanese "bunsetsu" and English words. 
Key  words: Markov model, error detection, 
error correction, bunsetsu, substitution, dele- 
tion, insertion 
1 In t roduct ion  
In order to improve the man-machine in- 
terface with computers, the <tevelopment of
input devices such as optical cha.racter tea<l- 
ets (OCR) or speech recognition devices are 
expected, llowew;r, it is not easy to input 
Japanese sentences J)y these devices, because. 
they are written by many kinds of charac- 
ters, especially thousands of "kanji" charac- 
ters. The sentences input through an OCR. 
or a speech recognition device usuMly contain 
erroneous character strings. 
The techniques of natural anguage process- 
ing are expected to find and correct these er- 
rors. tIowever, since current technologies of 
natural language analysis have been developed 
for correct sentences, they cannot directly be 
applied to these problems. Up to now, statis- 
tical approaches have been made to this prob- 
lem. 
Markov mo<lels are considered to be one 
of" machine learning models, sinfilar to neural 
networks a.nd fuzzy models. They have been 
applied to character chains of natural lan- 
g,,a~ges (e.g.,l);nglish)\[l\],\[2\], a.nd to phoneme

restricted to tind and correct the first type of 
errors\[5\],\[6\]. No method has been proposed for 
correcting errors of the second and the. third 
types. 'Phe. rea.son might be considered to be 
I.he di\[ticulties of finding the error location and

On the other hand, contextual algorithm

a dictionary look-ul) algorithm\[10\] have been 
discussed to detect a.nd correct erroneous char- 
acters in English sentences, which is seg- 
mented into words. 
This paper proposes new methods, which 
are able to be applied to a nor>segmented 
chains or" characters, to judge three types of 
the errors, which are characters wrongly sub- 
st.ituted, deleted a.nd inserted in a Japanese 
"bunsetsu", and to correct these errors in 
Japanese "kanji-l<ana" chains using m-th o f  
der Markov chain model. The methods are 
based on the idea about the relation between 
the types of errors and the length of a chain 
in which the wdnes of Markov joint probability 
remain small, l,'urthermore, this method is ap- 
187 
plied to detect and correct errors in segmented 
English words? 
Experiments were conducted for the case of 
2nd-order and 3rd-order Markov model, and 
they were applied to Japanese and English 
newspaper arhcles. Relevance Factor 1 and 
"Reeall Factor" R for erroneous characters de- 
tected and corrected by this method were ex- 
perimentally evaluated using statistical data 
for 70 issues of a daily Japanese newspaper 
and 5 issues of a daily English newspaper. 
2 Basic Def in i t ions and the 
Method  of Error Detect ion  
and Error Correct ion using 
2nd-Order  Markov Mode l  
2,1 Bas ic  Definit ions 
In this paper, two types of natural lan- 
guage's sentences are discussed. One is a 
Japanese sentence, which is non-segmented 
sentence and the other is an English sentence, 
which is segmented into words. 
A Japanese sentence can be separated into 
syntactic units called '%unsetsu", where a {~" ( "bunsetsu" is composed of one m lependent 
word" and ~ sequence of n (greater than equal 
to 0) "dependent words". 
A "bunsetsu" is a chain of Japanese "kanji- 
kana" characters or an English word is a chain 
of alphabets, and are represented by 3' = 
sl s2...s,~, where s~ is a "kanji-kana" character 
or an alphabet. In particular, a chain, 7 , is 
called a "J-bunsetsu" when all of its elements 
are "kanji-kana" characters, and is called a "\[iJ- 
word" when all of its elements are English al- 
phabets. The set of eorre, ct .lapanese "bun- 
setsu" or English words is represented by Pc. 
Three types of erroneous "J-bunsetsu" or 
E-word are dehned as follows: 
First, a chain ce = N,?~... s\[Zlg;..,  s,;~ is 
called a "(i,k)-Erroneous J-bunsetsu or E- 
word Wrongly Substituted " ( (i, k ) -EWS)  
if a subehain fl = t l tu . . .  Ih is wrongly sub- 
stituted at the location i of ce, that is  3 7 C- 
re ,  -y = ~(o11/< Here ~(Ollf3 donotes

tion i in a chain c~ , that is, d01i/  -

&," ' , tk  ~-- s iq~- , .  
Next, a chain c~ = &g.,.. .  si~_lgi . . .  s;,~ is 
called a "(i,k)-Erroneous J-bunsetsu or I';- 
word Wrongly Deleted" ( ( i ,~) -~WD)  if a 
subchMn fl = t~t=...tk is wrongly deleted at 
the location i of a, that is ~7 ~ l'c, "y = 
c~ (1) << ft. Here {,(0 << fl denotes insertion of a 
subchain fl at the location i in a chain c, , that 
is, a (0 << fl -- s't.sS"' Si~-l l t l2 "" " lk ,q i ' ' "  S~n. 
Finally, a chain cr = .?t ? "" s \ [ - lg i ""  si-(k-1 
s ;+k" '  s;,~ is also called "(i, k)-Erroneous J- 
bunsetsu or F~word Wrongly Inserted" ( 
( i , k ) -EWI )  if a sul)chain /3 = t l t~ . . . tk  is 
wrongly inserted at the location i of % that 
is 37 E Pc', 7 = d;)  >> ft. tIere c~ (1) >> fl

tion i in a chain c~ , that is, at0 >> fl = 
.?~'2 ' "s iZ ls i+~" 'sZ ,  and tl = g l , ' " , tk  = 
S i+k-1 .  
The set of (i ,k)-EWS, (i, k')-EWD and 
(i, k)-EWI are represented by P(~)s', P~) and 
17(1 ~) respectively. In this paper, all inputs 
"bunsetsn" or all inputs words to computers 
are assumed to belong to one of l-'c , p(k)s , P~) 
and 1'(1 k). 
Next, the meaning of detecting and cor- 
recting errors are define.d in the Nllowing. 
The words, "error detection problem", means 
the problem how to detect the location i of 
error in if, and "error correction problem" 
means the problem how to replace an erro- 
neous "d-bunsetsu" or an "E-word" ~v by a cor- 
rect "bunsetsu" or an English word 7, where 
s ,aEP  , o reeEP  aud ' rc ic .  
"Relevance Factor" p(D) and "Recall l)'ac- 
tor" R (D) for tile "error detection problem" is 
defined as follows: 
\]): p(D) at ( the number of "J-bunsetsu" or 2 ' '~ " t,. of the \],-word location i and length k 
error ill I '(k) p(k)  \]7,5k) .s' , "n  or is correctly detected 
q he total number of J-lmnsetsu or B- ) /  ,, . . ,,

"E-word").

error in P!s. ~), p(k) p~k) ~ D or is correctly detected 
) / ( the number of all "3-bunsetsu" or "E- 
wo,d" in t,,e set ) o,,  :'  )p,,epared in 
advance ). 
"Releva.nce factor" p(C) and "Recall factor" 
R (c) for the, "error correction problem" is also 
similarly defined. Here p}D) denotes the "Rel- 
evance Factor" for tile "error detection prob- 
~(k) (c) lem" of \] ~' , and R D denotes the "Recall 
Factor" for the "error correction problem" of 
p(k) respectively.

2.2 The  Method  of  Error Detect ion  us ing  
2nd-Order  Markov  Mode l  
We introduce the following assumption ac- 
cording to the experiences. 
Assumption Each Markov probability for 
erroneous chains of "ka@-kana" characters or 
English alphabets is small compared to that 
188 
of correct chains. 
! 
According to this assumption, the. procedure. 
of detecting the location i .~nd the length k of 
error chains arc detined as follows: 
Pwcedure 1 ( Method of detecting the lo- 
cation and the length of chain wrongly sub-

However, this method can not distinguish 
the erroneous characters wrongly substituted, 
from the characters wrongly inserted in the 
former c~e~ and can not determine the length 
k for the type of 1?~ ), because the Markov 
probability of any erroneous chmns in Pl) ~) 
remMns small value just the same times for 
length k. These problems can be solved by 
the procedt/re 3 and 4 shown in Sec.2.3. 
In this paper, the effect to detect errors for 
cases of length k = 1, 2 is evaluated. 
2.3 The Method of Error  Correct ion us- 
ing 2rid-Order Markov Model 
The procedure of replacing erroneous chains 
by correct chains using Markov model is pre- 
sented as follows: 
Procedure 3 ( Method of correcting the

By comparing Markov probability for correct 
chains in two cases above, choose a correct 
chain which has the great Markov probability.

Markov probabilities do not remain smaller 
than critical value T, then it is judged that

pe l l  can not  detect  the l ocat ion  o f  e r roneous  
alphabets in words. 
In order to detect and correct erroneous "E- 
word" more effectively, the method to combine 
Ispell and the procedure ( in  see. 2.3 ) using 
Markov model is expected? The combinato- 
rial method is denoted in the following way: 
(1) At first, erroneous "E-words" are detected 
by Ispell, but the locations of erroneous alpha- 
bets in words can not be detected by it. (2) 
Next decide the correct candidates words by 
procedure 3 and 4. (3) Finally, ls!)ell again 
checks if these candidates are correct words. 
The experimental results using this method is 
shown in Fig. 6(2nd-order) and in Fig. 7( 
3rd-order ). From the results, it is seen that 
this combinatorial method of Ispell and the 
procedure by 3rd-order Markov model to very 
useflfl to detect and correct all errors in En- 
glish words. 
It takes about 10 milli-seeonds and 6 sec- 
onds in average to detect and to correct er- 
roneous "bunsetsu" . Examples of "bun- 
setsu" and the output results of error de\]co- 
tion and error correction using Mm!kov model, 
are shown in Fig. 8.

4 Conclusion 
This l),~per proposed the methods to .ittdge 
three type of errors mM correct these errors, 
which are characters wrongly substituted, in- 
serted ~nd deleted in the .l~panese "ka.nji- 
kmt,~" chains and English words using m-th 
order Marker model. 
The effects of the methods were experimen- 
tally ev;dnated for the case of 2nd- and 3rd- 
order M~rkov chain. ~'rom the exI)erimental 
results, the following conclusions have been 
obt;dned: 
1. The m;~ximum vahte of P ;rod .le of detect- 
ing erroneous ch~racters wrongly inserte<l 
or substituted, is greater than that of er- 
roneous ehm'aeLers wrongly deleted. 
2. This method is specially useful to detect 
~md correct erroneous characters wrongly 
inserted att(l substituted in "k~mji-l~a,n~ '
"bunsetsu", but is not so useful 1.(; detect. 
and correct errors in English words. 
3. The combin,~toriM method of lspell a.nd 
the procedure by ard-order M arkov model 
is usefull to detect and correct all errors 
in Fmglish words. 
llowever they are not so usefltl for detecting 
and correcting of eharactells, wrongly deleted in 
"k,~I\ji-kana" bunsetsu". 1: hen, m(>re .flicient 
rrmthods are expected for this type of errors.
