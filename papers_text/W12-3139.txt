Abstract
We report on findings of exploiting large data
sets for translation modeling, language mod-
eling and tuning for the development of com-
petitive machine translation systems for eight
language pairs.
1 Introduction
We report on experiments carried out for the devel-
opment of competitive systems on the datasets of the
2012 Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation.
Our main focus was directed on the effective use
of all the available training data during training of
translation and language models and tuning.
We use the open source machine translation sys-
tem Moses (Koehn et al, 2007) and other standard
open source tools, hence all our experiments are
straightforwardly replicable1.
Compared to all single system submissions by
participants of the workshop we achieved the best
BLEU scores for four language pairs (es-en, en-es,
cs-en, en-cs), the 2nd best results for two language
pairs (fr-en, de-en), as well as a 3rd place (en-de)
and a 5th place (en-fr) for the remaining pairs. We
improved upon this in the post-evaluation period for
some of the language pairs by more systematically
applying our methods.
During the development of our system, we saw
most gains from using large corpora for translation
model training, especially when using subsampling
techniques for out-of-domain sets, using large cor-
pora for language model training, and larger tuning
sets. We also observed mixed results with alternative
tuning methods. We also experimented with hierar-
chical models and semi-supervised training, but did
not achieve any improvements.

We report all results in case-sensitive BLEU (mt-
eval13a) on the newstest2011 test set (Callison-
Burch et al, 2011). Please also note that base-
line scores vary throughout the paper, since different
methods were investigated at different time points.
2 Better Translation Models
2.1 Using Large Training Sets
The WMT evaluation campaign works with the
largest training sets in the field. Our French-English
systems are trained on a parallel corpus with 1,072
million French and 934 million English words.
Training a system on this amount of data takes about
two weeks.
The basic data sets for the language pairs are the
Europarl and NewsCommentary corpora consist of
about 50 million words and 3 million words, respec-
tively. These corpora are quite close to the target
domain of news reports, and give quite good results.
Table 1 shows the gains from using the much larger
UN (about 300 million words) and GigaFrEn cor-
pora (about 550 million words).
From these results, it is not clear if the UN is help-
ful, but the GigaFrEn corpus gives large gains (+0.4
BLEU and +1.0 BLEU).

2.2 Subsampling
We experimented with two different types of sub-
sampling techniques ? Model 1, similar to that used
by Schwenk et al (2011), and modified Moore-
Lewis (Axelrod et al, 2011) ? for the language pairs
es-en, en-es, fr-en and en-fr. In each case the idea
was to include the NewsCommentary and Europarl
corpora in their entirety, and to score the sentences
in the remaining corpora (the selection corpus) using
one of the two measures, adding either the top 10%
or top 50% of the selection corpus to the training
data.
For Model 1 filtering, we trained IBM Model 1
on Europarl and NewsCommentary concatenated, in
both directions, and scored the sentences in the se-
lection corpus using the length-normalised sum of
the IBM Model scores. For the modified Moore-
Lewis filtering, we trained two 5-gram language
models for source and target, the first on 5M sen-
tences from the news2011 monolingual data, and
the second on 5M words from the selection corpus,
using the same vocabulary. The modified Moore-
Lewis score for a sentence is the sum of the source
and target?s perplexity difference for the two lan-
guage models.
For the Spanish experiments, the selection corpus
was the UN data, whilst for the French experiments
it was the UN data and the GigaFrEn data, concate-
nated and with duplicates removed.
The results of the subsampling are shown in Ta-
ble 2, where the BLEU scores are averaged over
2 tuning runs. The conclusion was that modified
Moore-Lewis subsampling was effective (and was
used in our final submissions), but Model 1 sam-
pling made no difference for the Spanish systems,
and was harmful for the French systems.
3 Better Language Models
In previous years, we were not able to make use
of the monolingual LDC Gigaword corpora due to
lack of sufficiently powerful computing resources.
These corpora exist for English (4.3 billion words),
Spanish (1.1 billion words), and French (0.8 billion
words). With the acquisition of large memory ma-
chines2, we were now able to train language models
on this data. Use of these large language models dur-
ing decoding is aided by more efficient storage and
inference (Heafield, 2011).
Still, even with that much RAM it is not possi-
ble to train a language model with SRILM (Stolke,
2002) in one pass. Hence, we broke up the train-
ing corpus by source (New York Times, Washington
Post, ...) and trained separate language model for
each. The largest individual corpus was the English
New York Times portion which consists of 1.5 billion
words and took close to 100GB of RAM. We also
trained individual language models for each year of
WMT12?s monolingual corpus.
We interpolated the language models using the
SRILM toolkit. The toolkit has a limit of 10 lan-
guage models to be merged at once, so we had to in-
terpolate sub-groups of some of the language models
(the WMT12 monolingual news models) first. It is
not clear if this is harmful, but building separate lan-
guage model for each source and year and interpo-
late those many more models did hurt significantly.
Table 3 shows that we gain around half a BLEU
point into Spanish and French, as well as German?
English, and around one and a half BLEU points for
the other language pairs into English.

4 Better Tuning
4.1 Bigger Tuning Sets
In recent experiments, mainly geared towards using
much larger feature sets, we learned that larger tun-
ing sets may give better and more stable results. We
tested this hypothesis here as well.
By concatenating the sets from three years (2008-
2010), we constructed a tuning set of 7567 sentences
per language. Table 4 shows that we gain on average
about +0.2 BLEU points.
4.2 Pairwise Ranked Optimization
We recently added an implementation of the pair-
wise ranked optimization (PRO) tuning method
(Hopkins and May, 2011) to Moses as an alterna-
tive to Och?s (2003) minimum error rate training
(MERT). We checked if this method gives us better
results. Table 5 shows a mixed picture. PRO gives
slightly shorter translations, probably because it op-
timises sentence rather than corpus BLEU, which has
a noticeable effect on the BLEU score. For 2 lan-
guage pairs we see better results, for 4 worse, and
for 1 there is no difference. On other data and lan-

guage conditions we have observed better and more
stable results with PRO.
We tried to use PRO to generate starting points for
MERT optimization. Theoretically this will lead to
better optimization on the tuning set, since MERT
optimization steps on PRO weights will never lead
to worse results on the sampled n-best lists. This
method (PRO-MERT in the table) applied here,
however, did not lead to significantly different re-
sults than plain MERT.
5 What did not Work
Not everything we tried worked out. Notably, two
promising directions ? hierarchical models and
semi-supervised learning ? did not yield any im-
provements. It is not clear if we failed or if the
methods failed, but we will investigate this further
in future work.
5.1 Hierarchical Models
Hierarchical models (Chiang, 2007) have been sup-
ported already for a few years by Moses, and they
give significantly better performance for Chinese?
English over phrase-based models. While we have
not yet seen benefits for many other language pairs,
the eight language pairs of WMT12 allowed us to
compare these two models more extensively, also
in view of recent enhancements resulting in better
search accuracy.
Since hierarchical models are much larger
(roughly 10 times bigger), we trained hierarchical
models on downsized training data for most lan-
guage pairs. For Spanish and French, this ex-
cludes UN and GigaFrEn; for Czech some parts
of the CzEng corpus were excluded based on their
lower language model interpolation weights relative

to their size.
Table 6 shows inferior performance for all lan-
guage pairs (by about half a BLEU point), although
results for German?English are close (?0.2 BLEU).
5.2 Semi-Supervised Learning
Other research groups have reported improvements
using semi-supervised learning methods to cre-
ate synthetic parallel data from monolingual data
(Schwenk et al, 2008; Abdul-Rauf and Schwenk,
2009; Bertoldi and Federico, 2009; Lambert et al,
2011). The idea is to translate in-domain monolin-
gual data with a baseline system and filter the result
for use as an additional parallel corpus.
Table 7 shows out results when trying to emulate
the approach of Lambert et al (2011). We translate
the some of the 2011 monolingual news data (139
million words for French and 100 million words for
English) from the target language into the source
language with a baseline system trained on Europarl
and News Commentary. Adding all the obtained
data hurts (except for minimal improvements over
a small French-English system). When we filtered
out half of the sentences based on translation scores,
results were even worse.
