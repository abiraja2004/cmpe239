Abstract
In this paper, we (1) propose a new dataset
for testing the degree of relatedness be-
tween pairs of words; (2) propose a new
WordNet-based measure of relatedness, and
evaluate it on the new dataset.
1 Introduction
Estimating the degree of semantic relatedness be-
tween words in a text is deemed important in
numerous applications: word-sense disambigua-
tion (Banerjee and Pedersen, 2003), story segmen-
tation (Stokes et al, 2004), error correction (Hirst
and Budanitsky, 2005), summarization (Barzilay and
Elhadad, 1997; Gurevych and Strube, 2004).
Furthermore, Budanitsky and Hirst (2006) noted
that various applications tend to pick the same mea-
sures of relatedness, which suggests a certain com-
monality in what is required from such a measure by
the different applications. It thus seems worthwhile
to develop such measures intrinsically, before putting
them to application-based utility tests.
The most popular, by-now-standard testbed is
Rubenstein and Goodenough?s (1965) list of 65 noun
pairs, ranked by similarity of meaning. A 30-pair
subset (henceforth, MC) passed a number of repli-
cations (Miller and Charles, 1991; Resnik, 1995), and
is thus highly reliable.
Rubenstein and Goodenough (1965) view simi-
larity of meaning as degree of synonymy. Researchers
have long recognized, however, that synonymy is only
one kind of semantic affinity between words in a
text (Halliday and Hasan, 1976), and expressed a
wish for a dataset for testing a more general notion
of semantic relatedness.1
1?. . . similarity of meaning is not the same thing as
semantic relatedness. However, there is at present no
large dataset of human judgments of semantic related-
This paper proposes and explores a new related-
ness dataset. In sections 2-3, we briefly introduce
the experiment by Beigman Klebanov and Shamir
(henceforth, BS), and use the data to induce related-
ness scores. In section 4, we propose a new WordNet-
based measure of relatedness, and use it to explore
the new dataset. We show that it usually does bet-
ter than competing WordNet-based measures (sec-
tion 5). We discuss future directions in section 6.
2 Data
Aiming at reader-based exploration of lexical cohe-
sion in texts, Beigman Klebanov and Shamir con-
ducted an experiment with 22 students, each reading
10 texts: 3 news stories, 4 journalistic and 3 fiction
pieces (Beigman Klebanov and Shamir, 2006). Peo-
ple were instructed to read the text first, and then
go over a separately attached list of words in order
of their appearance in the text, and ask themselves,
for every newly mentioned concept, ?which previ-
ously mentioned concepts help the easy accommoda-
tion of the current concept into the evolving story,
if indeed it is easily accommodated, based on the
common knowledge as perceived by the annotator?
(Beigman Klebanov and Shamir, 2005); this preced-
ing helper concept is called an anchor. People were
asked to mark all anchoring relations they could find.
The rendering of relatedness between two concepts
is not tied to any specific lexical relation, but rather
to common-sense knowledge, which has to do with
?knowledge of kinds, of associations, of typical sit-
uations, and even typical utterances?.2 The phe-
nomenon is thus clearly construed as much broader
than degree-of-synonymy.
Beigman Klebanov and Shamir (2006) provide re-
liability estimation of the experimental data using
ness? (Hirst and Budanitsky, 2005); ?To our knowledge,
no datasets are available for validating the results of se-
mantic relatedness metric? (Gurevych, 2005).
2according to Hirst (2000), cited in the guidelines

statistical analysis and a validation experiment, iden-
tifying reliably anchored items with their strong an-
chors, and reliably un-anchored items. Such analysis
provides high-validity data for classification; how-
ever, much of the data regarding intermediate de-
grees of relatedness is left out.
3 Relatedness Scores
Our idea is to induce scores for pairs of anchored
items with their anchors (henceforth, AApairs)
using the cumulative annotations by 20 people.3
Thus, an AApair written by all 20 people scores 20,
and that written by just one person scores 1. The
scores would correspond to the perceived relatedness
of the pair of concepts in the given text.
In Beigman Klebanov and Shamir?s (2006) core
classification data, no distinctions are retained be-
tween pairs marked by 19 or 13 people. Now we
are interested in the relative relatedness, so it is im-
portant to handle cases where the BS data might
under-rate a pair. One such case are multi-word
items; we remove AApairs with suspect multi-word
elements.4 Further, we retain only pairs that belong
to open-class parts of speech (henceforth, POS), as
functional categories contribute little to the lexical
texture (Halliday and Hasan, 1976). The Size col-
umn of table 1 shows the number of AApairs for
each BS text, after the aforementioned exclusions.
The induced scores correspond to cumulative
judgements of a group of people. How well do they
represent the people?s ideas? One way to measure
group homogeneity is leave-one-out estimation, as
done by Resnik (1995) for MC data, attaining the
high average correlation of r = 0.88. In the current
case, however, every specific person made a binary
decision, whereas a group is represented by scores 1
to 20; such difference in granularity is problematic
for correlation or rank order analysis.
Another way to measure group homogeneity is to
split it into subgroups and compare scores emerging
from the different subgroups. We know from
Beigman Klebanov and Shamir?s (2006) analysis that
it is not the case that the 20-subject group clusters
into subgroups that systematically produced differ-
ent patterns of answers. This leads us to expect rel-
ative lack of sensitivity to the exact splits into sub-
groups.
To validate this reasoning, we performed 100 ran-
dom choices of two 9-subject4 groups, calculated the
scores induced by the two groups, and computed
3Two subjects were revealed as outliers and their data
was removed (Beigman Klebanov and Shamir, 2006).

Pearson correlation between the two lists. Thus, for
every BS text, we have a distribution of 100 coeffi-
cients, which is approximately normal. Estimations
of ? and ? of these distributions are ? = .69 ? .82
(av. 0.75), ? = .02? .03 for the different BS texts.
To summarize: although the homogeneity is lower
than for MC data, we observe good average inter-
group correlations with little deviation across the 100
splits. We now turn to discussion of a relatedness
measure, which we will evaluate using the data.
4 Gic: WordNet-based Measure
Measures using WordNet taxonomy are state-of-
the-art in capturing semantic similarity, attaining
r=.85 ?.89 correlations with the MC dataset (Jiang
and Conrath, 1997; Budanitsky and Hirst, 2006).
However, they fall short of measuring relatedness,
as, operating within a single-POS taxonomy, they
cannot meaningfully compare kill to death. This is
a major limitation with respect to BS data, where
only about 40% of pairs are nominal, and less than
10% are verbal. We develop a WordNet-based mea-
sure that would allow cross-POS comparisons, using
glosses in addition to the taxonomy.
One family of WordNet measures are methods
based on estimation of information content (hence-
forth, IC) of concepts, as proposed in (Resnik, 1995).
Resnik?s key idea in corpus-based information con-
tent induction using a taxonomy is to count every
appearance of a concept as mentions of all its hy-
pernyms as well. This way, artifact#n#1, although
rarely mentioned explicitly, receives high frequency
and low IC value. We will count a concept?s men-
tion towards all its hypernyms AND all words5 that
appear in its own and its hypernyms? glosses. Analo-
gously to artifact, we expect properties mentioned in
glosses of more general concepts to be less informa-
tive, as those pertain to more things (ex., visible,
a property of anything that is-a physical object).
The details of the algorithm for information con-
tent induction from taxonomy and gloss information
(ICGT ) are given in appendix A.
To estimate the semantic affinity between two
senses A and B, we average the ICGT values of the
3 words with the highest ICGT in the overlap of A?s
and B?s expanded glosses (the expansion follows the
algorithm in appendix A).6
5We induce IC values on (POS-tagged base
form) words rather than senses. Ongoing gloss
sense-tagging projects like eXtended WordNet
(http://xwn.hlt.utdallas.edu/links.html) would allow
sense-based calculation in the future.
6The number 3 is empirically-based; the idea is to
counter-balance (a) the effect of an accidental match of a

Table 1: Dataset sizes and correlations of Gic, BP
with human ratings. r > 0.16 is significant at
p < .05; r > .23 is significant at p < .01. Average
correlation (AvBS) is r=.28 (Gic), r=.17 (BP).
If A? (the word of which A is a sense) appears
in the expanded gloss of B, we take the maximum
between the ICGT (A?) and the value returned by
the 3-smoothed calculation. To compare two words,
we take the maximum value returned by pairwise
comparisons of their WordNet senses.7
The performance of this measure is shown under
Gic in table 1. Gic manages robust but weak corre-
lations, never reaching the r = .40 threshold.
5 Related Work
We compare Gic to another WordNet-based measure
that can handle cross-POS comparisons, proposed
by Banerjee and Pedersen (2003). To compare word
senses A and B, the algorithm compares not only
their glosses, but also glosses of items standing in
various WordNet relations with A and B. For ex-
ample, it compares the gloss of A?s meronym to that
of B?s hyponym. We use the default configuration
of the measure in WordNet::Similarity-0.12 package
(Pedersen et al, 2004), and, with a single exception,
the measure performed below Gic; see BP in table 1.
As mentioned before, taxonomy-based similarity
measures cannot fully handle BS data. Table 2 uses
nominal-only subsets of BS data and the MC nominal
similarity dataset to show that (a) state-of-the-art
WordNet-based similarity measure JC8 (Jiang and
Conrath, 1997; Budanitsky and Hirst, 2006) does
very poorly on the relatedness data, suggesting that
nominal similarity and relatedness are rather differ-
ent things; (b) Gic does better on average, and is
more robust; (c) Gic yields on MC to gain perfor-
mance on BS, whereas BP is no more inclined to-
single word which is relatively rarely used in glosses; (b)
the multitude of low-IC items in many of the overlaps
that tend to downplay the impact of the few higher-IC
members of the overlap.
7To speed the processing up, we use first 5 WordNet
senses of each item for results reported here.

Table 3 illustrates the relatedness vs. similarity
distinction. Whereas, taxonomically speaking, son
is more similar to man, as reflected in JC scores,
people marked family and mother as much stronger
anchors for son in BS-2; Gic follows suit.

6 Conclusion and Future Work
We proposed a dataset of relatedness judgements
that differs from the existing ones9 in (1) size ?
about 7000 items, as opposed to up to 350 in existing
datasets; (2) cross-POS data, as opposed to purely
nominal or verbal; (3) a broad approach to semantic
relatedness, not focussing on any particular relation,
but grounding it in the reader?s (idea of) common
knowledge; this as opposed to synonymy-based simi-
larity prevalent in existing databases.
We explored the new data with WordNet-based
measures, showing that (1) the data is different in
character from a standard similarity dataset, and
very challenging for state-of-the-art methods; (2) the
proposed novel WordNet-based measure of related-
ness usually outperforms its competitor, as well as
a state-of-the-art similarity measure when the latter
applies.
In future work, we plan to explore distributional
methods for modeling relatedness, as well as the
use of text-based information to improve correlations
with the human data, as judgments are situated in
specific textual contexts.
9Though most widely used, MC is not the only avail-
able dataset; we will address other datasets in a subse-
quent paper.

A Gloss&Taxonomy IC (ICGT )
We refer to POS-tagged base form items as ?words?
throughout this section. For every word-sense W in
WordNet database for a given POS:
1. Collect all content words from the gloss of W ,
excluding examples, including W ? - the POS-
tagged word of which W is a sense.
2. If W is part of a taxonomy, expand its gloss,
without repetitions, with words appearing in
the glosses of all its super-ordinate concepts,
up to the top of the hierarchy. Thus, the ex-
panded gloss for airplane#n#1 would contain
words from the glosses of the relevant senses of
aircraft , vehicle, transport, etc.
3. Add W ?s sense count to all words in its ex-
panded gloss.10
Each POS database induces its own counts on each
word that appeared in the gloss of at least one of its
members. When merging the data from the differ-
ent POS, we scale the aggregated counts, such that
they correspond to the proportion of the given word
in the POS database where it was the least informa-
tive. The standard log-frequency calculation trans-
forms these counts into taxonomy-and-gloss based in-
formation content (ICGT ) values.
B JC measure of similarity
In the formula, IC is taxonomy-only based informa-
tion content, as in (Resnik, 1995), LS is the lowest
common subsumer of the two concepts in the Word-
Net hierarchy, and Max is the maximum distance11
between any two concepts.
JC(c1, c2) = Max?(IC(c1)+IC(c2)?2?IC(LS(c1, c2))
To make JC scores comparable to Gic?s [0,1] range,
the score can be divided by Max. Normalization has
no effect on correlations.
10We do add-1-smoothing on WordNet sense counts.
11This is about 26 for WordNet-2.0 nominal hierar-
chy with add-1-smoothed SemCor database; see Beigman
Klebanov (2006) for details.
