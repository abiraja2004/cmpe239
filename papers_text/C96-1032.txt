Abstract 
This paper tbeuses on two disparate as- 
I)e(:ts of German syntax from the per- 
speetive of paral\]eJ grammar develop- 
menl;. As part of a eOOl)erative project, 
we present an innovative approach to 
auxiliaries and multiph: genitive NPs ill 
German. The LFG-based imph:men- 
ration t)resented here avoids unnessary 
structural eonq)lexity in the representa- 
tion of auxiliaries by challenging the tra- 
ditional analysis of auxiliaries as raising 
verbs. The approach developed for mul- 
tiple genitive NPs provides a mor(: at)- 
straet, language independent representa- 
ti(m of genitives associated with nomi- 
nalized verl)s. Taken together, the two 
ai)proa(:hes rei)resent a step (;owards pro- 
viding uniformly al)plical)le treatments 
for differing languages, thus lightening 
the burden for machine translation. 
1 In t roduct ion  
Within the cooperative parallel grmmnar project 
PARGRAM (IMS-Stuttgart, Xerox-Pale Alto, 
Xerox-Grenoble), the analysis and representation 
of stru(:tures in the grammars must bc viewed 
from a more gh)bal perspective than l;hat of tile 
individual languages (German, English, French). 
One major goal of PAll.GRAM is the development 
of broad coverage grammars which are also mod- 
ular and easy to nm.intain. Another major goal 
is the construction of parallel analyses for sen- 
tences of the same type in German, English, and 
French. If this can be achieved, the prol)h'm faced 
by machine translation (MT) could tm greatly re- 
duced. Due to the recent developnmnt of a faster 
and more powerful version of the LFG (Lexical- 
Functional-Grammar) based Grammar Writer's 
Workbench (Kaplan and Maxwell 1993) at Xerox, 
tile implementation of a linguistically adequate, 
broad coverage grammar aI)pears via.tile. Given 
the flexible t)rojection-based architecture of LFG 
(l)alrymple l; al. 1995) and the MT approach pre- 
sented in Kaplan et al (1989), 1 a rolmst MT sys- 
tem is already in place. 
In this paper, we (:oncentrate on two issues 
within the broader perspective of I>AI{GII.AM: the 
treatment of auxiliaries and the transi)arent rep- 
resentation of multilfle genitive NPs in German. 
'these phenoinena I'eI)resent two are.as for which 
generally accepted proposals exist, but, whose iln- 
plelnentation in the context of par'aiM gram- 
mar development throws up quest;ions as to their 
wider, crosslinguistic, feasibility. With restleet o 
auxiliaries, the standard raising at)preach that is 
usually adopted yields undesirable structural com- 
plexity and results in idiosyncratic, language par- 
ticular analyses of the role of auxiliaries. With 
regard to genitive NiPs, the standard analysis tbr 
German yields strtlctures which are too alnbigu- 
ous for a succesflfl at)plication of madfine transla- 
tion. The fbllowing sections present a solution in 
that morphological wellformedness conditions are. 
stated at a separate onlponent, the 'morTfl~ology 
projection. Furthermore, a representation f argu- 
inent structure is implenmnted that is related to, 
1)ut not idcnl;ical to the ret)resentation of grain- 
matical flmel,ions. Language particular idiosyn- 
cratic requirements are thus separated out from 
the language universal information l(:quired for 
further semantic interpretal;ion, or machine trans- 
lation. 
2 The Formal i sm 
The architecture of LFG assumed here is the 
"traditional" architecture described in Bresnan 
(1.982), as well as the newer advances within LFG 
(Dalrynq)te t al. , 1995). A grammar is viewed 
as a set of correspondences xpressed in ternls of 
projections fl'om one level of representation to nil- 
other. Two fundamental levels of representations 
within LFG are the c(onstitutent)-structure and 
the f(unctional)-structure. The c-structure en- 
codes idiosyncratic phrase structural prope.rties of 
a given language, while the f-structure provides

greater ordering possibilities gra.nted hy the flex- 
ible German word or(ler. There are a,lso major 
reasons, however, tbr nol; adopting this analysis: 
1) linguistic adequacy; 2) unmotivated structural 
complexity; 3) lion-parallel analyses for predica- 
tionally equivalent sentences. Consider the French 
e{luivalent of (\]) in (4). 
(4) Le {:ondu(:teur aura tourn6 le levier

'The driver will have turned the lever.' 
As argued by Akmajian el; al. (1979), erosslin- 
guistic evidence indicates that elements bearing 
only tense, mood, or voice should helong to a dis- 
tinct syntacti(: category. In many languages, like 
Fr(;nch or Japalmse, the infornmtioll (:arried by 
'will (future), or have (perfect) is realized mort)ho- 
logically rather than i)eriphrastically. The analy- 
sis in (4) thus effcetiw?ly claims that there exists 
a dee t) difference in the pr{;{lieational structure of 
auxiliaries like will and have and the l~ench aura. 4 
This is not {lesirable flom ~L crosslinguisti{: point,

The auxiliaries wird 'will' and haben 'have' now 
only contribute information as to tit(', overall tense, 
lint do not subcategorize for complements. Struc- 
tural phenomena like VP-ellipsis, coordination, 
or topicalization can, however, still be accounted 
for ill terms of an apl)roi)riate mt)e, hling at c- 
structure (cf. (2)). The role of a.uxiliaries in nat- 
m'al language is now adequately modeled, ill par- 
tieular with respect o a more realistic treatment 
of tense (compare (3) and (5)), as the 1,?ench (4) 
has essentially the same f-structure as (5)) 
4Note that wird 'will' is often analyzed as a modal 
in accordance with Vater (1975). However, the argu- 
inents i}resented there are not conclusive. 
'~The construction of the wflue for the cmnposed 
tenses results fl'om a complex interaction between the 
Ilowever, the fiat f-structure in (5) providc's 
no room for a statement of selectional require- 
ments, allowing massive overgeneration (e.g. noth- 
ing blocks the presence of two haben ill (1)). Nci- 
ther (:all the particular order of auxilia.ries be regu- 
lated. Our solution takes advantage of LFG's flex- 
iMe projection-based architecture by implement- 
ing a projection which models the hierarchical se- 
leetional requirements of auxiliaries, yet does not 
interfere with the sul)categorizatiomfl prot)erties 
of verbs, as wouhl he the ease under a raising anal- 
ysis.

in LFG, the flexihle word order of German is 
handled via f lmctional wnccrtainty, which charac- 
terizes long-distance dependeneies without resort- 
ing to movement analyses (Netter (1988), Zaenen 
and Kaplan (1995)). As in (6), which illustrates 
our alternatiw; solution, functional uneertainty is
represented by the Kleene Star (.).6 Tile annota- 
tion on the NPs indicates Lhat they could fulfill the 
role of any possible grammatical f metion (GF), 
e.g. SUllJ or oB.I, and that the level of embedding 
ranges from zero to infinite. With e.very auxil- 
iary subcategorizing for an XCOMP, the two NPs 
could conceivably be arguments of three different 
verbs: wird, haben, or gedreht. Titus, the greater 
structural complexity unnecessarily increases the. 
search space for the deternfination of a verb's 
arguments. In (6), however, the m-structure is 
projected from the e-structure parallel to the f- 
structure through annotations similar to the usual 
f-structure annotations. 7 Statements about "mor- 
le~xical entries. Note that this treatment does not as 
yet include a fine-grained represention of tense and 
aspect. This is the subject of ongoing work. The 
treatment presented here provides th('~ basis needed 
for a thorougt, erosslinguistic analysis of temi)oral and 
aspectual phelmmena. 
6For space reasons, the xc indicates XCOMP, the D 
a DEP .  
rThe annotation p M* in (6) refers to the m- 
structure associated with the parent c-structure node, 
and t t* refers to the m-structure associated with the 
daughter node. The more familiar t and $ of I,FG 
are simply shorthand notations of the same idea,

If the head-noun is not derived from, say, a verb, 
the single genitive ill either position is interpreted 
as a possessor. In case of a derived nominal, how- 
ever, a genitive is interpreted according to tile the- 
matic roles assigned to tile arguments of the verbal 
base. That means the functions GFN1 and sc gen2 
have to be linked to the approt)riate roles. Neither 
of tile two functions is in principle restricted to 
any specific roh;. But if both genitives are present 
they must be interpreted according to a thematic 
role hierarchy. 
As (10) shows, if only one genitive is present, its 
prenominal interpretation may be as agent or as 
patient. A postnominal (single) genitive is inter- 
preted as agent if the head noun is derived fronl 
an intransitive, and as a patient/theme if derived 
from a transitive.

'Elisabeth's laughter' 
b. l{oms Belagerung

'Rome's siege' 
However, if two genitives occur, as in (11), the 
prenominal genitive is restricted to an agent, and 
the postnominal one to patient. This restriction 
must be encoded at some lew;1, but does not fol- 
low from tile distiction between GEN\] and (IEN2, 
wtfich are flmctions that do not bear any semantic 
content on the.ir own.

To obtain the correct linking, tile argument 
structure of the verbal base must be available. 
Since MT is based on f-structu,'es within PAtt,- 
(IRAM~ the argument structure has to be present 
at; this level of representation. '9 Nominalization 
is therefore implemented as a morphologically 
driven process (lexical rule) which eliminates uI~a 
and Ol<J fl'om the verb's subcategorization frame 
and enters tile verb's argument structure into tile

and further ot)tional constituents, this ruh; captures 
the restrictions that determine the dislocation of a

lexical entry of the noun. This yields the option- 
ality of genitives while preserving tile underlying 
semantics, as shown in (12). The association of 
CEN1 and GEN2 then is determined according to 
a hierarchical order of arguments (Bresnan, 1995). 
This approach also provides a means of han- 
dling certain eases of categorial stfift. For in- 
stance, in German temporal and conditional ad- 
juncts mw be realized as PPs dominating an NP 
headed by a deverbal noun. English does not 
have this option, but employs an adjunct-clause 
instead. Ih;re, the GEN1 and GFN2 functions of 
the Germml fstructure have to be related cor- 
rectly to tile SUlIJ and OBJ functions of tile English 
f-structure.

man f-structure driw;s tile transfer of these func- 
tions to the SllllJ and oBJ time, lions of tile English

Under this approach, languages now only dif- 
fer with respct to the categorial realisation of the 
flmction by ease-marked NP or PP. Thus, an ap- 
plication of this treatnmnt not only provides an 
adequate grammatical analysis of the NP in Ger-

5 Conc lus ion  
This paper has presented innovative approaches 
for two particular syntactic phenomena: auxil- 
iaries and multiple genitive NPs. The analyses 
proposed alh)w tile faetorization of language par- 
tieular, idiosyncratic information. This results in 
a cleaner treatment of auxiliaries by factoring out 
morphological wellformedness conditions, and al- 
lows for the preservation of argurnent structure

information in cases like that of the German mul- 
tiple genitive NP eoImtr,ction, where syntacti- 
(:ally dissimilar eonstru(:tions express essentially 
the same l)re(ticate-argulnent relations. As such, 
the work t)resented here can 1)e seen a.s a sma.ll t)ut 
necessary ste I) towards th(; re, alization of a/)road 
coverage grammar. In particular, the \[easil)ility 
of (levelot)ing paralM grammars for differing lan- 
guages is greatly increased through the formula.- 
don of uniformly applicable, transparent analyses.
