Abstract
Semantic lexical matching is a prominent
subtask within text understanding applica-
tions. Yet, it is rarely evaluated in a di-
rect manner. This paper proposes a def-
inition for lexical reference which cap-
tures the common goals of lexical match-
ing. Based on this definition we created
and analyzed a test dataset that was uti-
lized to directly evaluate, compare and im-
prove lexical matching models. We sug-
gest that such decomposition of the global
semantic matching task is critical in order
to fully understand and improve individual
components.
1 Introduction
A fundamental task for text understanding ap-
plications is to identify semantically equivalent
pieces of text. For example, Question Answer-
ing (QA) systems need to match corresponding
parts in the question and in the answer passage,
even though such parts may be expressed in dif-
ferent terms. Summarization systems need to rec-
ognize (redundant) semantically matching parts
in multiple sentences that are phrased differently.
Other applications, such as information extraction
and retrieval, face pretty much the same seman-
tic matching task. The degree of semantic match-
ing found is typically factored into systems? scor-
ing and ranking mechanisms. The recently pro-
posed framework of textual entailment (Dagan et
al., 2006) attempts to formulate the generic seman-
tic matching problem in an application indepen-
dent manner.
The most commonly implemented semantic
matching component addresses the lexical level.
At this level the goal is to identify whether the
meaning of a lexical item of one text is expressed
also within the other text. Typically, lexical match-
ing models measure the degree of literal lexical
overlap, augmented with lexical substitution cri-
teria based on resources such as Wordnet or the
output of statistical similarity methods (see Sec-
tion 2). Many systems apply semantic matching
only at the lexical level, which is used to approx-
imate the overall degree of semantic matching be-
tween texts. Other systems incorporate lexical
matching as a component within more complex
models that examine matching at higher syntactic
and semantic levels.
While lexical matching models are so promi-
nent within semantic systems they are rarely eval-
uated in a direct manner. Typically, improve-
ments to a lexical matching model are evaluated by
their marginal contribution to overall system per-
formance. Yet, such global and indirect evaluation
does not indicate the absolute performance of the
model relative to the sheer lexical matching task
for which it was designed. Furthermore, the indi-
rect application-dependent evaluation mode does
not facilitate improving lexical matching models
in an application dependent manner, and does not
allow proper comparison of such models which
were developed (and evaluated) by different re-
searchers within different systems.
This paper proposes a generic definition for the
lexical matching task, which we term lexical ref-
erence. This definition is application indepen-
dent and enables annotating test datasets that eval-
uate directly lexical matching models. Conse-
quently, we created a dataset annotated for lexical
reference, using a sample of sentence pairs (text-
hypothesis) from the 1st Recognising Textual En-
tailment dataset. Further analysis identified sev-
172
eral sub-types of lexical reference, pointing at the
many interesting cases where lexical reference is
derived from a complete context rather than from
a particular matching lexical item.
Next, we used the lexical reference dataset to
evaluate and compare several state-of-the-art ap-
proaches for lexical matching. Having a direct
evaluation task enabled us to capture the actual
performance level of these models, to reveal their
relative strengths and weaknesses, and even to
construct a simple combination of two models that
outperforms all the original ones. Overall, we sug-
gest that it is essential to decompose global se-
mantic matching and textual entailment tasks into
proper subtasks, like lexical reference. Such de-
composition is needed in order to fully understand
the behavior of individual system components and
to guide their future improvements.
2 Background
2.1 Term Matching
Thesaurus-based term expansion is a commonly
used technique for enhancing the recall of NLP
systems and coping with lexical variability. Ex-
pansion consists of altering a given text (usu-
ally a query) by adding terms of similar meaning.
WordNet is commonly used as a source of related
words for expansion. For example, many QA sys-
tems perform expansion in the retrieval phase us-
ing query related words based on WordNet?s lexi-
cal relations such as synonymy or hyponymy (e.g
(Harabagiu et al, 2000; Hovy et al, 2001)). Lex-
ical similarity measures (e.g. (Lin, 1998)) have
also been suggested to measure semantic similar-
ity. They are based on the distributional hypothe-
sis, suggesting that words that occur within similar
contexts are semantically similar.
2.2 Textual Entailment
The Recognising Textual Entailment (RTE-1) chal-
lenge (Dagan et al, 2006) is an attempt to promote
an abstract generic task that captures major seman-
tic inference needs across applications. The task
requires to recognize, given two text fragments,
whether the meaning of one text can be inferred
(entailed) from another text. Different techniques
and heuristics were applied on the RTE-1 dataset
to specifically model textual entailment. Interest-
ingly, a number of works (e.g. (Bos and Mark-
ert, 2005; Corley and Mihalcea, 2005; Jijkoun and
de Rijke, 2005; Glickman et al, 2006)) applied or
utilized lexical based word overlap measures. Var-
ious word-to-word similarity measures where ap-
plied, including distributional similarity (such as
(Lin, 1998)), web-based co-occurrence statistics
and WordNet based similarity measures (such as
(Leacock et al, 1998)).
2.3 Paraphrase Acquisition
A substantial body of work has been dedicated to
learning patterns of semantic equivalency between
different language expressions, typically consid-
ered as paraphrases. Recently, several works ad-
dressed the task of acquiring paraphrases (semi-)
automatically from corpora. Most attempts were
based on identifying corresponding sentences in
parallel or ?comparable? corpora, where each cor-
pus is known to include texts that largely corre-
spond to texts in another corpus (e.g. (Barzilay
and McKeown, 2001)). Distributional Similarity
was also used to identify paraphrase patterns from
a single corpus rather than from a comparable
set of corpora (Lin and Pantel, 2001). Similarly,
(Glickman and Dagan, 2004) developed statistical
methods that match verb paraphrases within a reg-
ular corpus.
3 The Lexical Reference Dataset
3.1 Motivation and Definition
One of the major observations of the 1st Recog-
nizing Textual Entailment (RTE-1) challenge re-
ferred to the rich structure of entailment modeling
systems and the need to evaluate and optimize in-
dividual components within them. When building
such a compound system it is valuable to test each
component directly during its development, rather
than indirectly evaluating the component?s perfor-
mance via the behavior of the entire system. If
given tools to evaluate each component indepen-
dently researchers can target and perfect the per-
formance of the subcomponents without the need
of building and evaluating the entire end-to-end
system.
A common subtask, addressed by practically all
participating systems in RTE-1, was to recognize
whether each lexical meaning in the hypothesis is
referenced by some meaning in the corresponding
text. We suggest that this common goal can be
captured through the following definition:
Definition 1 A word w is lexically referenced by
a text t if there is an explicit or implied reference
173
from a set of words in t to a possible meaning of
w.
Lexical reference may be viewed as a natural ex-
tension of textual entailment for sub-sentential hy-
potheses such as words. In this work we fo-
cus on words meanings, however this work can
be directly generalized to word compounds and
phrases. A concrete version of detailed annotation
guidelines for lexical reference is presented in the
next section.1 Lexical Reference is, in some sense,
a more general notion than paraphrases. If the text
includes a paraphrase for w then naturally it does
refer to w?s meaning. However, a text need not
include a paraphrase for the concrete meaning of
the referenced word w, but only an implied refer-
ence. Accordingly, the referring part might be a
large segment of the text, which captures informa-
tion different than w?s meaning, but still implies a
reference to w as part of the text?s meaning.
It is typically a necessary, but not sufficient,
condition for textual entailment that the lexical
concepts in a hypothesis h are referred in a given
text t. For example, in order to infer from a text
the hypothesis ?a dog bit a man,? it is a neces-
sary that the concepts of dog, bite and man must
be referenced by the text, either directly or in an
implied manner. However, for proper entailment
it is further needed that the right relations would
hold between these concepts2. Therefore lexical
entailment should typically be a component within
a more complex entailment modeling (or semantic
matching) system.
3.2 Dataset Creation and Annotation Process
We created a lexical reference dataset derived
from the RTE-1 development set by randomly
choosing 400 out of the 567 text-hypothesis exam-
ples. We then created sentence-word examples for
all content words in the hypotheses which do not
appear in the corresponding sentence and are not
a morphological derivation of a word in it (since a
simple morphologic module could easily identify
these cases). This resulted in a total of 708 lexi-
cal reference examples. Two annotators annotated
these examples as described in the next section.
1These terms should not be confused with the use of lex-
ical entailment in WordNet, which is used to describe an en-
tailment relationship between verb lexical types, nor with the
related notion of reference in classical linguistics, generally
describing the relation between nouns or pronouns and ob-
jects that are named by them (Frege, 1892)
2or quoting the known journalism saying ? ?Dog bites
man? isn?t news, but ?Man bites dog? is.
Taking the same approach as of the RTE-1 dataset
creation (Dagan et al, 2006), we limited our ex-
periments to the resulting 580 examples that the
two annotators agreed upon3.
3.2.1 Annotation guidelines
We asked two annotators to annotate the
sentence-word examples according to the follow-
ing guidelines. Given a sentence and a target word
the annotators were asked to decide whether the
target word is referred by the sentence (true) or
not (false). Annotators were guided to mark the
pair as true in the following cases:
Word: if there is a word in the sentence which,
in the context of the sentence, implies a meaning
of the target word (e.g. a synonym or hyponym),
or which implies a reference to the target word?s
meaning (e.g. blind?see, sight). See examples 1-
2 in Table 1 where the word that implies the refer-
ence is emphasized in the text. Note that in exam-
ple 2 murder is not a synonym of died nor does it
share the same meaning of died; however it is clear
from its presence in the sentence that it refers to a
death. Also note that in example 8 although home
is a possible synonym for house, in the context of
the text it does not appear in that meaning and the
example should be annotated as false.
Phrase: if there is a multi-word independent ex-
pression in the sentence that implies the target (im-
plication in the same sense that a Word does). See
examples 3-4 in Table 1.
Context: if there is a clear reference to the mean-
ing of the target word by the overall meaning of
some part(s) of the sentence (possibly all the sen-
tence), though it is not referenced by any single
word or phrase. The reference is derived from the
complete context of the relevant sentence part. See
examples 5-7 in Table 1.
If there is no reference from the sentence to
the target word the annotators were instructed to
choose false. In example 9 in Table 1 the target
word ?HIV-positive? should be considered as one
word that cannot be broken down from its unit and
although both the general term ?HIV status? and
the more specific term ?HIV negative? are referred
to, the target word cannot be understood or derived
from the text. In example 10 although the year
1945 may refer to a specific war, there is no ?war?
either specifically or generally understood by the
text.

Table 1: Lexical Reference Annotation Examples
3.2.2 Annotation results
Wemeasured the agreement on the lexical refer-
ence binary task (in which Word, Phrase and Con-
text are conflated to true). The resulting kappa
statistic of 0.63 is regarded as substantial agree-
ment (Landis and Koch, 1997). The resulting
dataset is not balanced in terms of true and false
examples and a straw-baseline for accuracy is
0.61, representing a system which predicts all ex-
amples as true.
3.3 Dataset Analysis
In a similar manner to (Bar-Haim et al, 2005; Van-
derwende et al, 2005) we investigated the rela-
tionship between lexical reference and textual en-
tailment. We checked the performance of a textual
entailment system which relies solely on an ideal
lexical reference component which makes no mis-
takes and asserts that a hypothesis is entailed from
a text if and only if all content words in the hypoth-
esis are referred in the text. Based on the lexical
reference dataset annotations, such an ?ideal? sys-
tem would obtain an accuracy of 74% on the cor-
responding subset of the textual entailment task.
The corresponding precision is 68% and a recall
of 82%. This is significantly higher than the re-
sults of the best performing systems that partici-
pated in the challenge on the RTE-1 test set. This
suggests that lexical reference is a valuable sub-
task for entailment. Interestingly, a similar entail-
ment system based on a lexical reference compo-
nent which doesn?t account for the contextual lex-
ical reference (i.e. all Context annotations are re-
garded as false) would achieve an accuracy of only
63% with 41% precision and a recall of 63%. This
suggests that lexical reference in general and con-
textual entailment in particular, play an important
(though not sufficient) role in entailment recogni-
tion.
Further, we wanted to investigate the validity
of the assumption that for entailment relationship
to hold all content words in the hypothesis must
be referred by the text. We examined the exam-
ples in our dataset which were derived from text-
hypothesis pairs that were annotated as true (en-
tailing) in the RTE dataset. Out of 257 such exam-
ples only 34 were annotated as false by both anno-
tators. Table 2 lists a few such examples in which
entailment at whole holds, however, there exists a
word in the hypothesis (highlighted in the table)
which is not lexically referenced by the text. In
many cases, the target word was part of a non com-
positional compound in the hypothesis, and there-
fore should not be expected to be referenced by
the text (see examples 1-2). This finding indicates
that the basic assumption is a reasonable approxi-
mation for entailment. We could not have revealed
this fact without the dataset for the subtask of lex-
ical reference.
4 Lexical Reference Models
The lexical reference dataset facilitates qualita-
tive and quantitative comparison of various lexical
models. This section describes four state-of-the-
art models that can be applied to the lexical refer-
ence task. The performance of these models was
tested and analyzed, as described in the next sec-
tion, using the lexical reference dataset. All mod-
els assign a [0, 1] score to a given pair of text t
and target word u which can be interpreted as the
confidence that u is lexically referenced in t.

4.1 WordNet
Following the common practice in NLP applica-
tions (see Section 2.1) we evaluated the perfor-
mance of a straight-forward utilization of Word-
Net?s lexical information. Our wordnet model first
lemmatizes the text and target word. It then as-
signs a score of 1 if the text contains a synonym,
hyponym or derived form of the target word and a
score of 0 otherwise.
4.2 Similarity
As a second measure we used the distributional
similarity measure of (Lin, 1998). For a text t and
a word u we assign the max similarity score as fol-
lows:
similarity(t, u) = max
v?t
sim(u, v) (1)
where sim(u, v) is the similarity score for u and
v4.
4.3 Alignment model
(Glickman et al, 2006) was among the top scor-
ing systems on the RTE-1 challenge and supplies a
probabilistically motivated lexical measure based
on word co-occurrence statistics. It is defined for
a text t and a word u as follows:
align(t, u) = max
v?t
P(u|v) (2)
where P(u|v) is simply the co-occurrence proba-
bility ? the probability that a sentence containing v
also contains u. The co-occurrence statistics were
collected from the Reuters Corpus Volume 1.
4the scores were obtained from the following online re-
source: http://www.cs.ualberta.ca/?lindek/
downloads.htm
4.4 Baysean model
(Glickman et al, 2005) provide a contextual mea-
sure which takes into account the whole context
of the text rather than from a single word in the
text as do the previous models. This model is
the only model which addresses contextual refer-
ence rather than just word-to-word matching. The
model is based on a Na??ve Bayes text classification
approach in which corpus sentences serve as doc-
uments and the class is the reference of the target
word u. Sentences containing the word u are used
as positive examples while all other sentences are
considered as negative examples. It is defined for
a text t and a word u as follows:
bayes(t, u) =
P(u)
?
v?t P(v|u)
n(v,t)
P(?u)
?
v?t P(v|?u)
n(v,t)+P(u)
?
v?t P(v|u)
n(v,t)
(3)
where n(w, t) is the number of times word w ap-
pears in t, P(u) is the probability that a sentence
contains the word u andP(v|?u) is the probability
that a sentence NOT containing u contains v. In
order to reduce data size and to account for zero
probabilities we applied smoothing and informa-
tion gain based feature selection on the data prior
to running the model. The co-occurrence prob-
abilities were collected from sentences from the
Reuters corpus in a similar manner to the align-
ment model.
4.5 Combined Model
The WordNet and Bayesian models are derived
from quite different motivations. One would ex-
pect the WordNet model to be better in identify-
ing the word-to-word explicit reference examples
while the Bayesian model is expected to model the
contextualy implied references. For this reason we
tried to combine forces by evaluating a na??ve linear
176
interpolation of the two models (by simply averag-
ing the score of the two models). This model have
not been previously suggested and to the best of
our knowledge this type of combination is novel.
5 Empirical Evaluation and Analysis
5.1 Results
In order to evaluate the scores produced by the
various models as a potential component in an en-
tailment system we compared the recall-precision
graphs. In addition we compared the average pre-
cision which is a single number measure equiv-
alent to the area under an uninterpolated recall-
precision curve and is commonly used to evaluate
a systems ranking ability (Voorhees and Harman,
1999). On our dataset an average precision greater
than 0.65 is better than chance at the 0.05 level
and an average precision greater than 0.66 is sig-
nificant at the 0.01 level.
Figure 1 compares the average precision and
recall-precision results for the various models. As
can be seen, the combined wordnet+bayes model
performs best. In terms of average precision,
the similarity and wordnet models are comparable
and are slightly better than bayes. The alignment
model, however, is not significantly better than
random guessing. The recall-precision figure indi-
cates that the baysian model succeeds to rank quite
well both within the the positively scored wordnet
examples and within the negatively scored word-
net examples and thus resulting in improved av-
erage precision of the combined model. A better
understanding of the systems? performance is evi-
dent from the following analysis.
5.2 Analysis
Table 3 lists a few examples from the lexical refer-
ence dataset alng with their gold-standard anno-
tation and the Bayesian model score. Manual in-
spection of the data shows that the Bayesian model
commonly assigns a low score to correct examples
which have an entailing trigger word or phrase in
the sentence but yet the context of the sentence as a
whole is not typical for the target hypothesized en-
tailed word. For example, in example 5 the entail-
ing phrase ?set in place? and in example 6 the en-
tailing word ?founder? do appear in the text how-
ever the contexts of the sentences are not typical
news domain contexts of issued or founded. An in-
teresting future work would be to change the gen-
erative story and model to account for such cases.
The WordNet model identified a matching word
in the text for 99 out of the 580 examples. This
corresponds to a somewhat low recall of 25% and
a quite high precision of 90%. Table 4 lists typical
mistakes of the wordnet model. Examples 1-3 are
false positive examples in which there is a word
in the text (emphasized in the table) which is a
synonym or hyponym of the target word for some
sense in WordNet, however in the context of the
text it is not of such a sense. Examples 4-6 show
false negative examples, in which the annotators
identified a trigger word in the text (emphasized
in the table) but yet it or no other word in the text
is a synonym or hyponym of the target word.

phrase 4 12 9 4
context 15 5 56 25
false 24 5 38 226
Table 5: inter-annotator confusion matrix for the
auxiliary annotation.
As seen above, the combined model outper-
forms the others since it identifies both word-
to-word lexical reference as well as context-to-
word lexical reference. These are quite different
cases. We asked the annotators to state the sub-
category when they annotated an example as true
(as described in the annotation guidelines in Sec-
tion 3.2.1). The Word subcategory corresponds
to a word-to-word match and Phrase and Context
subcategories correspond to more than one word
to word match. As can be expected, the agreement
on such a task resulted in a lower Kappa of 0.5
which corresponds to moderate agreement (Landis
and Koch, 1997). the confusion matrix between
the two annotators is presented in Table 5. This de-
composition enables the evaluation of the strength
and weakness of different lexical reference mod-
ules, free from the context of the bigger entailment
system.
We used the subcategories dataset to test the
performances of the different models. Table 6
lists for each subcategory the recall of correctly
identified examples for each model?s 25% recall
level. The table shows that the wordnet and simi-
larity models? strength is in identifying examples
where lexical reference is triggered by a dominant
word in the sentence. The bayes model, however,

6 Conclusions
This paper proposed an explicit task definition for
lexical reference. This task captures directly the
goal of common lexical matching models, which
typically operate within more complex systems

that address more complex tasks. This defini-
tion enabled us to create an annotated dataset for
the lexical reference task, which provided insights
into interesting sub-classes that require different
types of modeling. The dataset enabled us to
make a direct evaluation and comparison of lexical
matching models, reveal insightful differences be-
tween them, and create a simple improved model
combination. In the long run, we believe that
the availability of such datasets will facilitate im-
proved models that consider the various sub-cases
of lexical reference, as well as applying supervised
learning to optimize model combination and per-
formance.
