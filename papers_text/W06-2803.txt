Abstract
Preliminary  surveys  show  that  the  lan?
guage  of  blogs  is  not  restricted  to  the 
more  informal  levels  of  expression.  In?
stead blogs may include many kinds of 
written  language:  from  simple  personal 
notes to literary prose or poetry. The pa?
per presents a sample of Italian blogs and 
comments on the results of the search of 
literary forms in two Web corpora using 
search engine queries.
1 Introduction
Close scrutiny of e-mails has revealed the pres?
ence  of  many  different  kinds  of  style  in  this 
medium  (Baron  2000:  250-2;  Pistolesi  2003: 
178-184 for Italian). The same appears to be true 
for  blogs.  It  is  therefore  difficult  to  determine 
specific linguistic features of blogs. Even occa?
sional surveys however show that blogs are not 
limited to ?a language reminiscent of brief notes, 
spoken asides, or short letters, rather than of es?
says or newsprint?. Such language plays an im?
portant  role  in  blogs,  but  accounts  for  only  a 
small part  of them. Many individual blogs aim 
instead at a true ?literary? status and have a cor?
respondingly  high  standard  for  word  selection. 
Therefore,  the  linguistic  equilibrium  of  this 
medium could be higher than expected. The pa?
per will try to describe the general linguistic fea?
tures of Italian blogs by contrasting them mainly 
with the language of newspapers, giving appro?
priate quantitative data.
2 Preliminary qualitative analysis: a tex?
tual sample
As a reference sample of blogs we can take ten 
blogs hosted by the Italian blog publishing site 
Splinder.com (arguably the most popular site of 
its kind). The sample was chosen by selecting the 
most recent blog appearing in the site list of the 
?Ultimi blog aggiornati? (?Most recently updated 
blogs?),  and  by  selecting  the  first  page  of  the 
postings published by the blog itself in Novem?
ber  2005  (if  it  had  at  least  two  postings  in 
November). The selection was made at different 
times  on  one  given  day  (29  December  2005) 
Some features of the selected blogs are described 
in Table 1.
A post taken from one of the less formal blogs 
in the sample (di ritorno da...) shows many of 
the linguistic features commonly ascribed to this 
kind of writing: 
giornata pi? tranquilla..sar? che sono a casa mia..a 
fare la mia vita..parlo appunto di mia perch? la vita 
parallela  che  sto  facendo  a  milano  non  mi 
appartiene..quindi non posso dire che sia mia..che di?
scorso complesso per? ci stava dentro bene nel conte?
sto..
ho programmato il mio capodanno..dopo due anni 
consecutivi in una baita in montagna quest'anno lascio 
l'italia..pronta per 4 gg in scozia con tre amiche..
non  vedo  l'ora..partir?  il  30  di  dicembre..aspetto 
quel giorno e intanto mi preparo per quattro esami al?
l'universit?..
ah...il viaggio al prezzo di 45 euro di volo e 90 di 
ostello..ultra risparmio...
The text  describes  the  planning  of  a  holday 
trip in Scotland for New Year's Eve and personal 
feeliings.The  post  shows  also  many  unprofes?
sional  graphic  choices  (no  capital  letters  for 
proper nouns or at the beginning of a sentence, 
no spacing after  punctuation marks,  perch? in?
stead of perch?) and the frequent use of three (or, 
11
wrongly, two) suspension points. The latter fea?
ture, also illustrated in Table 1, is considered one 
of the most common features of blogs and in this 
case it is surely used to give a feeling of ?spoken 
language? to the text.
The language of the other blogs in the sample 
is, instead, very different. Suspension points are 
used in the blog SoleLuna in order to create high-
pitched literary texts. This is a kind of lyrical de?
scription of a problematic relationship:
Cancelli i tuoi passi nell'ombra di te stesso e scom?
pari e compari quando e come pi? ti aggrada... Ed io 
mi lascio prendere dai pensieri e mi lascio intorpidire 
dai ricordi... Mi rivesto di te.. di noi.. Ho freddo.. Cer?
co di scaldarmi con il  ricordo di un amore... Non ti 
amo. Amo il  ricordo di  quello che eravamo...  E mi 
sfuggono via dalla mente le sensazioni e scivolano via 
gli  odori..  si  sbiadiscono i sapori...  Tutto diventa la 
sfumatura del  proprio colore..  la  parodia,  la  beffa... 
Cerco  di  palpare  le  immagini  e  faccio  attenzione  a 
non sgualcirle.. pi? di quanto non lo sia io...
This kind of lyric language is  heavily based 
upon  the  use  of  literary  forms  (?ti  aggrada?), 
complex rhetorical  constructions,  ?-d  eufonica? 
and so on. 
Midway between these two extremes we can 
find blogs like Incontrista. The posts of this blog 
are written in a language echoing newspaper edi?
torials  and  brilliant  prose.  Significantly,  they 
make no use of suspension points, as in this sec?
tione  (where  the  author  contrasts  the  average 
psychological differences between female blog?
gers and female subscribers of dating sites):
E' quindi un fatto ancora che le splinderine sono 
mediamente  delle  ragazze  migliori  delle  meetiche 
proprio per questo motivo. Hanno capacit?, caratteri?
stiche e aspetti che a me piacciono, come la voglia di 
esprimersi, di raccontare, di scrivere, di comunicare, 
di leggere, di scegliere, di assumere posizioni critiche. 
Le splinderine fanno parte della fascia pi? esperta e 
innovativa degli utenti internet, quelli che ne fanno un 
utilizzo pi? consapevole, e che hanno una cultura pi? 
elevata della  media.  Le splinderine sono donne che 
hanno qualcosa da dire e vogliono compagni di alto li?
vello con cui cercano il confronto serrato e accettano 
anche lo scontro.
It seems that none of those kinds of language 
could today claim to be the main model for blog 
writing. Free expression, literary prose and news?
paper  writing  seem to  co-exist  without  a  clear 
dominant  position.  Of  course,  however,  those 
impressions can be given substance only through 
extension of the field of search to a large set of 
blogs. This is partly made possible by the use of 
modern search engines.
3 Quantitative  analysis  of  large  corpora 
using search engines
Some  linguistic  features  of  blogs  can  now  be 
probed and measured using search engines. For 
instance,  preliminary  searches  show  that  from 
the orthographical point of view Italian blogs are 
much more correct than the average of the Italian 
web and that they are edited at least as well as 
online newspapers (Tavosanis in print b). Other 
indicators  related  to  the  use  of  ?neo-standard? 
Italian forms (Berruto 1987) in the field of per?
sonal  pronouns  and  demonstratives  suggest  a 
kinship between blogs and newspapers (Tavosa?
nis in print a).
According to those searches, the main differ?
ences between blog posts and newspaper articles 
are not linked to writing accuracy or to different 
morphological choices. We can therefore assume 
as a working hypothesis that the main differences 
between blogs and newspapers in fact relate to 
lexicon and syntax. 
The syntactic status of many blogs is probably 
well represented by the textual samples chosen 
above (widespread use of suspension points be?
ing  the  most  conspicuous  feature).  However, 
close  survey  of  this  level  can  probably be  ob?
tained only through the encoding of a wide cor?
pus with syntactic tagging.
The lexical  features  of  blogs  can  instead be 
studied  through  simple  search  engine  analysis 
(see again Tavosanis in print a and b for details 
of this method). Newspaper editing in Italy, en?
forced by a strong tradition and dedicated staff, 
excludes words considered too expressive (apart 
from those acknowledged by the same tradition: 
Bonomi 2002). Blogs, on the other hand, can in?
clude forms taken from every level of linguistic 
use.  We can therefore expect  that  both literary 
and low forms are  more used in blogs than in 
newspapers. 
Two Web corpora were then selected: the web 
site  of  the  newspaper  La  Repubblica,  indexed 
and queried through the Google interface (= R), 
and the whole of the blogs indexed in the beta 
version  of  Blogsearch.google.com  (=  B).  Of 
course, no exact data are available on the consis?
tency of the two collections and the number of 
tokens indexed. The two corpora seem however 
roughly equal in size:  the search of a common 
word like questo gives 427,000 occurrences in R 
12
and 467,000 in B; the search of  quello 209,000 
(R) and 257,608 occurrences (B); the search of 
lui 118,000  (R)  and  159,970  occurrences  (B); 
and so on.  Of course,  since word frequency is 
strongly correlated with the style and topic of the 
texts (for the Italian situation see Bortolini 1971: 
XIV-XV; Voghera 1993), this assessment cannot 
be considered an exact estimate. It does however 
give a preliminary quantitative estimate.
The highest frequency of vulgar words in the 
B corpus is of course undisputed, since newspa?
per editing is a strong barrier against this kind of 
language, and it needs no particular demonstra?
tion, e.g., we can find 30,310 occurrences of the 
word cazzo in B against 278 in R, and so on.
It is more difficult to demonstrate the highest 
frequency of literary language, which in the Ital?
ian tradition has a wide and varied lexicon. The 
abundance of synonyms and dispersion of forms 
lead  one  to  focus  searches  on  large  groups  of 
?weak? words instead of a limited set of ?strong? 
words.
Next the list of ?literary? verbs beginning with 
the letters b, e and v in the De Mauro (2000) dic?
tionary  was  selected  for  analysis.  The  chosen 
verbs were 31 (b-), 47 (e-) and 49 (v-). Many of 
them also had non-literary uses and/or coincided 
with  other  Italian  words:  therefore  only  the 
words  without  homographs  were  used  for  the 
search, where every meaning recorded in the dic?
tionary was marked at least as ?obsolete? (code 
OB),  ?literary?  (LE)  or  ?bureaucratic?  (BU). 
This left 23 (b-), 28 (e-) and 21 (v-) verbs. The 
two corpora were then searched for the infinitive 
forms of the verbs. Many of them did not appear 
at all: baiare, balbuzzire, ballonzare (1 occurren?
ce in a text written in the dialect of Naples), ba?
sciare,  benedicere  (2  occurrences  in  two  texts 
written in the dialect of Naples), biancicare, bia?
stemiare,  blasmare,  bombire,  botare,  botarsi, 
bravare,  buccinare,  bulicare,  ebere,  ecclissare, 
educere,  enfiare,  enfiarsi,  escomunicare,  escuo?
tere,  escusare,  esinanire,  espedire,  esseguire, 
esterminare,  estollere,  estollersi,  estorre,  estrue?
re, estruare, esturbare, esurire, evellere, evenire, 
vagheggiarsi,  vanare,  vengiare,  vengiarsi,  ver?
berare,  verdicare,  verdire,  vernare,  verzicare, 
vilificare and vincire. 
The search also revealed that a verb marked in 
the  dictionary  as  ?literary?  was  instead  widely 
used in both corpora: vigilare. While other forms 
occurred at most 94 times, in the corpora there 
are 644 occurrences of vigilare, evenly balanced 
(332 in B, 312 in R). It therefore appears more 
correct  to  consider  this  verb  as  a  ?common? 
word,  without  literary connotations,  and to  ex?
clude it from further analysis.
In a second phase, many forms were excluded 
from counts since they resulted simple typos or 
broken forms of different words (e.g., many oc?
currences of  ventare  are in fact  occurrences of 
widely  used  verbs  like  diventare  or  inventare, 
with  incorrect  spacing).  Only words  where  the 
possibilities  of  misspellings  seemed  low  were 
therefore included In the counts.
After this sifting, the forms represented in the 
corpus occurred as described in Table 2:

bastarsi 12 1
beare 9 2

Total 230 65
Table 2: occurrences of literary forms
It seems therefore that some Italian blogs have 
in fact a higher proportion of a random selection 
of literary words than Italian newspapers. Further 
searches should be able to confirm or refute this 
finding.

4 Conclusion
Preliminary  analyses  of  Italian  blogs  seem  to 
confute the simple equivalence ?blogs = informal 
text?.  Clearly,  both statistical  tools and special 
monitoring software are needed to give this kind 
of  search  more  focus  and  more  depth.  Future 
searches must also achieve a better understand?
ing of the coverage of search engines and should 
be based upon different search engines. It would 
be useful, moreover, to identify and exploit other 
searchable indicators of the linguistic quality of a 
text. Anyway in future researches adequate space 
should be allowed for the assessment of the pres?
ence of literary features in many blogs.
