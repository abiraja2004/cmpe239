Abstract 
An experimental system for dialogue 
structure analysis based on a new type plan 
recognition model for spoken dialogues has been 
implemented. This model is realized by using 
four typed plans which are categorized into three 
kinds of universal pragmatics and a ldnd of task- 
dependent knowledge related to common action 
h ierarch ies .  The exper imenta l  sys tem is 
character i zed  by h igher  modu lar i ty  and 
computational efficiency through defining a 
h ie rarch ica l  usage order  between these  
knowledges. The system can grasp a dialogue 
structure making it possible to solve problems 
related to spoken dialogue interpretation. 
1. INTRODUCTION 
An efficient, and smooth communicat ion 
be'~ween humans is generally realized in spoken 
dialogues. This fact is mainly supported by 
various el l ipsis exp:?essions concerning old 
information, the dialogue participants, zero- 
pronouns - especially in dapanese, substitutional 
verbs and so on. Ass  result, each utterance is 
fragmental. A sequence of these ut terances 
generally construct a whole dialogue step by 
step. \['ragmental utterance comprehension by a 
hearer can be achieved using knowledge of the 
dialogue sitamtion, context intbrmation, domain 
dependent knowledge, especially the donmin 
dependent  ac t ion  h ie rarchy \ [L i tman871,  
universal pragmatics concerning how to advance 
a dialogue, mainta in  dialogue cooperat ion  
between d ia logue par t i c ipants ,  etc. ,  and 
language specific pragmatics \[Levinson831. Such 
ellii;sis-resolution-is one of the main problems in 
discourse understanding. Several approaches 
were proposed and implemented in \[fiendrix781, 
\ [Sh imazu79\ ] ,  \ [Carbonel1831,  etc.  These  
researchers used various heuristic rules and did 
not make a clear distinction between domain 
~pecific knowledge and pragmat ics .  As a 
consequence,  the user  in ter face  became 
inflexible because the system basically handled 
expected utterance patterns. 
*(1) :A discourse goal is characterized by a discourse 
expectation which dialogue participants mutually believe 
as an expectation. Therefore, a discourse goal is very vague 
because a expectation depends on various attentions or 
empathies and the participant's knowledge, 
*(2) :Allowing embedded turn-takings. 
*(3):A communicative act is basically defined as an 
abstract action, one that effects the bearer's thinking or 
deci,qiommaking and which can be described by a plan 
schema (cf. Cohen84). 
Recent ly ,  a p lan -based  d ia logue  
understanding approach was developed using a 
kind of pragmatics metaplan: a 'discourse plan' 
incorporated with domain knowledge, 'domain 
plan' \[Litnmn871. This approach was based on 
Allen & Perrault's plan recognition strategies 
\[AllenS0\], \[PerraultS0\], [Allen871. By way of 
contrast ,  a pragmat ic-based approach was 
proposed in order to understand intersentential 
elliptical fragments \[Carberry891. She claimed 
Litnmn's st rategies  could not recognize a 
surprise o rs  doubt conveyed by an elliptical 
fragment, for example "$10,000 ":",. which is not a 
complete sentence including postulated speech 
acts 'request' or 'inform'. In addition, she also 
c la imed that  metap lans  represent ing  
communicat ive goals should be dealt  with 
adequately. She newly introduced 'discourse 
expectat ion'  rules for grasping interact ion 
between an in fo rmat ion -seeker  and an 
information-provider and 'discourse goal' rules 
for ident i fy ing  an in fo rmat ion -seeker ' s  
conversational or communicat ive goa\[*(l). 
These rules are heuristics for interpreting an 
elliptical fragment which explicitly indicates no 
linguistic clues to interpreting speech act.s. On 
the other hand, in order to make the general 
understanding mechanism clear, a surprise or a 
doubt fragment such as mentioned above, must 
be understood from recognizing an irregular 
meaning from the view of gaps between common 
sense (a certain prerequisite ondition) and the 
declarat ion. Fur thermore ,  studying how to 
express a query, an answer, a confirmation, a 
surprise or a doubt in a context and a dialogue 
situation is necessary. 
In considerat ion of mak ing  a d ia logue 
unders tand ing  model  inc lud ing  such an 
understanding process, a method to handle 
pragmaties and utterance or dialogue must be 
s tud ied .  Th is  l?aj)er shows three  typed  
pragmat ies  use(t 1or cooperat ive  d ia logue 
development, as well as a dialogue structure 
analysis and understandinfi model using a plan 
recognit ion approach. ' lhe pragmat lcs  are 
described by a 'dialogue plan', 'communication 
plan' and 'interaction plan'. 
2. THREE TYPED PRAGMATICS 
Three types of universal pragmat ies  (el. 
LevinsonS3) can be classified and described by 
the following plans: Interaction-Plan - a plan 
basically eharaeter ized by a dialogue turn- 
taking*(2) which descr ibes  a sequence  of 
communicative acts*(3), Communication-Plan - 
a plan which determines how to execute or 
370  
achieve an utterance goal or dialogue goals, and 
Dialogued:qan : a plan for establ ishing a
dialogue construction, e.g. a cooperative 
dialogue*(4). 
For example, in order to achieve the goal of 
registering for the conference tim following 
sequer, ce must usually be performed (Domain- 
Plan}: obtain a registration form, fill out the 
form and return it to the secretariat. In such a 
telephone dialo}'ue, if something is needed to 
execute the gore action, a request o send it can 
be made, or it wil l  be of fered to you 
(Co:mmunication-t) lan). To complete the 
cooperative infbrnmtion-seeking, thehearer will 
resl)ond to the speaker's request*(5) (Interaction- 
Plan). Beiorc building a whole dia logue 
structure, the speaker should utter the opening 
section of the dialogue, especial ly on the 
telephone. Furthermore when the dialogue is 
finished, the speaker should wide up the 
dialogue (Dialogue-Plan). 
Each plan is described in terms of a schema 
formulation (plan-schema). 
A plan-schema has various lots to describe both 
an action's inner properties, e.g. HEADER and 
41 r~ ,l ? ? PI{LI) ICAIE&CASES, and re lat ionstt lps  
between the act ion and prerequ is i te  
states/actions, effects, etc., e.g. PREREQUISITE, 
DECOMPOSITIONS,  CONSTRAINTS,  
EFFECTS. 
A definite hierarchical order among these 
plans is available as follows; 
Interaction-Plan > Communication-Plan >
Domain-Plan > Dialogue-Plan. 
3. DIALOGUE ANALYSIS 
There are several linguistic phenomena 
which are hard to interpret, such as ellipses, 
re fer r ing  pronouns and subst i tu t iona l  
expressions. Both in format ion  from the 
established context and expectations from the 
current dialogue situation are required to 
resolve such problems. In order to get these 
information a dialogue structure which indicates 
the goal hierarchy of utterances in a dialogue 
must be constructed. A dialogue analysis is 
required and it is necessary todetermine ; 
(1) how to infer each goal of an utterance 
within a dialogue, 
(2) how to make clear the relationships 
between goals within the dialogue. 
For the first problem, a plan recognition 
inference method is adequate for identifying an 
utterance intention because the intention can be 
inferred by recognizing the speaker's plan by 
chaining communicative acts regarded as speech 
acts in a specific domain \[Allen80), \[Perrault80\], 
\[Litman 87\]. For the second problem, the 
*(4) :A dialogue global construction usually has an opening 
section and closing section. I lere, such a linguistic 
phenotmnon is regarded as language-universal. 
*(5) :On the other hand, in order to complete the cooperative 
interaction, when the speaker imparts information, the 
hearer will confirm what the speaker has said according to 
the speaker's belief in the hearer's intention. 
*(6) An active chart parser has been developed for 
Japanese dialogue analysis on a unification based grammar, 
which is based on IIPSG and JPSG \[Pollard88), \[Gunji87\], 
\[Kogure89\]. Furthermore, many discourse entities can be 
identified by using NP Identification Method \[Nogaito88\]. 
domain..specific, knowledge is related to the 
action and objects, especial ly the act ion 
hierarchy which is used to grasp the utterance 
~ oal, and three kinds of pragmatics between unmns involved in a spoken dialogue are used 
to grasp the dialogue development. 
3A Communicative Acts 
First, in order to recognize the speaker's 
plan, it is necessary torecognize the turn-taking 
patterns. Communicative acts \[Cohen84\] are 
int roduced . In F ig . l ,  an example  of 
communicative acts in a cooperative task- 
oriented ialogue, e.g. 'queries and explanations 
regarding registration for an international 
conference' is shown. 
A communicative act in the demand class 
and a corresponding act in the response class 
make a turn-taking pair. This is recognized by 
the interaction plan. A communicative act is a 
decomposition element of an interaction plan. 
Denmnd Class Response Class

"Whet, is the deadline? . . . .  The deadline for the 
paper is,J une 3." 
Confirm-value . Affirmative 
"The deadline is Jtme 3, isn't it? . . . .  Yes, it is."

3.2 Inference Mechanism 
'An utterance meaning is represented by 
illocutionary speech act types and propositional 
contents  obtained from a t lead-Dr iven  
unification-based active chart parser*(6) for 
Japanese dialogues. The parsing result  is 
described by a feature structure and tim system 
input is modified into a communicative act with 
propositional contents. These consist of a certain 
predicate, an 'utterance type', and some 
variables, in particular, 'speaker', hearer', and 
'topic'. 'Topic' is, on a surface level, an NP 
marked with the Japanese special particle, 'wa', 
or the compound particle 'nituite'. 
The plan recognizer (1) assumes a goal. (2) If 
a particular goal cannot be found, then stop else 
goto next (3). (3) Infer a chaining path from an 
input to the goal. If success, stop. Else return to 
the first process (1) in order to try to find the next 
candidate. The chaining process between plans 
generally finds a candidate plan from the 
current state (IIEADER) to an action list 
represented in I)ECOMPOSITtON. Ilowever if 
this fails, the chaining will be continued in 
accordance with PREREQUISITE and EFFECT. 
In order  to manage the cur rent  
understanding state, the system uses two slacks. 
UN1)ERSTANDING-IAST stores completed 
plans as the current understanding state, and 
GOAL-IAST mainta ins  incomplete plans 
regarded as possibilities and expectations for 
-2- 371 
fu ture  goals . An overv iew of  a d ia logue  
structure construction process is shown in Fig.2. 
4. AN EXPERIMENTAL  SYSTEM 
This analysis model is realized by using lout" 
typed plans which are categor ized into Ulree 
types of universal  pragmatics and a type o? task- 
dependent knowledge related to common action 
hierarchies. The system has been implemented 
in Symbolics Common Lisp. A dialogue structure 
is represented  by both completed p lans  and 
incomplete  p lans  s tored in the two stacks.  
Therefore,  the system can understand ialogue 
meanings and can offer a dia logue s t ructure  
using the contents of both stacks. Four  model 
dialogues regarding an internat ional  conference 
registrat ion taken from slightly modified inter- 
keyboard  d ia logues  in Japanese  have been 
applied. For example, the system can understand 
a Japanese substitutional expression,  e.g. "O- 
isog-i kudasa i"  ( l i tera l  t rans la t ion  : 'Hur ry  
please') which shows no agent, no object and no 
verb, because the current  topic which is focused 
on an action in the domain plan is known in the 
system and the omitted verb (e.g. 'Return-Form') 
can be identified under the scope dominated by 
the topic. 
5.  CONCLUSION 
Litman & Allen introduced a set of discourse 
plans, each one corresponding to a par t i cu la r  
way that an utterance can relate to a discourse 
topic. They dist inguish discourse plans from a 
set of domain plans. The dia logue s t ructure  
analysis model basically follows the above idea 
and  uses  new three  typed pragmat ics :  
in teract ion  p lan,  communicat ion  p lan  and 
dialogue plan. By introducing these plans, the 
mech~mism for construct ing a dialogue structure 
becomes - c lear  because of the way a sur face  
utterance is connected with both pragmatics and 
the domain-specif ic knowledge, and by reducing 
the search space using a hierarchical  order  of 
applying knowledge, computat ional  efficiency is 
improved.
