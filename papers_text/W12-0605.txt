A User and NLP-Assisted Strategic Workflow for a  
Social Semantic OWL 2-Based Knowledge Platform  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Abstract 
Originating from a multidisciplinary research 
project that gathers, around the Semantic 
Web standards and principles, Social 
Networking and Natural Language 
Processing along with some Bioinformatics 
notions, this paper sheds the light on some of 
the most critical aspects of the 
correspondingly adopted framework and real-
time knowledge architecture and modeling 
platform. It recognizes the considerable 
profits of an appropriate fusion between the 
aforementioned disciplines, especially via the 
proper exploitation of OWL 2 (Web 
Ontology Language) features and novelties, 
typically OWL 2 language profiles. 
Accordingly, it proposes a distinctive 
workflow with well-defined strategies for an 
ontology-aware user and NLP-assisted 
flexible and multidimensional approach for 
the management of the abundantly available 
Social data. Application scenarios related to 
awareness and orientation recommender 
systems based on biomedical domain 
ontologies for childhood obesity prevention 
and surveillance are explored as typical proof 
of concept application areas. 
1 Introduction 
In parallel with the Semantic Web's extremely 
active research community lies a continuous and 
exceptionally rising propagation of the Social 
Web. A remarkable advancement can be made if 
a proper methodology for maximizing the 
cooperation between the two webs can be set. 
Such a methodology should highly encourage the 
first Web to bring in its theories and formalisms 
to the second, in exchange for some of the latter's 
popularity and proliferation. 
 An amplified fusion between the Social and 
the Semantic Webs is indeed a strongly 
beneficial achievement to both disciplines. It 
shall solve the foremost problems undergone by 
each of them, yielding an outcome that by far 
surpasses the sum of its individual components 
by endorsing automation, standardization and 
interoperability, promoting efficient information 
extraction, querying and aggregations, and 
providing valuable large data sets to feed the 
Semantic Web applications from the abundant 
social networking Web 2.0 sites (SNS). These 
sites will successively benefit from Semantic 
Web applications to generate semantically-rich 
data, and an overall reflection of the henceforth 
strongly formalized Social Web's network effect 
on the Semantic Web, boosting its formerly 
limited usage (Breslin et al, 2009).  
 By delving into the Semantic Web's main 
achievements for Social Networking (SN), this 
research notices a lack in those involving the 
Semantic Web's advanced findings and relatively 
complicated vocabularies and grammars, 
particularly in the endeavors related to OWL 2 
(Web Ontology Language) novelties. In addition, 
it recognizes the major limitations and concerns 
related to complexity and accuracy when dealing

with ontology-aware Natural Language 
Processing for large amounts of data. 
 As a consequence, it proposes a promising 
flexible and multidimensional user and NLP-
assisted workflow for social data management 
encompassing different strategies varying 
according to prerequisite constraints and 
concerns. The proposed workflow is highlighted 
as part of a knowledge architecture and modeling 
platform that in addition to its possible 
incorporation of previous efforts, includes formal 
methods and models for more advanced 
Semantic Web accomplishments in support of 
SN.  
 The paper thus introduces a backbone 
knowledge base repository while laying a 
particular emphasis on an anticipated "meta-
semantics" model, revealing the numerous 
advantages it offers such as its particular 
language and fragment projection capabilities 
and the considerably gained flexibility whilst 
addressing a favorable application area along 
with appropriate corresponding profile reasoning 
facilities.  
 Furthermore, the suggested innovative policy 
for applying ontology-aware pattern-matching 
grammars for natural language processing, 
recommends a layered approach that considers 
preconditioned concerns and constraints to 
loosen or restrict text parsing procedures. On the 
other hand, it confers a Web 2.0 user 
collaboration novelty residing in promoting SN  
users "rule tagging" assignments that are initiated 
on account of domain-specific semantic 
arrangements in the knowledge base repository. 
This optional user intervention feature 
determines the semi-automatic as opposed to the 
fully automatic adopted strategy. 
 The overall initiative leads to valuable and 
fruitful foundations of semantically engineered 
social data for efficient decision support and 
recommender systems. 
 Conversely, data and methodologies for 
relevant application scenarios aiming at 
awareness and orientation recommender systems 
based on biomedical domain ontologies are 
provided to support the different endeavors and 
provide typical proof of concept application 
areas. 
 Following is a summary of the key 
contributions: 
? Highlights on the critical aspects of an 
inclusive approach and framework for a 
knowledge architecture and modeling 
platform, in its comprised layers and 
methodologies  
? A flexible and multi-dimensional social 
data management strategy 
? An analysis of the proposed strategy's 
sub-approaches  encompassing a crucial 
NLP component 
? A description and emphasis on the user's 
role in assigning "semantic rule tags". 
 The rest of this paper is organized as follows: 
in the next section, we provide an overview of 
some of the related background work. Section 3 
presents a very brief overview of the enclosing 
knowledge framework and platform; in Section 
4, the user and NLP-assisted workflow is 
portrayed and analyzed; Section 5 exposes OWL 
2-supported demonstrating scenarios that endow 
with recommender systems based on an ontology 
for childhood obesity surveillance. We finally 
wrap up with a conclusions section that 
comprises a closing discussion and highlights on 
future work. 
2 Contextual Background Overview 
Description Logics (DL) are a family of 
knowledge representation languages (Baader et 
al., 2006) having building blocks consisting of 
three kinds of entities: concepts, roles and 
individual names. A DL ontology consists of 
statements called axioms formed based on the 
different types of entities and separated into three 
groups: the set of terminological axioms TBox, 
assertional axioms ABox, and relational axioms 
RBox. 
 While the NLP-related background work will 
be progressively  presented in its related Section 
4, we will provide herein some general 
background information related to OWL 2 
novelties on the one hand, and to the main 
relevant Semantic Web realizations for the Social 
Web on the other.   
2.1 OWL 2 and Description Logics 
Concepts 
Relying on Description Logics, OWL 2 was 
designed to overcome limitations encountered in 
the initial version of OWL and to compensate for 
them (W3C, 2009). It presents extended 
expressivity, convenience features and various 
capabilities that will prove to be particularly 
beneficial for the SN typical data expressed in 
blogs, wikis, feedback updates, etc. OWL 2 
profiles are among the novelty aspects that will 
38
  
mostly be referred to across different sections in 
this paper. 
 OWL 2 Profiles (also known as tractable 
fragments are "trimmed-down" versions of OWL 
2 DL; they are the result of a simple trade 
between all-inclusive expressivity and efficient 
reasoning. Every fragment addresses a favorable 
application area; it is therefore essential to 
identify the target scenario in order to apply the 
accordingly most favorable profile. In terms of 
reasoning engines, the regular OWL 2 reasoners 
are applicable; however, more capable 
specifically designed ones based on every 
fragment's constructs have been built. 
The main profiles presented for OWL 2 are: 
? OWL 2 EL: conceived for the reasoning 
over large-scale ontologies based on the 
EL++ family of description logics 
(Baader et al, 2005). This profile offers 
OWL's expressive features required by 
large-scale ontologies such as the 
"Systemised Nomenclature of Medicine - 
Clinical Terms" (SNOMED-CT) 
renowned ontology1. 
? OWL 2 QL: enabling conjunctive 
queries' satisfiability based on the DL-
Lite family of description logics 
(Calvanese et al, 2007), conceived 
specifically for reasoning with large 
amounts of data organized consistently 
with relatively simple schemata. 
? OWL 2 RL: a forward-chaining rule 
processing system supporting 
conjunctive rules and relying on a rule-
based description logics fragment 
(Grosof et al, 2003) and on parts of 
OWL Full rule-based implementations 
(ter Horst, 2005). 
2.2 Social Semantic Web Efforts and 
Ontologies 
The main efforts undergone based on a 
cooperation between the Semantic and the Social 
Webs have yielded a vast number of interesting 
SN specifications, ontologies and projects.  Some 
of the main contributions that our framework is 
set to be compatible with, to reuse and/or extend, 
are summarized next: 
? The Semantically Interlinked Online 
Community (SIOC 2 ) initiative presents 
an ontology for representing user 
activities in blogs and forums, thus

 www.sioc-project.org 
increasing the integration of the 
information in online communities. 
SIOC is a description of online-
community information. It offers a 
means to represent "rich data" from the 
Social Web in RDF  (Bojars et al, 2008). 
? The Friend-of-a-Friend (FOAF 3 ) is an 
ontology for describing people along 
with their relationships. FOAF can be 
integrated with other Semantic Web 
vocabularies and has been established as 
the most broadly used domain ontology 
on the semantic web (Miller and 
Brickley, 2010). 
? The Meaning of a Tag (MOAT 4 ) 
framework allows the association of tags 
to semantics, via linking them to 
knowledge base URIs such as DBpedia 
(Auer et al, 2007), GeoNames 5 , etc. 
(Passant and Laublet, 2008). 
3 Introducing the Overall Framework 
The various efforts described in this paper are all 
enfolded in an already conceptualized framework 
for a knowledge architecture and modeling 
platform that we briefly present herein. Figure 1 
provides a high level depiction of its main flow, 
components and layers. 
 Having as its core aim the extension of the 
cooperation between the Social and the Semantic 
Webs via an underlined use of highly developed 
and expressive Description Logics-based 
languages - namely OWL 2, this framework 
comprises: a knowledge base repository to hold 
the ontological data, rules and axioms, including 
specialized domain ontologies, and previously 
defined social semantic ones; a user and natural 
language processing-assisted approach to parse 
and detect semantics from SN Website data (to 
be explored in the next section),  as well as 
dedicated reasoning capabilities to offer a variety 
of knowledge and information system services 
and facilities. Typical reasoning services, 
typically elucidated in (Baader et al, 2006), like 
classification and subsumption, satisfiability and 
instance checking, inference discovery and query 
answering, rule validation and processing, are the 
means by which the outcome decision support 
systems capabilities are attainable. The backbone 
repository (based on the Semantic Meta-Object-
Facility, SMOF (OMG, 2010), another OWL 2

feature) also holds dedicated structures known as 
meta-semantics structures; they play a  crucial 
role in sorting and grouping the different axioms 
in the knowledge base, to later allow automatic 
scaling or downscaling between the OWL 2 
sublanguages having varying levels of 
expressivity. Algorithms and methods that allow 
this categorization procedure are beyond the 
scope of this paper, but it is worth noting that this 
process will have an important impact at the 
different platforms' levels, notably the NLP-
based social data management and ontology 
population workflow that forms the spotlight of 
this manuscript.   
4 Proposed User and NLP-Assisted 
Ontology Population Workflow 
The proposed strategy that will allow the 
generation of semantic annotations and the 
consequent ontological data population is next 
explored. In a few words, it is a 
multidimensional and flexible user and  NLP-
assisted approach relying on SN data constraints 
and knowledge based prerequisites for automatic 
or at least semi-automatic domain specific 
expressive ontology population.  
4.1 Online Social Data Sources and NLP 
Background 
The different Web 2.0 platforms such as 
Twitter 6 , Facebook 7 , LinkedIn 8 , as well as 
conventional Web logs (blogs), wikis and forums 
websites all form adequate sources of online SN 
data to be exploited by our framework, but surely 
with different levels of availability. Throughout 
our explored overall framework, we mostly rely 
on blog and forum posts, due to their 
accessibility facilities. 
 The data parsing layer targeting semantic 
information extraction from the available SN 
data is based on GATE (the General Architecture 
for Text Engineering) (Cunningham, 2002). 
GATE has rapidly grown and evolved to turn 
into one of the most mature NLP platforms. 
GATE's effectiveness in ontology-aware 
language processing has already been 
demonstrated within several studies and projects, 
such as KIM 9 , a platform for Information 
Extraction using GATE and targeting large-scale 
semantic annotation and ontology population 
based on the PROTON 10  lightweight ontology.

Some efforts are even directed at more 
expressive OWL-DL support (Witte et al, 2010). 
In the scope of our framework, we exploit similar 
efforts, we further follow  our proposed 
workflow strategy and as a consequence, we 
reach an automatic or at least semi-automatic 
creation of the semantic annotations that 
accordingly lead to the population of our 
expressive domain ontologies with data 
compatible with existing relevant SN ontologies 
(FOAF11, SIOC12, etc.). 
4.2 User and NLP-Assisted Workflow for 
Social Data Management 
In an ideal situation, a straightforward fully 
automatic ontology population with instances 
assigned based on the ontology-aware NLP 
grammars allows the populated ontology to be 
readily exploitable by the different OWL 
reasoners. Constraints and considerations related 
to the length of the massive social data in 
question, as well as to the level of expressivity 
and complexity of the ontology's semantics 
stimulates the conceptualization and adoption of 
a more flexible and beneficial strategy and 
workflow, illustrated in Figure 2, that aims at 
overcoming or at least limiting the different 
constraints' significance. 
 As a particular processing aspect that is 
proper to our overall previously described 
framework, a more progressive role held by the 
SN User is highlighted. A user is accordingly 
encouraged to explicitly authenticate and even 
communicate meaningful expressive rules based 
on provided suggestions. We describe such a role 
with the terminology of "rules tagging" 
assignment, enthused by the different SN tagging 
systems - for instance Flickr13 and Del.icio.us14 - 
that make it possible for users to tag their photos, 
documents and webpages with simple descriptive 
taxonomies. 
 For a more comprehensive interpretation of 
Figure 2, we start by considering the main 
constraints to be taken into account a priori, 
those being the concerns related to the amount of 
data to be processed, and the complexity of the 
ontology grammar. 
Unless the availability of massive amounts of 
data to handle is not deemed problematic,

predefined mostly impacting subsets of the 
original data can be arranged in accordance with: 
? The blog or forum post title 
? The first sentence or paragraph 
? The last sentence or paragraph 
? A preset number of lines 
? A preset number of sentences or 
paragraphs 
? The blogs and forums relevant to a 
particular SNS that is known to be 
mostly dedicated to our domain or sub-
domain in question 
? The blogs and forums satisfying a 
certain chronological period 
? The blogs and forums containing 
specific keywords (domain critical 
elements) 
? Combinations of the above elements 
 
 
 
Figure 2: Workflow Illustration 
 
Conversely, unless it is estimated more 
advantageous to deal with the full ontology, or at 
least the ensemble of axioms accepted by the 
employed NLP tool and appropriately developed 
grammars, semantic strategies can be adopted to 
deal with expressivity and complex ontology 
constructs concerns based on: 
41
  
? DL particular less expressive 
sublanguages, typically the OWL 2 
profiles already introduced 
? DL specific types of constructs, 
assessed as mostly critical for the global 
flow 
? Most significant ontology classes or 
concepts 
? Particular key axioms or expressions 
? Preset number of levels to go deep in 
the ontology hierarchy 
? A particular branch or set of branches in 
the ontology hierarchy 
? The set of axioms and expressions 
relevant to  certain given concept/s 
? Proper combinations of the above 
To note that all these conditions and strategies 
are made possible through the backbone 
repository's already introduced "meta-semantics" 
structures. 
 As a result of all the above, and based on the 
presented inputs, constraints and limitations, 
different scenarios can be arranged, and we end 
up with one of four "possible sub-approaches" as 
denoted in the illustration: 
? Full text processing and open semantics 
approach, which encompasses thorough 
analysis and semantic matching covering 
complicated rules and grammars, which 
increases implementation complexity, 
performance and accuracy concerns. 
? Open semantics on restricted data 
approach, in which the originally large 
amount of data to be processed is 
minimized. 
? Full text processing with semantics 
restrictions approach, in which we can 
afford managing large amounts of data, 
but require a low degree of development 
complexity, and correspondingly a high 
accuracy of the attained results. 
? Data and semantics restricted approach, 
which minimizes the large amounts of 
processable data, as well as performance 
and accuracy concerns. 
These defined NLP-assisted approaches have 
corresponding meta structures in our metadata 
repository. Such structures retain information 
related to the source data's SNS Web 2.0 
platforms, to their related conditions and 
parameters for data and semantics restrictions. 
Having reached this stage, the availability or 
absence of the SNS user collaboration will 
determine whether the overall strategy towards 
ontology population is fully or semi automatic. 
Back to the role of the user in his "rule tagging" 
assignment, and to lay more emphasis on this 
role, we highlight the provisional output resulting 
from the described NLP strategy, which mainly 
consists of constructed templates of preliminary 
non-validated sets of semantics, including 
identity relations and rules, thus made available 
in a user friendly questionnaire form to 
optionally confirm, correct or even add more 
expressive axioms and details. Although not 
mandatory, this semi-automatic approach that 
includes a user intervention is deemed extremely 
advantageous, especially for the open semantics 
case where the available NLP technology has 
severe restrictions upon dealing with somewhat 
complex and expressive vocabularies and 
ontologies. Nevertheless, it is the overall 
flexibility provided at both the data and 
semantics level that will limit the accuracy 
concerns encountered in traditional NLP 
approaches. 
5 Proof of Concept and Application 
Scenarios 
Our efforts are being carried out under the scope 
of parents' awareness and orientation. Useful 
SNS data sources typically beneficial for our 
domain are "Mom Bloggers". While these sites 
are extremely active and abundant, most of our 
data is extracted based on Babycenter15 (which 
alone counts more than 20 million users), Canada 
Moms Blog 16 , Raising Children Network 17 , 
among others. 
As part of the Brain-to-Society (BtS) (Dub? et 
al., 2008) research endeavors that call for a  
whole-of-society (WoS) transformation, centered 
on the indivudual, the Childhood Obesity 
[Knowledge] Enterprise (COPE) ontology was 
conceived (Shaban-Nejad et al, 2011) with the 
aim of allowing cross-sectional analysis of the 
obesity domain and consequently generating both 
generic and customized preventive 
recommendations. Figure 3 depicts an 
OntoGraf18 visualization of a  partial view of its 
major concepts and relationships.

COPE?s data sources (mainly relevant to TBox 
and RBox ontological data, apart from the 
assertional ABox data generated from our 
ontology population workflow) are: RAMQ 19 , 
Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS20) 
(population health database), CARTaGENE 21 , 
which offer information on medical history, 
genealogical data, lifestyles, etc..  
 The COPE ontology was extended and 
enriched with OWL 2 constructs to maximize its 
richness and expressivity and be able to take 
advantage of different language projection and 
reasoning facilities provided by our real-time 
knowledge architecture and modeling platform. 
It has hence served as a source for our 
semantically aware NLP grammars and 
Information Extraction algorithms.  
 To concretize a possible approach from the 
already proposed strategic workflow (the data 
and semantics restricted approach),  a hybrid 
methodology that considers the full ontological 
data related to childhood obesity risks for posts 
reported in 2012, performs a first phase of 
processing in which the filtering of all textual 
data compliant with the specified data 
restrictions occurs, and then proceeds to the 
remaining detailed semantics-based analysis.

 The rest of the flow depends on an optional 
user validation phase that will precede the 
population of our knowledge base with the 
detected ABox assertional data. Interoperability 
is ensured through an established link between 
detected individuals and existing FOAF users 
within the SIOC communities. 
 Having reached this stage, reasoning 
procedures can be applied in order to attain the 
required  services for our awareness and 
orientation recommender systems related to 
childhood obesity surveillance. Redirection 
mechanisms, based on the projected languages

and fragments, target advanced and powerful 
reasoners and rule engines. For example, Pellet 
(Sirin et al, 2007) can handle OWL 2 DL and 
RL, RacerPro (Haarslev and M?ller, 2001; 
Haarslev et al, 2008) can manage a subset OWL 
2 DL and OWL 2 EL, HermiT (Motik et al, 
2007) and FacT++ (Tsarkov et al, 2006) can 
cope with OWL 2 DL. On the other hand, the 
Jena framework (2007) and the database Oracle 
11g enable the processing of OWL 2 RL rules, 
whereas Quill (Thomas and Pan, 2009) a TrOWL 
(Thomas et al, 2010) component provide OWL 2 
QL querying capabilities. 
6 Conclusions 
Apart from providing a maximal set of consistent 
and accurate semantics, fostering such a user and 
NLP-assisted workflow can prove to be 
advantageous at many levels. We can underline a 
few extra issues, by considering for example the 
"Open World Assumption" which is evidently 
appropriate for the context of textual blog 
information dealt with in this research: a 
statement or fact not explicitly mentioned in a 
blog does not disprove its existence. 
Nevertheless, to deal with certain critical rules 
and axioms, for which the availability of accurate 
data is deemed much more valuable for our 
working framework, an exclusive approach can 
be embraced in order to possibly "close the 
world" related to these critical facts. Closing 
axioms can be identified in our backbone 
repository, and presented to the user, inviting 
them to key in their exact input. Furthermore, the 
intensional reasoning required in any application 
involving natural language processing presents 
DL-safety restrictions, due to conclusions 
referring to unnamed objects. By offering this 
user rule tagging facility, we can limit the effects 
of such constraints. In all cases, relying on a 
collective effort through which rules and 
semantics are gathered and validated, before 
becoming instance and ontology enrichment 
elements is a much more profitable and effective 
approach.  
 A well-populated knowledge base, 
henceforth enriched with semantically 
engineered social data, is consequently 
accessible for further extensive reasoning and 
analysis. The outcome reached surpasses by far 
the sum of its social and semantic data 
components, typically leading to significant 
services and recommender systems. 
 Taking into consideration the applicable 
involved reasoning, the opportunity of 
identifying, creating and expanding social and 
semantic networks is presented. Implemented 
algorithms allow opinion mining, detection of 
ties and similarities between people, leading to 
connections via shared interests or any possible 
common ground areas. For instance, semantic 
networks are initiated based on the algorithms' 
ability to retrieve people with same or similar 
goals, tastes, origins, backgrounds, etc., and to 
further apply advanced reasoning with the 
intention of providing suggestions, 
recommendations, possible solutions, feedbacks, 
openings, and so on. More straightforward Web 
Social Networks can be deduced through the 
users' joint actions and interactions, their created, 
commented upon, linked to, or similarly 
annotated contents. 
 Many aspects of the conclusions and findings 
will thus be related to the concept of "object-
centered sociality", which connects people via 
the common interests associated with their 
occupations, hobbies, jobs, etc. 
 Analogous features accessible through this 
semantically engineered social data and possibly 
serving the purposes of recommender systems 
include the ability to perform: 
? User profiling, clustering and 
segmentation based on certain traits and 
criteria, all of which are endeavors 
considered closely related to opinion 
mining undertakings 
? Tracking processes to identify a user?s 
Web history from different Web 2.0 
platforms, outlining this user?s general 
overall contributions to the Web and 
reporting their different activities, goals 
and problems 
? Improved quality of the search process, 
with ego-centric algorithms and searches 
to identify a key user?s associated or 
closely related nodes, as well as 
community detection algorithms to trace 
two or more key users? surrounding 
community 
 In terms of future work, we plan to pursue 
fostering our different efforts that include 
implementation and verification tools, looking 
for the incorporation of maximized sets of rules 
and Description Logics-based fragments, 
providing further validating ground for the 
widest set of the aforementioned potentials and 
promises.
