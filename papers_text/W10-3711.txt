Abstract
In this paper we tackle the challenging
task of Multi-word term (MWT) extrac-
tion from different types of specialized
corpora. Contrastive filtering of previ-
ously extracted MWTs results in a con-
siderable increment of acquired domain-
specific terms.
1 Introduction
Multi-word term (MWT) extraction is a challeng-
ing and well-known automatic term recognition
(ATR) subtask, aimed at retrieving complex do-
main terminology from specialized corpora. Al-
though domain sublanguages are characterized by
specific vocabularies, a well-defined border be-
tween specific sublanguages (SLs) and general
language (GL) vocabularies is difficult to establish
since lexicon shifts in a continuum from a highly
specialized area to a transition area between GL
and SLs (Rondeau et al, 1984). Within this con-
tinuum, Cabre? (1999) identifies three types of lex-
ical items: a. GL lexical items; b. SL terms, c.
lexical items belonging to a borderline area be-
tween GL and SL. The proportion of these dif-
ferent types of lexical items varies depending on
the text type. To our knowledge, automatic term
recognition methods proposed so far in the litera-
ture focussed on highly specialized corpora (typ-
ically, technical and scientific literature), mainly
characterized by SL terminology. However, the
same ATR methods may not be equally effective
when dealing with corpora characterized by a dif-
ferent proportion of term types; e.g. from texts
such as Wikipedia articles, which are conceived
for a more extended audience, both SL terms and
common words are acquired as long as they show
a statistically significant distribution. In this pa-
per, we claim that the contrastive approach to
MWT extraction described in Bonin et al (2010)
can be effectively exploited to distinguish be-
tween common words and domain-specific termi-
nology in different types of corpora as well as to
identify terms belonging to different SLs when oc-
curring in the same text. The latter is the case of
legal texts, characterized by a mixture of differ-
ent SLs, the legal and the regulated-domain SLs
(Breuker et al, 2004). Effectiveness and flexibil-
ity of the proposed ATR approach has been tested
with different experiments aimed at the extrac-
tion of domain terminology from corpora charac-
terized by different degrees of difficulty as far as
ATR is concerned, namely (i) environmental sci-
entific literature, (ii) Wikipedia environmental ar-
ticles, and (iii) a corpus of legal texts on environ-
mental domain.
2 General Extraction Method
The MWT extraction methodology we follow is
organized in two steps, described in detail in
Bonin et al (2010). Firstly, a shortlist of well-
formed and relevant candidate MWTs is extracted
from a given target corpus and secondly a con-
trastive method is applied against the selected
MWTs only. In fact, in the first stage, candi-
date MWTs are searched for in an automatically
POS-tagged and lemmatized text and they are then
weighted with the C-NC Value method (Frantzi et
al., 1999). In the second stage, the list of MWTs
extracted is revised and re-ranked with a con-
trastive score, based on the distribution of terms
across corpora of different domains; in particu-
77
lar, the Contrastive Selection of multi-word terms
(CSmw) function, newly introduced in Bonin et
al. (2010), was used, which proved to be partic-
ularly suitable for handling variation in low fre-
quency events. The main benefit of such an ap-
proach consists in its modularity; by first selecting
valid MWTs which have significant distributional
tendencies, and then by assessing their domain-
relevance using a contrastive function, the MWT
sparsity problem is overcome or at lest signifi-
cantly reduced.
3 Experiments
The MWT extraction methodology described
above has been followed in order to acquire envi-
ronmental terminology from three different kinds
of domain corpora. The first experiment has been
carried out on a corpus of scientific articles con-
cerning climate change research of Italian Na-
tional Research Council (CNR), of 397,297 to-
kens, while the second experiment has been car-
ried out on a corpus of Wikipedia articles from
the Italian Portal ?Ecologia e Ambiente? (Ecol-
ogy and Environment) (174,391 tokens). As gen-
eral contrastive corpus, we used, in both cases,
the PAROLE Corpus (Marinelli et al, 2003)1, in
order to filter out GL lexical items. The third
and more challenging experiment has been car-
ried out on a collection of Italian European legal
texts concerning the environmental domain for a
total of 394,088 word tokens. In this case, as con-
trastive corpus we exploited a collection of Ital-
ian European legal texts regulating a domain other
than the environmental one2, in order to extract
MWTs belonging to the environmental domain,
but also to single out legal-domain terms, used in
legal texts. For each acquisition corpus we fol-
lowed the two-layered approach described above,
selecting, firstly, a top list of 2000 environmental
MWTs from the candidate term list ranked on the
C-NC Value score and, secondly, re-ranking this
2000-term list on the basis of the CSmw function;
then we extracted the final top list of 300 envi-
ronmental MWTs. In order to assess the effec-

tiveness of the approach against different types of
corpora, we analyzed the two 300-term top lists
of MWTs acquired respectively after the first and
the second extraction steps. In both cases, we
divided the 300-term top lists in 30-term groups
which show domain-specific terms? distribution,
so that they could be easily compared. The eval-
uation has been carried out by comparing the lists
of MWTs extracted against a gold standard re-
source, i.e. the thesaurus EARTh (Environmen-
tal Applications Reference Thesaurus).3. In ad-
dition, a second resource has been used in the
third experiment for evaluating legal terms: the
Dizionario giuridico (Edizioni Simone)4. Those
terms which could not find a positive matching
against the gold standard resources were manually
validated by domain experts.

3.1 Discussion of Results
Achieved experimental results highlight two main
issues. Firstly, they show that the proposed con-
trastive approach to domain-specific MWTs ex-
traction has a general good performance. As Fig-
ures 1, 2 and 3 show, the amount of environ-
mental MWTs after the contrastive stage increases
with respect to the amount of MWTs acquired af-
ter the candidate MWT extraction stage carried

out with the C-NC Value method. Secondly, re-
ported results witness that such performances are
differently affected by the different types of in-
put corpora: as summarized in Table 3, the rela-
tive increment of environmental MWTs after the
contrastive filtering stage ranges from 11.3% to
23.81%. Interestingly, as shown in Table 1, the
results obtained in the first and second experi-
ments show similar trends. This is due to the over-
whelming occurrence in the two input corpora of
specialized terminology with respect to the GL
items. Differently from what could have been

expected, Wikipedia texts contain highly special-
ized terminology. However, a qualititative evalu-
ation of MTWs extracted revealed that this latter
corpus includes terms which belong to that bor-
derline area between GL and SL (case c. in the
Cabre? (1999) classification). It follows that in
the Wikipedia case the contrastive stage filtered
out not only common words, such as milione di
dollari ?a million dollars?, but also terms such as
unita` immobiliare ?real estate? belonging to such
borderline area of terminology; their difficult clas-
sification slightly decreases the contrastive stage
performance.
In the third experiment, the total amount of
environmental MWTs percentually increased by
23.81% after the second stage of contrastive re-
ranking. Differently from the previous experi-
ments, in this case we faced the need for dis-
cerning terms belonging to the vocabulary of two
SLs, i.e. regulated domain (i.e. environmental)
terms and legal ones (e.g. norma nazionale, na-
tional rule): this emerges clearly from the results
reported in Table 2 where it is shown that the
same number of environmental and legal MWTs
(i.e. 12 terms) are extracted at the first stage in
the first 30-term group, and that the contrastive
re-ranking allows the emergence of 21 environ-
mental MWTs against 4 legal MWTs only. This
trend can be observed in Figure 4, where the di-
vergent lines show the different distributions of
environmental and legal terms: interestingly, lines
cross each other where legal terms outnumber en-
vironmental terms, i.e. in the last 30-term group.
Such a relative increment with respect to the C-
NC Value ranking can be easily explained in terms
of the main features of the two methods, where C-
NC Value method is overtly aimed at extracting
domain-specific terminology (both environmental
and legal terms), and the contrastive re-ranking
step is specifically aimed at distinguishing the rel-
evance of acquired MWTs with respect to the in-
volved domains.
4 Conclusion
In this paper we tackled the challenging task of
MWT extraction from different kinds of domain

corpora, characterized by different types of termi-
nologies. We demonstrated that the multi-layered
approach proposed in Bonin et al (2010) can be
successfully exploited in distinguishing between
GL and SL items and in assessing the domain-
relevance of extracted terms. The latter is the case
of type of multi-domain corpora, characterized by
the occurrence of terms belonging to different SLs
(e.g. legal texts). Moreover, the results obtained
from different text types proved that the perfor-
mance of the contrastive filtering stage is dramat-
ically influenced by the nature of the acquisition
corpus.
