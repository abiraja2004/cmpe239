ABSTRACT 
The VESPRA system is designed for  the 
processing of chains of (not connected 
utterances of)  wordforms. These s t r ings  
of wordforms correspond to sentences 
except that  they are not rea l i sed  in 
connected speech. VESPRA means: 
Verarbeitung und Erkennung gesprochener 
Sprache (processing and recogn i t ion  of 
speech). VESPRA w i l l  be used to cont ro l  
d i f fe rent  types of machines by voice 
input ( fo r  instance: non c r i t i ca l  
cont ro l  funct ions  in cars and in 
t rucks ,  voice box in d ig i ta l  te lephone 
systems, text  processing systems, 
d i f fe rent  types of o f f i ce  work- 
s ta t ions ) .

The VESPRA system consists  of f i ve  
components: 
I)  the noise reduct ion un i t ;  
2) the phonet ic feature  ext rac t ion  and 
pat tern  recogn i t ion  un i t ;  
3) an ATN grammar , a d ia log  model and 
a model of the cont ro l led  machlne; 
4) a machine cont ro l  and d ia log  
generat ion un i t ;  
5) a user f r iend ly  software development 
environment. 
2. 
In d i f fe rence  to common speech 
processing systems VESPRA has an 
in tegrated  noise reduct ion un i t .  This 
noise reduct ion un i t  is context 
sens i t i ve .  Depending on the type of 
noise several  types of f i l te rs  w i l l  
reduce the noise corresponding to the 
actual  s i tuat ion  in which the system is 
used. Analog and d ig i ta l  f i l te r ing  
methods w i l l  be used. Noise has been up 
to now a big problem which made a wide 
use of speech processing systems 
impossib le.  The noise reduct ion is 
t r iggered  by the actual  state of the 
machine and the general acoust ica l  
environment.  VESPRA w i l l  be able to 
recognize 500 wordforms speaker 
dependent and 100 wordforms speaker non 
sens i t i ve .  
An ATN grammar processes a l l  meaningful 
sentences on the basis of these 
wordforms ( inc lud ing  reduced forms of 
618 
sentences) .  The resu l t  of  th i s  lex ica \ ] ,  
syntact i ca l ,  semant ica l  and pragmat ica l  
p rocess ing  is s to red  in the d ia log  
memory or compared w i th  the content  of  
the d ia log  memory. The in terpreted  
command input  is  processed by the model 
of the ac tua l  s ta te  of  the cont ro l led  
machine.  I f  a command by the user  is in 
conf l i c t  w i th  the genera l  s ta te  of  the 
cont ro l led  machine VESPRA in forms the 
user by vo ice  output  or  by v i sua l  
output .  The vo ice  output  w i l l  be 
rea l i sed  by LPC coded speech and is 
inc luded in the VESPRA system. The 
v i sua l  output  depends on the 
poss ib i l i t i es  o f fe red  by the cont ro l led  
machine.  I f  a command by the user is 
not in conf l i c t  w i th  the genera l  s ta te  
of the cont ro l led  machine the VESPRA 
system : j ives  an ins t ruct ion  to  the 
cont ro l led  machine,  lhe  in ter face  
between VESPRA and the cont ro l led  
machine is des igned in a way that  
a l lows  to  connect  var ious  types of 
sensors and actors  to  VESPRA. 
There is a feedback cont ro l  between the 
lex ica l ,  syntact i ca l ,  semant ica l  and 
pragmat ica l  p rocess ing  un i t  and the 
phonet ic  ext rac t ion  and pat tern  
recogn i t ion  un i t  in o rder  to opt imize  
the phonet ic  p rocess ing  and the 
process ing  of  the cha ins  of  word forms.  
The d ia log  model and the model of  the 
cont ro l led  machine cont ro l  the no ise  
reduct ion  un i t .  Tile cha ins  of w ord forms 
may cons is t  of  ten wordforms in the 
maximum. A f te r  the command input  by the 
user is  F in i shed  the VESPRA system or 
the cont ro l led  machine reacts  w i th in  
0.3 seconds.  
A user I~r iend ly  so f tware  deve lopmenta l
