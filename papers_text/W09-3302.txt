Abstract
Named entity recognition (NER) is used in
many domains beyond the newswire text
that comprises current gold-standard cor-
pora. Recent work has used Wikipedia?s
link structure to automatically generate
near gold-standard annotations. Until now,
these resources have only been evaluated
on newswire corpora or themselves.
We present the first NER evaluation on
a Wikipedia gold standard (WG) corpus.
Our analysis of cross-corpus performance
on WG shows that Wikipedia text may
be a harder NER domain than newswire.
We find that an automatic annotation of
Wikipedia has high agreement with WG
and, when used as training data, outper-
forms newswire models by up to 7.7%.
1 Introduction
Named Entity Recognition (NER) is the task of
identifying and classifying people, organisations
and other named entities (NE) within text. NER is
central to many NLP systems, especially informa-
tion extraction and question answering.
Machine learning approaches now dominate
NER, learning patterns associated with individual
entity classes from annotated training data. This
training data, including English newswire from
the MUC-6, MUC-7 (Chinchor, 1998), and CONLL-
03 (Tjong Kim Sang and De Meulder, 2003) com-
petitive evaluation tasks, and the BBN Pronoun
Coreference and Entity Type Corpus (Weischedel
and Brunstein, 2005), is critical to the success of
these approaches.
This data dependence has impeded the adapta-
tion or porting of existing NER systems to new
domains, such as scientific or biomedical text,
e.g. Nobata et al (2000). Similar domain sensi-
tivity is exhibited by most tasks across NLP, e.g.
parsing (Gildea, 2001), and the adaptation penalty
is still apparent even when the same set of named
entity classes is used in text from similar domains
(Ciaramita and Altun, 2005).
Wikipedia is an important corpus for informa-
tion extraction, e.g. Bunescu and Pas?ca (2006)
and Wu et al (2008) because of its size, cur-
rency, rich semi-structured content, and its closer
resemblance to web text than newswire. Recently,
Wikipedia?s markup has been exploited to auto-
matically derive NE annotated text for training sta-
tistical models (Richman and Schone, 2008; Mika
et al, 2008; Nothman et al, 2008).
However, without a gold standard, existing eval-
uations of these models were forced to compare
against mismatched newswire corpora or the noisy
Wikipedia-derived annotations themselves. Fur-
ther, it was not possible to directly ascertain the
accuracy of these automatic extraction methods.
We have manually annotated 39,007 tokens of
Wikipedia with coarse-grained named entity tags
(WG). We present the first evaluation of Wiki-
pedia-trained models on Wikipedia: the C&C NER
tagger (Curran and Clark, 2003b) trained on (a)
automatically annotated Wikipedia text (WP2) ex-
tracted by Nothman et al (2009); and (b) tradi-
tional newswire NER corpora (MUC, CONLL and
BBN). The WP2 model, though trained on noisy
annotations, outperforms newswire models on WG
by 7.7%. However, every model, including WP2,
performs far worse on WG than on the newswire.
We examined the quality of WG, and found that
our annotation strategy produced a high-quality,
consistent corpus. Our analysis suggests that it is
the form and distribution of NEs in Wikipedia that
make it a difficult target domain.
Finally, we compared WG with the annotations
extracted by Nothman et al (2009), and found
agreement comparable to our inter-annotator
agreement, demonstrating that NE corpora can be
derived very accurately from Wikipedia.

2 Background
Traditional evaluations of NER have considered
the performance of a tagger on test data from the
same source as its training data. Although the
majority of annotated corpora available consist of
newswire text, recent practical applications cover
a far wider range of genres, including Wikipedia,
blogs, RSS feeds, and other data sources. Cia-
ramita and Altun (2005) showed that even when
moving a short distance, e.g. annotating WSJ text
with the same scheme as CONLL?s Reuters, the per-
formance was 26% worse than on the original text.
Similar differences are reported by Nothman
et al (2009) who compared MUC, CONLL and
BBN annotations reduced to a common tag-set.
They found poor cross-corpus performance to be
due to tokenisation and annotation scheme mis-
match, missing frequent lexical items, and naming
conventions. They then compared automatically-
annotated Wikipedia text as training data and
found it also differs in otherwise inconsequen-
tial ways from the newswire corpora, in particular
lacking abbreviations necessary to tag news text.
2.1 Automatic Wikipedia annotation
Wikipedia, a collaboratively-written online ency-
clopedia, is readily exploited in NLP, because it is
large, semi-structured and multilingual. Its arti-
cles often correspond to NEs, so it has been used
for NE recognition (Kazama and Torisawa, 2007)
and disambiguation (Bunescu and Pas?ca, 2006;
Cucerzan, 2007). Wikipedia links often span NEs,
which may be exploited to automatically create
annotated NER training data by determining the
entity class of the linked article and then labelling
the link text with it.
Richman and Schone (2008) use article clas-
sification knowledge from English Wikipedia to
produce NE-annotated corpora in other languages
(evaluated against NE gold standards for French,
Spanish, and Ukrainian). Mika et al (2008) ex-
plored the use of tags from a CONLL-trained tag-
ger to seed the labelling of entities and evaluate
the performance of a Wikipedia-trained model by
hand.
We make use of an approach described by Noth-
man et al (2009) which is engineered to perform
well on BBN data with a reduced tag-set (LOC,
MISC, ORG, PER). They derive an annotated cor-
pus with the following steps:
1. Classify Wikipedia articles into entity classes
2. Split the articles into tokenised sentences
3. Label expanded links according to target NEs
4. Select sentences for inclusion in a corpus
To prepare the text, they use mwlib (Pedi-
aPress, 2007) to parse Wikipedia?s native markup
retaining only paragraph text with links, ap-
ply Punkt (Kiss and Strunk, 2006) estimated on
Wikipedia text to perform sentence boundary de-
tection, and tokenise the resulting text using regu-
lar expressions.
Nothman et al (2009) infer additional NEs not
provided by existing links, and apply rules to ad-
just link boundaries and classifications to closer
match BBN annotations.
2.2 NER evaluation
Meaningful automatic evaluation of NER is dif-
ficult and a number of metrics have been pro-
posed (Nadeau and Sekine, 2007). Ambiguity
leads to entities correctly delimited but misclas-
sified, or boundaries mismatched despite correct
classification.
Although the MUC-7 evaluation (Chinchor,
1998) defined a metric which was less sensitive
to often-meaningless boundary errors, we consider
only exact entity matches as correct, following
the standard CONLL evaluation (Tjong Kim Sang,
2002). We report precision, recall and F -score for
each entity type.
3 Creating the Wikipedia gold standard
We created a corpus by manually annotating the
text of 149 articles from the May 22, 2008 dump
of English Wikipedia. The articles were selected
at random from all articles describing named en-
tities, with a roughly equal proportion of arti-
cle topics from each of the four CONLL-03 classes
(LOC, MISC, ORG, PER). We adopted Nothman et
al.?s (2008) preprocessing described above to pro-
duce tokenised sentences for annotation.
Only body text was extracted from the chosen
articles for inclusion in the corpus. Four articles
were found not to have any usable text, consisting
solely of tables, lists, templates and section head-
ings, which we remove. Their exclusion leaves a
corpus of 145 articles.
3.1 Annotation
Annotation was initially carried out using a fine-
grained tag-set which was expanded by the an-

notators as annotation progressed, and eventually
contained 96 tags.
We created a mapping from these fine-grained
tags to the four coarse-grained tags used in the
CONLL-03 data: PER, LOC, MISC and ORG. This
enables evaluation with existing NER models. We
believe this two-phase approach allowed anno-
tators to defer difficult mapping decisions, (e.g.
should an airport be classified as a LOC, ORG, or
MISC?) which can then be made after discussion.
The mapping could also be modified to suit a par-
ticular evaluation task.
Figure 1 shows an example of the use of fine and
coarse-grained tags to annotate a sentence. Tags
such as PERSON correspond directly to coarse-
grained tags, while most map to a more general
tag, such as STATE and CITY mapping to LOC.
PLANE is an example of a fine-grained tag that
cannot be mapped to LOC, ORG, or PER. These
tags may be mapped to MISC; some are not con-
sidered entities under the CONLL scheme and are
left unlabelled in the coarse-grained annotation.
Three independent annotators were involved in
the annotation process. Annotator 1 annotated all
145 articles using the fine-grained tags. Annota-
tors 2 and 3 then re-annotated 19 of these articles
(316 sentences or 8030 tokens), amounting to 21%
of the corpus. Annotator 2 used the fine-grained
tags described above, while Annotator 3 used the
four coarse-grained CONLL tags. To measure vari-
ation, all three annotations of this common portion
were mapped down to the CONLL tag-set and inter-
annotator agreement was calculated.
We found that 202 tokens were disagreed upon
by at least one annotator (2.5% of all tokens
annotated), and these discrepancies were then
discussed by the three annotators. The inter-
annotator agreement will be analysed in more de-
tail in Section 5.
Sentences containing grammatical and typo-
graphical errors were not corrected, so that the cor-
pus would be as close as possible to the source
text. Web text often contains errors, such as to

marketed the Sea Hawker from the example in Fig-
ure 1, so any NER system must deal with these er-
rors. Sentences with poor tokenisation or sentence
boundary detection were identified and corrected
manually, since these errors are introduced by our
processing and annotation, and do not exist in the
source text.
The final corpus was created by correcting an-
notation mistakes, with annotators 2 and 3 each
correcting 50% of the corpus. The fine-grained
tags were mapped to the four CONLL tags before
the final corrections were made. The final WG cor-
pus consists of the body text of 145 Wikipedia ar-
ticles tagged with the four CONLL-03 tags.
4 NER on the Wikipedia gold-standard
Nothman et al (2009) have previously shown that
that an NER system trained on automatically anno-
tated Wikipedia corpora performs reasonably well
on non-Wikipedia text. Having created our WG
corpus of gold-standard annotations, we are able
to evaluate the performance of these models on
Wikipedia text.
We compare the C&C NE maximum-entropy
tagger (Curran and Clark, 2003b) trained on
gold-standard newswire corpora (MUC-7, BBN and
CONLL-03) with the same tagger trained on auto-
matically annotated Wikipedia text, WP2. WG is

too small to train a reasonable NER model on gold-
standard Wikipedia annotations. Part-of-speech
tags are added to all corpora using the C&C POS
tagger (Curran and Clark, 2003a) before training
and testing.
1
We evaluate each model on tradi-
tional newswire evaluation corpora as well as WG.
Table 1 gives the size of each corpus.
The results are shown in Table 2. The WP2 tag-
ger performed substantially better on WG than tag-
gers trained on newswire text, with a 7?11% in-
crease in F -score compared to BBN and CONLL-
03, and a 16% increase compared to MUC-7, when
miscellaneous NEs in the corpus are not consid-
ered in the evaluation. The Wikipedia trained
model thus outperforms newswire models on our
new WG corpus even though the training annota-
tions were automatically extracted.
The WP2 tagger performed worse on WG than
on gold-standard news corpora (BBN and CONLL),
with a 2?7% reduction in F -score. Further, the
performance of WP2 on WG is 11?20% F -score
lower than same-source evaluation results, e.g.
BBN on BBN, CONLL on CONLL. Therefore, de-
spite WP2 showing an advantage in tagging WG
due to their common source domain, we find that
WG?s annotations are harder to predict than the
newswire test data commonly used for evaluation.
One possible explanation is that our WG corpus
has been inconsistently annotated. When NEs of
miscellaneous type are not considered in the eval-
uation (asterisks in Table 2), the performance of all
taggers on WG improves, with WP2 demonstrating
a 4% increase. This result suggests another par-
tial explanation: that MISC NEs in Wikipedia are
more difficult to annotate correctly, due to their
poor definition and broad coverage. A third ex-
planation is that the automatic conversion process
proposed by Nothman et al (2008) produces much
lower quality training data than manual annota-
tion. We explore these three possibilities below.

Table 3: Initial human inter-annotator agreement.
5 Quality of the Wikipedia gold standard
The low performance observed on WG may be
due to the poor quality of its annotation. We en-
sure that this is not the case by measuring inter-
annotator agreement. The WG annotation process
produced three independent annotations of a sub-
set of WG. These annotations were compared us-
ing Cohen?s ? (Fleiss and Cohen, 1973) between
pairs of annotators, and Fleiss? ? (Fleiss, 1971),
which generalises Cohen?s ? to more than two
concurrent annotations.
Table 3 shows the three types of ? values cal-
culated. Token is calculated on a per token basis,
comparing the agreement of annotators on each
token in the corpus; NE only, is calculated on
the agreement between entities alone, excluding
agreement in cases where all annotators agreed
that a token was not a NE; Exact refers to the
agreement between annotators where all annota-
tors have agreed on the boundaries of a NE, but
disagree on the type of NE.
Annotator 1 originally annotated the entire cor-
pus, and Annotators 2 and 3 then corrected exactly
half of the corpus each after a discussion between
the three annotators to resolve ambiguities. Landis
and Koch (1977) determine that a ? value greater
than 0.81 indicates almost perfect agreement. By
this standard, our three annotators were in strong
agreement prior to discussion, with our Fleiss? ?
values all greater than 0.81. Inconsistencies in the
corpus due to annotation mistakes by Annotator 1
were corrected by Annotators 2 and 3.
Inter-annotator agreement for cases where the
annotators agreed on NE boundaries was higher
than agreement on each token, which suggests
that many discrepancies resulted from NE bound-

ary ambiguities, or disagreement as to whether
a phrase constituted a NE at all. Higher inter-
annotator agreement between Annotators 1 and 2
leads us to believe that the two-phase annotation
strategy, where an initially fine-grained tag-set is
reduced, results in more consistent annotation.
Our analysis demonstrates that WG is annotated
in a consistent and accurate manner and the small
number of errors cannot alone explain the reduced
performance figures.
6 Comparing gold-standard corpora
6.1 NE class distribution
Table 4 compares the distribution of different
classes of NEs across different corpora on the four
CONLL categories. WG has a higher proportion of
PER and MISC NEs and a lower proportion of ORG
NEs than the BBN corpus. This is also found in the
MUC corpus, although comparisons to MUC are af-
fected by its lack of a MISC category. The CONLL-
03 corpus is most similar to WG in terms of the
distribution of the NE classes, although CONLL-03
has a smaller proportion of MISC NEs than WG.
An analysis of the lengths of NEs in CONLL shows,
however, that they are very different to those in
WG (see Table 8), perhaps explaining the differ-
ence in performance observed.
Tag entropy H(C) was calculated for each cor-
pus with respect to the 5 possible classes (4 NE
classes, and the O tag, indicating non-entities).
H(C) is a measure of the amount of information
required to represent the classification of each to-
ken in the corpus. Two calculations are made, in-
cluding and excluding the frequent O tag. Our re-
sults (Table 4) suggest that WG?s tags are least pre-
dictable, with a tag entropy of 2.0 bits (without the
O class) compared to 1.7 and 1.9 bits for BBN and
CONLL respectively.
6.2 Fine-grained class distribution
While the CONLL-03 and MUC evaluation corpora
are marked up with only very coarse tags, the BBN
corpus uses 29 coarse tags, many with specific
subtypes, including NEs, descriptors of NEs and

non-NEs, intended as answer types for question
answering (Brunstein, 2002). Non-NE types in-
clude MONEY and TIME, which are also tagged in
the MUC corpus, and others such as ANIMAL. When
evaluating the performance of the taggers, each of
BBN?s 150 fine-grained tags was mapped to one of
four coarse-grained classes or none, using a map-
ping described in Nothman (2008).
However, since the WG corpus was initially an-
notated using 96 distinct classes, we map these
tags to the corresponding fine-grained BBN NE
classes. In some cases, the tags map exactly
(e.g. COUNTRY mapped to LOCATION:COUNTRY);
in other cases, classes have to be merged or not
mapped at all, where the BBN and WG annotations
differ in granularity. Where possible, we map to
fine-grained BBN categories.
We create mappings to a total of 36 BBN entity
types, and apply them across the WG corpus. Table
5 shows the distribution of the most common tags,
calculated as a percentage of all counts of the 36
selected tags across each corpus. Tags for which
there is at least a two-fold difference in proportion
between BBN and WG are marked in bold.
The comparison is dominated by the
presence of a disproportionate number of

pared to WG. It also mentions many more
governmental organisations. Prominent cases of
tags found in higher proportions in WG are works
of art, organisations of type OTHER (e.g. bands,
sports teams, clubs), events and attractions.
This comparison demonstrates that there are ob-
servable differences in NE types between the news
and Wikipedia domains. These differences are re-
flected in the distribution of both coarse and fine-
grained types of NEs. The more complex entity
distribution in Wikipedia is a likely cause for re-
duced NER performance on WG.
6.3 Feature-tag gain
Nobata et al (2000) use gain ratio as an infor-
mation-theoretic measure of corpus difficulty:
GR(C;F ) =
I(C;F )
H(C)
where I(C;F ) = H(C) ? H(C|F ) is the infor-
mation gain of the NE tag distribution (C) with re-
spect to a feature set F .
This gain ratio normalises the information gain
over the tag entropy, which Nobata et al (2000)
suggest allows us to compare gain ratios between
corpora. It also makes the impact of including the
?O? tag negligible for our calculations.
We apply this approach to measure the relative
difficulty of tagging NEs in the WG corpus. Ta-
ble 7 shows that WG tags seem generally harder
to predict than those in newswire, on the basis of
words, POS tags or orthographic word-types (like
those used in the Curran and Clark (2003b) tagger
as proposed by Collins (2002)).
In particular, POS tags are less indicative than
in BBN and CONLL, suggesting a wider variety of

grammatical functions in NE names in Wikipedia
? this might be expected with more band names,
and song and movie titles. Alternatively, it may be
an indication that the POS tagging is less reliable
on Wikipedia using newswire-trained models.
The previous word?s orthographic form also
provides less information, which may relate to ti-
tles like Mr. and Mrs., strong indicators of PER en-
tities, which are frequent in BBN and to a lesser
extent CONLL, but are almost absent in Wikipedia.
6.4 Lengths of named entities
The number of tokens in NEs is substantially dif-
ferent between WG and other gold-standard cor-
pora. When compared with WG, other gold-
standard corpora have a larger proportion of
single-word NEs (between 7 and 13% more), as
shown in Table 8. The distribution of NE lengths
in BBN is most similar to WG, but it still differs
significantly in the proportion of single-word NEs.
Additionally, WG has a larger number of long
multi-word NEs than the other gold-standard cor-
pora. Longer entities are more difficult to clas-
sify, since boundary resolution is more error prone
and they typically contain lowercase words with
a wider range of syntactic roles. This adds to the
difficulty of correctly identifying NEs in WG.
The difference in entity lengths is most pro-
nounced MISC NEs (Table 6), with Wikipedia hav-
ing a substantially smaller number of single-word
MISC NEs. The presence of a large number of long
miscellaneous NEs, including song, film and book
titles, and other works of art are a feature that char-
acterises the nature of Wikipedia text in contrast
to newswire text. Typically, longer MISC NEs in
newswire text are laws and NORPs, which also ap-
pear in Wikipedia text.

7 Evaluation of automatic annotation
We compared the gold-standard annotations in our
WG corpus to those sentences that were automati-
cally annotated by Nothman et al (2009). Their
automatic annotation process does not retain all
Wikipedia sentences. Rather, it selects sentences
where, on the basis of capitalisation heuristics,
it seems all named entities in the sentence have
been tagged by the automatic process. We adopt
this confidence criterion to produce automatically-
annotated subsets of the WG corpus.
Two variants of their automatic annotation pro-
cedure were used: WP2 uses a few rules to infer
tags for non-linked NEs in Wikipedia; WP4 has
looser criteria for inferring additional links, and its
over-generation typically reduced its performance
as training data (Nothman et al, 2009).
A large proportion of sentences in our WG cor-
pus cannot be automatically tagged with confi-
dence. Sentence selection leaves 571 sentences
(33.7%) after the WP2 process and 698 (41.2%)
after the WP4 process (see Table 10). The use of
the more permissive WP4 process may lead to the
labelling of more NEs, but many may be spurious.
We use three approaches to compare automatic
and manual annotations of WG text: (a) treat each
corpus as test data and evaluate NER performance
on each; (b) treat WP2 and WP4-style subsets as
NER predictions on the WG corpus to calculate an
F -score; and (c) treat the automatic annotations
like human annotators and calculate ? values.
We first evaluate the WP2 model on each
corpus and find that performance is higher on
automatically-annotated subsets of WG (Table 11).
This is unsurprising given the common automatic
annotation process and the effects of the selection
criterion. However, Nothman (2008) provides an

F -score for the WP2 model when evaluated on 10
folds of automatically-annotated (WP2-style) test
data. This F -score is 8?10% higher than WP2?s
performance on the WP2-style subset of WG, sug-
gesting that WG?s text is somewhat more difficult
to annotate than typical portions of WP2-style text.
We compare the annotations of WG text more
directly by treating the automatic annotations as
if they are the output from a tagger run on the 698
and 571 sentences that were confidently chosen. A
reasonable agreement between the gold standard
and automatic annotation is observed (Table 12),
with F -scores of 87.2% and 89.0% achieved by
WP2 and WP4.
Table 12 also shows inter-annotator agreement
calculated between the automatically annotated
subsets and the gold-standard annotations in WG,
using Cohen?s ? in the same way as for human an-
notators. The agreement was very high: equal or
better than the agreement between human annota-
tors prior to discussion and correction.
8 Conclusion
We have presented the first evaluation of named
entity recognition (NER) on a gold-standard eval-
uation of Wikipedia, a resource of increasing
16
importance in Computational Linguistics. We
annotated a corpus of Wikipedia articles (WG)
with gold-standard NE tags. Using this new re-
source as test data we have evaluated models
trained on three gold-standard newswire corpora
for NER, and compared them to a model trained on
Wikipedia-derived NER annotations (Nothman et
al., 2009). We found that this WP2 model outper-
formed models trained on MUC, CONLL, and BBN
data by more than 7.7% F -score.
However, we found that all four models per-
formed significantly worse on the WG corpus than
they did on news text, suggesting that Wikipedia
as a textual domain is more difficult for NER. We
initially suspected that annotation quality was re-
sponsible, but found that we had very high inter-
annotator agreement even before further discus-
sion and correction of the corpus. This also val-
idates our approach of creating many fine-grained
categories and then reducing them down to the
four CONLL types.
To further examine the difficulty of tagging WG,
we compared the distribution of fine-grained entity
types in WG and BBN, finding a more even dis-
tribution over a larger range of types in WG. We
found that the standard NER features such as cur-
rent and previous POS tags and words had lower
predictive power on WG. We also compared the
distribution of NEs lengths and showed that WG
entities are longer on average (for instance song
and book titles). This all suggests that Wikipedia
is genuinely more difficult to automatically anno-
tate with named entities than newswire.
Finally, we compared the common sentences
between Nothman et al?s (2009) automatic NE an-
notation of Wikipedia and WG, directly measuring
the quality of automatically deriving NE annota-
tions from Wikipedia.
We found that WP2 agreed with our final
WG corpus to a high degree, demonstrating that
Wikipedia is a viable source of automatically an-
notated NE annotated data, reducing our depen-
dence on expensive manual annotation for training
NER systems.
