Abstract
This paper presents a corpus study
of evaluative and speculative language.
Knowledge of such language would be
useful in many applications, such as
text categorization and summarization.
Analyses of annotator agreement and of
characteristics of subjective language are
performed. This study yields knowl-
edge needed to design eective machine
learning systems for identifying subjec-
tive language.
1 Introduction
Subjectivity in natural language refers to aspects
of language used to express opinions and evalua-
tions (Baneld, 1982; Wiebe, 1994). Subjectivity
tagging is distinguishing sentences used to present
opinions and other forms of subjectivity (subjec-
tive sentences) from sentences used to objectively
present factual information (objective sentences).
This task is especially relevant for news report-
ing and Internet forums, in which opinions of var-
ious agents are expressed. There are numerous
applications for which subjectivity tagging is rele-
vant. Two are information retrieval and informa-
tion extraction. Current extraction and retrieval
technology focuses almost exclusively on the sub-
ject matter of documents. However, additional
aspects of a document inuence its relevance, in-
cluding, e.g., the evidential status of the material
presented, and the attitudes expressed about the
topic (Kessler et al, 1997). Knowledge of subjec-
tive language would also be useful in ame recog-
nition (Spertus, 1997; Kaufer, 2000), email clas-
sication (Aone et al, 2000), intellectual attribu-
tion in text (Teufel and Moens, 2000), recogniz-
ing speaker role in radio broadcasts (Barzilay et
al., 2000), review mining (Terveen et al, 1997),
generation and style (Hovy, 1987), clustering doc-
uments by ideological point of view (Sack, 1995),
and any other application that would benet from
knowledge of how opinionated the language is, and
whether or not the writer purports to objectively
present factual material.
To use subjectivity tagging in applications,
good linguistic clues must be found. As with many
pragmatic and discourse distinctions, existing lex-
ical resources are not comprehensively coded for
subjectivity. The goal of our current work is learn-
ing subjectivity clues from corpora. This paper
contributes to this goal by empirically examin-
ing subjectivity. We explore annotating subjectiv-
ity at dierent levels (expression, sentence, docu-
ment) and produce corpora annotated at dierent
levels. Annotator agreement is analyzed to un-
derstand and assess the viability of such annota-
tions. In addition, because expression-level anno-
tations are ne-grained and thus very informative,
these annotations are examined to gain knowledge
about subjectivity.
We also use our annotations and existing ed-
itorial annotations to generate and test features
of subjectivity. Altogether, the observations and
results of these studies provide valuable informa-
tion that will facilitate designing eective machine
learning systems for recognizing subjectivity.
The remainder of this paper rst provides back-
ground about subjectivity, then presents results
for document-level annotations, followed by an
analysis of expression-level annotations. Results
for features generated using document-level anno-
tations are next, ending with conclusions.
2 Subjectivity
Sentence (1) is an example of a simple subjective
sentence, and (2) is an example of a simple objec-
tive sentence:
1
(1) At several dierent layers, it's a fascinating
tale.
1
The term subjectivity is due to Ann Baneld
(1982). For references to work on subjectivity, please
see (Baneld, 1982; Fludernik, 1993; Wiebe, 1994;
Stein and Wright, 1995).
(2) Bell Industries Inc. increased its quarterly to
10 cents from 7 cents a share.
The main types of subjectivity are:
1. Evaluation. This category includes emotions
such as hope and hatred as well as evalua-
tions, judgements, and opinions. Examples
of expressions involving positive evaluation
are enthused, wonderful, and great product!.
Examples involving negative evaluation are
complained, you idiot!, and terrible product.
2. Speculation. This category includes anything
that removes the presupposition of events oc-
curring or states holding, such as speculation
and uncertainty. Examples of speculative ex-
pressions are speculated, and maybe.
Following are examples of strong negative
evaluative language from a corpus of Usenet
newsgroup messages:
(3a) I had in mind your facts, buddy, not hers.
(3b) Nice touch. \Alleges" whenever facts posted
are not in your persona of what is \real".
Following is an example of opinionated, edito-
rial language, taken from an editorial in the Wall
Street Journal:
(4) We stand in awe of the Woodstock genera-
tion's ability to be unceasingly fascinated by the
subject of itself.
Sentences (5) and (6) illustrate the fact that
sentences about speech events may be subjective
or objective:
(5) Northwest Airlines settled the remaining
lawsuits led on behalf of 156 people killed in
a 1987 crash, but claims against the jetliner's
maker are being pursued, a federal judge said.
(6) \The cost of health care is eroding our stan-
dard of living and sapping industrial strength,"
complains Walter Maher, a Chrysler health-and-
benets specialist.
In (5), the material about lawsuits and claims is
presented as factual information, and a federal
judge is given as the source of information. In
(6), in contrast, a complaint is presented. An NLP
system performing information extraction on (6)
should not treat the material in the quoted string
as factual information, with the complainer as a
source of information, whereas a corresponding
treatment of sentence (5) would be appropriate.
Subjective sentences often contain individual
expressions of subjectivity. Examples are fasci-
nating in (1), and eroding, sapping, and complains
in (6). The following paragraphs mention aspects
of subjectivity expressions that are relevant for
NLP applications.
First, although some expressions, such as !, are
subjective in all contexts, many, such as sapping
and eroding, may or may not be subjective, de-
pending on the context in which they appear. A
potential subjective element (PSE) is a linguistic
element that may be used to express subjectivity.
A subjective element is an instance of a potential
subjective element, in a particular context, that is
indeed subjective in that context (Wiebe, 1994).
Second, a subjective element expresses the sub-
jectivity of a source, who may be the writer or
someone mentioned in the text. For example, the
source of fascinating in (1) is the writer, while
the source of the subjective elements in (6) is Ma-
her. In addition, a subjective element has a tar-
get, i.e., what the subjectivity is about or directed
toward. In (1), the target is a tale; in (6), the tar-
get of Maher's subjectivity is the cost of health
care. These are examples of object-centric sub-
jectivity, which is about an object mentioned in
the text (other examples: \I love this project";
\The software is horrible"). Subjectivity may also
be addressee-oriented, i.e., directed toward the lis-
tener or reader (e.g., \You are an idiot").
Third, there may be multiple subjective ele-
ments in a sentence, possibly of dierent types
and attributed to dierent sources and targets.
For example, in (4), subjectivity of the Woodstock
generation is described (specically, its fascina-
tion with itself). In addition, subjectivity of the
writer is expressed (e.g., `we stand in awe'). As de-
scribed below, individual subjective elements were
annotated as part of this work, rening previous
work on sentence-level annotations. Finally, PSEs
may be complex expressions such as `village id-
iot', `powers that be', `You' NP, and `What a'
NP. There is a great variety of such expressions,
including many studied under the rubric of idioms
(see, for example, (Nunberg et al, 1994)). We ad-
dress learning such expressions in another project.
3 Previous Work on Subjectivity
Tagging
In previous work (Wiebe et al, 1999; Bruce and
Wiebe, 1999), a corpus of sentences from the Wall
Street Journal Treebank Corpus (Marcus et al,
1993) was manually annotated with subjectivity
classications by multiple judges. The judges were
instructed to consider a sentence to be subjective
if they perceived any signicant expression of sub-
jectivity (of any source) in the sentence, and to
consider the sentence to be objective, otherwise.
Agreement was summarized in terms of Cohen's
 (Cohen, 1960), which compares the total proba-
bility of agreement to that expected if the taggers'
classications were statistically independent (i.e.,
\chance agreement"). After two rounds of tag-
ging by three judges, an average pairwise  value
of .69 was achieved on a test set. The EM learn-
ing algorithm was used to produce corrected tags
representing the consensus opinions of the taggers
(Goodman, 1974; Dawid and Skene, 1979). An
automatic system to perform subjectivity tagging
was developed using the new tags as training and
testing data. In 10-fold cross validation experi-
ments, a probabilistic classier obtained an aver-
age accuracy on subjectivity tagging of 72.17%,
more than 20 percentage points higher than a
baseline accuracy obtained by always choosing the
more frequent class. Five part-of-speech features,
two lexical features, and a paragraph feature were
used.
To identify richer features, (Wiebe, 2000) used
Lin's (1998) method for clustering words accord-
ing to distributional similarity, seeded by a small
amount of detailed manual annotation, to auto-
matically identify adjective PSEs. There are two
parameters of this process, neither of which was
varied in (Wiebe, 2000): C, the cluster size con-
sidered, and FT , a ltering threshold, such that, if
the seed word and the words in its cluster have, as
a set, lower precision than the ltering threshold
on the training data, the entire cluster, includ-
ing the seed word, is ltered out. This process is
adapted for use in the current paper, as described
in section 7.
4 Choices in Annotation
In expression-level annotation, the judges rst
identify the sentences they believe are subjective.
They next identify the subjective elements in
the sentence, i.e., the expressions they feel are
responsible for the subjective classication. For
example (subjective elements are in parentheses):
They promised (yet) more for (really good stu).
(Perhaps you'll forgive me) for reposting his
response.
Subjective-element (expression-level) annota-
tions are probably the most natural. Ultimately,
we would like to recognize the subjective elements
in a text, and their types, targets, and sources.
However, both manual and automatic tagging at
this level are dicult because the tags are very
ne-grained, and there is no predetermined clas-
sication unit; a subjective element may be a sin-
gle word or a large expression. Thus, in the short
term, it is probably best to use subjective-element
annotations for knowledge acquisition (analysis,
training, feature generation) alone, and not target
automatic classication of subjective elements.
In this work, document-level subjectivity anno-
tations are text categories of which subjectivity
is a key aspect. We use three text categories:
editorials (Kessler et al, 1997), reviews, and
\ames", i.e., hostile messages (Spertus, 1997;
Kaufer, 2000). For ease of discussion, we group
editorials and reviews together under the term
opinion pieces.
There are benets to using such document-level
annotations. First, they are more directly re-
lated to applications (e.g., ltering hostile mes-
sages and mining reviews from Internet forums).
Second, there are existing annotations to be ex-
ploited, such as editorials and arts reviews marked
as such by newspapers, as well as on-line product
reviews accompanied by formal numerical ratings
(e.g., 4 on a scale from 1 to 5).
However, a challenging aspect of such data is
that opinion pieces and ames contain objective
sentences, while documents in other text cate-
gories contain subjective sentences. News reports
present reactions to and attitudes toward reported
events (van Dijk 1988); they often contain seg-
ments starting with expressions such as critics
claim and supporters argue. In addition, quoted-
speech sentences in which individuals express their
subjectivity are often included (Barzilay et al,
2000). On the other hand, editorials contain ob-
jective sentences presenting facts supporting the
writer's argument, and reviews contain sentences
objectively presenting facts about the product.
This \impure" aspect of opinionated text cate-
gories must be considered when such data is used
for training and testing. Some specic results are
given below in section 7.
We believe that sentence-level classications
will continue to provide an important level of
analysis. The sentence provides a prespeci-
ed classication unit
2
and, while sentence-level
judgements are not as ne-grained as subjective-

element judgements, they do not involve the large
amount of noise we face with document-level an-
notations.
5 Document-Level Annotation
Results
5.1 Flame Annotations
In this study, newsgroup messages were assigned
the tags ame or not-ame. The corpus con-
sists of 1140 Usenet newsgroup messages, bal-
anced among the categories alt, sci, comp, and rec
in the Usenet hierarchy. The corpus was divided,
preserving the category balance, into a training set
of 778 messages and a test set of 362 messages.
The annotators were instructed to mark a mes-
sage as a ame if the \main intention of the mes-
sage is a personal attack, containing insulting or
abusive language." A number of policy decisions
were made in the instructions, dealing, primarily,
with included messages (part or all of a previous
message, included in the current message as part
of a reply). Some additional issues addressed in
the instructions were who the attack was directed
at, nonsense, sarcasm, humor, rants, and raves.
During the training phase, two annotators, MM
and R, participated in multiple rounds of tagging,
revising the annotation instructions as they pro-
ceeded. During the testing phase, MM and R in-
dependently annotated the test set, achieving a 
value on these messages of 0.69. A third annota-
tor, L, trained on 492 messages from the training
set, and then annotated 88 of the messages in the
test set. The pairwise  values on this set of 88
are: MM & R: 0.80; MM & L: 0.75; R & MM:
0.80; for an average pairwise  of .78.
This study provides evidence for the viability
of document-level ame annotation. We plan to
build a ame-recognition system in the future. As
will be seen below, MM and R also tagged this
data at the subjective-element level.
5.2 Opinion-Piece Classications
Our opinion-piece classications are built on exist-
ing annotations in the Wall Street Journal. Specif-
ically, there are articles explicitly identied to be
Editorials, Letters to the Editor, Arts & Leisure,
and Viewpoints; together, we call these opinion
pieces. This data is a good resource for subjectiv-
ity recognition. However, an inspection of some
data revealed that some editorials and reviews are
not marked as such. For example, there are arti-
cles written in the rst person, and the purpose of
the article is to present an argument rather than
cover a news story, but there is no explicit indi-
cation that they are editorials. To create high
quality test data, two judges manually annotated
WSJ data for opinion pieces. The instructions
were to nd any additional opinion pieces that
are not marked as such. The annotators also had
the option of disagreeing with the existing anno-
tations, but did not opt to do so in any instances.
One judge annotated all articles in four datasets
of the Wall Street Journal Treebank corpus (Mar-
cus et al, 1993) (W9-4, W9-10, W9-22, and W9-
33, each approximately 160K words) as well as
the corpus of Wall Street Journal articles used in
(Wiebe et al, 1999) (called WSJ-SE below). An-
other judge annotated all articles in two of the
datasets (W9-22 and W9-33).
This annotation task appears to be relatively
easy. With no training at all, the  values are very
high: .94 for dataset W9-33 and .95 for dataset
W9-22.
The agreement data for W9-22 is given in Table
1 in the form of a contingency table. In section
7, this data is used to generate and test candidate
potential subjective elements (PSEs).
6 Subjective-Element Annotation
Results and Analyses
6.1 Annotations and Data
These subsections analyze subjective element an-
notations performed on three datasets, WSJ-SE,
NG-FE, and NG-SE.
WSJ-SE is the corpus of 1001 sentences of the
Wall Street Journal Treebank Corpus referred to
above in section 3. Recall that the sentences of
this corpus were manually annotated with subjec-
tivity classications as described in (Wiebe et al,
1999; Bruce and Wiebe, 1999).
For this paper, two annotators (D and M ) were
asked to identify the subjective elements in WSJ-
SE. Specically, the taggers were given the sub-
jective sentences identied in the previous study,
and asked to put brackets around the words they
believe cause the sentence to be classied as sub-
jective.
Note that inammatory language is a kind of
subjective language. NG-FE is a subset of the
Usenet newsgroup corpus used in the document-
level ame-annotation study described in section
5.1. Specically, NG-FE consists of the 362-
message test set for taggers R and MM. For this
study, R and MM were asked to identify the ame
elements in NG-FE. Flame elements are the sub-
set of subjective elements that are perceived to
be inammatory. R and MM were asked to do
this in all 362 messages, because some messages
that were not judged to be ames at the message
level do contain individual inammatory phrases

these phrases express the main intent of the mes-
sage).
In addition to the above annotations, tagger M
performed subjective-element tagging on a dier-
ent set of Usenet newsgroup messages, corpus NG-
SE. The size of this corpus is 15413 words.
In datasets WSJ-SE and NG-SE, the taggers
were also asked to specify one of ve subjective
element types: e+ (positive evaluative), e  (neg-
ative evaluative), e? (some other type of evalua-
tion), u (uncertainty), and o (none of the above),
with the option to assign multiple types to an in-
stance. All corpora were stemmed (Karp et al,
1992) and part-of-speech tagged (Brill, 1992).
6.2 Agreement Among Taggers
There are techniques for analyzing agreement
when annotations involve segment boundaries
(Litman and Passonneau, 1995; Marcu et al,
1999), but our focus in this paper is on words.
Thus, our analyses are at the word level: each
word is classied as either appearing in a subjec-
tive element or not. Punctuation is excluded from
our analyses. The WSJ data is divided into two
subsets in this section, Exp1 and Exp2.
As mentioned above, in WSJ-SE Exp1 and
Exp2, the taggers also classied subjective ele-
ments with respect to the type of subjectivity
being expressed. Subjectivity type agreement is
again analyzed at the word level, but, in this anal-
ysis, only the words classied as belonging to sub-
jective elements by both taggers are considered.
Table 2 provides  values for word agreement
in NG-FE (the ame data) as well as for WSJ-SE
Exp1 and Exp2. The task of identifying subjec-
tive elements in a body of text is dicult, and the
agreement results reect this fact; agreement is
much stronger than that expected by chance, but
less than what we would like to see when verify-
ing a new classication. Further renement of the
coding manual is required. Additionally, it may be
possible to rene the classications automatically
using methods such as those described in (Wiebe
et al, 1999). In this analysis, we explore the pat-
terns of agreement exhibited by the taggers in an
eort to better understand the classication.
We begin by looking at word agreement. Word
agreement is higher in the ame experiment
(NG-FE) than it is in either WSJ experiment
(WSJ-SE Exp1 and Exp2). Looking at the WSJ
data provides one plausible explanation for the
lower word agreement in the WSJ experiments.
As exhibited in the subjective elements identied
for the single clause below,
D: (e+ played the role well) (e? obligatory
ragged jeans a thicket of long hair and rejection
of all things conventional)
M : (e+ well) (e? obligatory) (e- ragged) (e?
thicket) (e- rejection) (e- all things conventional)
tagger D consistently identies entire phrases
as subjective, while Tagger M prefers to select
discrete lexical items. This dierence in inter-
pretation of the tagging instructions does not
occur in the ame experiment. Nonetheless, even
within the ame data, there are many instances
where both taggers identify the same segment of
a sentence as forming a subjective element but
disagree on the boundaries of that segment, as in
the example below.
R: (classic case of you deliberately misinterpret-
ing my comments)
MM : (you deliberately misinterpreting my
comments)
These patterns of partial agreement are also evi-
dent in the  values for words from specic syn-
tactic categories (see Table 2 again). In the WSJ
data, agreement on determiners is particularly low
because they are often included as part of a phrase
by tagger D but typically not included in the spe-
cic lexical items chosen by tagger M. Interest-
ingly, in the WSJ experiments, the taggers most
frequently agreed on the selection of modals and
adjectives, while in the ame experiment, agree-
ment was highest on nouns and adjectives. The
high agreement on adjectives in both genres is con-

sistent with results from other work (Bruce and
Wiebe, 1999; Wiebe et al, 1999), but high agree-
ment on nouns in the ame data verses high agree-
ment on modals in the WSJ data suggests a genre
specic usage of these categories. This would be
the case if, for example, modals were most fre-
quently used to express uncertainty, a type of sub-
jectivity that would be relatively rare in ames.
Turning to subjective-element type, in both
WSJ experiments, the  values for type agreement
are comparable to those for word agreement. Re-
call that multiple types may be assigned to a single
subjective instance. All such instances in the WSJ
data are u in combination with an evaluative tag
(i.e., e+, e- and e?), and they are not common:
each tagger assigned multiple tags to fewer than
7% of the subjective instances. However, if partial
matches between type tags are recognized, i.e., if
they share a common tag, then the  values im-
prove signicantly. Table 3 shows both types of
results.
It is interesting to note the variation in type agree-
ment for words of dierent syntactic categories.
Agreement on adjectives is consistently high while
the agreement on the type of subjectivity ex-
pressed by modals and adverbs is consistently low.
This contrasts with the fact that word agreement
for modals, in particular, and, to a lesser extent,
adverbs was high. This lack of agreement sug-
gests that the type of subjectivity expressed by
adjectives is more easily distinguished than that
of modals or adverbs. This is particularly impor-
tant because the number of adjectives included in
subjective elements is high. In contrast, the num-
bers of modals and adverbs are relatively low.
Additional insight can be gained by combining
the 3 evaluative classications (i.e., e+, e- and
e?) to form a single tag, e, representing any
form of evaluative expression. Table 4 presents
type agreement results for the tag set e, u, o.
In contrasting Tables 3 and 4, it is surprising
to note that most of the  values decrease when
the distinction among the evaluative types is re-
moved. This suggests that the three evaluative
types are natural classications. Only for adverbs
does type agreement improve with the smaller
tag set; this indicates that it is dicult to dis-
tinguish the evaluative nature of adverbs. Note
also that agreement for modals is not impacted
by the change in tag sets. This fact supports the
hypothesis that modals are used primary to ex-
press uncertainty. As a nal point, we look at
patterns of agreement in type classication using
the models of symmetry, marginal homogeneity,
quasi-independence, and quasi-symmetry. Each
model tests for a specic pattern of agreement:
symmetry tests the interchangeability of taggers,
marginal homogeneity veries the absence of bias
among taggers, quasi-independence veries that
the taggers act independently when they disagree,
and quasi-symmetry tests for the presence of any
pattern in their disagreements. For a more com-
plete description of these models and their use
in analyzing intercoder reliability see (Bruce and
Wiebe, 1999). In short, the results presented in
Table 5 indicate that the taggers are not inter-
changeable: they exhibit biases in their type clas-
sications, and there is a pattern of correlated dis-
agreement in the assignment of the original type
tags. Surprisingly, the taggers appear to act in-
dependently when they disagree in assigning the
compressed type tags (i.e., tags e, u and o). This
shift in the pattern of disagreement between tag-
gers again suggests that the compression of the
evaluative tags was inappropriate. Additionally,
these ndings suggest that it may be possible to
automatically correct the type biases expressed
by the taggers using the technique described in
(Bruce and Wiebe, 1999), a topic that will be in-
vestigated in future work.
6.3 Uniqueness
Based on previous work (Wiebe et al, 1998), we
hypothesized that low-frequency words are associ-
ated with subjectivity. Table 6 provides evidence
that the number of unique words (words that ap-
pear just once) in subjective elements is higher
than expected. The rst row gives information
for all words and the second gives information for
words that appear just once. The gures in the
Num columns are total counts, and the gures in
the P columns give the proportion that appear in
subjective elements. The Agree columns give in-

formation for the subset of the corresponding data
set upon which the two annotators agree.
Comparison of rows 1 and 2 across columns
shows that the proportion of unique words that
are subjective is higher than the proportion of all
words that are subjective. In all cases, this dier-
ence in proportions is highly statistically signi-
cant.
6.4 Types and Context
An interesting question is, when a word appears
in multiple subjective elements, are those subjec-
tive elements all the same type? Table 7 shows
that a signicant portion are used in more than
one type. Each item considered in the table is a
word-POS pair that appears more than once in the
corpus. The gures shown are the total number of
word-POS items that appear more than once (the
columns labeled MultInst) and the proportion of
those items that appear in more than one type
of subjective element (the columns labeled Mult-
Type). These results highlight the need for contex-
tual disambiguation. For example, one thinks of
great as a positive evaluative term, but its polarity
depends on the context; it can be used negatively
evaluatively in a context such as \Just great." A
goal of performing subjective-element annotations
is to support learning such local contextual inu-
ences.
7 Generating and Testing PSEs
using Document-Level
Annotations
This section uses the opinion-piece annotations to
expand our set of PSEs beyond those that can be
derived from the subjective-element annotations.
Precision is used to assess feature quality. The
precision of feature F for class C is the number
of Fs that occur in units of class C over the total
number of Fs that occur anywhere in the data.
An important motivation for using the opinion-
piece data is that there is a large amount of it,
and manually rening existing annotations as de-
scribed in section 5.2 is much easier and more re-
liable than other types of subjectivity annotation.
However, we cannot expect absolutely high pre-
cisions for two reasons. First, the distribution of
opinions and non-opinions is highly skewed in fa-
vor of non-opinions. For example, in Table 1, tag-
ger 1 classies only 23 of 293 articles as opinion
pieces. Second, as discussed in section 4, opin-
ion pieces contain objective sentences and non
opinion-pieces contain subjective sentences. For
example, in WSJ-SE, which has been annotated
at the sentence and document levels, 70% of the
sentences in opinion pieces are subjective and 30%
are objective. In non-opinion pieces, 44% of the
sentences are subjective and only 56% are objec-
tive.
To give an idea of expected precisions, let us
consider the precision of subjective sentences with
respect to opinion pieces. Suppose that 15% of
the sentences in the dataset are in opinions, 85%
in non-opinions. Let us assume the proportions of
subjective and objective sentences in opinion and
non-opinion pieces given just above. Let N be the
total number of sentences. The desired precision
is the number of subjective sentences in opinions
over the total number of subjective sentences. It
is .22:
p=.15 * N * .70 / (.15 * N * .70 + .85 * N * .44).
In addition, we are assessing PSEs, which are
only potentially subjective; many have objective
as well as subjective uses.
Thus, even if precisions are much lower than 1,
we use increases in precision over a baseline as ev-
idence of promising PSEs. The baseline for com-
parison is the number of word instances in opin-
ion pieces, divided by the total number of word
instances. Table 8 shows the precisions for three
types of PSEs. The freq columns give total fre-
quencies, and the +prec columns show the im-
provements in precision from the baseline. The
baseline precisions are given at the bottom of the
table.
As mentioned above, (Wiebe, 2000) showed suc-
cess automatically identifying adjective PSEs us-
ing Lin's method, seeded by a small amount of de-
tailed manual annotations. Desiring to move away
from manually annotated data, for this paper the
same process is used, but the seed words are all
the adjectives (verbs) in the training data. In ad-
dition, in the current setting, there are no a priori
values to use for parameters C (cluster size) and
FT (ltering threshold), as there were in (Wiebe,
2000), and results vary with dierent parameter
settings. Thus, a train-validate-test process is ap-
propriate. In Table 8, the numbers given under,
e.g., W9-10, are the results obtained when W9-10
is used as the test set. One of the other datasets,
say W9-22, was used as the training set, meaning
that all the adjectives (verbs) in that dataset are
the seed words, and all ltering was performed us-
ing only that data. The seed-ltering process was
repeated with dierent settings of C and FT , pro-
ducing a dierent set of adjectives (verbs) for each
setting. A third dataset, say W9-33, was used as a
validation set, i.e., among all the sets of adjectives
generated from the training set, those with good
performance on the validation set were selected as

the PSEs to test on the test set. A set was consid-
ered to have good performance on the validation
set if its precision is at least .25 and its frequency
is at least 100. Since this process is meant to
be a method for mining existing document-level
annotations for PSEs, the existing opinion-piece
annotations were used for training and validation.
Our manual opinion-piece annotations were used
for testing.
The row labeled unique words shows the preci-
sion on the test set of the individual words that
are unique in the test set. The increase over base-
line precision shows that low-frequency words can
be informative for recognizing subjectivity.
Note that the features all do better and worse
on the same data sets. This shows that the subjec-
tivity is somehow harder to identify in, say, W9-33
than in W9-10; it also shows an important consis-
tency among the features, even though they are
identied in dierent ways.
8 Conclusions
This paper presents the results of an empirical ex-
amination of subjectivity at the dierent levels of
a text: the expression level, the sentence level,
and the document level. While analysis of subjec-
tivity is perhaps most natural and precise at the
expression level, document-level annotations are
freely available from a number of sources and are
appropriate for many applications. The sentence-
level annotation is a workable intermediate level:
sentence-level judgments are not as ne-grained as
expression-level judgments, and they don't involve
the large amount of noise found at the document
level.
As part of this examination, we present a study
of annotator agreement characterizing the di-
culty of identifying subjectivity at the dierent
levels of a text. The results demonstrate that not
only can subjectivity be identied at the docu-
ment level with high reliability, but that it is also
possible to identify expression-level subjectivity,
albeit with lower reliability.
Using manual annotations, we are able to char-
acterize subjective language. At the expression
level, we found that it is natural to distinguish
among positively evaluative, negatively evalua-
tive, and speculative uses of a word. We also
found that subjective text contains a high pro-
portion of unique word occurrences, much more so
than ordinary text. Rather than ignoring or dis-
carding unique words, we demonstrate that the
occurrence of a unique word is a PSE. We also
found that agreement is higher for some syntac-
tic word classes, e.g., for adjectives in comparison
with determiners.
Finally, we are able to mine PSEs from text
tagged at the document level. Given the diculty
of evaluating PSEs in document-level subjectiv-
ity classication due to the mix of subjective and
objective sentences, the PSEs identied in this
study exhibit relatively high precision. In future
work, we will investigate document-level classi-
cation using these PSEs, as well as other methods
for extracting PSEs from text tagged at the doc-
ument level; methods to be investigated include
mutual-bootstrapping and/or co-training.
