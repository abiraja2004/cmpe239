.Abstract 
This paper describes how recent linguistic results in 
explaining Japanese short and long distance scram 
hling (:an be directly incorporated into an exist- 
ing principles-and-parameters-based p rser with only 
triviM modifications. ' \['he fact that this is realizable 
on a parser originally designed for a fixed-word-order 
language, together with the fact thai; Japanese scram- 
bling is complex, attests to the high degree of cross 
linguistic generalization present in the theory. 
1 In t roduct ion  
l)uring the past several years, the phenomenon k own 
as "sermnbling" has become a topic of some interest; 
it is of particular importance in languages like Get'- 
man, Japanese, Korean and tlindi among others, its 
opposed to fixed-word-order languages like English. 
Scrambling can pose both sever(', linguistic and cornpu- 
rational ditficulties for naturM language parsers. This 
paper describes how these problems are dealt with in 
a Principles-and-I)aran3eters-based p rser. Japanese, 
at first glance, seems to permit fMrly-free permutation 
of objects: 
(I) Short distance (Vl'-internal) scrambling 
Ca) aohn-ga Mary-n! kono hon-o ageta (koto) t 
John gave this book to Mary 
(b) ,Iohn-ga kono hon-o Mary-n! ageta (koto) 
(2) Short (or medium)distance scrambling to IP 
(at) Mary-ga John-n! sono hon-o watasita (koto) 
Mary handed that book to John 
(b) SOIl() hon-o John-n! Mary-ga watasita (koto) 
(e) .Iohn-ui sono hon-o Mary-ga watasita (koto) 
(3) Long distance scrambling 
Ca) 3ohn-ga Mary-ga sono hon o katta to omotte 
iru (koto) 
John thinks that Mary bought that book 
(13) sono hon-o ,lohn-ga Mary-ga katta to olnotte

*The author  is deeply grateful  to I{obert C. Berwlck for his 
technical  advice and comments .  
(c) Mary-ga John-ga Bill-n! sono hon-o watasita~ 
to omotte iru (koto) 
Mary thinks John handed that book to Bill 
(d) Bill-n! sono hon-o Mary-ga,lohn-ga wata.sita 
to omotte iru (koto) 
(Exan3ple (l) is take.n from (Tada, 1993), and (2) and 
(3) from (Saito, 1985).) 
To handle examples like these, computational lin- 
guists have sometimes adopted the straightforward 
strategy of adding permutation machinery on top of an 
existing formMism: for example, Becket el; M.(1990) 
augment he '\[?ee Adjoining Grammar (TAG) sys- 
tent using either: (1) multi-component (set-based) 
adjunct!on (Me-TAG), or (9) relaxed linear prece- 
dence (FO-TAG), I~o handle so-called "long distance" 
scrambling in German (that is, scrambling over clausal 
boundaries). 2 This augmentation aims to directly re- 
pair the lack off pernmtation in ordinary TAGs by 
adding a mechanism that can (over)generate many 
different scramblings, llowever, as so often hap- 
pens, when one turns to a richer sel; of exmnples in 
other languages, or the interaction of scrambling with 
other phenomena such as anaphor binding and weak 
crossover, things are not as simple as they appear and 
the straightforward solution breaks clown. 
An altogether different appro~ch is t~ken in this pa 
per. The goM is to produce an a nMysis of scram- 
bling that works for different languages and a wider 
variety of examples wilhou! introducing new machin- 
ery. The essential idea is to rely on the same (uni- 
versal) constraints and parsing algorithms Mready in 
place for non-scramhling languages, e.g. English. \[n 
other words, we adopt the null hypothesis. So, we be- 
gin with a comImtationally-rnodelh:d linguistic frame- 
work that is already capable of handling scrambling as 
the dedm-tive result of interactions ofbasic principles, 
such as general movement (Move-c 0 with Binding the- 
ory. The point is that scrambling (like the so-called 
i asmv ; and "dative" constructions) obeys the same 
i:estrictions ah'eady showu to be operative for other 
syntactic phenomena, and so shoukl follow from in- 
1 (Salt, o, 1992) remarks  that  ko to %he fact. that '  is of ten added 
to avoid the unuagurahless  result ing fl'om not hav ing a topic in

coinmunlcat ion) ,  l  hat  German is normal ly  considered to have 
only short, d is tance scrambl ing  for technical  reasons. We will 
not explore this here, but  note that  none of die examples  lu'e -

~tccoun~, of its (r~*ther subtle) interactions with pre- 
viously described phenomena l iot handled ill the 
(Becket ct, al., 1990) a~ceoultl\[,. As we will see, the sys- 
tem directly hmidles a surprisingly l;~rge munl)er of 
examples from l, he recenl, l i terature.

reanMysis and the ECP, and therefore analyses, turn 
on it. Much has also been written on this issue as it re- 
lates to scrambling in other languages, ee (Mahajan, 
1990) on l\]indi and (Webelhuth, 1989) on Germanic 
languages. 
2.2 Scrambling and Binding 
Our goal in this and the following sections is to rein- 
terpret the data in terms of the implemented theory 
outlined above, and see how far we get. Wc will point 
out any oddities and problems along tile way. All ex- 
amples are taken From (Saito, 1985) and have been 
verified to work on the parser unless otherwise stated.

kate binds John. (4c) and (4d) flora (Saito, 1992) 
are also handled by Binding theory. In (4c) olagai 
is unbound which violates Condition A (all anaphors 
have to be A-bound). In (4d) it is A-bound since we 
have assumed scrambling to A-positions. Ilence, these 
data. involving tile scrambling of anaphors and pro- 
nouns constitutes evidence that scrambled elements 
obey the usual principh;s. 
2.3 Scrambling and Weak Crossover  
Weak Crossover (WCO) effects are a well-known phe- 
nomenon in English. For example: 
(5)  (a)  Whoi  loves his i n\ ]other  
(b)* Who/ does hisi mother love ti 
(5a) can be interpreted as asking tile question for  
which. person a:, x loves x 's  mother. Crucially, (51)) 
cannot be interpreted as asking the question: for' 
which, person x, x 's  ?no/her loves x. In the parser, the 
unavailability of (Sb) is explained by an LF principle, 
Ileanalyze Pro-l;'orms, which reanMyzes as variables 
those pro-rorms (e.g. pronouns) hound by an operator 
in tm A-position, as suggested by the above logical 
analysis. \[iowever, this fails when the pro-fbrm inter- 
venes between the operator mid its trace, as is the case 
in (Sh). 
(6) (a) Johni-o karei-no hahaoya-ga ti aisiteru

Figure 2: Examples of vacuons crambling 
The problem that arises is that the parser produces 
extra parses not eliminated by the existing principles, 
involving vacuous crambling of the form shown in fig- 
tire 2. 
Let us define the obvious notion of "non-vacuous" 
or visible scrambling as scrambling that "passes over" 
one or more overt elements at S-strncture. Adopting 
this definition immediately eliminates cases (a) (c), 
and more importantly, the repeated application of case 
(a) which causes parsing non-termination, la In par- 
titular, this rules out vacnons scrambling over empty 
subjects, e.g. pro or PRO. As far the data from (Saito, 
1985),(1992) and ('I'ada, 1993) goes, this is no restric- 
tion at all. This leaves case (d) which is vacuous only 
when considered as a "pair", i.e. each sub-instance is
clearly non-vacuous. 
We will make use of the following assumptions: 
1. Scrambling is always to the left. 
2. Empty NPs don't scramble. 
Again, judging from the data, these appear to be no 
restriction all. Now, it, is simple to implement he 
non-vacuity (NV) constraint as a licensing condition 
on phrasal adjunction: 
IPi --+ sNP, IPi(x), {NV(x)} 
VP; ~sNP,  VPi(x), {NV(z)} 
ltere, we assume that there are two phrasM adjnnc- 
tion rules, for IP attd VP, that introduce scrambled 
NPs (sNPs). 14 Here, {NV(x)} is a semantic aelion 
which checks the frontier of x, the tP or VP phrase, 
for non-vacuity using the following left-to-right, two 
state machine: 
State 0: (Start) See an overt node, go to State 1. 
State 1: (End) Skip until see an NP gap, halt. 
Note this is potentially inefficient since the NV con- 
straint is only checked when the LtUmachine com- 
pletes the RHS of a rule, i.e. when it completes an IP 
or VP phrase. By operating at the lew~l of the terminal 
string, instead of waiting for the complete IP or VP, 
laNote that the string w'tcuous empty operator movement 
showIl in (C) do(Is not count as an instance of scrambling. It's 
not adjunction at VP or \[P. 
14The tricky case of (d) shown earlier can be handled hy re- 
stricting sNP to overt NPs only. 
we (:an take advantage of the fact; that scrambling is 
always to tile left to implement the non-vacuity check 
in ~ strictly left-to-right fashion. As before, when we 
see a potentially scrambled NP, we start the two state 
machine. Ilere, the basic idea is that a shift action 
(read a terminM) corresponds to the state 0 to state 
1 transition. Similarly, a NP-~ ,~ reduce action corre- 
sponds to the "see an NP gap and halt" part. Con,- 
paring the two algorithms on 50 Japanese sentences 
(25 scrambling examples) fi'om (Saito, 1985) & (Las- 
nik & Saito, 1984), an average speed-up factor of 2.3 
per sentence and a total of 3.2 over the 50 sentences 
was observed for the second algorithm over just the 
phrase structure recovery portion. Due to the varying 
effects from the participation of other principh'.s, the 
improvement for the total parsing time was le.ss clear- 
cut, generally varying between o speed-up at all l;o a 
factor of two depending on the sentence. Using the 25 
non-scrambling examples fl'om the test set, an addi- 
tional experiment hetween two variants of the parser, 
one with and one without the ability to handle scram 
bling, showed that the ability to handle scrambling ex- 
acts a penalty of about 30 50% in total parsing time, 
In conclusion, given tit(; pertlaps disproportionate el'- 
feet of scrambling on parsing time, we suggest that 
although scrambling comes virtually for free linguisti- 
cally speaking, the same certainly does not N)pear to 
be the case for computation.
