Abstract 
This paper argues that it is impossible to separate lexical and encyclopedic knowledge 
and describes an attempt to build a large lexical database that contains the range of 
information needed to make a parser or a text generation system interpret and use 
words and phrases correctly. 
1 Int roduct ion 
Any natural anguage processing system needs both knowledge about words and knowl- 
edge about he world. Many natural language systems divide these two kinds of knowledge 
into two knowledge bases, which we call the lexicon and the encyclopedia for the purposes 
of this discussion. We argue that the distinction between the lexicon and the encyclo- 
pedia is difficult to maintain both in theory and in practice. We describe the design 
and development ofa large lexical database intended to support parsing, generation, and 
information retrieval applications. We claim that these applications require information 
of many different kinds, some of which is traditionally stored in a dictionary, some in a 
thesaurus, and some in an encyclopedia. 
We need to support not just alphabetic access to this information but access through 
semantic links. Bierman \[1964\] was one of the first to describe lexical-semantic l nks 
between words. They define the basic organization of semantic information, he claims. 
He paints an image of a very large single-page dictionary with language-specific nodes 
connected by semantic relations. 
Can we distinguish between the lexicon and the encyclopedia in this context? Bierwisch 
and Kiefer \[1970\] assume that both kinds of information are contained in the same lexical 
entry. The distinction between linguistic or lexical and encyclopedic knowledge, they say, 
corresponds to the difference between the core and the periphery of a lexical entry, where: 
The core of a lexical reading comprises all and only those semantic spec- 
ifications that determine, roughly speaking, its place within the system of 
dictionary entries, i.e., delimit it from other (non-synonymous) entries. The 
periphery consists of those semantic specifications which could be removed 
from its reading without changing its relation to other lexical readings within 
the same grammar. \[Bierwisch and Kiefer 1970, 69-70\] 
The major difficulty with this criterion is its instability. As new entries are added to 
the system, information sufficient o distinguish one entry from another may have to be 
179 
shifted from the periphery to the core - and thus from the encyclopedia to the lexicon. 
For instance, suppose a new entry, "leopard - a large wild cat" is to be added. The entire 
lexicon must be searched for entries that mention large wild cats. If one is found, say 
"lion - a large wild cat," then enough information must be added to both definitions to 
differentiate l opard and lion from each other. 
Apresyan, Mel'~uk, and Zolkovsky run into the same difficulty of distinguishing lexieal 
and encyclopedic nformation i  attempting to define the lexical universe of a word CO. 
The main themes dealt with under the heading 'lexical universe' are: 1) the 
types of CO; 2) the main part or phases of CO; 3) typical situations occurring 
before and after CO, etc. Thus, the section lexical universe for the word skis 
consists of a list of the types of skis (racing, mountain, jumping, hunting), their 
main parts (skis proper and bindings), the main objects and actions necessary 
for the correct use (exploitation) ofskis (poles, grease, to wax), the main types 
of activities connected with skis (a ski-trip, a ski-race ...) ... the sections 
contain only such words as are necessary for talking on the topic, and nothing 
else. \[Apresyan et al 1970\] 
The problem is that "what is needed for talking about the topic" depends very much 
on who is going to do the talking. The definition of ski in Webster's New International 
(2nd edition) begins: 
One of a pair of narrow strips of wood, metal, or plastic, usually in com- 
bination, bound one on each foot and used for gliding over a snow-covered 
surface. 
Apresyan et al do not provide for three of the items mentioned here: what skis 
are made of (wood, plastic, or metal), what shape they come in (long and narrow) and 
where they belong spatially (on the human foot). Yet these items could be essential to 
understanding implicit inferences in a story. 
It was snowing. Jim took out his skis and the can of wax. He began to 
wax the wood carefully. Then he looked for the poles. 
It could be needed to answer questions: 
Jim skied rapidly down the mountain. 
Question: What was Jim wearing? 
slippers skis sandals 
Although in English and Russian it is possible to refer to skis without knowing that 
they are long and narrow it is not possible in Navajo or certain African languages where 
physical shapes determine verb forms. While the entry in Webster's New International 
goes on at length beyond the sentence given above, it does not include all the items that 
Apresyan mentions. Clearly the boundaries of the lexical universe are not well defined. 
The dichotomy between the lexicon and the encyclopedia s particularly hard to pre- 
serve during the updating process. Recognizing definitions phrased in ordinary English 
is difficult \[Bierwisch and Kiefer, 1970\]. This information does not come neatly packaged 
and marked "for the lexicon" and "for the encyclopedia". How do we tell which is which? 
180 
Addition of information to one part of the entry may necessitate updating other parts 
of the entry. For example, if we learn that record is a verb as well as a noun we need 
to add morphological information and describe the relation between record and erase. 
We should probably describe recording materials, as well. We also need to add that 
the verb record is a factive, i.e., the assertion that someone records an action implies 
the assertion that the action really occurreed. Which of this information is lexical and 
which is encyclopedic? Both theoretical and practical arguments convince us that the 
lexicon-encyclopedia ichtomy is not valid. 
Information about semantic relationships between words - thesaurus information - is 
needed for many reasons. It is crucial to semantic access. Hirst and Morris \[1990\] have 
shown that it is fundamental to language understanding. Fox \[1980, 1988\], Nutter et al 
\[1988\] and Wang et al \[1985\] have used thesaurus information to improve the results of an 
information retrieval system. Eiler \[1979\] has shown the importance oflexical relationships 
in human text generation. Lee \[1991\] is using this kind of information to generate cohesive 
text by machine. Zhang \[1990\] is using it to generate xplanations. 
We need to store all this information not just for words but for phrases. Becker \[1975\] 
argues cogently that language is ordinarily generated in large swatches, not a word at a 
time. Commercial dictionaries include many phrasal entries. For example, approximately 
160~ of the main entries in Webster's Seventh Collegiate Dictionary are phrases and many 
other phrases appear as "runons" at the foot of other entries. Charniak \[1972\] makes it 
clear that "birthday party" needs an entry of its own - and shows also that its lexical 
universe is huge. 
2 Organization of the Lexical Database 
Because we want to see our lexicon used by as many people as possible, we have sought 
sources for our data that will permit us to distribute the database to anyone who plans 
to use for research purposes. Collins Publishers has generously agreed we may give a 
copy of our lexicon including data derived from the first edition of the Collins English 
Dictionary (CED) to anyone who qualifies to obtain a machine-readable copy from the 
Data Collection Initiative. Another valuable source of lexical data is the Brandeis Verb 
Lexicon constructed by Grimshaw and Jackendoff \[1985\]. Sven Jacobson \[1964, 1978\] has 
kindly allowed us to keyboard and distribute his Dictionary of Adverb Placement. We 
have also put into machine readable form the Adjective, Adverb, Noun, and Verb Lists 
developed from Householder's NSF project of twenty-five years ago \[1964, 1965\]. 
Our lexical database is organized and stored using the Oracle Relational Database 
Management System. Our database relations (which we will call tables to distinguish 
them from semantic relations) include a main table with the word, and its homograph 
and sense number (from the CED) combined into one field, the part of speech, and the 
source. Each word with a different homograph and sense number (assigned in CED) is 
put into a different entry for the purpose of lexical disambiguation. Words that have no 
homograph or sense number in CED are assigned a code of-1. We have also designed 
separate tables for each part of speech. Each table contains different information specific 
to that part of speech. 
The noun table contains information about whether a noun is regular or irregular, 
abstract or concrete, count or mass, human, animate or inanimate, singular or plural, 
common or proper, collective or not, what gender it is, and whether it appears in an 
181 
Indiana noun list. We have a separate table for Indiana nouns (those that support that 
clauses) giving the number of the Indiana list \[Bridgeman 1965\]. Then there is still another 
table that gives the definition and an example for each Indiana noun list. We also have a 
separate table for nouns with irregular plurals, like child, goose, and oz. 
There are a number of different verb tables. The main verb table tells whether a verb 
is regular or irregular, dynamic or stative, transitive or intransitive (or both), takes a 
sentential complement or not, can be put into passive voice or not. If it is in a speech act 
class \[Wierzbicka, 1989\] or a performative class \[McCawley, 1979\] then the class will be 
given. Then there is a table for strong verbs with their forms. There is a case table giving 
information about verb arguments. If a verb takes sentential complements i  appears in a 
special table that tells what complementizers the verb takes, its implicative class (factive, 
etc.), whether it is subject o raising, and whether it appears in an Indiana verb list. The 
Indiana verb table gives Indiana verb classes in which the verb appears. There is yet 
another table that gives the defining information for the Indiana verb lists. 
The adjective table indicates whether the adjective is dynamic or stative, gradable or 
non-gradable, inherent or non-inherent. An adjective may be intensitive. It may appear 
as a post-determiner. It may be a general adjective susceptible to subjective measure, 
a general adjective susceptible to objective measure including size or shape, or color. 
It may be a denominal adjective denoting material, or a denominal adjective denoting 
provenance or style. Information about the semantic lasses an adjective belongs to is 
essential to determining its position in the sentence during text generation. While most 
adjectives can occur in both attributive and predicate positions, some are non-attributive, 
others are non-predicative. We also have a table for unpredictable adjective inflections 
and another for Indiana adjectives \[Householder et al 1965\]. Our adverb tables have been 
fully discussed elsewhere \[Pin-Ngern et al 1990\]. 
We also have a table listing lexical-semantic relations with definitions and examples 
and then several tables of lexical- semantic relationships \[Ahlswede and Evens, 1988a\]. 
Our plans include tables containing other information from CED such as definitions, 
pronunciations, and etymologies, but these have not been built since none of us is currently 
using that information. 
3 Entries for Phrases 
We have been concerned for several years with the design of entries for phrases; it seems 
apparent that we need to record the same kind of information for phrases as for single word 
entries and that they are involved in the same lexical relations as other words and more 
besides \[Markowitz et al 1988; Ahlswede t al. 1988\]. Li and Markowitz are concentrating 
on questions about phrasal verbs. Problems about the kinds of constructions that these 
verbs take part in have often been discussed in the literature but not resolved. Markowitz 
has devised several series of examples that we are trying out on every passerby who 
happens to be a native speaker of English. The data collected so far is chaotic; it suggests 
that the explanations in the literature are over-simplified. CED contains many thousands 
of phrasal main entries and many more phrases appear as runons in other entries. We 
are trying to design programs to translate these phrasal entries into entries in the lexical 
database. 
182 
4 Arguments for Verbs 
Information about appropriate arguments for verbs is an obvious need. We are building 
a table that indicates for each sense of the verb what cases it takes, how those cases are 
syntactically realized (as subject, object, or object of a preposition), whether it is obligaory 
or  not, and what are the selection restrictions on the fillers of those case slots. Joanne 
Dardaine wrote a program to build skeleton entries for the verbs in the Brandeis Verb 
Lexicon \[Grimshaw and Jackendoff, 1985\]. Then we sit around and argue about additional 
examples, beginning with verbs that we are using in text generation i a tutoring system 
for cardiovascular physiology \[Zhang et hi. 1990\] and in an explanation subsystem for an 
expert system for stroke \[Lee and Evens 1991\]. Grimshaw's new book \[1990\] on argument 
patterns has been of the greatest help. Given the theoretical disagreements between 
Fillmore \[1970\], Bresnan \[1982\], and Grimshaw \[1990\], it is not possible to come up with 
an ideal solution. When in doubt we try to make the finest distinctions we can, in the 
belief that it will be easier for others to clump our categories together than to divide them 
further. 
Clearly much of what we are doing for verbs needs to be done for adjectives and 
adverbs. Much of the necessary research for adverbs has been carried out by House- 
holder's group \[1965\] and by Sven Jacobson and published in very detailed and useful 
forms \[1964, 1978\]. Jacobson has generously given permission for us "to include this work 
in our database. Sumali Pin-Ngern Conlon is using the superb computing facilities of the 
University of Mississippi, where she is now a faculty member, to put this material into 
machine readable form and to combine it with the information from the Indiana Adverb 
Lists \[Householder t hi. 1965\]. We are trying to locate and understand more of the 
research on adjectives such as the work of Ljung at Goteborg, before we start to enhance 
our adjective tables appropriately. 
5 Sentential Complements  
We have split off the problem of sentential complements from other arguments for verbs 
because we wanted to store this information i separate database tables and because there 
are there are separate rich sources of information. Yu-Fen Huang has entered the verbs 
from Wierzbicka's list of speech act verbs. We are trying to find out if CED synonyms of 
speech act verbs are also speech act verbs and if they sometimes fit into the same speech 
act classes \[Wierzbicka 1989\] or performative classes, using McCawley's \[1979\] categories. 
Pin-Ngern wrote a program to put Indiana Verb List verbs \[Alexander and Kunz 1964; 
Bridgeman et hi. 1965\] into tables in the database. Huang is rewriting that program to 
include further information and trying to correlate Wierzbicka's \[1989\] speech act verbs 
and the Indiana verbs with their CED homograph and sense numbers. 
6 Sublanguage Information 
CED contains quite a lot of information about sublanguage and register (e.g., entries begin 
"a legal term for" or "a slang name for"). We are trying to figure out how and where to 
capture this information so that we can study it more effectively and also so that we can 
figure out to use it to make appropriate subsets of the lexical database. 
183 
Of course, sublanguage affects the syntactic orrelates of words as well as the lexical 
ones. It is clear that we need to relate syntactic information in the lexical database to a 
given sense and homographic number. 
We are designing tools to help us deliver subsets of the database to potential users. 
Clearly we need to be able to make subsets on the basis of sublanguage information as 
well as from word lists given us by people who want data to match. We expect to make 
this kind of data available in fiat files (unless the user has an Oracle Relational Database 
Management System). All the attributes currently recorded in the database are also 
defined in the database. Any user of the database will be provided with this information. 
We expect that most of these users will need add to information to the data that we give 
them. So far our lexical data acquisition tools function mainly as SQL forms \[Evens et al 
1989\]. We need to provide flat file versions of these tools. 
7 Tools for Accessing and Building the Database 
We a re designing two families of tools, one for building the database and one for accessing 
it. Database construction tools themselves fall into three categories. One group of tools 
is intended to collect information from human informants to make it easy to add material 
to the lexicon for some special purpose or to extend existing information. For example, 
we have a tool to examine synonyms of verbs on the Indiana Verb Lists that also take 
sentential complements and add them to the correct lists \[Evens et aL 1989\]. Another 
group of tools is intended to take explicit information from a source and put it into the 
right table or tables. The third group of tools, most of which were originally built for 
sublanguage study, is designed to tackle text, sometimes dictionary definitions, sometimes 
other text, and extract information from it. These tools make lists of words and phrases 
and count them and parse text. Frank Rinaldo has built most of these tools and is working 
on bigger and better ones. 
Our Oracle database xpert, Robert Strutz, is working on tools to access the database. 
These tools extract information to be used by a parser or a text generation program. Other 
tools in this category check the database for missing data and make reports. One tool 
makes a list of nouns that appear in subsidiary noun tables but not in the main noun 
table, for example. Still other tools make subsets of the database for different kinds of 
user specifications. 
8 Current Applications 
A small subset of the lexical database, the stroke lexicon \[Ahlswede and Evens, 1988b\], 
is being used in experiments in information retrieval and text generation. Wang et aL 
\[1989\] are using thesaurus information to enhance queries in an interactive information 
retrieval system, which operates as a separate PC program and carries out searches of the 
stroke literature ither independently or in support of an expert system. Lee and Evens 
\[1991\] are using the stroke lexicon to generate xplanations for an expert system for stroke. 
Information about lexical-semantic relations is used in an experiment to make that text 
cohesive; other lexical information is used to support the basic generation process. 
184 
9 Summary 
We are trying to build a big lexical database that contains detailed information about all 
its entries. We argue in support of this enterprise that much information often classified 
as encyclopedic is needed by natural language processing programs trying to carry out 
tasks in parsing, generation, and information retrieval. In particular, the need for the- 
saurus information (information about lexical and semantic relationships between words) 
is becoming increasingly clear. We are convinced that phrasal entries need information 
that is at least as rich and detailed as that provided for individual words. 
We are trying to make this lexicon usable by many different people for many different 
tasks, with the goal of providing it free to anyone who can use it. This means that we must 
build it out of pieces that are readily available to the research community, that we must 
be able to provide subsets of many different kinds, and that we must provide tools so that 
others can access these files and add to them whatever further entries and information 
they need for particular applications.
