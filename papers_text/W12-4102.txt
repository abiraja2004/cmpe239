Abstract
Most of the research on social networks has al-
most exclusively focused on positive links be-
tween entities. There are much more insights
that we may gain by generalizing social net-
works to the signed case where both positive
and negative edges are considered. One of the
reasons why signed social networks have re-
ceived less attention that networks based on
positive links only is the lack of an explicit
notion of negative relations in most social net-
work applications. However, most such appli-
cations have text embedded in the social net-
work. Applying linguistic analysis techniques
to this text enables us to identify both positive
and negative interactions. In this work, we
propose a new method to automatically con-
struct a signed social network from text. The
resulting networks have a polarity associated
with every edge. Edge polarity is a means for
indicating a positive or negative affinity be-
tween two individuals. We apply the proposed
method to a larger amount of online discus-
sion posts. Experiments show that the pro-
posed method is capable of constructing net-
works from text with high accuracy. We also
connect out analysis to social psychology the-
ories of signed network, namely the structural
balance theory.
1 Introduction
A great body of research work has focused on so-
cial network analysis. Social network analysis plays
a huge role in understanding and improving so-
cial computing applications. Most of this research
has almost exclusively focused on positive links be-
tween individuals (e.g. friends, fans, followers,
etc.). However, if we carefully examine the relation-
ships between individuals in online communities,
we will find out that limiting links to positive inter-
actions is a very simplistic assumption. It is true that
people show positive attitude by labeling others as
friends, and showing agreement, but they also show
disagreement, and antagonism toward other mem-
bers of the online community. Discussion forums
are one example that makes it clear that considering
both positive and negative interactions is essential
for understanding the rich relationships that develop
between individuals in online communities.
If considering both negative and positive interac-
tions will provide much more insight toward under-
standing the social network, why did most of pre-
vious work only focus on positive interactions? We
think that one of the main reasons behind this is the
lack of a notion for explicitly labeling negative re-
lations. For example, most social web applications
allow people to mark others as friends, like them,
follow them, etc. However, they do not allow people
to explicitly label negative relations with others.
Previous work has built networks from discus-
sions by linking people who reply to one another.
Even though, the mere fact that X replied to Y ?s
post does show an interaction, it does not tell us any-
thing about the type of that interaction. In this case,
the type of interaction is not readily available; how-
ever it may be mined from the text that underlies
the social network. Hence, if we examine the text
exchanged between individuals, we may be able to
come up with conclusions about, not only the exis-
tence of an interaction, but also its type.
In this work, we apply Natural Language Pro-
cessing techniques to text correspondences ex-
changed between individuals to identify the under-
6
lying signed social structure in online communities.
We present and compare several algorithms for iden-
tifying user attitude and for automatically construct-
ing a signed social network representation. We ap-
ply the proposed methods to a large set of discussion
posts. We evaluate the performance using a manu-
ally labeled dataset.
The input to our algorithm is a set of text corre-
spondences exchanged between users (e.g. posts or
comments). The output is a signed network where
edges signify the existence of an interaction between
two users. The resulting network has polarity asso-
ciated with every edge. Edge polarity is a means for
indicating a positive or negative affinity between two
individuals.
The proposed method was applied to a very large
dataset of online discussions. To evaluate our auto-
mated procedure, we asked human annotators to ex-
amine text correspondences exchanged between in-
dividuals and judge whether their interaction is pos-
itive or negative. We compared the edge signs that
had been automatically identified to edges manually
created by human annotators.
We also connected our analysis to social psychol-
ogy theories, namely the Structural Balance The-
ory (Heider, 1946). The balance theory has been
shown to hold both theoretically (Heider, 1946) and
empirically (Leskovec et al, 2010b) for a variety
of social community settings. Showing that it also
holds for our automatically constructed network fur-
ther validates our results.
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In
section 2, we review some of the related prior work
on mining sentiment from text, mining online dis-
cussions, extracting social networks from text, and
analyzing signed social networks. We define our
problem and explain our approach in Section 3. Sec-
tion 4 describes our dataset. Results and discussion
are presented in Section 5. We present a possible
application for the proposed approach in Section 6.
We conclude in Section 7.
2 Related Work
In this section, we survey several lines of research
that are related to our work.
2.1 Mining Sentiment from Text
Our general goal of mining attitude from one in-
dividual toward another makes our work related to
a huge body of work on sentiment analysis. One
such line of research is the well-studied problem
of identifying the of individual words. In previ-
ous work, Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown (1997)
proposed a method to identify the polarity of ad-
jectives based on conjunctions linking them in a
large corpus. Turney and Littman (2003) used sta-
tistical measures to find the association between a
given word and a set of positive/negative seed words.
Takamura et al (2005) used the spin model to ex-
tract word semantic orientation. Finally, Hassan and
Radev (2010) use a random walk model defined over
a word relatedness graph to classify words as either
positive or negative.
Subjectivity analysis is yet another research line
that is closely related to our general goal of mining
attitude. The objective of subjectivity analysis is to
identify text that presents opinion as opposed to ob-
jective text that presents factual information (Wiebe,
2000). Prior work on subjectivity analysis mainly
consists of two main categories: subjectivity of a
phrase or word is analyzed regardless of the context
(Wiebe, 2000; Hatzivassiloglou and Wiebe, 2000;
Banea et al, 2008), or within its context (Riloff and
Wiebe, 2003; Yu and Hatzivassiloglou, 2003; Na-
sukawa and Yi, 2003; Popescu and Etzioni, 2005).
Hassan et al (2010) presents a method for identify-
ing sentences that display an attitude from the text
writer toward the text recipient. Our work is dif-
ferent from subjectivity analysis because we are not
only interested in discriminating between opinions
and facts. Rather, we are interested in identifying
the polarity of interactions between individuals. Our
method is not restricted to phrases or words, rather it
generalizes this to identifying the polarity of an in-
teraction between two individuals based on several
posts they exchange.
2.2 Mining Online Discussions
Our use of discussion threads as a source of data
connects us to some previous work on mining
online discussions. Lin et al (2009) proposed
a sparse coding-based model that simultaneously
models semantics and structure of threaded discus-
7
sions. Huang et al (2007) learn SVM classifiers
from data to extract (thread-title, reply) pairs. Their
objective was to build a chatbot for a certain do-
main using knowledge from online discussion fo-
rums. Shen et al (2006) proposed three clustering
methods for exploiting the temporal information in
discussion streams, as well as an algorithm based on
linguistic features to analyze discourse structure in-
formation.
2.3 Extracting Social Networks from Text
Little work has been done on the front of extracting
social relations between individuals from text. El-
son et al (2010) present a method for extracting so-
cial networks from nineteenth-century British nov-
els and serials. They link two characters based on
whether they are in conversation or not. McCal-
lum et al (2007) explored the use of structured data
such as email headers for social network construc-
tion. Gruzd and Hyrthonthwaite (2008) explored the
use of post text in discussions to study interaction
patterns in e-learning communities.
Our work is related to this line of research because
we employ natural language processing techniques
to reveal embedded social structures. Despite sim-
ilarities, our work is uniquely characterized by the
fact that we extract signed social networks from text.
2.4 Signed Social Networks
Most of the work on social networks analysis has
only focused on positive interactions. A few recent
papers have taken the signs of edges into account.
Brzozowski et al (2008) study the positive and
negative relationships between users of Essembly.
Essembly is an ideological social network that dis-
tinguishes between ideological allies and nemeses.
Kunegis et al (2009) analyze user relationships in
the Slashdot technology news site. Slashdot allows
users of the website to tag other users as friends or
foes, providing positive and negative endorsements.
Leskovec et al (2010c) study signed social networks
generated from Slashdot, Epinions, and Wikipedia.
They also connect their analysis to theories of signed
networks from social psychology. A similar study
used the same datasets for predicting positive and
negative links given their context (Leskovec et al,
2010a). Other work addressed the problem of clus-
tering signed networks by taking both positive and
negative edges into consideration (Yang et al, 2007;
Doreian and Mrvar, 2009).
All this work has been limited to analyzing a
handful of datasets for which an explicit notion of
both positive and negative relations exists. Our work
goes beyond this limitation by leveraging the power
of natural language processing to automate the dis-
covery of signed social networks using the text em-
bedded in the network.
3 Approach
The general goal of this work is to mine attitude be-
tween individuals engaged in an online discussion.
We use that to extract a signed social network rep-
resenting the interactions between different partici-
pants. Our approach consists of several steps. In
this section, we will explain how we identify senti-
ment at the word level (i.e. polarity), at the sentence
level (i.e. attitude), and finally generalize over this
to find positive/negative interactions between indi-
viduals based on their text correspondences.
The first step toward identifying attitude is to
identify polarized words. Polarized words are very
good indicators of subjective sentences and hence
we their existence will be highly correlated with the
existence of attitude. The method we use for identi-
fying word polarity is a Random Walk based method
over a word relatedness graph (Hassan and Radev,
2010).
The following step is to move to the sentence level
by examining different sentences to find out which
sentences display an attitude from the text writer to
the recipient. We train a classifier based on several
sources of information to make this prediction (Has-
san et al, 2010). We use lexical items, polarity tags,
part-of-speech tags, and dependency parse trees to
train a classifier that identifies sentences with atti-
tude.
Finally, we build a network connecting partici-
pants based on their interactions. We use the predic-
tions we made both at the word and sentence levels
to associate a sign to every edge.
3.1 Identified Positive/Negative Words
The first step toward identifying attitude is to iden-
tify words with positive/negative semantic orienta-
tion. The semantic orientation or polarity of a word
8
indicates the direction the word deviates from the
norm (Lehrer, 1974). Past work has demonstrated
that polarized words are very good indicators of
subjective sentences (Hatzivassiloglou and Wiebe,
2000; Wiebe et al, 2001). We use a Random Walk
based method to identify the semantic orientation
of words (Hassan and Radev, 2010). We construct
a graph where each node represents a word/part-
of-speech pair. We connect nodes based on syn-
onyms, hypernyms, and similar-to relations from
WordNet (Miller, 1995). For words that do not
appear in WordNet, we use distributional similar-
ity (Lee, 1999) as a proxy for word relatedness.
We use a list of words with known polarity (Stone
et al, 1966) to label some of the nodes in the graph.
We then define a random walk model where the set
of nodes correspond to the state space, and transi-
tion probabilities are estimated by normalizing edge
weights. We assume that a random surfer walks
along the word relatedness graph starting from a
word with unknown polarity. The walk continues
until the surfer hits a word with a known polarity.
Seed words with known polarity act as an absorb-
ing boundary for the random walk. We calculate the
mean hitting time (Norris, 1997) from any word with
unknown polarity to the set of positive seeds and the
set of negative seeds. If the absolute difference of
the two mean hitting times is below a certain thresh-
old, the word is classified as neutral. Otherwise, it
is labeled with the class that has the smallest mean
hitting time.
3.2 Identifying Attitude from Text
The first step toward identifying attitude is to iden-
tify words with positive/negative semantic orienta-
tion. The semantic orientation or polarity of a word
indicates the direction the word deviates from the
norm (Lehrer, 1974). We use OpinionFinder (Wil-
son et al, 2005a) to identify words with positive
or negative semantic orientation. The polarity of a
word is also affected by the context where the word
appears. For example, a positive word that appears
in a negated context should have a negative polarity.
Other polarized words sometimes appear as neutral
words in some contexts. Hence, we use the method
described in (Wilson et al, 2005b) to identify the
contextual polarity of words given their isolated po-
larity. A large set of features is used for that purpose
including words, sentences, structure, and other fea-
tures.
Our overall objective is to find the direct attitude
between participants. Hence after identifying the se-
mantic orientation of individual words, we move on
to predicting which polarized expressions target the
addressee and which are not.
Sentences that show an attitude are different from
subjective sentences. Subjective sentences are sen-
tences used to express opinions, evaluations, and
speculations (Riloff and Wiebe, 2003). While ev-
ery sentence that shows an attitude is a subjective
sentence, not every subjective sentence shows an at-
titude toward the recipient. A discussion sentence
may display an opinion about any topic yet no atti-
tude.
We address the problem of identifying sentences
with attitude as a relation detection problem in a su-
pervised learning setting (Hassan et al, 2010). We
study sentences that use second person pronouns and
polarized expressions. We predict whether the sec-
ond person pronoun is related to the polarized ex-
pression or not. We regard the second person pro-
noun and the polarized expression as two entities
and try to learn a classifier that predicts whether the
two entities are related or not. The text connecting
the two entities offers a very condensed represen-
tation of the information needed to assess whether
they are related or not. For example the two sen-
tences ?you are completely unqualified? and ?you
know what, he is unqualified ...? show two differ-
ent ways the words ?you?, and ?unqualified? could
appear in a sentence. In the first case the polarized
word unqualified refers to the word you. In the sec-
ond case, the two words are not related. The se-
quence of words connecting the two entities is a
very good predictor for whether they are related or
not. However, these paths are completely lexicalized
and consequently their performance will be limited
by data sparseness. To alleviate this problem, we
use higher levels of generalization to represent the
path connecting the two tokens. These representa-
tions are the part-of-speech tags, and the shortest
path in a dependency graph connecting the two to-
kens. We represent every sentence with several rep-
resentations at different levels of generalization. For
example, the sentence your ideas are very inspiring
will be represented using lexical, polarity, part-of-
9
speech, and dependency information as follows:
LEX: ?YOUR ideas are very POS?
POS: ?YOUR NNS VBP RB JJ POS?
DEP: ?YOUR poss nsubj POS?
3.2.1 A Text Classification Approach
In this method, we treat the problem as a topic
classification problem with two topics: having pos-
itive attitude and having negative attitude. As we
are only interested in attitude between participants
rather than sentiment in general, we restrict the text
we analyze to sentences that contain mentions of the
addressee (e.g. name or second person pronouns).
A similar approach for sentiment classification has
been presented in (Pang et al, ).
We represent text using the popular bag-of-words
approach. Every piece of text is represented using
a high dimensional feature space. Every word is
considered a feature. The tf-idf weighting schema
is used to calculate feature weights. tf, or term fre-
quency, is the number of time a term t occurred in
a document d. idf, or inverse document frequency,
is a measure of the general importance of the term.
It is obtained by dividing the total number of doc-
uments by the number of documents containing the
term. The logarithm of this value is often used in-
stead of the original value.
We used Support Vector Machines (SVMs) for
classification. SVM has been shown to be highly
effective for traditional text classification. We used
the SVM Light implementation with default param-
eters (Joachims, 1999). All stop words were re-
moved and all documents were length normalized
before training.
The set of features we use are the set of unigrams,
and bigrams representing the words, part-of-speech
tags, and dependency relations connecting the two
entities. For example the following features will be
set for the previous example:
YOUR ideas, YOUR NNS, YOUR poss,
poss nsubj, ...., etc.
We use Support Vector Machines (SVM) as a
learning system because it is good with handling
high dimensional feature spaces.
3.3 Extracting the Signed Network
In this subsection, we describe the procedure we
used to build the signed network given the compo-
nents we described in the previous subsections. This
procedure consists of two main steps. The first is
building the network without signs, and the second
is assigning signs to different edges.
To build the network, we parse our data to identify
different threads, posts and senders. Every sender is
represented with a node in the network. An edge
connects two nodes if there exists an interaction be-
tween the corresponding participants. We add a di-
rected edge A? B, if A replies to B?s posts at least
n times in m different threads. We set m, and n to
2 in most of our experiments. The interaction infor-
mation (i.e. who replies to whom) can be extracted
directly from the thread structure.
Once we build the network, we move to the more
challenging task in which we associate a sign with
every edge. We have shown in the previous section
how sentences with positive and negative attitude
can be extracted from text. Unfortunately the sign
of an interaction cannot be trivially inferred from the
polarity of sentences. For example, a single negative
sentence written by A and directed to B does not
mean that the interaction between A and B is neg-
ative. One way to solve this problem would be to
compare the number of negative sentences to posi-
tive sentences in all posts between A and B and clas-
sify the interaction according to the plurality value.
We will show later, in our experiment section, that
such a simplistic method does not perform well in
predicting the sign of an interaction.
As a result, we decided to pose the problem
as a classical supervised learning problem. We
came up with a set of features that we think are
good predictors of the interaction sign, and we
train a classifier using those features on a labeled
dataset. Our features include numbers and percent-
ages of positive/negative sentences per post, posts
per thread, and so on. A sentence is labeled as posi-
tive/negative if a relation has been detected in this
sentence between a second person pronoun and a
positive/negative expression. A post is considered
positive/negative based on the majority of relations
detected in it. We use two sets of features. The first
set is related to A only or B only. The second set

is related to the interactions between A and B. The
features are outlined in Table 1.
4 Data
Our data consists of a large amount of discussion
threads collected from online discussion forums. We
collected around 41, 000 threads and 1.2M posts
from the period between the end of 2008 and the end
of 2010. All threads were in English and had 5 posts
or more. They covered a wide range of topics in-
cluding: politics, religion, science, etc. The data was
tokenized, sentence-split, and part-of-speech tagged
with the OpenNLP toolkit. It was parsed with the
Stanford parser (Klein and Manning, 2003).
We randomly selected 5300 posts (having approx-
imately 1000 interactions), and asked human anno-
tators to label them. Our annotators were instructed
to read all the posts exchanged between two partic-
ipants and decide whether the interaction between
them is positive or negative. We used Amazon Me-
chanical Turk for annotations. Following previous
work (Callison-Burch, 2009; Akkaya et al, 2010),
we took several precautions to maintain data in-
tegrity. We restricted annotators to those based in
the US to maintain an acceptable level of English
fluency. We also restricted annotators to those who
have more than 95% approval rate for all previous
work. Moreover, we asked three different annota-
tors to label every interaction. The label was com-
puted by taking the majority vote among the three
annotators. We refer to this data as the Interactions
Dataset.
The kappa measure between the three groups of
annotations was 0.62. To better assess the quality
of the annotations, we asked a trained annotator to
label 10% of the data. We measured the agreement
between the expert annotator and the majority label
from the Mechanical Turk. The kappa measure was

We trained the classifier that detects sentences
with attitude (Section 3.1) on a set of 4000 manu-
ally annotated sentences. None of this data overlaps
with the dataset described earlier. A similar annota-
tion procedure was used to label this data. We refer
to this data as the Sentences Dataset.
5 Results and Discussion
We performed experiments on the data described
in the previous section. We trained and tested the
sentence with attitude detection classifiers described
in Section 3.1 using the Sentences Dataset. We
also trained and tested the interaction sign classi-
fier described in Section 3.3 using the Interactions
Dataset. We build one unsigned network from ev-
ery topic in the data set. This results in a signed
social network for every topic (e.g. politics, eco-
nomics,etc.). We decided to build a network for ev-
ery topic as opposed to one single network because
the relation between any two individuals may vary
across topics. In the rest of this section, we will de-
scribe the experiments we did to assess the perfor-
mance of the sentences with attitude detection and
interaction sign prediction steps.
In addition to classical evaluation, we evaluate our
results using the structural balance theory which has
been shown to hold both theoretically (Heider, 1946)
and empirically (Leskovec et al, 2010b). We val-
idate our results by showing that the automatically
extracted networks mostly agree with the theory.
5.1 Identifying Sentences with Attitude
We tested this component using the Sentences
Dataset described in Section 4. In a 10-fold cross
validation mode, the classifier achieves 80.3% accu-
racy, 81.0% precision, %79.4 recall, and 80.2% F1.

5.2 Interaction Sign Classifier
We used the relation detection classifier described in
Section 3.2 to find sentences with positive and neg-
ative attitude. The output of this classifier was used
to compute the the features described in Section 3.3,
which were used to train a classifier that predicts the
sign of an interaction between any two individuals.
We used Support Vector Machines (SVM) to train
the sign interaction classifier. We report several per-
formance metrics for them in Table 2. All results
were computed using 10 fold cross validation on the
labeled data. To better assess the performance of
the proposed classifier, we compare it to a baseline
that labels the relation as negative if the percentage
of negative sentences exceeds a particular threshold,
otherwise it is labeled as positive. The thresholds
was empirically evaluated using a separate develop-
ment set. The accuracy of this baseline is only 71%.
We evaluated the importance of the features listed
in Table 1 by measuring the chi-squared statistic for
every feature with respect to the class. We found
out that the features describing the interaction be-
tween the two participants are more informative than
the ones describing individuals characteristics. The
later features are still helpful though and they im-
prove the performance by a statistically significant
amount. We also noticed that all features based on
percentages are more informative than those based
on count. The most informative features are: per-
centage of negative posts per tread, percentage of
negative sentences per post, percentage of positive
posts per thread, number of negative posts, and dis-
cussion topic.
5.3 Structural Balance Theory
The structural balance theory is a psychological the-
ory that tries to explain the dynamics of signed so-
cial interactions. It has been shown to hold both the-
oretically (Heider, 1946) and empirically (Leskovec
et al, 2010b). In this section, we study the agree-
ment between the theory and the automatically ex-
tracted networks. The theory has its origins in the
work of Heider (1946). It was then formalized in a
graph theoretic form in (Cartwright and Harary, ).
The theory is based on the principles that ?the friend
of my friend is my friend?, ?the enemy of my friend
is my enemy?, ?the friend of my enemy is my en-
emy?, and variations on these.
There are several possible ways in which trian-
gles representing the relation of three people can be
signed. The structural balance theory states that tri-
angles that have an odd number of positive signs (+
+ + and + - -) are balanced, while triangles that have
an even number of positive signs (- - - and + + -) are
not.
Even though the structural balance theory posits
some triangles as unbalanced, that does not elimi-
nate the chance of their existence. Actually, for most
observed signed structures for social groups, exact
structural balance does not hold (Doreian and Mr-
var, 1996). Davis (1967) developed the theory fur-
ther into the weak structural balance theory. In this
theory, he extended the structural balance theory to
cases where there can be more than two such mu-
tually antagonistic subgroups. Hence, he suggested
that only triangles with exactly two positive edges
are implausible in real networks, and that all other
kinds of triangles should be permissible.
In this section, we connect our analysis to the
structural balance theory. We compare the predic-
tions of edge signs made by our system to the struc-
tural balance theory by counting the frequencies of
different types of triangles in the predicted network.
Showing that our automatically constructed network
agrees with the structural balance theory further val-
idates our results.
We compute the frequency of every type of trian-
gle for ten different topics. We compare these fre-
quencies to the frequencies of triangles in a set of
random networks. We shuffle signs for all edges on
every network keeping the fractions of positive and

negative edges constant.
We repeat shuffling for 1000 times. Every time,
we compute the frequencies of different types of tri-
angles. We find that the all-positive triangle (+++)
is overrepresented in the generated network com-
pared to chance across all topics. We also see that
the triangle with two positive edges (++?), and the
all-negative triangle (? ? ?) are underrepresented
compared to chance across all topics. The trian-
gle with a single positive edge is slightly overrep-
resented in most but not all of the topics compared
to chance. This shows that the predicted networks
mostly agree with the structural balance theory. In
general, the percentage of balanced triangles in the
predicted networks is higher than in the shuffled net-
works, and hence the balanced triangles are signif-
icantly overrepresented compared to chance. Fig-
ure 1 compares the percentage of balanced triangles
in the predicted networks and the shuffled networks.
This proves that our automatically constructed net-
work is similar to explicit signed networks in that
they both mostly agree with the balance theory.
6 Application: Dispute Level Prediction
There are many applications that could benefit from
the signed network representation of discussions
such as community finding, stance recognition, rec-
ommendation systems, and disputed topics identifi-
cation. In this section, we will describe one such
application.
Discussion forums usually respond quickly to
new topics and events. Some of those topics usu-
ally receive more attention and more dispute than
others. We can identify such topics and in general
measure the amount of dispute every topic receives
using the extracted signed network. We computed
the percentage of negative edges to all edges for ev-
ery topic. We believe that this would act as a mea-
sure for how disputed a particular topic is. We see,
from Figure 2, that ?environment?, ?science?, and
?technology? topics are among the least disputed
topics, whereas ?terrorism?, ?abortion? and ?eco-
nomics? are among the most disputed topics. These
findings are another way of validating our predic-
tions. They also suggest another application for this
work that focuses on measuring the amount of dis-
pute different topics receive. This can be done for
more specific topics, rather than high level topics as
shown here, to identify hot topics that receive a lot
of dispute.
7 Conclusions
In this paper, we have shown that natural language
processing techniques can be reliably used to extract
signed social networks from text correspondences.
We believe that this work brings us closer to un-
derstanding the relation between language use and
social interactions and opens the door to further re-
search efforts that go beyond standard social net-
work analysis by studying the interplay of positive
and negative connections. We rigorously evaluated
the proposed methods on labeled data and connected
our analysis to social psychology theories to show
that our predictions mostly agree with them. Finally,
we presented potential applications that benefit from
the automatically extracted signed network.
