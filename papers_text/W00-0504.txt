Abstract 
We describe a system which supports 
English text queries searching for 
Mandarin Chinese spoken documents. 
This is one of the first attempts to tightly 
couple speech recognition with machine 
translation technologies for cross-media 
and cross-language retrieval. The 
Mandarin Chinese news audio are indexed 
with word and subword units by speech 
recognition. Translation of these multi- 
scale units can effect cross-language 
information retrieval. The integrated 
technologies will be evaluated based on 
the performance of translingnal speech 
retrieval. 
1. Introduction 
Massive quantities of audio and multimedia 
programs are becoming available. For example, 
in mid-February 2000, www.real.com listed 
1432 radio stations, 381 Internet-only 
broadcasters, and 86 television stations with 
Internet-accessible content, with 529 
broadcasting in languages other than English. 
Monolingual speech retrieval is now practical, as 
evidenced by services such as SpeechBot 
(speechbot.research.compaq.com), and it is clear 
that there is a potential demand for translingual 
speech retrieval if effective techniques can be 
developed. The Mandarin-English Information 
(MEI) project represents one of the first efforts 
in that direction. 
MEI is one of the four projects elected for 
the Johns Hopkins University (JHU) Summer 
Workshop 2000.1 Our research focus is on the 
integration of speech recognition and embedded 
translation technologies in the context of 
translingual speech retrieval. Possible 
applications of this work include audio and 
video browsing, spoken document retrieval, 
automated routing of information, and 
automatically alerting the user when special 
events occur. 
At the time of this writing, most of the MEI 
team members have been identified. This paper 
provides an update beyond our first proposal 
\[Meng et al, 2000\]. We present some ongoing 
work of our current eam members, as well as 
our ideas on an evolving plan for the upcoming 
JHU Summer Workshop 2000. We believe the 
input from the research community will benefit 
us greatly in formulating ourfinal plan. 
2. Background 
2.1 Translingual Information Retrieval 
The earliest work on large-vocabulary cross- 
language information retrieval from free-text 
(i,e., without manual topic indexing) was 
reported in 1990 \[Landauer and Littman, 1990\], 
and the topic has received increasing attention 
over the last five years \[Oard and Diekema, 
1998\]. Work on large-vocabulary retrieval from 
recorded speech is more recent, with some initial 
work reported in 1995 using subword indexing 
\[Wechsler and Schauble, 1995\], followed by the 
first TREC 2 Spoken Document Retrieval (SDR) 
I http://www.clsp,jhu.edu/ws2000/ 
2 Text REtrieval Conference, http://trec.nist.gov 
23 
evaluation \[Garofolo et al, 2000\]. The Topic 
Detection and Tracking (TDT) evaluations, 
which started in 1998, fall within our definition 
of speech retrieval for this purpose, differing 
from other evaluations principally in the nature 
of the criteria that human assessors use when 
assessing the relevance of a news stow to an 
information eed. In TDT, stories are assessed 
for relevance to an event, while in TREC stories 
are assessed for relevance to an explicitly stated 
information eed that is often subject- rather 
than event-oriented. 
The TDT-33 evaluation marked the first 
case of translingual speech retrieval - the task of 
finding information in a collection of recorded 
speech based on evidence of the information 
need that might be expressed (at least partially) 
in a different language. Translingual speech 
retrieval thus merges two lines of research that 
have developed separately until now. In the 
TDT-3 topic tracking evaluation, recognizer 
transcripts which have recognition errors were 
available, and it appears that every team made 
use of them. This provides a valuable point of 
reference for investigation of techniques that 
more tightly couple speech recognition with 
translingual retrieval. We plan to explore one 
way of doing this in the Mandarin-English 
Information (MEI) project. 
2.2 The Chinese Language 
In order to retrieve Mandarin audio documents, 
we should consider a number of linguistic 
characteristics of the Chinese language: 
The Chinese language has many dialects. 
Different dialects are characterized by their 
differences in the phonetics, vocabularies and 
syntax. Mandarin, also known as Putonglma 
("the common language"), is the most widely 
used dialect. Another major dialect is Cantonese, 
predominant in Hong Kong, Macau, South 
China and many overseas Chinese communities. 
Chinese is a syllable-based language, 
where each syllable carries a lexical tone. 
Mandarin has about 400 base syllables and four 
lexical tones, plus a "light" tone for reduced 
syllables. There are about 1,200 distinct, tonal 
syllables for Mandarin. Certain syllable-tone 
3 http://morph.ldc.upenn.edu/Projects/TDT3/ 
combinations are non-existent in the language. 
The acoustic correlates of the lexical tone 
include the syllable's fundamental frequency 
(pitch contour) and duration. However, these 
acoustic features are also highly dependent on 
prosodic variations of spoken utterances. 
The structure of Mandarin (base) syllables 
is (CG)V(X), where (CG) the syllable onset - C 
the initial consonant, G is the optional medial 
glide, V is the nuclear vowel, and X is the coda 
(which may be a glide, alveolar nasal or velar 
nasal). Syllable onsets and codas are optional. 
Generally C is known as the syllable initial, and 
the rest (GVX) syllable final. 4 Mandarin has 
approximately 21 initials and 39 finals. 5 
In its written form, Chinese is a sequence 
of characters. A word may contain one or more 
characters. Each character is pronounced as a 
tonal syllable. The character-syllable mapping is 
degenerate. On one hand, a given character may 
have multiple syllable pronunciations - for 
example, the character/d" may be pronounced as 
/hang2/, 6/hang4/, or/xing2/. On the other hand, 
a given tonal syllable may correspond to 
multiple characters. Consider the two-syllable 
pronunciation/fu4 shu4/, which corresponds toa 
two-character word. Possible homophones 
include ~, ,  (meaning "rich"), ~ ~tR, ("negative 
number"), ~1~1~, ("complex number" or 
"plural"), ~1~ ("repeat"). 7 
Aside from homographs and homophones, 
another source of ambiguity in the Chinese 
language is the definition of a Chinese word. 
The word has no delimiters, and the distinction 
between a word and a phrase is often vague. The 
lexical structure of the Chinese word is very 
different compared to English. Inflectional 
forms are minimal, while morphology and word 
derivations abide by a different set of rules. A 
word may inherit the syntax and semantics of 
(some of) its compositional characters, for 
4 http://m?rph'ldc'upenn'edu/Pr?jects/Chinese/intr?'html 
5 The corresponding linguistic haracteristics of Cantonese 
are very similar. 
6 These are Mandarin pinyin, the number encodes the tone 
of the syllable. 
7 Example drawn from \[Leung, 1999\]. 
24 
example, 8 ~ means red (a noun or an 
adjective), ~., means color (a noun), and ~. ,  
together means "the color red"(a noun) or 
simply "red" (an adjective). Alternatively, a 
word may take on totally different 
characteristics of its own, e.g. ~. means east (a 
noun or an adjective), ~ means west (a noun or 
an adjective), and .~.~ together means thing (a 
noun). Yet another case is where the 
compositional characters of a word do not form 
independent lexical entries in isolation, e.g. D~ 
means fancy (a verb), but its characters do not 
occur individually. Possible ways of deriving 
new words from characters are legion. The 
problem of identifying the words string in a 
character sequence is known as the segmentation 
/ tokenization problem. Consider the syllable 
string: 
/zhe4 yil wan3 hui4 ru2 chang2 ju3 xing2/ 
The corresponding character string has three 
possible segmentations - all are correct, but each 
involves a distinct set of words: 
(Meaning: It will be take place tonight as usual.) 
(Meaning: The evening banquet will take place 
as usual.) 
(Meaning: If this evening banquet akes place 
frequently...) 
The above considerations lead to a number 
of techniques we plan to use for our task. We 
concentrate on three equally critical problems 
related to our theme of translingual speech 
retrieval: (i) indexing Mandarin Chinese audio 
with word and subword units, (ii) translating 
variable-size units for cross-language 
information retrieval, and (iii) devising effective 
retrieval strategies for English text queries and 
Mandarin Chinese news audio. 
3. Multiscale Audio Indexing 
A popular approach to spoken document 
retrieval is to apply Large-Vocabulary 
s Examples drawn from \[Meng and Ip, 1999\]. 
Continuous Speech Recognition (LVCSR) 9 for 
audio indexing, followed by text retrieval 
techniques. Mandarin Chinese presents a 
challenge for word-level indexing by LVCSR, 
because of the ambiguity in tokenizing a 
sentence into words (as mentioned earlier). 
Furthermore, LVCSR with a static vocabulary is
hampered by the out-of-vocabulary (OOV) 
problem, especially when searching sources with 
topical coverage as diverse as that found in 
broadcast news. 
By virtue of the monosyllabic nature of the 
Chinese language and its dialects, the syllable 
inventory can provide a complete phonological 
coverage for spoken documents, and circumvent 
the OOV problem in news audio indexing, 
offering the potential for greater recall in 
subsequent retrieval. The approach thus supports 
searches for previously unknown query terms in 
the indexed audio. 
The pros and cons of subword indexing for 
an English spoken document retrieval task was 
studied in \[Ng, 2000\]. Ng pointed out that the  
exclusion of lexical knowledge when subword 
indexing is performed in isolation may adversely 
impact discrimination power for retrieval, but 
that some of that impact can be mitigated by 
modeling sequential constraints among subword 
units. We plan to investigate the efficacy of 
using both word and subword units for 
Mandarin audio indexing \[Meng et al, 2000\]. 
Although Ng found that such an approach 
produced little gain over words alone for 
English, the structure of Mandarin Chinese may 
produce more useful subword features. 
3.1 Modeling Syllable Sequence Constraints 
We have thus far used overlapping syllable N- 
grams for spoken document retrieval for two 
Chinese dialects - Mandarin and Cantonese. 
Results on a known-item retrieval task with over 
1,800 error-free news transcripts \[Meng et al, 
1999\] indicate that constraints from overlapping 
bigrams can yield significant improvements in 
retrieval performance over syllable unigrams, 
producing retrieval performance competitive 
9 The lexicon size of a typical large-vocabulary 
continuous speech recognizer can range from 10,000 
to 100,000 word forms. 
25 
with that obtained using automatically tokenized 
Chinese words. 
The study in \[Chen, Wang and Lee, 2000\] 
also used syllable pairs with skipped syllables in 
between. This is because many Chinese 
abbreviations are derived from skipping 
characters, e.g. J .~:~.~t:~  ~ National 
Science Council" can be abbreviated as l~r~ 
(including only the first, third and the last 
characters). Moreover, synonyms often differ by 
one or two characters, e.g. both ~ ' /~4~ and 
~.~,,Ag mean "Chinese culture". Inclusion o f  
these "skipped syllable pairs" also contributed to
retrieval performance. 
When modeling sequential syllable 
constraints, lexical constraints on recognized 
words may be helpful. We thus plan to exp\]Iore 
the potential for integrated sequential model\]ling 
of both words and syllables \[Meng et al, 20013\]. 
4. Multiseale Embedded Translation 
Figures 1 and 2 illustrate two translingual 
retrieval strategies. In query translation, English 
text queries are transformed into Mandarin and 
then used to retrieve Mandarin documents. For 
document translation, Mandarin documents are 
translated into English before they are indexed 
and then matched with English queries. 
McCarley has reported improved effectiveness 
from techniques that couple the two techniques 
\[McCarley, 1999\], but time constraints may 
limit us to explonng only the query translation 
strategy dunng the six-week Workshop. 
4,1 Word  Translat ion 
While we make use of sub-word 
transcription tosmooth out-of-vocabulary(OOV) 
problems in speech recognition as described 
above, and to alleviate the OOV problem :for 
translation as we discuss in the next section, 
accurate translation generally relies on the 
additional information available at the word and 
phrase levels. Since the "bag of words" 
information retrieval techniques do not 
incorporate any meaningful degree of language 
understanding to assess similarity between 
queries and documents, a word-for-word (or, 
more generally, term-for-term) embedded 
translation approach can achieve a useful level 
of effectiveness for many translingual retrieval 
applications \[Oard and Diekema, 1998\]. 
We have developed such a technique for the 
TDT-3 topic tracking evaluation \[Levow and 
Oard, 2000\]. For that work we extracted an 
enriched bilingual Mandarin-English term list by 
combining two term lists: (i) A list assembled 
by the Linguistic Data Consortium from freely 
available on-line resources; and (ii) entries from 
the CETA file (sometimes referred to as 
"Optilex"). This is a Chinese to English 
translation resource that was manually compiled 
by a team of linguists from more than 250 text 
sources, including special and general-purpose 
print dictionaries, and other text sources uch as 
newspapers. The CETA file contains over 
250,000 entries, but for our lexical work we 
extracted a subset of those entries drawn from 
contemporary general-purpose sources. We also 
excluded efinitions uch as "particle indicating 
a yes/no question." Our resulting Chinese to 
English merged bilingual term list contains 
translations for almost 200,000 Chinese terms, 
with average of almost two translation 
alternatives per term. We have also used the 
same resources to construct an initial English to 
Chinese bilingual term list that we plan to refine 
before the Workshop. 
Three significant challenges faced by term- 
to-term translation systems are term selection in 
the source language, the source language 
coverage of the bilingual term list, and 
translation selection in the target language when 
more than one alternative translation is known. 
Word segmentation is a natural by-product of 
large vocabulary Mandarin speech recognition, 
and white space provides word boundaries for 
the English queries. We thus plan to choose 
words as our basic term set, perhaps augmenting 
this with the multiword expressions found in the 
bilingual term list. 
Achieving adequate source language 
coverage is challenging in news retrieval 
applications of the type modelled by TDT, 
because proper names and technical terms that 
may not be present in general-purpose lexical 
resources often provide important retrieval cues. 
Parallel (translation equivalent) corpora have 
proven to be a useful source of translation 
26 
equivalent terms, but obtaining appropriate 
domain-specific parallel corpora in electronic 
form may not be practical in some applications. 
We therefore plan to investigate the use of 
comparable corpora to learn translation 
equivalents, based on techniques in \[Fung, 
1998\]. Subword translation, described below, 
provides a complementary way of handling 
terms for which translation equivalents cannot 
be reliably extracted from the available 
comparable corpora. 
One way of dealing with multiple 
translations is to weight the alternative 
translations using either a statistical translation 
model trained on parallel or comparable corpora 
to estimate translation probability conditioned 
on the source language term. When such 
resources are not sufficiently informative, it is 
generally possible to back off to an 
unconditioned preference statistic based on 
usage frequency of each possible translation i  a 
representative monolingual corpus in the target 
language. In retrospective r trieval applications 
the collection being searched can be used for 
this purpose. We have applied simple versions 
of this approach with good results \[Levow and 
Oard, 2000\]. 
We have recently observed that a simpler 
technique introduced by \[Pirkola, 1998\] can 
produce xcellent results. The key idea is to use 
the structure of the lexicon, in which several 
target language terms can represent a single 
source language term, to induce structure in the 
translated query that the retrieval system can 
automatically exploit. In essence, the translated 
query becomes a bag of bags of terms, where 
each smaller bag corresponds to the set of 
possible translations for one source-language 
term. We plan to implement his structured 
query translation approach using the Inquery 
\[Callan, 1992\] "synonym" operator in the same 
manner as \[Pirkola, 1998\], and to the potential to 
extend the technique to accommodate alternative 
recognition hypothesis and subword units as 
well: 
4.2 Subword  Translat ion 
Since Mandarin spoken documents can be 
indexed with both words and subwords, the 
translation (or "phonetic transliteration") of 
subword units is of particular interest. We plan 
to make use of cross-language phonetic 
mappings derived from English and Mandarin 
pronunciation rules for this purpose. This should 
be especially useful for handling named entities 
in the queries, e.g. names of people, places and 
organizations, etc. which are generally important 
for retrieval, but may not be easily translated. 
Chinese translations of English proper nouns 
may involve semantic as well as phonetic 
mappings. For example, "Northern Ireland" is 
translated as :~b~ttlM - -  where the first 
character ~ means 'north', and the remaining 
characters ~tllllll are pronounced as /ai4-er3- 
lan2L Hence the translation is both semantic 
and phonetic. When Chinese translations strive 
to attain phonetic similarity, the mapping may 
be inconsistent. For example, consider the 
translation of "Kosovo" - sampling Chinese 
newspapers in China, Taiwan and Hong Kong 
produces the following translations: 
~-~r~ /kel-suo3-wo4?, ~-~ /kel-suo3-fo2/, 
~'~&/kel-suo3-ful/f l4"~dt/kel-suo3-fu2/, or 
~/ke  1-suo3-fo2/. 
As can be seen, there is no systematic 
mapping to the Chinese character sequences, but 
the translated Chinese pronunciations bear some 
resemblance to the English pronunciation (/k ow 
s ax vow/). In order to support retrieval under 
these circumstances, the approach should 
involve approximate matches between the 
English pronunciation and the Chinese 
pronunciation. The matching algorithm should 
also accommodate phonological variations. 
Pronunciation dictionaries, or pronunciation 
generation tools for both English words and 
Chinese words / characters will be useful for the 
matching algorithm. We can probably leverage 
off of ideas in the development of universal 
speech recognizers \[Cohen et al, 1997\]. 
5. Mulfiscale Retrieval 
5.1 Coupling Words and Subwords 
We intend to use both words and subwords for 
retrieval. Loose coupling would involve separate 
retrieval runs using words and subwords, 
producing two ranked lists, followed by list 
merging using techniques such as those explored 
by \[Voorhees, 1995\]. Tight coupling, by 
27 
contrast, would require creation of a unified 
index containing both word and subword units, 
resulting in a single ranked list. We hope to 
explore both techniques during the Workshop. 
5.2 Imperfect Indexing and Translat ion 
It should be noted that speech recognition 
exacerbates uncertainty when indexing audio, 
and that translation or transliteration exacerbates 
uncertainty when translating queries and/or 
documents. To achieve robustness for retrieval, 
we have tried three techniques that we have 
found useful: (i) Syllable lattices were used in 
\[Wang, 1999\] and \[Chien et al, 2000\] for 
monolingual Chinese retrieval experiments. The 
lattices were pruned to constrain the search 
space, but were able to achieve robust retrieval 
based on imperfect recognized transcripts. (ii) 
Query expansion, in which syllable transcription 
were expanded to include possibly confusable 
syllable sequences based on a syllable confusion 
matrix derived from recognition errors, was used 
in \[Meng et al, 1999\]. (iii) We have expanded 
the document representation using terms 
extracted from similar documents in a 
comparable collection \[Levow and Oard, 2000\], 
and similar techniques are known to work well 
in the case of query translation (Ballesteros and 
Croft, 1997). We hope to add to this set: of 
techniques by exploring the potential for query 
expansion based on cross-language phonetic 
mapping. 
6. Using the TDT-3 Collection 
We plan to use the TDT-2 collection for 
development testing and the TDT-3 collection 
for evaluation. Both collections provide 
documents from two English newswire sources, 
six English broadcast news audio sources, two 
Mandarin Chinese newswire sources, and one 
Mandarin broadcast news source (Voice of 
America). Manually established story 
boundaries are available for all audio 
collections, and we plan to exploit that 
information to simplify our experiment design. 
The TDT-2 collection includes complete 
relevance assessments for 20 topics, and the 
TDT-3 collection provides the same for 60 
additional topics, 56 of which have at least one 
relevant audio story. For each topic, at least four 
English stories and four Chinese stories are 
known. 
We plan to automatically derive text queries 
based on one or more English stories that are 
presented as exemplars, and to use those queries 
to search the Mandarin audio collection. 
Manually constructed queries will provide a 
contrastive condition. Unlike the TDT "topic 
tracking" task in which stories must be declared 
relevant or not relevant in the order of their 
arrival, we plan to perform retrospective 
retrieval experiments in which all documents are 
known when the query is issued. By relaxing 
the temporal ordering of the TDT topic tracking 
task, we can meaningfully search for Mandarin 
Chinese stories that may have arrived before the 
exemplar story or stories. We thus plan to report 
ranked retrieval measures of effectiveness uch 
as average precision in addition to the detection 
statistics (miss and false alarm) typically 
reported in TDT. 
7.  Summary 
This paper presents our current ideas and 
evolving plan for the MEI project, to take place 
at the Johns Hopkins University Summer 
Workshop 2000. Translingual speech retrieval is 
a long-term research direction, and our team 
looks forward to jointly taking an initial step to 
tackle the problem. The authors welcome all 
comments and suggestions, aswe strive to better 
define the problem in preparation for the six- 
week Workshop.
