Abst rac t  
Chinese sentences are written with no special delimiters 
such as space to indicate word boundaries. Existing Chi- 
nese NLP systems therefore mploy preprocessors to seg- 
ment sentences into words. Contrary to the conventional 
wisdom of separating this issue from the task of sentence 
understanding, we propose an integrated model that per- 
forms word boundary identification in lockstep with sen- 
tence understanding. In this approach, there is no distinc- 
tion between rules for word boundary identification and 
rules for sentence understanding. These two functions are 
combined. Word boundary ambiguities are detected, es- 
pecially the fallacious ones, when they block the primary 
task of discovering the inter-relationships among the var- 
ious constituents of a sentence, which essentially is the 
essence of the understanding process. In this approach, 
statistical information is also incorporated, providing the 
system a quick and fairly reliable starting ground to carry 
out the primary task of relationship- building. 
1 THE PROBLEM 
Chinese sentences are written with no special delimiters 
such as space to indicate word boundaries. Existing Chi- 
nese NLP systems therefore mploy preprocessors to seg- 
ment sentences into words. Many techniques have been de- 
veloped for this task, from simple pattern matching meth- 
ods (e.g., maximum matching, reverse maximum match- 
ing) (Wang, et al, 1990; Kang & Zheng, 1991), to statis- 
tical methods (e.g., word association, relaxation) (Sproat 
& Shih, 1990; Fan & Tsai, 1988), to rule-based approaches 
(Huang, 1989 ; Yeh & Lee, 1991; He, et al, 1991). 
However, it is observed that simple pattern matching 
methods and stochastic methods perform poorly in sen- 
tences uch as (1), (2), and (3), where word boundary am- 
biguities exist. 1

approaches.

This problem can be dealt with in a more systematic and 
effective way if syntactic and semantic analyses are also in- 
corporated. The frequency in which this problem occurs 
justifies the additional effort needed. However, contempo- 
rary approaches of constructing a standalone, rule-based 
word segmentor do not offer the solution, as this would 
mean duplicating the effort of syntactic and semantic anal- 
yses twice: first in the preprocessing phase, and later in 
the understanding phase. Moreover, separating the issue 
of word boundary identification from sentence understand- 
ing often leads to devising word segmentation rules which 
are arbitrary and word specific, 2 and hence not useful at 
all for sentence understanding. Most importantly, the rules 
devised always face the problem of over-generalization. 
Contrary to conventional wisdom, we do not view the 
task of word boundary identification as separated from the 
task of sentence understanding. Rather, the former is re- 
garded as one of the tasks an NLP system must handle 
within the understanding phase. This perspective allows 
us to devise a more systematic and natural solution to the 
problem, at the same time avoiding the duplication of mor- 
phological, syntactic, and semantic analyses in two sepa- 
rate stages: the preprocessing stage and the understanding 
stage. 
The basic principle underlying this approach is: ev- 
ery constituent in a sentence must be meaningfully re- 
lated (syntactically and/or semantically) to some other 
constituent. Understanding a sentence is simply a pro- 
cess to discover this network of relations. A violation of 
this principle signifies the presence of abnormal groupings 
(fallacious word boundaries), which must be removed, a 
For example, the fallacious grouping rensheng 'life', if it 
exists in (1), can be detected by observing a violation of 
the syntactic relation between this group and le, which is 
2 For example, a heuristic rule to resolve the ambiguous frag- 
ment shi fen in (2): adverb shifen 'very' cannot occur at the 
end of a sentence. This rule rules out the grouping shifen to 
appear in sentence (2). 
3This principle, in its present form, is too tight for handling 
metonymic usage of language, as well as ill-formed sentences. 
We will leave this for future work. 
an aspect marker that cannot be a nominal modifier. In 
(2), selectional restrictions on the RANGE of the verb kao, 
which must either be pedagogical (e.g., kao shuzue 'test 
Mathematics'), resultative (e.g., kao shibai le 'test fail AS- 
PECT') ,  or time (e.g., kao le yi ge zingqi 'test ASPECT 
one week'), rules out the grouping shifen 'very', which is 
a degree marker. 4 Sentence (3) also requires thematic 
role interpretation to resolve the ambiguous fragment. Se- 
lectional restrictions on the PATIENT of the verb kaifa 
'develop', which must be either a concrete material (e.g., 
kaifa meikuang 'develop coal mine') or a location (e.g., 
kaifa sanqu 'develop rural area'), rules out interpreting the 
ambiguous fragment he shang as heshang 'monk'. 5 
This approach, however, does not totally discard the 
use of statistical information. On the contrary, we use 
statistical information s to give our system a quick and 
fairly reliable initial guess of the likely word boundaries 
in a sentence. Based on these suggested word boundaries, 
the system proceeds to the primary task of determining 
the syntactic and semantic relations that may exist in the 
sentence (i.e., the understanding process). Any violation 
encountered in this process signals the presence of abnor- 
mal groupings, which must be removed. 
Our approach will not lead to an exceedingly complex 
system, mainly because we have made use of statistical 
information to provide us the initial guide. It does not 
generate all possible word boundary combinations in order 
to select the best one. Rather, alternative paths are ex- 
plored only when the current one leads to some violation. 
This feature makes its complexity not more than that of a 
two-stage system where syntax and semantics at the later 
stage of processing signal to the preprocessor that certain 
lexemes have been wrongly identified. 
2 THE PROPOSED MODEL 
The approach we proposed takes in as input a stream of 
characters of a sentence rather than a collection of cor- 
rectly pre-segmented words. It performs word boundary 
disambiguation concurrently with sentence understanding. 
In our investigation, we focus on sentences with clearly 
ambiguous word boundaries as they constitute an appro- 
priate testbed for us to investigate the deeply interwoven 
relationships between these two tasks. 
Since we are proposing an integrated approach to word 
boundary identification and sentence understanding, con- 
ventional sequential-based architectures are not appropri- 
ate. A suitable computational model should have at least 
4Notice the difference between this knowledge and the one 
mentioned in footnote 2. Both are used to disambiguate he 
fragment shi .fen. The former is more ad hoc while ours comes 
in naturally as part and parcel of thematic role interpretation. 
awe would like to stress that rules in this approach are not 
distinguished into two separate classes, one for resolving word 
boundary ambiguities and the other for sentence understand- 
ing. Ours combine these two functions together, performing 
word boundary identification alongside with sentence under- 
standing. We will give a detailed escription on the effective- 
ness of the various kinds of information after we have completed 
our implementation. 
6See Section 3 for an example. 
the following features: (i) linguistic information such as 
morphology, syntax, and semantics hould be available si- 
multaneously so that it can be drawn upon whenever nec- 
essary; (ii) the architecture should allow competing inter- 
pretations to coexist and give each one a chance to develop; 
(iii) partial solutions should be flexible enough that they 
can be easily modified and regrouped; (iv) the architec- 
ture can support localized inferencing which will eventually 
evolve into a global, coherent interpretation of a sentence. 
We are using the Copycat model (Hofstadter, 1984; 
Mitchell, 1990), which has been developed and tested in 
the domain of analogy-making. There are four compo- 
pents in this architecture: the conceptual network (en- 
codes linguistic concepts), the workspace (the working 
area), the coderack (a pool of codelets waiting to run), 
and the temperature (controls the rate of understanding). 
Our model will differ from NLP systems with a similar 
approach (Goldman, 1990; Hirst, 1988; Small, 1980) pri- 
marily through the incorporation of statistical methods, 
and the nondeterministic control mechanism used. 7 For 
a detailed discussion, see (Gan, et al, 1992). In essence, 
this model simulates the understanding process as a crys- 
tallization process, in which high-level linguistic structures 
(e.g., words; analogous to crystals) are formed and hooked 
up in a proper way as characters (ions) of a sentence are 
gradually cooled down. 
3 AN EXAMPLE 
We will use sentence (1) to briefly outline how the model 
works, s

. bottom-up structure building 
The system starts with bottom-up, character-based 
codelets in the coderack whose task is to evaluate the as- 
sociative strength between two neighboring characters. 
10 One of the codelets will be chosen probabilistieally to 
run. 11 The executing codelet selects an object from the 
workspace and tries to build some structures on it. For 
7See also footnote 11. 
SOur description here is oversimplified. Many important 
issues, such as the representation f linguistic knowledge, the 
treatment of ambiguous fragments that have multiple equally 
plausible word boundaries, are omitted. The example discussed 
in this section is a hand-worked test case which is currently 
being implemented. 
9The English glosses and translation are omitted here, as 
they have been shown in Section 1. 
1?The association between two characters i measured based 
on mutual information (Fano, 1961). It is derived from the 
frequency that the two characters occur together versus the 
frequency that they are independent. Here, we find that statis- 
tical techniques can be nicely incorporated into the model We 
will derive this information from a corpus of 46,520 words of to- 
tal usage frequency of 13019,814 given to us by Liang Nanyuan 
of the Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics. 
11This is another way statistics is used. The selection of 
which codelet o run, and the selection of which object to work 
on are decided probabilistically depending on the system tem- 
perature. This is the nondeterministic control mechanism en- 
tioned in Section 2. 
302 
example, it may select the last two characters hai and zi 
in (1) and evaluate their associative strength as equal to 
13.34. This association is so strong that another codelet 
will be called upon to group these two characters into a 
word-structure, which forms the word haizi 'children'. 
* top-down influences 
The formation of the word-structure haizi activates the 
WORD 12 node in the network of linguistic concepts. 
This network is a dynamic controller to ensure that 
bottom-up rocesses do not proceed independently of 
the system's understanding of the global situation. The 
activation of the WORD node in turn causes the posting 
of top-down codelets couting for other would-be word- 
structures. Thus, single-character words such as ta 'she', 
le (aspect marker), san 'three', and ge (a classifier) may 
be discovered. 
? radical restructuring 
The characters ren and sheng will be grouped as a word 
rensheng 'life' by bottom-up, character-based codelets, 
as the associative strength between them is strong 
(3.75). This is incorrect in (1). It will be detected when 
an ASPECT-relation builder, spawned after identifying 
le as an aspect marker, tries to construct a syntactic 
relation between the word-structure rensheng 'life' and 
the word-structure l  (ASPECT). Since this relation can 
only be established with a verb, a violation occurs, which 
causes the temperature to be set to its maximal value. 
The problematic structure rensheng will be dissolved, 
and the system proceeds in its search for an alternative, 
recording down in its memory that this structure ren- 
sheng should not be tried again in future, x3 
4 SUMMARY 
In this model, there is an implicit order in which codelets 
are executed. At the initial stage, the system is more con- 
cerned with identifying words. After some word-structures 
have been built, other types of codelets begin to decipher 
the syntactic and semantic relations between these struc- 
tures. From then on, the word identification and higher- 
level analyses proceed hand-in-hand. In short, the main 
ideas in our model are: (i) a parallel architecture in which 
hierarchical, inguistic structures are built up in a piece- 
meal fashion by competing and cooperating chains of sim- 
ple, independently acting codelets; (ii) a notion of fluid re- 
conformability of structures built up by the system; (iii) a 
parallel terraced scan (Hofstadter, 1984) of possible courses 
of action; (iv) a temperature variable that dynamically ad- 
justs the amount of randomness in response to how happy 
the system is with its currently built structures.
