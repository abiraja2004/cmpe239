1. ABSTRACT 
SRI has ported its DECIPHER TM speech recognition system from 
DARPA's ATIS domain to DARPA's CSR domain (read and spon- 
taneous Wall Street Journal speech). This paper describes what 
needed to be done to port DECIPHER TM, and reports experiments 
performed with the CSR task. 
The system was evaluated on the speaker-independent (SI) portion 
of DARPA's February 1992 "Dry-Run" WSJ0 test and achieved 
17.1% word error without verbalized punctuation (NVP) and 
16.6% error with verbalized punctuation (VP). In addition, we 
increased the amount of training data and reduced the VP error 
rate to 12.9%. This SI error rate (with a larger amount of training 
data) equalled the best 600-training-sentence speaker-dependent 
error rate reported for the February CSR evaluation. Finally, the 
system was evaluated on the VP data using microphones unknown 
to the system instead of the training-set's Sennheiser microphone 
and the error ate only inere~ased to 26.0%. 
ways; it includes speaker-dependent vs. speaker indepen- 
dent sections and sentences where the users were asked to 
verbalize the punctuation (VP) vs. those where they were 
asked not to verbalize the punctuation (NVP). There are 
also a small number of recordings of spontaneous speech 
that can be used in development and evaluation. 
The corpus and associated evelopment and evaluation 
materials were designed so that speech recognition systems 
may be evaluated in an open-vocabulary mode (none of the 
words used in evaluation are known in advance by the 
speech recognition system) or in a closed vocabulary mode 
(all the words in the test sets are given in advance). There 
are suggested 5,000-word and 20,000-word open- and 
closed-vocabulary language models that may be used for 
development and evaluation. This paper discusses a pre- 
liminary evaluation of SRI's DECIPHER TM system using 
read speech from the 5000-word closed-vocabulary tasks 
with verbalized and nonverbalized punctuation. 
2. DECIPHER TM 
The SRI has developed the DECIPHERm system, an 
HMM-based speaker-independent, continuous-speech rec- 
ognition system. Several of DECIPHERr~'s attributes are 
discussed in the references (Butzberger et al, \[1\]; Murveit 
et al, \[2\]). Until recently, DECIPHERm's application has 
been limited to DARPA's resource management task (Pal- 
let, \[3\]; Price et al, \[4\]), DARPA's ATIS task (Price, \[5\]), 
the Texas Instruments continuous-digit recognition task 
(Leonard, \[6\]), and other small vocabulary recognition 
tasks. This paper describes the application of DECIPHERrU 
to the task of recognizing words from a large-vocabulary 
corpus composed of primarily read-speech. 
3. THE CSR TASK 
Doddington \[7\] gives a detailed description of DARPA's 
CSR task and corpus. Briefly, the CSR corpus* is composed 
of recordings of speakers reading passages from the Wall 
Street Journal newspaper. The corpus is divided in many 
4. PORTING DECIPHER TM 
TO THE CSR TASK 
Several types of data are needed to port DECIPHER~ to a 
new domain: 
? A target vocabulary list 
? A target language model 
? Task-specific training data (optional) 
? Pronunciations for all the words in the target vocab- 
ulary (mandatory) and for all the words in the train- 
ing data (optional) 
? A backend which converts recognition output o 
actions in the domain (not applicable to the CSR 
task). 
*The current CSR corpus, designated WSJ0 is a pilot 
for a large corpus to be collected in the future.

4.1. CSR Vocabulary Lists and Language 
Models 
Doug Paul at Lincoln Laboratories provided us with base- 
line vocabularies and language models for use in the Febru- 
ary 1992 CSR evaluation. This included vocabularies for 
the closed vocabulary 5,000 and 20,000-word tasks as well 
as backed-off bigram language models for these tasks. 
Since we used backed-off bigrarns for our ATIS system, it
was straightforward touse the Lincoln language models as 
part of the DECIPHERa~-CSR system. 
4.2. CSR Pronunciations 
SRI maintains alist of words and pronunciations that have 
associated probabilities automatically estimated (Cohen et 
al., \[8\]). However, a significant number of words in the 
speaker-independent CSR training, development, and 
(closed vocabulary) test data were outside this list. Because 
of the tight schedule for the CSR evaluation, SRI looked to 
Dragon Systems which generously provided SRI and other 
DARPA contractors with limited use of a pronunciation 
table for all the words in the CSR task. SRI combined its 
intemal lexicon with portions of the Dragon pronunciation 
list to generate a pronunciation table for the DECIPHERa~- 
CSR system. 
4.3. CSR Training Data 
The National Institute of Standards and Technology pro- 
vided to SRI several CDROMS containing training, devel- 
opment, and evaluation data for the February 1992 DARPA 
CSR evaluation. The data were recorded at SRI, MIT, and 
TI. The baseline training conditions for the speaker-inde- 
pendent CSR task include 7240 sentences from 84 speak- 
ers, 3,586 sentences from 42 men and 3,654 sentences from 
42 women. 
5.2. Results for a Simplified System 
Our strategy was to implement a system as quickly as possi- 
ble. Thus we initially implemented a system using four vec- 
tor-quantized speech features with no cross-word acoustic 
modeling. Performance ofthe system on our development 
set is described in the tables below.

5. PRELIMINARY CSR PERFORMANCE 
5.1. Development Data 
We have partitioned the speaker-independent CSRdevelop- 
ment data into four portions for the purpose of this study. 
Each set contains 100 sentences. The respective sets are 
male and female speakers using verbalized and nonverbal- 
ized punctuation. There are 6 male speakers and 4 female 
speakers in the SI WSJ0 development data. 
The next section shows word recognition performance on 
this development set using 5,000-word, closed-vocabulary 
language models with verbalized and nonverbalized bigram 
grammars. The perplexity of the verbalized punctuation 
sentences inthe development set is 90. 
The female speakers are those above the bold line in Table 
1. Recognition speed on a Sun Sparcstation-2 was approxi- 
mately 40 times slower than real time (over 4 minutes/sen- 
tence) using a beam search and no fast match (our standard 
smaller-vocabulary algorithm), although it was dominated 
by paging time. 
A brief analysis of Speaker 422 shows that he speaks much 
faster than the other speakers which may contribute to the 
high error rate for his speech. 
5.3. Full DECIPHER~-CSR Performance 
We then tested a larger DECIPHER~ system on our VP 
development set. That is, the previous ystem was extended 
to model some cross-word acoustics, increased from four to 
411 
six spectral  features (second der ivat ives of  cepstra and 
energy were added) and a t ied-mixture h idden Marker  
model (HMM) replaced the vector-quantized HMM above. 
This resulted in a modest improvement asshown in the

6. DRY-RUN EVALUATION 
Subsequent tothe system development, above, we evalu- 
ated the "full recognizer' system on the February 1991 Dry- 
Run evaluation materials for speaker-independent sys ems. 
We achieved word error rates of 17.1% without VP and 
16.6% error rates with VP as measured by NIST.*

7. OTHER MICROPHONE RESULTS 
The WSJ0 corpus was col lected using two microphones 
simultaneously recording the talker. One was a Sennheiser 
HMD-410 and the other was chosen randomly for each 
speaker from among a large group of microphones. Such 
*The NIST error ates differ slightly (insigrtificantly) 
from our own measures (17.1% and 16.6%), however, to 
be consistent with the other error ates reported in this 
paper, we are using our internally measured error rates 
in the tables.

dual recordings are available for the training, development, 
and evaluation materials. 
We chose to evaluate our full system on the "other-micro- 
phone" data without using other-microphone training data. 
The error rate increased only 62.3% when evaluating with 
other-microphone recordings vs. the Sennheiser recordings. 
In these tests, we configured our system exactly as for the 
standard microphone evaluation, except hat we used SRI's 
noise-robust front end (Erell and Weintraub, \[9,10\]; Mur- 
veit, et al, \[11\]) as the signal processing component. 
Table 4 summarizes the "other-microphone" evaluation 
results. Speaker 424's performance, where the error rate 
increases 208.2% (from 18.4% to 56.7%) when using a 
Shure SM91 microphone isa problem for our system. How- 
ever, the microphone is not the sole source of the problem, 
since the performance of Speaker 427, with the same 
microphone, is only degraded 18.9% (from 9.0 to 10.7%). 
We suspect that the problem is due to a loud buzz in the 
recordings that is absent from the recordings of other speak- 
errs. 
8. EXTRA TRAINING DATA 
We suspected that he set of training data specified as the 
baseline for the February 1992 Dry Run Evaluation was 
insufficient to adequately estimate the parameters of the 
DECIPHER TM system. The baseline SI training condition 
contains approximately 7,240 from 84 speakers (half42 
male, 42 female). 
We used the SI and SD training and development data to 
train the system to see if performance ould be improved 
with extra data. However, to save time, we used only speech 
from male speakers to train and test the system. Thus, the 
training data for the male system was increased from 3586 
sentences (42 male speakers) to 9109 sentences (53 male 
speakers).* The extra training data reduced the error rate by 
approximately 20% as shown in Table 5. 
*The number of speakers did not increase substantially 
since the bulk of the extra training data was taken from 
the speaker-dependent portion of the corpus.

Interestingly, this reduced error rate equalled that for 
speaker-dependent systems trained with 600 sentences per 
speaker and tested with the same language model used here. 
However, speaker-dependent systems trained on 2000+ 
sentences per speaker did perform significantly better than 
this system. 
9. SUMMARY 
This is a preliminary report demonstrating that the DECI- 
PHER TM speech recognition system was ported from a 
1,000-word task (ATIS) to a large vocabulary (5,000-word) 
task (DARPA's CSR task). We have achieved word error 
rates between of 16.6% and 17.1% as measured by NIST on 
DARPA's February 1992 Dry-Run WSJ0 evaluation where 
no test words were outside the prescribed vocabulary. We 
evaluated using alternate microphone data and found that 
the error rate increased only by 62%. Finally, by increasing 
the amount of training data, we were able to achieve an 
error rate that matched the error rates reported for this task 
from 600 sentence/speaker speaker-dependent systems. 
This could not have been done without substantial support 
from the rest of the DARPA community in the form of 
speech data, pronunciation tables, and language models.
