ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION 
Anaphora resolut ion is the process of 
determining the referent of ~uaphors. 
such as def in i te noun phrases and 
pronouns, in a discourse. Computat ional  
l inguists, in model ing the process of 
anaphora resolution, have proposed the 
not ion of focusing. Focusing is the 
process, engaged in by a reader, of 
select ing a subset of the discourse 
items and maJ?ing them highly avai lable 
for further computations. This paper 
provides a cognit ive basis for anaphora 
resolut ion and focusing. Human memory 
is d iv ided into a short-term, an 
operating, and a long-term memory. 
Short-term memory can only contain a 
small number of meaning units and its 
retr ieval time is fast. Short-term 
memory is d iv ided into a cache and a 
buffer. The cache contains a subset of 
meaning units expressed in the previous 
sentences and the buffer holds a 
representat ion of ~he incoming sentence. 
Focusing is real ized in ~he cache that 
contains a subset of the most topical  
units and a subset of the mos~ recent 
units in the text. The in format ion 
stored in the cache is used to integrate 
~he incoming sentence with the preceding 
discourse. Pronouns should be used to 
refer to units in focus. Operat ing 
memory contains a very large number of 
units but its re~rleval t ime is slow. 
It contains the previous tex~ units that 
are not in the cache. It comprises the 
tex~ units not in focus. Def in i te noun 
phrases should be used to refer to unite 
not in focus. Two empir ical  studies are 
descr ibed that demonstrate the cognit ive 
basis for focusing, the use of def in i te 
noun phrases to refer to antecedents not 
in focus, and the use of pronouns to 
refer to antecedents in focus. 
The goal of thls research is to 
show the relat ion between the 
psychologica l  work on anaphora 
reso lut ion based on the notion of a 
l imited short-term or working memory and 
the computat ional  l inguist ics work based 
on the notion of focusing. 
This rapprochement is important for 
the fol lowing reasons: 
I) From a theoret ical  viewpoint. 
cognit ive evidence increases the 
val id i ty  of the computat ional  notion of 
focus. 
2) Focusing corresponds to one of the 
reader's comprehension processes and it 
needs to be incorporated in the model of 
the user in language understanding 
systems to adequately resolve 
am~iguit les  in the user's utterances and 
to handle language generation. 
FOCUSING IN COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS 
According to Grosz (1977) .  who was 
interested in ~he resolut ion of def in i te 
noun phrases, focusing is the process. 
engaged in by part ic ipants in a 
discourse, of h ighl ight ing a subset of 
their shared reality. Grosz. Joshi. and 
weinste in (1983) d ist inguish between two 
levels of focus, global focus and 
centerimg. Global  focusing is a major 
factor in maintain ing global coherence 
and in the interpretat ion of def in i te 
noun phrases. Center ing is a major 
factor in maintain ing local coherence 
and in the interpretat ion of pronouns. 
Grosz. Joshi. and Weinstein further 
def ine the notion of centering. Each 
sentence has two types of centers whose 
purpose is to  integrate the sentence to  
the discourse. The backward- look ing 
center l inks the current sentence to the 
preceding discourse. The set of 
forward- looklng centers provides th~ set 
of ent it ies to which further anaphors 
m~y refer. The b6okw~rd- looklng center 
corresponds, roughly.- to Sidner's focus 
and the forward- looklng centers  to 
Sidner's potentla~l fool. 
~8 
? L 
One principle der ived by Grosz, 
Joshl, and Weins~ein is the following: 
if the b~okward- looking center of the 
ourren~ utterance is the same as the 
baokward- looklng cen~er of the previous 
utterance, a pronoun should be used. In 
other words, if there are no ~oplc 
shifts, continue to refer to the same 
entity by using a pronoun. 
However, violat ions of- this 
pr inciple have been presented in Grosz 
(1977) and noted in Grosz, Joshl, and 
Welns~eln (198~). They have shown that 
pronouns are sometimes used to refer to 
entit ies mentioned many sentences back, 
even though the backward- looklng center 
of intervening sentences has been 
changed by topic shifts. 
Sidner (19V9. 1983) has proposed 
the notion of focus in the context of 
interpreting anaphors, especial ly 
pronouns. In Sidner's theory, an 
anaphor neither refers ~o another word 
nor co-refers to another word. but 
rather co-specif ies a cognit ive elemen~ 
in the reader's mind. Moreover. a 
theory of an&phora resolution must 
predict the pattern of reader's correct 
and incorrect choices of co-specif iers 
and ~he fai lures ~o unders tand .  This 
view makes explicit the considerat ion of 
the reader's mental model and 
inferential capa~bili~ies 
A sEetch of Sidner's focusing 
process follows. First. an init ial 
focus is selected on the basis of 
syntactic features and thematic roles 
indicating toplc~l ity in the flrs~ 
sentence. Other elements introduced in 
the sentence are stored as potential  
loci for later sentences. When an 
anaphorlc expression is encountered. 
this focus is tested as a co-speclf ler  
for ~he anaphor. It has to satisfy 
syntaotlo res~rlo~ions on co-references 
(L~snlk, 1976), semantic seleo~ional  
restr lo~ions (Katz and Fodor, 1963), and 
pragmatic plausibi l i ty  oons~raln~s 
expressed in the remainder of the 
sentence. If the focus fails ~s a 
co-speclf ier for the ~n~phor, the 
potential  fool are tr ied in turn. At 
the same time, the new elements 
introduced in the sentence are stored as 
potential  loci for later sentences. 
Third, the focus is updated to the 
selected co-speclf ler for the anaphor. 
If the focus has changed, a topic s~ift 
has occurred. The second and third 
s~eps are cycl ical ly applied after each 
sentence. 
The advantage of using a focus 
mechanism is tha~ it priorlt lzes and 
restr lc~s the search for a co-speclfier, 
and as a consequence, reduces the 
oomputat lon~l costs assoolated with 
inferent ia l  processing when test ln~ the 
appl icabi l i ty  of the oo-specl f ler  to the 
anaphor. 
COGNITIVE STUDIES OF ANAPHORA RESOLUTION 
A few representat ive empirical 
studies of anaphora resolut ion are 
descr ibed below. All the experimental  
par~dlgms used share the fol lowing 
assumptions: 
1) human memory is func~ional ly or 
s~ruc~ural ly  div ided into at least two 
types of memories, a short-term memory 
with small storage capacity but very 
fast retrieval time and a long-term 
memory with very large s~orage capacity 
but slow retrieval time: 
2) a topic shift transfers the units 
currently in short-term memory to 
lon~-term memory: 
3) ~n anaphor transfers its referent 
from long-term memory to short-term 
memory (i.e. reinstates its referent), 
if it was not already in short-term 
memory. 
The first assumption is crucial. 
Other things being equal, computations 
involving retrieval from short-term 
memory will be faster than those 
involving retr ieval from long-term 
memory. Turning to the second 
assumption, topic shifts have been found 
to be induced wlth a varify of 
l inguls%ic devices. One of the devices 
is the introduct ion of intervening 
sentences between the referent and its 
anaphor. The intervening sentences are 
unrelated zo the referent but related to 
the overall  text. Another device is the 
speci f icat ion of a temporal or Spatial 
parameter that is outside the normal 
range of a situation. When descr ibing a 
dinner, the phrase "Five hours later," 
signals ~h~t the topic of conversat ion 
is no longer the dinner. Another device 
is the use of an anaphor, frequently a 
def ln l te noun phrase, to refer to an 
antecedent tha~ is not current ly the 
topic of conversat ion bu~ is in the 
"background". Finally, there is the use 
of key phrases to signal a diversion in 
the flow of discourse, such as "Let's 
turn to.". as documented in Relchman 
(1978, 1984). 
The general pattern for the 
material used in these experiments is 
the following. A~ the beginning of the 
tex~ appears a sentence containing a 
referent (e.g. biologist). For 
example, "The mission included a 
biologist". Then, if ~he referent 
should not be in focus, the nex~ 
sentence or sentences indloate a topic 
shift as described aJ3ovs (e.g. 
~9 
unrelated intervening sentences). If 
the referent should be in focus, no 
devices for topic shifts are used. The 
fol lowing sentence then contains an 
an&phor (e.g. scientist, he) to the 
focused or non-focused referent (e.g. 
biologist). For example, "The scientlst 
col lected samples from the cultures". 
Another example is shown in Table 1 of 
this paper. 
Carpenter and Just (1977) used eye 
traoklng with other converging 
techniques to study anaphora resolution. 
Wlth eye tracking, one can monitor very 
precisely the trajectory of the eyes, 
with their forward and regressive 
movements, and the duration of eye 
f ixations on small segments of the te~.  
The assumption behind using this 
technique is that eye movements are 
closely related to higher level 
cognit ive activit ies such as 
comprehension. Therefore. one can 
expect longer f ixation durations on text 
segments requir ing addit ional processing 
to be comprehended and one can expect 
the eye movement pattern to mirror the 
select ive pickup of important 
information in the text. 
They performed a series of 
experiments testln~ the effect of 
recency of a referent on the time course 
of anaphora resolution. Indirectly. 
they tested the effect of recency on the 
avai labi l i ty of an item in short-term 
memory. They presented texts where the 
number of sentences between the referent 
and the anaphor was varied from zero to 
three. The subjects read each sentence 
and. after the sentence, had to decide 
whether it was consistent or 
inconsistent with the previous 
sentences. The consistency Judgment 
times and the eye fixations were 
recorded. The consistency Judgment 
task, used as converging evidence with 
the eye movement technique, is bel ieved 
to induce the subjects to integrate each 
new sentence and should pars,llel the 
di f f iculty of ~phora  resolution. The 
overall  reading time of the ~n&phorlo 
sentence was measured using the eye 
tracking technique. Each of these tasks 
should be faster if the referent was in 
short-term memory than if the referent 
was in long-term memory. 
Response times for the consistency 
Judgments and reading times of the 
anaphorlc sentences increased as the 
n-mher of intervening sentences 
increased. The sharpest difference 
appeared between zero and one 
intervening sentence. Gaze durations 
within the anaphorlo sentence were  
shorter when there were no intervenlng 
sentences th~n in the other conditions. 
These results show not only that 
&naphora resolut ion is easier when the 
referent is nearer the ~naphor but also 
that one intervenln E sentence may be 
suff lolent to produce a topic shift. 
C lare and Sengul (1979) used the 
sentence reading time technique to study 
anaphora resolution. In this technique. 
subjects control the onset and offset of 
the presentat ion of a sentence by 
pressing a button. The subjects are 
instructed to press the button to see a 
new sentence as soon as they have 
understood the current sentence. The 
assumption behind this technique is that 
addit ional  processing required for 
comprehension wil l  increase sentence 
reading time. 
Clare and Sengul (1979) measured 
the reading time of a sentence 
containing an anaphor. They 
d ist inguished between two models of the 
effect of recency of a referent on the 
speed of ~naphora resolution. In the 
first model, cal led the "continuity 
model", entit ies mentioned in the 
discourse are searched backward from the 
last one. One should expect 
monotonical ly  increasing re~din~ time as 
the searched entity is farther back. In 
the second model, cal led the 
"discontinuity model", entit ies 
mentioned in the current or last 
sentence are kept in short-term memory 
and accessed first. All the entit ies 
that are further back are more l ikely to 
be in long-term memory (and not in 
shor~-term memory) and accessed second. 
Subjects rea~ short paragraphs 
where a referent could be separated from 
the anaphor by zero ~o two intervenin~ 
sentences. The readln~ time of ~he 
sentence containing the anaphor was fast 
when the referent was in the immediately 
preceding sentence but ~a l lx  ~ when 
it was two or three sentences before. 
This f inding supports the discont inuity 
model. Entit ies in the last processing 
cycle are more l ikely to be kept in 
short-term memory than entit ies in 
previously processed cycles. Once a 
tex~ entity is not in short-term, the 
number of intervening sentences does not 
affect the speed of an~phora resolution. 
Lesgold, Roth, and Curtis (1979), 
who related the l inguistic notion of 
foregrounding (Chafe, 1972) to ~he 
psychological  notion of short-term 
memory, performed a series of 
experiments similar ~o those of Clark 
~nd Sengul (1979), using more varied 
ways to produce topic shifts, and 
repl icated the above findings.

McKoon and gatol i f f  (1980) used an 
act ivat ion procedure based on Chang 
(1980). A desor ipt lon of the baslo 
paradigm and its underlying loglo 
follows. When one reads a text, only a 
small part of the text information is 
stored in short-term memory and most of 
the informat ion is stored in long-term 
memory. This is due to the very small 
storage capacity of short-term memory (7 
t2 chunEs; Miller, 1956). Given that 
retr ieval  time in short-term memory is 
much faster than retr ieval time in 
long-term memory, it wil l  tame longer to 
remember something from the text if the 
memory is stored in long-term memory 
than in short-term memory. 
In their study, subjects read a 
paragraph sentence by sentence. 
Immediate ly  after the last sentence, the 
subjects were presented with a single 
word and the subjects had to remember 
whether the word had appeared previously 
in the text or not (an old-new 
recognition). If the tested word was 
stil l  in short-term memory, the old-new 
recognit ion time should be faster than 
if it was in long-term memory. 
To test this hypothesis, the 
paragraphs were constructed in the 
fol lowing manner. The referent (e.g. 
burglar) was separated from the anaphor 
by either zero or ~wo in~ervenlng 
sentences. The anaphor appeared in the 
last sentence of the paragraph. The 
last sentence was presented in one of 
three versions: i) the subject of the 
sentence was a repetit ion (i.e. 
burglar) of the referent in the first 
sentence (anaphorio- identioal);  2) the 
subject was the name of the category- 
(e.g. criminal) in which the referent 
belonged (anaphorlc- category); 3) the 
subject was a noun (e.g. ca~) unrelated 
~o the referent (non-anaphoric). During 
the experimental  trials, the "referent" 
(i.e. burglar) was presented 
immediately after the last sentence for 
an old-new recognition. 
Assuming that an anaphor activates 
its referent by making it avai lable in 
short-term memory, one can expect 
s lgni f loant ly faster old-new recognit ion 
t imes for "burglar" in the 
anaphor lc-ca~egory oondi~lon than in the 
non-anaphor lo condition. This 
predict ion was observed. 
Surprisingly, the number of 
intervening sentences did not have an 
effect. This suggests that the two 
intervening sentences did not remove the 
referent from short-term memory (i.e. 
"backgrounds" the referent). It is 
probably not the case. Rather. i~ is 
l lkely that by testing the referent at 
the end of the clause, as opposed to 
when the anaphor is encountered, the 
referent had time to be reinstated in 
shor~-term memory and be highly 
available. This is an important point. 
The act ivat ion procedure was not on-l lne 
since the old-new recognit ion ocoured at 
the ~n~ of the sentence as opposed to 
M~ll~ the sentence was read and the 
anaphor encountered. 
Another in i t ia l ly  surpr is ing effect 
was that ~he old-new recognit ion times 
for the referents were slower in the 
zero intervening sentences when the 
anaphor was a repet it ion of the referent 
itself  than when the anaphor was the 
category name. This last result 
suggests that it is not appropriate to 
use a def in i te noun phrase, especial ly a 
repet i t ion of the referent, to refer to 
a antecedent in short-term memory. 
As explained previously, 
intervening sentences are not the only 
devices that transfer text units from 
short-term to long-term memory. 
Stereotypical  s ituations have spatial 
and temporal parameters with legal 
ranges of values. If one specif ies a 
spatial or ~emporal value outside these 
ranges, a scenario-shift  occurs. For 
example. Anderson (in Sanford and 
Garrodo 1981) constructed texts about 
stereotypical  s ituations such as going 
to a restaurant. In one sentence of the 
text, there was a reference to a 
character related to the script, say a 
waiter. AZ the beginning of the next 
sentence, there was a mention of a 
temporal or spatial  parameter, such as 
"One hour later" or "Five hours la~er". 
In the flrs~ case the parameter is 
within the range def in ing the scrip~, in 
the second case it is not. The rest of 
~he sentence contained an anaphor to the 
previously ment ioned character, the 
walter. Measumlng ~he reading time of 
the anaphorlo sentence. Anderson showed 
longer reading time when the spatial or 
temporal parameter w~s outside the range 
of the script th~n inside. This 
suggests that the referent was 
transfered from short-term to long-term 
memory by the scenarlo-shlft  and it took 
longer ~o retrieve the referent during 
anaphora resolution. 
The results from all these 
experiments support the notion tha~ an 
anaphor activates its referent by malting 
it highly available in short-term memory 
and ~hat topic shifts transfer units 
from short-term memory to long-term 
memoz'y. However. none of these studles~ 
except some eye movement siudles.

COGNITIVE BASIS FOR FOCUSING 
A sketch of a cognit ive model of 
anaphora resolut ion is offered here. It 
has been  heavi ly  inf luenced by the 
short-term~long-term memory model of 
K intsch and van DiJk (19~8) and 
especia l ly  its leading edge strategy. 
~tructure ~f ~ memg/~ 
Analogical ly, human memory can be 
conceptual ized as a three level 
structure similar to the memory of most 
mini and main frame computers. It 
consists of a small, very fast memory 
cal led short-term memory (STM); a 
relat ively larger main or operating 
memory (OM): and a vast store of 
general  world knowledge cal led long-term 
memory (LTM). 
The total STM is only large enough 
to contain 7t2 chunks of information at 
any one time (Simon, 1974; Miller. 
1956). The resources for STM are 
dynamical ly  al located to one of two 
uses. First, par~ of the STM is used to 
store the incoming sentence or clause. 
This is a temporary storage of the 
sentence or clause before further 
processing and is cal led the STM buffer. 
The second part of STM is cal led the STM 
cache. It is used to hold over. from 
one sentence or clause to the next. the 
information necessary to provide local 
and global coherence. It contains a 
subset of the previous text items that 
are topical and a subset of those that 
are recent. Retr ieval  t imes from 
short-term memory are very fast. 
Conceptually. operating memory is 
the subset of the world knowledge in 
long-term memory which is deemed 
relev~n~ to the prooesslng of the 
current par~ of the text. It also 
contains the growing memory structure 
oorrsspondin~ to the tex~ read so f~r. 
I~ contains the less topical  and less 
recent information from the text. 
Retrieval times are much longer than for 
short-term memory. 
The time course of anaphora 
resolution is greatly determined by the 
current content of shor~-term memory and 
of operating memory. Moroever, pronouns 
and definite noun phrases are resolved 
using different s~rategies. 
Cache ~ .  During the input 
of a sentence into the buffer ~nd the 
concurrent integrat ion of the sentence 
into the cache, a subset of the semantic 
units  held in the STM is selected to be 
held over in the cache for the next 
cycle. Fol lowing Elntsch and van Di jk 
(1978), the cache management strategy 
selects a subset T of the most topical  
i tems and a subset R of the most recent 
items to be held over in the cache. The 
select ion strategy aims at m~xlmiz in~ 
the probabi l i ty  that an anaphor in the 
nex~ sentence wil l  refer to a semantic 
unit held in the cache. Cache 
management is appl ied after each 
sentence or clause. 
Pronouns and def inite noun phrases are 
resolved using different strategies, we 
wil l  descr ibe four cases: 
i. The anaphor is a def in i te noun 
phrase and the referent is not 
in focus, that is, i~ is in 
operating memory, 
2. The anaphor is a def inite noun 
phrase and the referent is in 
focus, that is. it is in the 
cache. 
3. The anaphor is a pronoun and 
the referent is in the cache 
(in fOCUS). 
4. The anaphor is a pronoun and 
the referent is in operating 
memory (not in focus). 
It is hypothesized that the 
expl ic i tness of sm anaphor is a signal. 
used by the readier, which denotes 
whether the referent is in the cache or 
in operating memory. 
If the ~naphor is a def in i te noun 
phrase, operating memory is searched 
immediately. If the referent is in 
operat ing memory it is then reinstated 
into the cache. A topic shift has 
occured. 
If the anaphor is a definite noun 
phrase and the referent is in focus 
(i.e. in the cache), anaphora 
resolut ion wil l  be hindered. The reader 
searches operating memory while the 
referent is in short-term memory. 
Correspondingly. this violates a rule of 
cooperat ive communication: use a 
def inite noun phrase to refer to an 
~ntecedent not in focus. The def ini te 
noun phrase signals a topic shift, while 
in fact. the same entity is being talked 
about. 
999 
If the anaphor is a pronoun, the 
cache is searched for a plausible 
referent. If found, mnaphora resolution 
is completed. Because cache management 
is based on topioal l ty and recency, 
pronouns can refer to ~he main ~opio of 
~he text even when the main ~opio has 
no~ been mentioned directly for mamy 
sentences. Unless there is a global 
~opic shift, the main topic in the cache 
remains unchanged throughout ~he text. 
If the anaphor is a pronoun but no 
referent is found in the cache, it is 
then necessary to search operating 
memory. If a referen~ is found in 
operating memory, it is reinstated into 
the c~che. A ~opic shift has occured. 
Using a pronoun ~o refer ~o information 
in operating memory is de~rlmental  ~o 
amaphora resolution. The reader first 
searches the cache. ~hen ~he operating 
memory, and ~hen has ~o relnst~te ~he 
referent into the cache. 
COMPARISONS 
A clear relation exists between ~he 
notion of focusing proposed in 
computational l inguist ics and the model 
of human memory and discourse processing 
proposed in cognit ive psychology. 
The Q~h~ is used to store the 
items in f.~Q~. Given the small number 
of items stored in the cache, a sketchy 
anaphor such as ~ ~ is sufflclen~ 
to retrieve the referent. The cache 
management strategy in human .memory is 
aimed at maximizing ~he probabi l i ty that 
the cache contains the information 
relevant to the next cycle of 
computation. The cache, by containing 
topical and recen~ i~ems, allows to 
maintain global and local coherence. 
Q ~  m~y~ is used ~o store 
items that are not in f~A~.  Because 
the set of items is large, an 
informative descr lp~ion of the Item ~o 
be searched for is needed. D~f i~ i~ 
~ou~ ~h/~es  a/e used ~o indlc~te to the 
reader ~ha~ the i~em is no~ in focus. 
thus In operating memory. Other things 
being equal, it will tame more time to 
retr ieve an item from operating memory 
than from the cache. The referent will 
need to be reinstated into the cache. 
This will produce a topic shift. The 
reinstated referent is then highly 
avai lable and can be referred to by 
using a pronoun. 
TWO ON-LINE STUDIES OF ANAPHORA 
RESOLUTION 
The presented studies test the 
not ion tha~ focus is cognlt ively 
real ized in the reader's l imited 
short - term memory. They also test 
Grosz. Joshl. and Welnsteln's  claim that 
def in i te  noun phrases, and not pronouns, 
should be used to refer ~o items no 
longer in focus and ~hat pronouns, ~nd 
not def in i te noun phrases, should be 
used to refer to items in focus. 
Moreover, if one assumes that the 
content of short-term memory is 
dynamica l ly  updated on ~he basis of 
recency ~nd topicality, one can explain 
why pronouns can be used to refer Zo 
recent items ~nd also to topical 
non-recen~ items. 
A new technique, cal led Q~z l i~  
~ i Q n ,  was developed speci f ical ly 
to provide the empir ical  da~a for these 
studies. The on-l ine act ivat ion 
technique can be compared to "closely" 
tracing the execution of ~ program. 
In the on-l ine act ivation 
technique, passages are presented using 
rapid serial visual presentat ion (RSVP), 
one  word a~ a time. In ~ddit lon to 
reading each text. the part ic ipants were 
also given the ~ask to recognize whether 
some special ly marked words, presented 
surrept i t ious ly  wi~hln ~he ~ext, had 
appemred before in the tex~ or not. 
Some of ~hese special words were 
presented before in the text and others 
were not.. We will call ~hese special ly 
marked words zest words. This task is 
cal led am old-new recognit ion task. 
The passages contained anaphors 
referr ing ~o antecedents which were 
either in focus or not in focus. An 
antecedent was removed from focus by 
introducing a topic shift, with ~he 
restr lc~ion that the antecedent was not 
the main topic of the discourse. An 
example ter~ is presented in table I. 
Note that only one of the alternative 
sentences 5a, 5b. or 50 was presented 
for each text to the part icipants of the 
study. 
In each text. one of the test words 
was the referent of the anaphor. At 
some point before or after the anaphor 
was presented on the CRT, its referent 
was presented for old-new recognit ion 
and recognit ion times and errors were 
collected. The delay between the onse~ 
of the anaphor and the onset of the test 
word is called the stimulus onset 
asynchrony (SOA). The ~naphor is acting 
as a prime, which should activate the 
referent. The old-new recognit ion time 
for the referent test word indicates 
223 
whether the referent is in the cache or 
in operating memory.

4- He measured the temperature of a 
solut ion using a thermometer.

the expected re~ding.

for the react ion to complete. 
5a- The thin instrument was not givlng 
the expected reading. 
5b- A broken instrument was not giving 
the expected reading. 
50- The computer terminal was not giving 
the expected reading. 
In addition, there were three types 
of primes, as shown in sentences 5a, 5b, 
8~d 5o in Table i. The prime could be 
either semant ical ly  related and 
referential  (S+R?) ~ in 5a, 
semantical ly  related and not referential  
(S+R-)  as in 5b, or  semantical ly 
unre lated and not referential  (S-R-) as 
in 5c. In the S?R? condition, the prime 
is the an~phor. The two condit ions S?R- 
and S-R- were control condit ions to 
separate the effect of semantic priming, 
due ~o semantic ~ssociat ion between the 
anaphor and the referent, on the old-new 
reccgnlt lon for referents.  
A schema of the procedure is shown 
in Table 2. The words surrounded by

I. If a referent is not in focus, 
due to a topic shift, the 
ooourenoe of the anaphor should 
reinstate the referent into the 
cache, leading to faster 
old-new recognit ion times. In 
terms of the experimental  
conditions, there should be a 
decrease in old-new recognit ion 
time at the 350 and 1250 msec 
condit ions in the S+R? 
condit ion ( i .e .  after the 
anaphor), but not in the S+R- 
and S-R- conditions, which are 
not anaphorio. 
2. The use of a def inite noun 
phrase to refer to an 
antecedent in the cache (i.e. 
in focus) should be detr imental  
to anaphora resolution. IZ 
should slow down the 
recognit ion of the referent as 
old or new. In terms of the 
ex~erlmental  conditions, if the 
referent is in focus, the 
old-new recognit ion times in 
the 350 and 1250 msec SOA 
condit ions should be slower 
than in the before SOA 
coD~Litlon.

exper imental  texts. They contained as a 
referent an instance of a cl~ss (e.g. 
thermometer) to be used later as a test 
word, and a~ an an~phor the class name 
(e.g. instrument). In this study, the 
an~phor w~s a def inite noun phrase. An 
example of the material  was presented in

Dur ing  the presentat ion  of each 
text. two or three test words were 
presented,  one exper imenta l  and one or 
two f i l lers. The f i l ler  words were 
presented  at semi - random locat ions  in

there was an equal  number of old and new 
test words.

wh ich  had a "yes" but ton  on the right. 
for old test words, and a "no" but ton  on 
the left. for new test words. The tex~s 
were presented  us ing RSVP. with each 
word presented  in the center  of the 
screen for 300 msec. The par t i c ipants  
were asked to recogn ize  whether  the test 
words were old or new. as fast as 
poss ib le  but wi thout  making mistakes. 
D~i~ There were 36 exper imenta l  
texts  and 18 exper imenta l  condit ions.  
The f irst man ipu la t ion  was the focus ing

In another study (Gulndon, 1982), 
using ~he same on-l lne ~c~iva~ion 
technique, the ~c~ivation of an 
antecedent by a pronoun was ~raced. In 
this study, it was fo%L~d tha~ referring 
~o an anteceden~ not in focus by using a 
pronoun was detr imental  to anaphora 
resolution. The delay between reading 
the anaphor and reins~atlng the 
an~eceden~ was as long as 2400 msec. 
The act lva~ion of an anteceden~ no~ in 
focus by a pronoun takes a long ~ime 
because ~he reader is induced: I) to 
search the cache unsuocesful ly; 2) to 
search operating memory with a "sketchy" 
pronoun: 3) to relnstaZe the referent 
into the cache. Act ivat ion was 
immediate for ~he antecedents in focus. 
As opposed ~o the previous s~udy where 
referr ing to a focused referen~ using a 
def inite noun phrase hindered anaphora 
resolution, no such effect was observed 
when using a pronoun. This is expected 
since pronouns signal tha~ ~he referent 
is in the cache. 
SUMMARY 
The notion of focusing and the 
notion that the form of the anaphor 
signals whether ~he referen~ is in focus 
or no~ have cognit ive support. Items in 
focus are items in the cache which is 
dynamical ly  updated ~o contain ~he T 
most ~opical and the R most recen~ items 
in the ~ex~. Because the cache con~alns 
few items, pronouns should be used ~o 
refer to items in focus. O~her things 
being equal, anaphora resolut ion wil l  be 
easier if the antecedent is in focus, 
because ~he retrieval ~imes from the 
cache are much faster ~han those from 
the operating memory. Antecedents not 
in focus are in operating memory. I~ems 
no~ in focus are in operating memory. A 
def inite noun phrase, because it is more 
descr ipt ive ~han a pronoun, should be 
used to re~rieve the ~nteceden~ from ~he 
large set of i~ems in operating memory. 
However, because ~he reErleval ~ime is 
slow in opera~in~ memory, anaphora 
resolut ion is more dlf f lcul~ for i~ems 
~ha~ are no~ in focus. The 
relns~a~emen~ of am an~eceden~ into ~he 
cache effects a ~oplc shift. 
The on-llne activation ~echnique 
was developed specif ical ly to provide 
empir ical  data on the no~ion of focus. 
The ~dvan~age of this technique over 
conventional memory experiments is that 
one can ~est precisely the ~emporal 
propert ies of various analyses and 
processes occurring durln~ sentence and 
ter~ comprehension. This technique can 
be used to dist inguish between different 
models of anaphora resolution when ~hese 
models are no~ easi ly dist inguished on 
the basis of discourse or dialogue 
an~iysls.
