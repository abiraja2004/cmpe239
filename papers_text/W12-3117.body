Abstract
This paper describes the features and the ma-
chine learning methods used by Dublin City
University (DCU) and SYMANTEC for the
WMT 2012 quality estimation task. Two sets
of features are proposed: one constrained, i.e.
respecting the data limitation suggested by the
workshop organisers, and one unconstrained,
i.e. using data or tools trained on data that was
not provided by the workshop organisers. In
total, more than 300 features were extracted
and used to train classifiers in order to predict
the translation quality of unseen data. In this
paper, we focus on a subset of our feature set
that we consider to be relatively novel: fea-
tures based on a topic model built using the
Latent Dirichlet Allocation approach, and fea-
tures based on source and target language syn-
tax extracted using part-of-speech (POS) tag-
gers and parsers. We evaluate nine feature
combinations using four classification-based
and four regression-based machine learning
techniques.
1 Introduction
For the first time, the WMT organisers this year pro-
pose a Quality Estimation (QE) shared task, which
is divided into two sub-tasks: scoring and ranking
automatic translations. The aim of this workshop is
to define useful sets of features and machine learn-
ing techniques in order to predict the quality of a
machine translation (MT) output T (Spanish) given
a source segment S (English). Quality is measured
using a 5-point likert scale which is based on post-
editing effort, following the scoring scheme:
1. The MT output is incomprehensible
2. About 50-70% of the MT output needs to be
edited
3. About 25-50% of the MT output needs to be
edited
4. About 10-25% of the MT output needs to be
edited
5. The MT output is perfectly clear and intelligi-
ble
The final score is a combination of the scores as-
signed by three evaluators. The use of a 5-point scale
makes the scoring task more difficult than a binary
classification task where a translation is considered
to be either good or bad. However, if the task is
successfully carried out, the score produced is more
useful.
Dublin City University and Symantec jointly ad-
dress the scoring task. For each pair (S, T ) of source
segment S and machine translation T , we train three
classifiers and one classifier combination using the
training data provided by the organisers to predict
5-point Likert scores. In this paper, we present the
classification results on the test set along with addi-
tional results obtained using regression techniques.
We evaluate the usefulness of two new sets of fea-
tures:
1. topic-based features using Latent Dirichlet Al-
location (LDA (Blei et al., 2003)),
2. syntax-based features using POS taggers and
parsers (Wagner et al., 2009)
The remainder of this paper is organised as fol-
lows. In Section 2, we give an overview of all the
138
features employed in our QE system. Then, in Sec-
tion 3, we describe the topic and syntax-based fea-
tures in more detail. Section 4 presents the vari-
ous classification and regression techniques we ex-
plored. Our results are presented and discussed in
Section 5. Finally, we summarise and outline our
plans in Section 6.
2 Features Overview
In this section, we describe the features used in our
QE system. In the first subsection, the features in-
cluded in our constrained system are presented. In
the second subsection, we detail the features in-
cluded in our unconstrained system. Both of these
systems include the 17 baseline features provided
for the shared task.
2.1 Constrained System
The constrained system is based only on the data
provided by the organisers. We extracted 70 fea-
tures in total (including the baseline features) and
we present them here according to the type of infor-
mation they capture.
Word and Phrase-Level Features
? Ratio of source and target segment length:
the number of source words divided by the
number of target words
? Ratio of source and target number of punc-
tuation marks: the number of source punctua-
tion marks divided by the number of target ones
? Number of phrases comprising the MT out-
put: given a phrase-table, we assume that a
sentence composed of several phrases indicates
uncertainty on the part of the MT system.
? Average length of source and target phrases:
concatenating short phrases may result in lower
fluency compared to the use of longer ones.
? Ratio of source and target averaged phrase
length
? Number of source prepositions and conjunc-
tions word: our assumption here is that seg-
ments containing a relatively high number of
prepositions and conjunctions may be more
complex and difficult to translate.
? Number of source out-of-vocabulary words
Language Model Features
All the language models (LMs) used in our work
are n-gram LMs with Kneser-Ney smoothing built
with the SRI Toolkit (Stolcke, 2002).
? Backward 2-gram and 3-gram source and
target log probabilities: as proposed by
Duchateau et al. (2002)
? Log probability of target segments on
5-gram MT-output-based LM: using
MOSES (Koehn et al., 2007) trained on the
provided parallel corpus, we translated the En-
glish side of this corpus into Spanish, assuming
that the MT output contains mistakes. This
MT output is used to build a LM that models
the behavior of the MT system. We assume
that for a given MT output, a high n-gram
probability (or a low perplexity) of the LM
indicates that the MT output contains mistakes.
MT-system Features
? 15 scores provided by Moses: phrase-table,
language model, reordering model and word
penalty (weighted and unweighted)
? Number of n-bests for each source segment
? MT output back-translation: from Spanish to
English using MOSES trained on the provided
parallel corpus, scored with TER (Snover et
al., 2006), BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) and
the Levenshtein distance (Levenshtein, 1966),
based on the source segments as a translation
reference
Topic Model Features
? Probability distribution over topics: Source
and target segment probability distribution over
topics for a 10-dimension topic model
? Cosine distance between source and target
topic vectors
More details about these two features are provided
in Section 3.1.
2.2 Unconstrained System
In addition to the features used for the constrained
system, a further 238 unconstrained features were
included in our unconstrained system.
139
MT System Features
As for our constrained system, we use MT output
back-translation from Spanish to English, but this
time using Bing Translator1 in addition to Moses.
Each back-translated segment is scored with TER,
BLEU and the Levenshtein distance, based on the
source segments as a translation reference.
Source Syntax Features
Wagner et al. (2007; 2009) propose a series of
features to measure sentence grammaticality. These
features rely on a part-of-speech tagger, a probabilis-
tic parser and a precision grammar/parser. We have
at our disposal these tools for English and so we ap-
ply them to the source data. The features themselves
are described in more detail in Section 3.2.
Target Syntax Features
We use a part-of-speech tagger trained on Spanish
to extract from the target data the subset of grammat-
icality features proposed by Wagner et al. (2007;
2009) that are based on POS n-grams. In addition
we extract features which reflect the prevalence of
particular POS tags in each target segment. These
are explained in more detail in Section 3.2 below.
Grammar Checker Features
LANGUAGETOOL (based on (Naber, 2003)) is an
open-source grammar and style proofreading tool
that finds errors based on pre-defined, language-
specific rules. The latest version of the tool can
be run in server mode, so individual sentences can
be checked and assigned a total number of errors
(which may or may not be true positives).2 This
number is used as a feature for each source segment
and its corresponding MT output.
3 Topic and Syntax-based Features
In this section, we focus on the set of features
that aim to capture adequacy using topic modelling
and grammaticality using POS tagging and syntactic
parsing.

2The list of English and Spanish rules is available at:
http://languagetool.org/languages.
3.1 Topic-based Features
We extract source and target features based on a
topic model built using LDA. The main idea in topic
modelling is to produce a set of thematic word clus-
ters from a collection of documents. Using the par-
allel corpus provided for the task, a bilingual corpus
is built where each line is composed of a source seg-
ment and its translation separated by a space. Each
pair of segments is considered as a bilingual docu-
ment. This corpus is used to train a bilingual topic
model after stopwords removal. The resulting model
is one set of bilingual topics z containing words w
with a probability p(wn|zn, ?) (with n equal to the
vocabulary size in the whole parallel corpus). This
model can be used to infer the probability distri-
bution of unseen source and target segments over
bilingual topics. During the test step, each source
segment and its translation are considered individu-
ally, as two monolingual documents. This method
allows us to compare the source and target topic dis-
tributions. We assume that a source segment and its
translation share topic similarities.
We propose two ways of using topic-based fea-
tures for quality estimation: keeping source and tar-
get topic vectors as two sets of k features, or com-
puting a vector distance between these two vectors
and using one feature only. To measure the prox-
imity of two vectors, we decided to used the Co-
sine distance, as it leads to the best results in terms
of classification accuracy. However, we plan to
study different metrics in further experiments, like
the Manhattan or the Euclidean distances. Some
parameters related to LDA have to be studied more
carefully too, such as the number of topics (dimen-
sions in the topic space), the number of words per
topic, the Dirichlet hyperparameter ?, etc. In our
experiments, we built a topic model composed of 10
dimensions using Gibbs sampling with 1000 itera-
tions. We assume that a higher dimensionality can
lead to a better repartitioning of the vocabulary over
the topics.
Multilingual LDA has been used before in nat-
ural language processing, e.g. polylingual topic
models (Mimno et al., 2009) or multilingual topic
models for unaligned text (Boyd-Graber and Blei,
2009). In the field of machine translation, Tam et
al. (2007) propose to adapt a translation and a lan-
140
guage model to a specific topic using Latent Se-
mantic Analysis (LSA, or Latent Semantic Index-
ing, LSI (Deerwester et al., 1990)). More recently,
some studies were conducted on the use of LDA to
adapt SMT systems to specific domains (Gong et al.,
2010; Gong et al., 2011) or to extract bilingual lexi-
con from comparable corpora (Rubino and Linare`s,
2011). Extracting features from a topic model is, to
the best of our knowledge, the first attempt in ma-
chine translation quality estimation.
3.2 Syntax-based Features
Syntactic features have previously been used in MT
for confidence estimation and for building automatic
evaluation measures. Corston-Oliver et al. (2001)
build a classifier using 46 parse tree features to pre-
dict whether a sentence is a human translation or MT
output. Quirk (2004) uses a single parse tree feature
in the quality estimation task with a 4-point scale,
namely whether a spanning parse can be found, in
addition to LM perplexity and sentence length. Liu
and Gildea (2005) measure the syntactic similarity
between MT output and reference translation. Al-
brecht and Hwa (2007) measure the syntactic simi-
larity between MT output and reference translation
and between MT output and a large monolingual
corpus. Gimenez and Marquez (2007) explore lexi-
cal, syntactic and shallow semantic features and fo-
cus on measuring the similarity of MT output to ref-
erence translation. Owczarzak et al. (2007) use la-
belled dependencies together with WordNet to avoid
penalising valid syntactic and lexical variations in
MT evaluation. In what follows, we describe how
we make use of syntactic information in the QE task,
i.e. evaluating MT output without a reference trans-
lation.
Wagner et al. (2007; 2009) use three sources
of linguistic information in order to extract features
which they use to judge the grammaticality of En-
glish sentences:
1. For each POS n-gram (with n ranging from 2 to
7), a feature is extracted which represents the
frequency of the least frequent n-gram in the
sentence according to some reference corpus.
TreeTagger (Schmidt, 1994) is used to produce
POS tags.
2. Features provided by a hand-crafted, broad-
coverage precision grammar of English (Butt
et al., 2002) and a Lexical Functional Grammar
parser (Maxwell and Kaplan, 1996). These in-
clude whether or not a sentence could be parsed
without resorting to robustness measures, the
number of analyses found and the parsing time.
3. Features extracted from the output of three
probabilistic parsers of English (Charniak and
Johnson, 2005), one trained on Wall Street
Journal trees (Marcus et al., 1993), one trained
on a distorted version of the treebank obtained
by automatically creating grammatical error
and adjusting the parse trees, and the third
trained on the union of the original and dis-
torted versions.
These features were originally designed to distin-
guish grammatical sentences from ungrammatical
ones and were tested on sentences from learner cor-
pora by Wagner et al. (2009) and Wagner (2012).
In this work we extract all three sets of features
from the source side of our data and the POS-based
subset from the target side.3 We use the publicly
available pre-trained TreeTagger models for English
and Spanish4. The reference corpus used to obtain
POS n-gram frequences is the MT translation model
training data.5
In addition to the POS-based features described in
Wagner et al. (2007; 2009), we also extract the fol-
lowing features from the Spanish POS-tagged data:
for each POS tag P and target segment T , we ex-
tract a feature which is the proportion of words in
T that are tagged as P . Two additional features are
extracted to represent the proportion of words in T
that are assigned more than one tag by the tagger,
3Unfortunately, due to time constraints, we were unable to
source a suitable probabilistic phrase-structure parser and a pre-
cision grammar for Spanish and were thus unable to extract
parser-based features for Spanish. We expect that these features
would be more useful on the target side than the source side.

projekte/corplex/TreeTagger/
5To aid machine learning methods that linearly combine fea-
ture values, we add binarised features derived from the raw XLE
and POS n-gram features described above, for example we add
a feature indicating whether the frequency of the least frequent
POS 5-gram is below 10. We base the choice of binary fea-
tures on (a) decision rules observed in decision trees trained for
a binary scoring task and (b) decision rules of simple classifiers
(decision trees with just one decision node and 2 leaf nodes)
that form a convex hull of optimal classifiers in ROC space.

and the proportion of words in T that are unknown
to the tagger.
4 Machine Learning
In this section, we describe the machine learning
methods that we experimented with. Our final sys-
tems submitted for the shared task are based on clas-
sification methods. However, we also performed
some experiments with regression methods.
We evaluate the systems on the test set using the
official evaluation script and the reference scores.
We report the evaluation results as Mean Aver-
age Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error
(RMSE).
4.1 Classification
In order to apply classification algorithms to the
set of features associated with each source and tar-
get segment, we rounded the training data scores
to the closest integer. We tested several classifiers
and empirically chose three algorithms: Support
Vector Machine using sequential minimal optimiza-
tion and RBF kernel (parameters optimized by grid-
search) (Platt, 1999), Naive Bayes (John and Lang-
ley, 1995) and Random Forest (Breiman, 2001) (the
latter two techniques were applied with default pa-
rameters). We use the Weka toolkit (Hall et al.,
2009) to train the classifiers and predict the scores
on the test set. Each method is evaluated individu-
ally and then combined by averaging the predicted
scores.
4.2 Regression
We applied three different regression techniques:
SVM epsilon-SVR with RBF kernel, Linear Regres-
sion and M5P (Quinlan, 1992; Wang and Witten,
1997). The two latter algorithms were used with
default parameters, whereas SVM parameters (?, c
and ) were optimized by grid-search. We also per-
formed a combination of the three algorithms by av-
eraging the predicted scores. We apply a linear func-
tion on the predicted scores S in order to keep them
in the correct range (from 1 to 5) as detailed in (1),
where S? is the rescaled sentence score, Smin is the
lowest predicted score and Smax is the highest pre-
dicted score.
S? = 1 + 4?
S ? Smin
Smax ? Smin

5 Evaluation
Table 1 shows the results obtained by our classifi-
cation approach on various feature subsets. Note
that the two submitted systems used the combined
classifier approach with the constrained and uncon-
strained feature sets. Table 2 shows the results for
the same feature combinations, this time using re-
gression rather than classification.
The results of quality estimation using classifica-
tion methods show that the baseline and the syntax-
based features with the classifier combination leads
to the best results with an MAE of 0.71 and an
RMSE of 0.87. However, these scores are substan-
tially lower than the ones obtained using regression,
where the unconstrained set of features with SVM
leads to an MAE of 0.62 and an RMSE of 0.78.
It seems that the classification methods are not
suitable for this task according to the different sets
of features studied. Furthermore, the topic-distance
feature is not correlated with the quality scores, ac-
cording to the regression results. On the other hand,
the syntax-based features appear to be the most in-
formative and lead to an MAE of 0.70.
6 Conclusion
We presented in this paper our submission for the
WMT12 Quality Estimation shared task. We also
presented further experiments using different ma-
chine learning techniques and we evaluated the im-
pact of two sets of features - one set which is based
on linguistic features extracted using POS tagging
and parsing, and a second set which is based on topic
modelling. The best results are obtained by our un-
constrained system containing all features and us-
ing an -SVR regression method with a Radial Basis
Function kernel. This setup leads to a Mean Aver-
age Error of 0.62 and a Root Mean Squared Error
of 0.78. Unfortunately, we did not submit our best
configuration for the shared task.
We plan to continue working on the task of ma-
chine translation quality estimation. Our immediate
next steps are to continue to investigate the contribu-
tion of individual features, to explore feature selec-
tion in a more detailed fashion and to apply our best
system to other types of data including sentences
taken from an online discussion forum.
