Abstract
In this paper, we present an approach
to automatically revealing phonological
correspondences within historically re-
lated languages. We create two bilingual
pronunciation dictionaries for the lan-
guage pairs German-Dutch and German-
English. The data is used for automat-
ically learning phonological similarities
between the two language pairs via EM-
based clustering. We apply our models
to predict from a phonological German
word the phonemes of a Dutch and an
English cognate. The similarity scores
show that German and Dutch phonemes
are more similar than German and En-
glish phonemes, which supplies statistical
evidence of the common knowledge that
German is more closely related to Dutch
than to English. We assess our approach
qualitatively, finding meaningful classes
caused by historical sound changes. The
classes can be used for language learning.
1 Introduction
German and Dutch are languages that exhibit a wide
range of similarities. Beside similar syntactic fea-
tures like word order and verb subcategorization
frames, the languages share phonological features
which are due to historical sound changes. These
similarities are one reason why it is easier to learn a
closely historically related language than languages
from other language families: the learner?s native
language provides a valuable resource which can be
used in learning the new language. Although En-
glish also belongs to the West Germanic languages,
German and Dutch share more lexical entries with a
common root than German and English.
The knowledge about language similarities on the
lexical level is exploited in various fields. In ma-
chine translation, some approaches search for sim-
ilar words (cognates) which are used to align par-
allel texts (e.g., Simard et al (1992)). The word
triple Text-tekst-text ([tEkst] in German, Dutch
and English) can be easily recognized as a cog-
nate; recognizing Pfeffer-peper-pepper ([pfE][f@r]-
[pe:][p@r])-[pE][p@r*]), however, requires more
knowledge about sound changes within the lan-
guages. The algorithms developed for machine
translation search for similarities on the ortho-
graphic level, whereas some approaches to com-
parative and synchronic linguistics put their fo-
cus on similarities of phonological sequences.
Covington (1996), for instance, suggests different
algorithms to align the phonetic representation of
words of historical languages. Kondrak (2000)
presents an algorithm to align phonetic sequences
by computing the similarities of these words.
Nerbonne and Heeringa (1997) use phonetic tran-
scriptions to measure the phonetic distance between
different dialects. The above mentioned approaches
presuppose either parallel texts of different lan-
guages for machine translation or manually com-
piled lists of transcribed cognates/words for analyz-
ing synchronic or diachronic word pairs. Unfortu-
nately, transcribed bilingual data are scarce and it
33
is labor-intensive to collect these kind of corpora.
Thus, we aim at exploiting electronic pronunciation
dictionaries to overcome the lack of data.
In our approach, we automatically generate data
as input to an unsupervised training regime and
with the aim of automatically learning similar struc-
tures from these data using Expectation Maximiza-
tion (EM) based clustering. Although the generation
of our data introduces some noise, we expect that
our method is able to automatically learn meaningful
sound correspondences from a large amount of data.
Our main assumption is that certain German/Dutch
and German/English phoneme pairs from related
stems occur more often and hence will appear in the
same class with a higher probability than pairs not in
related stems. We assume that the historical sound
changes are hidden information in the classes.
The paper is organized as follows: Section 2
presents related research. In Section 3, we describe
the creation of our bilingual pronunciation dictionar-
ies. The outcome is used as input to the algorithm
for automatically deriving phonological classes de-
scribed in Section 4. In Section 5, we apply our
classes to a transcribed cognate list and measure the
similarity between the two language pairs. A quali-
tative evaluation is presented in Section 6, where we
interpret our best models. In Sections 7 and 8, we
discuss our results and draw some final conclusions.
2 Previous Research
Some approaches to revealing sound correspon-
dences require clean data whereas other methods can
deal with noisy input. Cahill and Tiberius (2002)
use a manually compiled cognate list of Dutch,
English and German cognates and extract cross-
linguistic phoneme correspondences. The results1
contain the counts of a certain German phoneme
and their possible English and Dutch counterparts.
The method presented in Kondrak (2003), however,
can deal with noisy bilingual word lists. He gener-
ates sound correspondences of various Algonquian
languages. His algorithm considers them as possi-
ble candidates if their likelihood scores lie above a
certain minimum-strength threshold. The candidates
are evaluated against manually compiled sound cor-
respondences. The algorithm is able to judge
1http://www.itri.brighton.ac.uk/projects/metaphon/
whether a bilingual phoneme pair is a possible sound
correspondence. Another interesting generative
model can be found in Knight and Graehl (1998).
They train weighted finite-state transducers with the
EM algorithm which are applied to automatically
transliterating Japanese words - originated from En-
glish - back to English. In our approach, we aim at
discovering similar correspondences between bilin-
gual data represented in the classes. The classes can
be used to assess how likely a bilingual sound corre-
spondence is.
3 Generation of two parallel Corpora
In this section, we describe the resources used for
our clustering algorithm. We take advantage of two
on-line bilingual orthographic dictionaries2 and the
monolingual pronunciation dictionaries (Baayen et
al., 1993) in CELEX to automatically build two bilin-
gual pronunciation dictionaries.
In a first step, we extract from the German-Dutch
orthographic dictionary 72,037 word pairs and from
the German-English dictionary 155,317. Figures 1
and 2 (1st table) display a fragment of the extracted
orthographic word pairs. Note that we only allow
one possible translation, namely the first one.
In a next step, we automatically look up the pro-
nunciation of the German, Dutch and English words
in the monolingual part of CELEX. A word pair is
considered for further analysis if the pronunciation
of both words is found in CELEX. For instance, the
first half of the word pair Hausflur-huisgang (cor-
ridor) does occur in the German part of CELEX but
the second half is not contained within the Dutch
part. Thus, this word pair is discarded. However, the
words Haus-huis-house are found in all three mono-
lingual pronunciation dictionaries and are used for
further analysis. Note that the transcription and syl-
labification of the words are defined in CELEX.
The result is a list of 44,415 transcribed German-
Dutch word pairs and a list of 63,297 transcribed
German-English word pairs. Figures 1 and 2 (2nd
table) show the result of the look-up procedure.
For instance, [?haus]3-[?hUIs] is the transcription of
Haus-huis in the German-Dutch dictionary, while

Figure 2: Creation of the German-English input: from the orthographic lexicon - the automatically tran-
scribed lexicon - the bilingual dictionary - to the final bilingual onset, nucleus and coda lists ( left to right)
[?haus]-[haUs] is the transcription of Haus-house in
the German-English part.
We aim at revealing phonological relationships
between German-Dutch and German-English word
pairs on the phonemic level, hence, we need some-
thing similar to an alignment procedure on the syl-
lable level. Thus, we first extract only those word
pairs which contain the same number of syllables.
The underlying assumption is that words with a his-
torically related stem often preserve their syllable
structure. The only exception is that we do not use
all inflectional paradigms of verbs to gain more data
because they are often a reason for uneven syllable
numbers (e.g., the past tense German suffix /tete/
is in Dutch /te/ or /de/). Hautarzt-huidarts would
be chosen both made up of two syllables; how-
ever, Hautarzt-dermatologist will be dismissed as
the German word consists of two syllables whereas
the English word comprises five syllables. Figures 1
and 2 (3rd table) show the remaining items after this
filtering process. We split each syllable within the
bilingual word lists into onset, nucleus and coda.
All consonants to the left of the vowel are consid-
ered the onset. The consonants to the right of the
vowel represent the coda. Empty onsets and codas
are replaced by the word [NOP]. After this process-
ing step, each word pair consists of the same number
of onsets, nuclei and codas.
The final step is to extract a list of German-Dutch
and German-English phoneme pairs. It is easy to ex-
tract the bilingual onset, nucleus and coda pairs from
the transcribed word pairs (fourth table of Figures 1
and 2). For instance, we extract the onset pair [h]-
[h], the nucleus pair [au]-[UI] and the coda pair [s]-[s]
from the German-Dutch word pair [?haus]-[?hUIs].
With the described method, we obtain from the re-
maining 21,212 German-Dutch and 13,067 German-
English words, 59,819 German-Dutch and 35,847
German-English onset, nucleus and coda pairs.
4 Phonological Clustering
In this section, we describe the unsupervised clus-
tering method used for clustering of phonological
units. Three- and five-dimensional EM-based clus-
tering has been applied to monolingual phonologi-
cal data (Mu?ller et al, 2000) and two-dimensional
clustering to syntax (Rooth et al, 1999). In our
approach, we apply two-dimensional clustering to
reveal classes of bilingual sound correspondences.
The method is well-known but the application of
probabilistic clustering to bilingual phonological
data allows a new view on bilingual phonological
35
processes. We choose EM-based clustering as we
need a technique which provides probabilities to
deal with noise in the training data. The two main
parts of EM-based clustering are (i) the induction
of a smooth probability model over the data, and (ii)
the automatic discovery of class structure in the data.
We aim to derive a probability distribution p(y) on
bilingual phonological units y from a large sample
(p(c) denotes the class probability, p(ysource|c) is
the probability of a phoneme of the source language
given class c, and p(ytarget|c) is the probability of a
phoneme of the target language given class c).
p(y) =
?
c?C
p(c) ? p(ysource|c) ? p(ytarget|c)
The re-estimation formulas are given in (Rooth et
al., 1999) and our training regime dealing with the
free parameters (e.g. the number of |c| of classes)
is described in Sections 4.1 and 4.2. The output of
our clustering algorithm are classes with their class
number, class probability and a list of class members
with their probabilities.
class 2 0.069
t 0.633
ts 0.144
s 0.055
t 0.764
d 0.128
The above table comes from our German-Dutch ex-
periments and shows Class # 2 with its probability of
6.9%, the German onsets in the left column (e.g., [t]
appears in this class with the probability of 63.3%,
[ts] with 14.4% and [s] with 5.5%) and the Dutch
onsets in the right column ([t] appears in this class
with the probability of 76.4% and [d] with 12.8%).
The examples presented in this paper are fragments
of the full classes showing only those units with the
highest probabilities.
4.1 Experiments with German-Dutch data
We use the 59,819 onset, nucleus and coda pairs
as training material for our unsupervised training.
Unsupervised methods require the variation of all
free parameters to search for the optimal model.
There are three different parameters which have to
be varied: the initial start parameters, the number
of classes and the number of re-estimation steps.
Thus, we experiment with 10 different start param-
eters, 6 different numbers of classes (5, 10, 15, 20,
25 and 304) and 20 steps of re-estimation. Our train-
ing regime yields 1,200 onset, 1,200 coda and 1,000
nucleus models.
4.2 Experiments with German-English data
Our training material is slightly smaller for German-
English than for German-Dutch. We derive 35,847
onset, nucleus and coda pairs for training. The re-
duced training set is due to the structure of words
which is less similar for German-English words than
for German-Dutch words leading to words with un-
equal syllable numbers. We used the same training
regime as in Section 4.1, yielding the same number
of models.
5 Similarity scores of the syllable parts
We apply our models to a translation task. The main
idea is to take a German phoneme and to predict the
most probable Dutch and English counterpart.
Hence, we extract 808 German-Dutch and 738
German-English cognate pairs from a cognate
database5, consisting of 836 entries. As for the train-
ing data, we extract those pairs that consist of the
same number of syllables because our current mod-
els are restricted to sound correspondences and do
not allow the deletion of syllables. We split our cor-
pus into two parts by putting the words with an even
line number in the development database and the
words with an uneven line number in the gold stan-
dard database. The development set and the gold
standard corpus consist of 404 transcribed words for
the German to Dutch translation task and of 369
transcribed words for the German to English trans-
lation task.
The task is then to predict the translation of Ger-
man onsets to Dutch onsets taken from German-
Dutch cognate pairs, e.g. the models should predict
from the German word durch ([dUrx]) (through), the
Dutch word door ([do:r]). If the phoneme correspon-
dence, [d]:[d], is predicted, the similarity score of the
onset model increases. The nucleus score increases
if the nucleus model predicts [U]:[o:] and the coda
score increases if the coda model predicts [rx]:[r].
We assess all our onset, nucleus and coda models
4We did not experiment with 30 classes for nucleus pairs as
there are fewer nucleus types than onset or coda types

by measuring the most probable phoneme transla-
tions of the cognates from our development set. We
choose the models with the highest onset, nucleus
and coda scores. Only the models with the highest
scores (for onset, nucleus and coda prediction) are
applied to the gold standard to avoid tuning to the
development set. Using this procedure shows how
our models perform on new data. We apply our scor-
ing procedure to both language pairs.
Table 1 shows the results of our best models by
measuring the onset, nucleus and coda translation
scores on our gold standard. The results point out
that the prediction of the onset is easier than predict-
ing the nucleus or the coda. We achieve an onset
similarity score of 80.7% for the German to Dutch
task and 69.6% for the German to English task. Al-
though the set of possible nuclei is smaller than the
set of onsets and codas, the prediction of the nuclei
is much harder. The nucleus similarity score de-
creases to 50.7% and to 17.1% for German-English
respectively. Codas seem to be slightly easier to pre-
dict than nuclei leading to a coda similarity score of
52.2% for German-Dutch and to 28.7% for German-
English.
The comparison of the similarity scores from the
translation tasks of the two language pairs indicates
that predicting the phonological correspondences
from German to Dutch is much easier than from
German to English. These results supply statistical
evidence that German is historically more closely re-
lated to Dutch than to English. We do not believe
that the difference in the similarity scores are due to
the different size of the training corpora but rather
to their closer relatedness. Revealing phonological
relationships between languages is possible simply
because the noisy training data comprise enough re-
lated words to learn from them the similar structure
of the languages on the syllable-part level.

6 Evaluation: Interpretation of the Classes
In this section, we interpret our classes by manu-
ally identifying classes that show typical similari-
ties between the two language pairs. Sometimes, the
classes reflect sound changes in historically related
stems. Our data is synchronic, and thus it is not pos-
sible to directly identify in our classes which sound
changes took place (Modern German (G), Modern
English (E) and Modern Dutch (NL) did not de-
velop from each other but from a common ances-
tor). However, we will try to connect the data to an-
cient languages such as Old High German (OHG),
Middle High German (MHG), Old English (OE),
Middle Dutch (MNL), Old Dutch (ONL), Proto or
West Germanic (PG, WG). Naturally, we can only
go back in history as far as it is possible according
to the information provided by the following litera-
ture: For Dutch, we use de Vries (1997) and the on-
line version of Philippa et al (2004), for English, an
etymological dictionary (Harper, 2001) and for Ger-
man, Burch et al (1998). We find that certain his-
toric sound changes took place regularly, and thus,
the results of these changes can be rediscovered in
our synchronic classes. Figure 3 shows the historic
relationship between the three languages. A poten-
tial learner of a related language does not have to
be aware of the historic links between languages but
he/she can implicitly exploit the similarities such as
the ones discovered in the classes.
The relationship of words from different lan-
guages can be caused by different processes: some
words are simply borrowed from another language
and adapted to a new language. Papagei-papegaai
37
(parrot) is borrowed from Arabic and adapted to
German and Dutch phonetics, where the /g/ is pro-
nounced in German as a voiced velar plosive and in
Dutch as an unvoiced velar fricative.
Other language changes are due to phonology;
e.g., the Old English word [mus] (PG: muHs) was
subject to diphthongization and changed to mouse
([maUs]) in Modern English. A similar process
took place in German and Dutch, where the same
word changed to the German word Maus (MHG:
mu?s) and to the Dutch word muis (MNL: muus).
On the synchronic level, we find [au] and [aU] in
the same class of a German-English model and [au]
and [UI] in a German-Dutch model. There are also
other phonological processes which apply to the nu-
clei, such as monophthongization, raising, lower-
ing, backing and fronting. Other phonological pro-
cesses can be observed in conjunction with conso-
nants, such as assimilation, dissimilation, deletion
and insertion. Some of the above mentioned phono-
logical processes are the underlying processes of the
subsequent described classes.
6.1 German-Dutch classes
According to our similarity scores presented in Sec-
tion 5, the best onset model comprises 30 classes,
the nucleus model 25 classes and the coda model 30
classes. We manually search for classes, which show
interesting sound correspondences.

The German part of class # 20 reflects Grimm?s first
law which states that a West Germanic [p] is often
realized as a [pf] in German. The underlying phono-
logical process is that sounds are inserted in a cer-
tain context. The onsets of the Middle High Ger-
man words phat (E: path) and phert (E: horse, L:
paravere?redus) became the affricate [pf] in Modern
German. In contrast to German, Dutch preserved
the simple onsets from the original word form, as
in paard (E: horse, MNL: peert) and pad (E: path,
MNL: pat).

Class # 25 represents a class where the Dutch onsets
are more complex than the onsets in German. From
the Old High German word sca?f (E: sheep) the onset
/sc/ is assimilated in Modern German to [S] whereas
the Dutch onset [sx] preserves the complex conso-
nant cluster from the West Germanic word sk?pan
(E: sheep, MNL: scaep).

We find in Class # 4 a lowering process. The Ger-
man short high back vowel /U/ can be often trans-
formed to the Dutch low back vowel /O/. The un-
derlying processes are that the Dutch vowel is some-
times lowered from /i/ to /O/; e.g., the Dutch word
gezond (E: healthy, MNL: ghesont, WG: gezwind)
comes from the West Germanic word gezwind. In
Modern German, the same word changed to gesund
(OHG: gisunt).

Class # 14 represents codas where plural and infini-
tive suffixes /en/, as in Menschen-mensen (E: hu-
mans) or laufen-lopen (E: to run), are reduced to a
Schwa [@] in Dutch and thus appear in this class
with an empty coda [NOP]. It also shows that cer-
tain German codas are assimilated by the alveolar
sounds /d/ and /s/ from the original bilabial [m] to an
apico-alveolar [n], as in Boden (E: ground, MHG:
bodem) or in Besen (E: broom, MHG: be?sem, OHG:
pe?samo). In Dutch, the words bodem (E: ground,
MNL: bo?dem, Greek: puthme?n), and bezem (E:
broom, MNL: be?sem, WG: besman) kept the /m/.

Class # 23 comprises complex German codas which
are less complex in Dutch. In the German word
Arzt (E: doctor, MHG: arza?t), the complex coda [tst]
emerges. However in Modern Dutch, arts came
from MNL arst or arsate (Latin: archia?ter). We can
also find the rule that German codas [Nst] of a 2nd
person singular form of a verb are reduced to [Nt] in
Dutch as in bringst-brengt (E: bring).
6.2 German-English classes
The best German-English models contain 30 onset
classes, 20 nucleus classes, and 10 coda classes.
Our German-English models are noisier than the
German-Dutch ones, which again points at the
closer relation between the German and Dutch lex-
icon. However, when we analyze the 30 on-
set classes, we find meaningful processes as for
German-Dutch.

Class # 23 shows that a complex German onset [Spr]
preserves the consonant cluster, as in sprechen (E:
to speak, OHG: sprehhan, PG: sprekanan). Modern
English, however, deleted the /r/ to [sp], as in speak
(OE: sprecan). Another regularity can be found: the
palato-alveolar [S] in the German onset [Sp] is re-
alized in English as the alveolar [s] in [sp]. Both
the German word spinnen and the English word spin
come from spinnan (OHG, OE).

Class # 3 displays the rule that in many loan words,
the onset /c/ is realized in German as [ts] and in En-
glish as [s] in Akzent-accent (Latin: accentus).

In some loan words, we find that an original /u/ or /o/
becomes in German the long vowel [o:] and in En-
glish the diphthong [@U], as in Sofa-sofa (Arabic:
suffah) or in Foto-photo (Latin: Phosphorus). The
diphthongization in English usually applies to open
syllables with the nucleus /o/, as shown in class # 8.
6.2.3 Coda classes
Class # 6 displays the present participle suffix /end/,
which is realized in English as /ing/ (OE: -ende), as
in backend-baking.

7 Discussion
We automatically generated two bilingual phono-
logical corpora. The data is classified by using
an EM-based clustering algorithm which is new in
that respect that this method is applied to bilin-
gual onset, nucleus and coda corpora. The method
provides a probability model over bilingual sylla-
ble parts which is exploited to measure the similar-
ity between the language pairs German-Dutch and
German-English. The method is able to generalize
from the data and reduces the noise introduced by
the automatic generation process. Highly probable
sound correspondences appear in very likely classes
with a high probability whereas unlikely sound cor-
respondences receive lower probabilities.
Our approach differs from other approaches either
in the method used or in the different linguistic task.
Cahill and Tiberius (2002) is based on mere counts
of phoneme correspondences; Kondrak (2003) gen-
erates Algonquian phoneme correspondences which
are possible according to his translation models;
Kondrak (2004) measures if two words are possi-
ble cognates; and Knight and Graehl (1998) focus
on the back-transliteration of Japanese words to En-
glish. Thus, we regard our approach as a thematic
complement and not as an overlap to former ap-
proaches.
The presented approach depends on the available
resources. That means that we can only learn those
phoneme correspondences which are represented in
the bilingual data. Thus, metathesis which applies to
onsets and codas can not be directly observed as the
syllable parts are modeled separately. In the Dutch
word borst (ONL: bructe), the /r/ shifted from the
onset to the coda whereas in English and German
(breast-Brust), it remained in the onset. We are also
39
dependent on the CELEX builders, who followed dif-
ferent transcription strategies for the German and
Dutch parts. For instance, elisions occur in the
Dutch lexicon but not in the German part. The coda
consonant /t/ in lucht (air) disappears in the Dutch
word luchtdruk (E: air pressure), [?lUG][drUk], but
not in the German word Luftdruck, [lUft][drUk].
We assume that the similarity scores of the sylla-
ble parts might be sharpened by increasing the size
of the databases. A first possibility is to take the
first transcribed translation and not the first transla-
tion in general. As often the first translation is not
contained in the pronunciation dictionary.
Our current data generation process also in-
troduces unrelated word pairs such as Haut-skin
([haut]-[skIn]). However, it is very unlikely that re-
lated words do not include similar phonemes. Thus,
this word pair should be excluded. Exploiting this
knowledge could lead to cleaner input data.
8 Conclusions and Future Work
We presented a method to automatically build bilin-
gual pronunciation dictionaries that can be used to
reveal phonological similarities between related lan-
guages. In general, our similarity scores show that
the lexicons of German and Dutch are closer related
than German and English. Beside the findings about
the relatedness between the two language pairs, we
think that the classes might be useful for language
learning. An interesting point for future work is to
apply the methods developed for the identification
of cognates to our bilingual word-lists. Beyond the
increase in data, a great challenge is to develop mod-
els that can express sound changes on the diachronic
level adumbrated in Section 6. We also believe that
a slightly modified version of our method can be ap-
plied to other related language pairs by using the
transcription of morphemes.
