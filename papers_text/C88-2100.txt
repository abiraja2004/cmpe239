descriptions, prouominalizalion arid ellipsis did not ~wx:oiae acutely im- 
l?l~mt. 
3 Why is it a difficult task? 
Dextral choice is not a stl~ightlb~ward task, Snppase we hay.': to express 
ill F, nglJsh the meaning 'a person whose sex is lUnle aud wh(}t;c affc is 
between 13 and 15 years.' What knowledge do people use in order to 
come up with an appropriate choice out of such candidate realizations 
as those listed in (1). 
(1) boy, kid, teenager, youth, child, young man, schoolboy, adoles- 
cent, man, 
Without a sentential context file choice, based on eloseuess of i|t~ 
nmauing match and genendity of meaning, should t~e boy. I;or a coul- 
puter program to tm capable of making choices like this, ii Ilas to 
possess a preferenee-assigding capability on the nmtches betweetl tht: 
meaniugs of tile cattdidate l xical l~aliTatkm on the one hand aud tilt', 
input meaning unit (see the discussion of thc matching lUCtlic below). 
3A Collocations 
Lcxical choices am, however, tylfically made in centext. Conlextual 
rclations anloug lcxical units reflect lueauiflg.-iudilced consiraillts ori 
eamccarfence (selectional ~estrictions: admire utkes a human subject). 
Sometimes, however, it is difficult to formulate a cot~:cnrrencc C()ll- 
straint ill terms of selectional rcslriclions alone. Ttnls, 10r cxanqfie, 
tile causative construction wilh the English inJhzence requires eae, t; ils 
Russian equivalent vlijanie requires okazyvat', aed the \]alter is not a 
Rnssian correlate of exert other Itmn ill the above and very R'.w similar 
syntagmatic conslructions. Why do wc use, in Euglish, shed with iea,'s 
or leaves but don't usuaUy say shed water out era bucket or they drop 
tear,*" every time when <...>? Snch properties o f  the lexical sleek of 
a natural anguage ate called eolloeational. We will now ilhlsi~tte, Ihe 
c~meept of collouation through several examples, 
Cousidcr thc conceptual Old,rater of a large quantity of, a (relative) 
value liar measuring quantities (of materMs, lknccs, qualities, properties, 
etc.). It is realized in Euglish in sorer&race with collocational propm'ties 
of the lexical units that arc ascxl its its ope.lands. Not every quantity goes 
with every realization of the above opeaattm Members of ~hc set <big, 
enormous, great, high, large, strong, wide> of potential realb,~ltions 
of a large quantity of call reoccur with every of file members of the 
set <amount, difficulty, expanse, selection, voltage> of quantities. We 
say high voltage but a large amount. It wouhl lx~ inapprollriate liar 
a generation system to produce someflfing like high selection or large 
dif3eulty. (Note that in parsing the problem of assigning a similar 
senatntk: marker to all file various expressions from tile e.x~allpl(,; C~tU~ 
in priuciple, be. tackled through a mechanism of metaplt(w pnmcssing 
(e.g., Cat'boneR, 1987), whereby a geueral heuristic rule is dcw;luped 
for processing metaphorical input belouging a single class, such as, for 
instance, a large quantity of... - see Lakoff and Johnson, 1980, 10r an 
extensive listing of potential metaphor classes; in generalion, however, 
the task is the opposite - to produce llucnt nmtaphorical lauguuge. 
Since this depends not on regularities of meaning, but mthcJ on the 
idiosyncrasies of nteaniug realization in the varlons natural angtmges, 
the general rules will be more difficalt to come by and furumlate,) 
An additional class of collocations are the paradigmalic ollocao 
lions. "these am best exemplified by the 'set-complement' collocaliuns 
such as the English left and right or parents and chiMren. 'l~le knowi. 
edge of these collocations, for instauee, simplifies the proccss of lcxical 
selection of conjoined constructions, uch as ladies and gemlemen. 
Colloeatioual relatious are defined on lexical ualls, not meaning 
~'epresentadons. The study of collocations asceuds to Firdi (195 It; it i:, 
4 711 
a central part of the Meaning - Text school of linguistics - - -  cf. Mel'~uk, 
19'14; 1981. 'll,e importance of collocational propelzies in generations 
has been recognized (cf. Cummiug, 1986), bat relatively few systems 
actually include collocational information in their decision processes. 
3.2 ElLipsis and  Anaphora  
Certain contexts completely alleviate the problem of open-class lexical 
selection. Consider the following (gloss of an) input segment: 
(2) Clause1:BuyOohn3 book7), time|, focus: book7 
Clause2:Bring(John3 book7 office~), belong-to(office~ John3), 
time2: time~ > timeh focus: office| 
Clause3:Read(John3 hook7), aspect: inchoative, time: after(timez) 
One of the adequate ways of realizing it is: 
(3) John bought a book. He brought this book to his office and 
started to read it. 
Ttiefe are seven instances of the three object-type concepts in the 
case-role slots of the input propositions above. Each of the three con- 
cepts is realized lexically only once. In two cases these meanings 
were realized through prononlinalization and in one each through def- 
inite description and ar| elliptic'/ construction. This example shows 
that non-lexical realization is an integral part of the process of lexical 
selection m generation. 
In what fellows we briefly describe the system architecture,, the 
knowledge structures and the algorithm we use for selecting open-class 
lexical items in generation. 
4 The System and the Knowledge 
DIOGF.NI~S is a dislributed natural language generation system featuring 
a blackboard-type control structure. The processing in it is concerto 
teated in the knowledge sources which are triggered by the state of 
the various blackboards. The latter contain the input to generation as 
well as all intermediate and final results of DIOGEN&S operation, rep- 
resented uniformly in a frame-o|icoted knowledge representation lan- 
guage. Background knowledge in 9\[OG~qES includes the following 
components relevant to the task of lexical selection: 
a concept lexicon, a set of knowledge structures that describe ob- 
ject ,qnd eveut-types in the (sub)world of the texts to be generated 
(the fn'st application of DIOG~'qES is; for example, in the domain 
of computer hardware maan~ds) 
o a generation lexicon that F,~ks (sub)world concepts (or, more 
accurately, their instances) with particular lexical units of the 
target Danguage. 
The above description is necessarily incomplete. See Nkanhurg, 
1997 for an extensive specification of all the facets of DIOGrlNES. 
'll,e implementation vehicles for DIOGENRS ate, the Fraraekit lmowl- 
'edge representation hmgaage (Carbonell and Joseph, 1985) and CMU 
CommonLisp running on an IBM PC RT. 
Sample eoueept lexicon entries are illustrated in Figure 1. The figure 
shows a screen of the knowledge acquisition and main~nance system, 
called ONTOS (Nireuburg et al 1988), which we use for a~quiring 
and mah~taining the lexicons. The figure shows a partial view of the 
concept network and three concept lexicon frame, s cow,responding to the 
concepts of research-workstation, memory and disk.

40~ The (~e~crat ion  Lex icon  
The main static knowledge source for generating of open-class items 
is a specialized generation lexicon (GL). The structure of an entry i .  
the g~neral\]ou lexicon in DIOGENES is shown in Figure 2 (the BNF is 
incomplete wherever obvions): 
The importance value serves to ~stingulsh the sal~ney of the var- 
ious relations for the idenfl~ of the entry head. Thus, f~  iustance; 
generating youth instead of boy seems to be less a deviation than gen- 
erating gld. Th~ is why the importance of the sex slot in the example 
below is grea~r than that of the age s~t

5 The Algorithm 
in the DIOGENES generator art inslar~tiation f a head-selecfing knowl.- 
edge source is triggered simultaneously forevery event ,and role instance 
in the input representation. The results of their operafiou are posted to a 
public blackboard, so that ail knowledge source instances can draw on 
Ihis knowledge in their own decisiou processes. The knowledge sources 
responsible for selecting modifiers are triggered when the heads of their 
phrases have already been selected. 
Figut~ 3 illustrates dm algorithm tora single lexical selection (head 
or modifier) knowledge source. If an input frame was already menlo 
tonext in the input, the question arises whether it should be realized 
non-lcxically, that is, using deictic means (this is the case with the seco 
ond appeanmce of John in (2)). If so, a proper realization must be, 
found and posted on the corresponding blackboard. If this process fails 
at arty point, We revert o the 'regular' case of lexical realization. This 
latter consists, first of all, in scanning the generation lexicon in semeh 
of a set of candidate r alizations for the input frame. (1) is an example 
of such a set. When such a set is produced, we attempt to filter it 
by removhlg those candidates that are not compatible with realizations 
already decided upon for other input fi'ames in the same sentence. This 
processing is based on comparing the collocation infonnation in the 
lexicon entries for the members of various candidate realization seLq. 
F~r example, if a neighbor frame has already been realizexl as demon- 
strator, then the collocational intbrmation will filter out all mcmlxa's 
of (1) but youth, teenager, man. If the residual set has cardinality one, 
we post the result. Otherwise - -  as in the case when no collocationnl 
intbrmatkm cnn be used - -  we pmcexxl to select he ~v~aliz~tion based 
solely on the entries in the cnndidate r alization set (ttmt is, without he

heaefit of a context). This routine uses a well-defined inexact'matching 
metric that e~deulates distances between the meaning of the input franle 
and the raea,fings of the lexieai units in the candidate realizution set. 
The closest meaning is then selected and posted. 
6 Stattas and Future Work 
The blackboard architecture and the inexact meaning matching mod- 
ule luts been implemented; the collocation treatment module has also 
been implemented, but extensive testing has not been performed ue 
to the lack of a lm.ge-seale l xicon. The anaphora treatment module 
has been implemented for pronominalization ly, and the nnmber of 
pronominali,~ation rules employed has to be and will be increased. 
It is chair that the acquisition of the generation lexicon is a major 
and extremely abor-intensive task in natural language genelution. The 
acquisition of this dictionary, especially of the colloeafional information 
cannot at present be done automatically. But the efficiency of the team 
of human lcxicograplters working on this problem can be increased 
dramatically through the use of specialized intelligent interactive aids. 
We have developed one such Knowledge Base Maintenance System 
(el. Nirenbtwg et al, 1987) for rite acquisition of concept lexicons and 
will extend it so that it becomes applicable to the task of acquiring 
genernlJon ~exicons as well.
