Abstract
The paper presents a semi-automatic approach
to creating sentiment dictionaries in many lan-
guages. We first produced high-level gold-
standard sentiment dictionaries for two lan-
guages and then translated them automatically
into third languages. Those words that can
be found in both target language word lists
are likely to be useful because their word
senses are likely to be similar to that of the
two source languages. These dictionaries can
be further corrected, extended and improved.
In this paper, we present results that verify
our triangulation hypothesis, by evaluating tri-
angulated lists and comparing them to non-
triangulated machine-translated word lists.
1 Introduction
When developing software applications for senti-
ment analysis or opinion mining, there are basi-
cally two main options: (1) writing rules that assign
sentiment values to text or text parts (e.g. names,
products, product features), typically making use of
dictionaries consisting of sentiment words and their
positive or negative values, and (2) inferring rules
(and sentiment dictionaries), e.g. using machine
learning techniques, from previously annotated doc-
uments such as product reviews annotated with an
overall judgment of the product. While movie or
product reviews for many languages can frequently
be found online, sentiment-annotated data for other
fields are not usually available, or they are almost
exclusively available for English. Sentiment dictio-
naries are also mostly available for English only or,
if they exist for other languages, they are not com-
parable, in the sense that they have been developed
for different purposes, have different sizes, are based
on different definitions of what sentiment or opinion
means.
In this paper, we are addressing the resource bot-
tleneck for sentiment dictionaries, by developing
highly multilingual and comparable sentiment dic-
tionaries having similar sizes and based on a com-
mon specification. The aim is to develop such dic-
tionaries, consisting of typically one or two thou-
sand words, for tens of languages, although in this
paper we only present results for eight languages
(English, Spanish, Arabic, Czech, French, German,
Italian and Russian). The task raises the obvious
question how the human effort of producing this re-
source can be minimized. Simple translation, be it
using standard dictionaries or using machine trans-
lation, is not very efficient as most words have two,
five or ten different possible translations, depending
on context, part-of-speech, etc.
The approach we therefore chose is that of trian-
gulation. We first produced high-level gold-standard
sentiment dictionaries for two languages (English
and Spanish) and then translated them automatically
into third languages, e.g. French. Those words that
can be found in both target language word lists (En
Fr and Es Fr) are likely to be useful because their
word senses are likely to be similar to that of the
two source languages. These word lists can then be
used as they are or better they can be corrected, ex-
tended and improved. In this paper, we present eval-
uation results verifying our triangulation hypothesis,
by evaluating triangulated lists and comparing them
28
to non-triangulated machine-translated word lists.
Two further issues need to be addressed. The
first one concerns morphological inflection. Auto-
matic translation will yield one word form (often,
but not always the base form), which is not suffi-
cient when working with highly inflected languages:
A single English adjective typically has four Spanish
or Italian word forms (two each for gender and for
number) and many Russian word forms (due to gen-
der, number and case distinctions). The target lan-
guage word lists thus need to be expanded to cover
all these morphological variants with minimal effort
and considering the number of different languages
involved without using software, such as morpho-
logical analysers or generators. The second issue
has to do with the subjectivity involved in the human
annotation and evaluation effort. First of all, it is im-
portant that the task is well-defined (this is a chal-
lenge by itself) and, secondly, the inter-annotator
agreement for pairs of human evaluators working on
different languages has to be checked in order to get
an idea of the natural variation involved in such a
highly subjective task.
Our main field of interest is news opinion min-
ing. We would like to answer the question how cer-
tain entities (persons, organisations, event names,
programmes) are discussed in different media over
time, comparing different media sources, media in
different countries, and media written in different
languages. One possible end product would be a
graph showing how the popularity of a certain en-
tity has changed over time across different languages
and countries. News differs significantly from those
text types that are typically analysed in opinion min-
ing work, i.e. product or movie reviews: While a
product review is about a product (e.g. a printer)
and its features (e.g. speed, price or printing qual-
ity), the news is about any possible subject (news
content), which can by itself be perceived to be pos-
itive or negative. Entities mentioned in the news can
have many different roles in the events described.
If the method does not specifically separate positive
or negative news content from positive or negative
opinion about that entity, the sentiment analysis re-
sults will be strongly influenced by the news context.
For instance, the automatically identified sentiment
towards a politician would most likely to be low if
the politician is mentioned in the context of nega-
tive news content such as bombings or disasters. In
our approach, we therefore aim to distinguish news
content from sentiment values, and this distinction
has an impact on the sentiment dictionaries: unlike
in other approaches, words like death, killing, award
or winner are purposefully not included in the sen-
timent dictionaries as they typically represent news
content.
The rest of the paper is structured as follows: the
next section (2) describes related work, especially
in the context of creating sentiment resources. Sec-
tion 3 gives an overview of our approach to dic-
tionary creation, ranging from the automatic learn-
ing of the sentiment vocabulary, the triangulation
process, the expansion of the dictionaries in size
and regarding morphological inflections. Section 4
presents a number of results regarding dictionary
creation using simple translation versus triangula-
tion, morphological expansion and inter-annotator
agreement. Section 5 summarises, concludes and
points to future work.
2 Related Work
Most of the work in obtaining subjectivity lexicons
was done for English. However, there were some
authors who developed methods for the mapping of
subjectivity lexicons to other languages. Kim and
Hovy (2006) use a machine translation system and
subsequently use a subjectivity analysis system that
was developed for English. Mihalcea et al (2007)
propose a method to learn multilingual subjective
language via cross-language projections. They use
the Opinion Finder lexicon (Wilson et al, 2005)
and two bilingual English-Romanian dictionaries to
translate the words in the lexicon. Since word am-
biguity can appear (Opinion Finder does not mark
word senses), they filter as correct translations only
the most frequent words. The problem of translat-
ing multi-word expressions is solved by translating
word-by-word and filtering those translations that
occur at least three times on the Web. Another ap-
proach in obtaining subjectivity lexicons for other
languages than English was explored in Banea et al
(2008b). To this aim, the authors perform three dif-
ferent experiments, with good results. In the first
one, they automatically translate the annotations of
the MPQA corpus and thus obtain subjectivity an-
29
notated sentences in Romanian. In the second ap-
proach, they use the automatically translated entries
in the Opinion Finder lexicon to annotate a set of
sentences in Romanian. In the last experiment, they
reverse the direction of translation and verify the as-
sumption that subjective language can be translated
and thus new subjectivity lexicons can be obtained
for languages with no such resources. Finally, an-
other approach to building lexicons for languages
with scarce resources is presented in Banea et al
(2008a). In this research, the authors apply boot-
strapping to build a subjectivity lexicon for Roma-
nian, starting with a set of seed subjective entries,
using electronic bilingual dictionaries and a training
set of words. They start with a set of 60 words per-
taining to the categories of noun, verb, adjective and
adverb obtained by translating words in the Opin-
ion Finder lexicon. Translations are filtered using a
measure of similarity to the original words, based on
Latent Semantic Analysis (Landauer and Dumais,
1997) scores. Wan (2008) uses co-training to clas-
sify un-annotated Chinese reviews using a corpus
of annotated English reviews. He first translates
the English reviews into Chinese and subsequently
back to English. He then performs co-training using
all generated corpora. Banea et al (2010) translate
the MPQA corpus into five other languages (some
with a similar ethimology, others with a very differ-
ent structure). Subsequently, they expand the fea-
ture space used in a Naive Bayes classifier using the
same data translated to 2 or 3 other languages. Their
conclusion is that expanding the feature space with
data from other languages performs almost as well
as training a classifier for just one language on a
large set of training data.
3 Approach Overview
Our approach to dictionary creation starts with semi-
automatic way of colleting subjective terms in En-
glish and Spanish. These pivot language dictionaries
are then projected to other languages. The 3rd lan-
guage dictionaries are formed by the overlap of the
translations (triangulation). The lists are then man-
ually filtered and expanded, either by other relevant
terms or by their morphological variants, to gain a
wider coverage.
3.1 Gathering Subjective Terms
We started with analysing the available English
dictionaries of subjective terms: General Inquirer
(Stone et al, 1966), WordNet Affect (Strapparava
and Valitutti, 2004), SentiWordNet (Esuli and Se-
bastiani, 2006), MicroWNOp (Cerini et al, 2007).
Additionally, we used the resource of opinion words
with associated polarity from Balahur et al (2009),
which we denote as JRC Tonality Dictionary. The
positive effect of distinguishing two levels of inten-
sity was shown in (Balahur et al, 2010). We fol-
lowed the idea and each of the emloyed resources
was mapped to four categories: positive, negative,
highly positive and highly negative. We also got
inspired by the results reported in that paper and
we selected as the base dictionaries the combination
of MicroWNOp and JRC Tonality Dictionary which
gave the best results. Terms in those two dictionar-
ies were manually filtered and the other dictionar-
ies were used as lists of candidates (their highly fre-
quent terms were judged and the relevant ones were
included in the final English dictionary). Keeping in
mind the application of the dictionaries we removed
at this step terms that are more likely to describe bad
or good news content, rather than a sentiment to-
wards an entity. In addition, we manually collected
English diminishers (e.g. less or approximately), in-
tensifiers (e.g. very or indeed) and invertors (e.g.
not or barely). The English terms were translated to
Spanish and the same filtering was performed. We
extended all English and Spanish lists with the miss-
ing morphological variants of the terms.
3.2 Automatic Learning of Subjective Terms
We decided to expand our subjective term lists by
using automatic term extraction, inspired by (Riloff
and Wiebe, 2003). We look at the problem of ac-
quisition of subjective terms as learning of seman-
tic classes. Since we wanted to do this for two dif-
ferent languages, namely English and Spanish, the
multilingual term extraction algorithm Ontopopulis
(Tanev et al, 2010) was a natural choice.
Ontopopulis performs weakly supervised learning
of semantic dictionaries using distributional similar-
ity. The algorithm takes on its input a small set of
seed terms for each semantic class, which is to be
learnt, and an unannotated text corpus. For example,
30
if we want to learn the semantic class land vehicles,
we can use the seed set - bus, truck, and car. Then
it searches for the terms in the corpus and finds lin-
ear context patterns, which tend to co-occur imme-
diately before or after these terms. Some of the
highest-scored patterns, which Ontopopulis learned
about land vehicles were driver of the X, X was
parked, collided with another X, etc. Finally, the
algorithm searches for these context patterns in the
corpus and finds other terms which tend to fill the
slot of the patterns (designated by X). Considering
the land vehicles example, new terms which the sys-
tem learned were van, lorry, taxi, etc. Ontopop-
ulis is similar to the NOMEN algorithm (Lin et al,
2003). However, Ontopopulis has the advantage to
be language-independent, since it does not use any
form of language-specific processing, nor does it use
any language-specific resources, apart from a stop
word list.
In order to learn new subjective terms for each
of the languages, we passed the collected subjective
terms as an input to Ontopopulis. For English, we
divided the seed set in two classes: class A ? verbs
and class B ? nouns and adjectives. It was necessary
because each of these classes has a different syn-
tactic behaviour. It made sense to do the same for
Spanish, but we did not have enough Spanish speak-
ers available to undertake this task, therefore we put
together all the subjective Spanish words - verbs, ad-
jectives and nouns in one class. We ran Ontopopulis
for each of the three classes - the class of subjective
Spanish words and the English classes A and B. The
top scored 200 new learnt terms were taken for each
class and manually reviewed.
3.3 Triangulation and Expansion
After polishing the pivot language dictionaries we
projected them to other languages. The dictionaries
were translated by Google translator because of its
broad coverage of languages. The overlapping terms
between English and Spanish translations formed
the basis for further manual efforts. In some cases
there were overlapping terms in English and Span-
ish translations but they differed in intensity. There
was the same term translated from an English posi-
tive term and from a Spanish very positive term. In
these cases the term was assigned to the positive cat-
egory. However, more problematic cases arose when
the same 3rd language term was assigned to more
than one category. There were also cases with dif-
ferent polarity. We had to review them manually.
However, there were still lots of relevant terms in the
translated lists which were not translated from the
other language. These complement terms are a good
basis for extending the coverage of the dictionaries,
however, they need to be reviewed manually. Even if
we tried to include in the pivot lists all morpholog-
ical variants, in the triangulation output there were
only a few variants, mainly in the case of highly in-
flected languages. To deal with morphology we in-
troduced wild cards at the end of the term stem (*
stands for whatever ending and for whatever char-
acter). This step had to be performed carefully be-
cause some noise could be introduced. See the Re-
sults section for examples. Although this step was
performed by a human, we checked the most fre-
quent terms afterwards to avoid irrelavant frequent
terms.
4 Results
4.1 Pivot dictionaries
We gathered and filtered English sentiment terms
from the available corpora (see Section 3.1). The
dictionaries were then translated to Spanish (by
Google translator) and filtered afterwards. By ap-
plying automatic term extraction, we enriched the
sets of terms by 54 for English and 85 for Spanish,
after evaluating the top 200 candidates suggested by
the Ontopolulis tool for each language. The results
are encouraging, despite the relevance of the terms
(27% for English and 42.5% for Spanish where
some missing morphological variants were discov-
ered) does not seem to be very high, considering the
fact that we excluded the terms already contained
in the pivot lists. If we took them into account, the
precision would be much better. The initial step re-
sulted in obtaining high quality pivot sentiment dic-
tionaries for English and Spanish. Their statistics
are in table 1. We gathered more English terms than
Spanish (2.4k compared to 1.7k). The reason for
that is that some translations from English to Span-
ish have been filtered. Another observation is that
there is approximately the same number of negative
terms as positive ones, however, much more highly
negative than highly positive terms. Although the

frequency analysis we carried out later showed that
even if there are fewer highly positive terms, they are
more frequent than the highly negative ones, which
results in almost uniform distribution.
4.2 Triangulation and Expansion
After running triangulation to other languages the
resulted terms were judged for relevance. Native
speakers could suggest to change term?s category
(e.g. negative to highly negative) or to remove it.
There were several reasons why the terms could
have been marked as ?non-sentiment?. For instance,
the term could tend to describe rather negative news
content than negative sentiment towards an entity
(e.g. dead, quake). In other cases the terms were
too ambiguous in a particular language. Examples
from English are: like or right.
Table 2 shows the quality of the triangulated dic-
tionaries. In all cases except for Italian we had only
one annotator assessing the quality. We can see that
the terms were correct in around 90% cases, how-
ever, it was a little bit worse in the case of Russian
in which the annotator suggested to change category
very often.
Terms translated from English but not from Span-
ish are less reliable but, if reviewed manually, the
dictionaries can be expanded significantly. Table 3
gives the statistics concerning these judgments. We
can see that their correctness is much lower than in
the case of the triangulated terms - the best in Italian
(54.4%) and the worst in Czech (30.7%). Of course,
the translation performance affects the results here.
However, this step extended the dictionaries by ap-
proximately 50%.
When considering terms out of context, the most
common translation error occurs when the original
word has several meanings. For instance, the En-
glish word nobility refers to the social class of no-
bles, as well as to the quality of being morally good.
In the news context we find this word mostly in the
second meaning. However, in the Russian triangu-
lated list we have found dvoryanstvo , which refers
to a social class in Russian. Likewise, we need to
keep in mind that a translation of a monosemantic
word might result polysemantic in the target lan-
guage, thereby leading to confusion. For example,
the Italian translation of the English word champion
campione is more frequently used in Italian news
context in a different meaning - sample, therefore
we must delete it from our sentiment words list for
Italian. Another difficulty we might encounter es-
pecially when dealing with inflectional languages is
the fact that a translation of a certain word might be
homographic with another word form in the target
language. Consider the English negative word ban-
dit and its Italian translation bandito, which is more
frequently used as a form of the verb bandire (to an-
nounce) in the news context. Also each annotator
had different point of view on classifying the bor-
derline cases (e.g. support, agreement or difficult).
Two main reasons are offered to explain the low
performance in Arabic. On the one hand, it seems
that some Google translation errors will be repeated
in different languages if the translated words have
the same etymological root. For example both words
? the English fresh and the Spanish fresca ? are
translated to the Arabic as YK
Yg. meaning new. The
Other reason is a more subtle one and is related to
the fact that Arabic words are not vocalized and to
the way an annotator perceive the meaning of a given
word in isolation. To illustrate this point, consider
the Arabic word ? J. ?A
	
J ?? @ , which could be used
as an adjective, meaning appropriate, or as a noun,
meaning The occasion. It appears that the annotator
would intuitively perceive the word in isolation as a
noun and not as an adjective, which leads to disre-
garding the evaluative aspects of a given word.
We tried to include in the pivot dictionaries all
morphological variants of the terms. However, in
highly inflected languages there are much more vari-
ants than those translated from English or Spanish.
32
We manually introduced wild cards to capture the
variants. We had to be attentive when compiling
wild cards for languages with a rich inflectional sys-
tem, as we might easily get undesirable words in the
output. To illustrate this, consider the third person
plural of the Italian negative word perdere (to lose)
perdono, which is also homographic with the word
meaning forgiveness in English. Naturally, it could
happen that the wildcard captures a non-sentiment
term or even a term with a different polarity. For in-
stance, the pattern care% would capture either care,
careful, carefully, but also career or careless. That
is way we perform the last manual checking after
matching the lists expanded by wildcards against a
large number of texts. The annotators were unable
to check all the variants, but only the most frequent
terms, which resulted in reviewing 70-80% of the
term mentions. This step has been performed for
only English, Czech and Russian so far. Table 5
gives the statistics. By introducing the wildcards,
the number of distinct terms grew up significantly
- 12x for Czech, 15x for Russian and 4x for En-
glish. One reason why it went up also for English
is that we captured compounds like: well-arranged,
well-balanced, well-behaved, well-chosen by a sin-
gle pattern. Another reason is that a single pat-
tern can capture different POSs: beaut% can cap-
ture beauty, beautiful, beautifully or beautify. Not
all of those words were present in the pivot dictio-
naries. For dangerous cases like care% above we
had to rather list all possible variants than using a
wildcard. This is also the reason why the number
of patterns is not much lower than the number of
initial terms. Even if this task was done manually,
some noise was added into the dictionaries (92-94%
of checked terms were correct). For example, highly
positive pattern hero% was introduced by an anno-
tator for capturing hero, heroes, heroic, heroical or
heroism. If not checked afterwards heroin would
score highly positively in the sentiment system. An-
other example is taken from Russian: word meaning
to steal ukra% - might generate Ukraine as one most
frequent negative word in Russian.
4.3 How subjective is the annotation?
Sentiment annotation is a very subjective task. In ad-
dition, annotators had to judge single terms without
any context: they had to think about all the senses of

the term. Only if the main sense was subjective they
agreed to leave it in the dictionary. Another sub-
jectivity level was given by concentrating on distin-
guishing news content and news sentiment. Defining
the line between negative and highly negative terms,
and similarly with positive, is also subjective. In the
case of Italian we compared judgments of two anno-
tators. The figures of inter-annotator agreement of
annotating the triangulated terms are in table 6 and
the complement terms in table 7. Based on the per-
cent agreement the annotators agree a little bit less
on the triangulated terms (76.6%) compared to the
complement terms (82.6%). However, if we look at
Kappa figures, the difference is clear. Many terms
translated only from English were clearly wrong
which led to a higher agreement between the annota-
tors (0.318 compared to 0.614). When looking at the
difference between positive and negative terms, we
can see that there was higher agreement on the neg-
ative triangulated terms then on the positive ones.

4.4 Triangulation vs. Translation
Table 4 present the results of simple translation from
English (summed up numbers from tables 2 and 3).
We can directly compare it to table 2 where only
results of triangulated terms are reported. The per-
formance of triangulation is significantly better than
the performance of translation in all languages. The
highest difference was in Czech (89.1% and 57.2%)
and the lowest was in Italian (89.0% and 71.4%).
As a task-based evaluation we used the triangu-
lated/translated dictionaries in the system analysing
news sentiment expressed towards entities. The sys-
tem analyses a fixed word window around entity
mentions. Subjective terms are summed up and the
resulting polarity is attached to the entity. Highly
negative terms score twice more than negative, di-
minishers lower and intensifiers lift up the score. In-
vertors invert the polarity but for instance inverted
highly positive terms score as only negative pre-
venting, for instance, not great to score as worst.
The system searches for the invertor only two words
around the subjective term.
We ran the system on 300 German sentences
taken from news gathered by the Europe Media
Monitor (EMM)1. In all these cases the system at-
tached a polarity to an entity mention. We ran it with
three different dictionaries - translated terms from
English, raw triangulated terms (without the man-
ual checking) and the checked triangulated terms.
This pilot experiment revealed the difference in per-
formance on this task. When translated terms were
used there were only 41.6% contexts with correct
polarity assigned by the system, with raw triangu-
lated terms 56.5%, and with checked triangulated
terms 63.4%. However, the number does not contain
neutral cases that would increase the overall perfor-
mance. There are lots of reasons why it goes wrong
here: the entity may not be the target of the sub-
jective term (we do not use parser because of deal-
ing with many languages and large amounts of news
texts), the system can miss or apply wrongly an in-
vertor, the subjective term is used in different sense,
and irony is hard to detect.

4.5 State of progress
We finished all the steps for English, Czech and Rus-
sian. French, German, Italian and Spanish dictio-
naries miss only the introduction of wild cards. In
Arabic we have checked only the triangulated terms.
For other 7 languages (Bulgarian, Dutch, Hungarian,
Polish, Portuguese, Slovak and Turkish) we have
only projected the terms by triangulation. However,
we have capabilities to finish all the steps also for
Bulgarian, Dutch, Slovak and Turkish. We haven?t
investigated using more than two pivot languages for
triangulation. It would probably results in more ac-
curate but shortened dictionaires.
5 Conclusions
We presented our semi-automatic approach and cur-
rent state of work of producing multilingual senti-
ment dictionaries suitable of assessing the sentiment
in news expressed towards an entity. The triangula-
tion approach works significantly better than simple
translation but additional manual effort can improve
it a lot in both recall and precision. We believe that
we can predict the sentiment expressed towards an
entity in a given time period based on large amounts
of data we gather in many languages even if the per-
case performance of the sentiment system as on a
moderate level. Now we are working on improving
the dictionaries in all the discussed languages. We
also run experiments to evaluate the system on vari-
ous languages.
