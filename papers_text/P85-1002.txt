ABSTRACT 
The object ives of this paper are twofold, 
whereby the computer  program i s  meant to be 
a part icu lar  implementat ion of a general  natura l  
Language \[NL\] p roeess in~ sys tem \[NI,PSI wh ich  
could be used for d i f ferent  domains. The first 
obiect ive is to provide a theory for process ing 
temporal information conta ined in  a we l l - s t ruct -  
ured, technical  text. The second ob iect ive  
is to argue for a knowledge-based approach 
to NLP in which the pars ing procedure is dr iven 
bv extra Linguist ic knowledRe.  
The resul t ing computer  program incorporates 
enough domain-spec i f ic  and ~enera\[  knowledge 
so that the parsing procedure can be dr iven 
by the knowledge base of the program, whi le 
at  the same time empLoy in~ a descr ip t ive ly  
adequate theory of syntact ic  processing,  i.e., 
X-bar syntax. My pars ing a lgor i thm not only 
supports the prevalent theories of 
knowledge-based pars in~ put forth in A\[, but 
also uses a sound l inguist ic  theory for the 
necessary  syntact ic  information process ing .  
l .O  INTRODUCTION 
This paper descr ibes the development of 
a NiPS for  analyz ing domain -spec i f i c  as wel l  
as temporal information in a wel l -def ined text 
type. The analysis,  i . e .  output, of the NLPS 
i s  a data structure which serves as the i nput  
to an expert system. The ult imate Real  is 
to a l low the user  of the expert system to enter  
data into the system by means of NL text which 
fol lows the l inguist ic convent ions of English. 
The part icu lar  domain chosen to i l lustrate 
the under ly ing theory of such a system ts that 
of medical  descr ipt ive re?is which deal with 
patients' case histor ies of Liver diseases. 
The texts are taken unedtted from the Jourmal 
of  the  Amerzcan Medica l  As~oc?at ion .  The in fo r -  
mat ion  contained in those texts serves as input 
to PATREC, an intel l igent database ass istant  
for MDX, the medical  expert system

research are  twofold, whereby the sy~;tem 
descr ibed above is meant to be a part icu lar  
imp lementat ion  o f  a genera \ [  NLP which cou ld  
be used  fo r  a var ie ty  o f  domains .  
The f i r s t  ob jec t ive  i s  to  p rov ide  a theory

My NLPS, cal led GROK, \[Gran~nattcal

Linguist ic knowledge; (2) map the parsed 
Linguist ic structure into an

The first module of the program analyzes 
each word by accessing a \[exical component 
which assigns syntactic, semantic, and conceptual 
features to it. The second module consists 
of a bottom-up parser which matches the output 
from the lexical component to a set of augmented 
phrase structure rules 2. The third module 
consists of a knowledge base which contains 
the domain-specif ic information as well as 
temporal knowledge. The knowledge base is 
accessed during the processing of the text 
in conjunction with the augmented phrase 
structure rules. 
The output of the program includes a lexical 
feature assignment as given in Figure 2, a 
phrase-structure representation as given in 
Figure 3, and a knowledge representation as 
provided in Figure 4. The resulting knowledge 
representation of mv NLPS consists of a series 
of events which are extracted from the text 
and chronological ly ordered by the NLPS based 
on the stored knowledge the system has about 
the domain and ~enera \[ temporal re\[at ions. 
The final knowledge representation (see Figure 
5) which my NLPS ~enerates is the input to 
the expert system or its database specialist. 
The final output o\[ the expert system is a 
diagnosis of the patient.

with information ~eared toward the domain expert.

If a doctor were given a patient's case 
history (see Figure l), he would read the text 
and try to extract the salient pieces of infor- 
mation which are necessary for his diagnosis. 
In this particular text type, he would be in- 
terested in the sign, symptoms, and laboratory 
data, as well as the medical history of the 
patient. The crucial point hereby is the 
temporal information associated with the 
occurrences of these data. In general, he 
would try to cluster certain abnormal 
manifestations to form hypotheses which would 
result in a coherent diagnosis. The clustering 
would be based on the temporal succession of 
the information in the text. Each manifestation 
of abnormalities \[ will refer to as an "event". 
Each event is defined and related to other 
events by means of temporal information 
explicitly or implicitly provided in the text. 
An important notion which \[ use in my program 
is chat of a key event 4. "Events are or~anize~ 
around key events  (which are domain-specific 
in the medical domain, some of the important 
ones are 'admission', 'surgery', 'accident', 
etc.), so that ocher events are typically stated 
or ordered with respect to these key events" 
\[Micra\[ 82\]. 
3.0  KNi~IrLF.DCE-BASED PARSING 
3.1 Se lec t ion  and OwganizaCion for  the Knowledge 
Base 
\[ have characterized the task of a doctor 
reading a patient's case history as finding 
key domain concepts (e.g., sign, symptom, 
laboratory data), relating them to temporal 
indicators (e.g, seven veers a~o), and ordering 
the events resulting from assignin R temporal 
indicators co key concepts with respect to 
a "key event" (e.g., at admission, at surgery). 
(\[) This 80-year-old Caucasian female complained 
of nausea, vomiting, abdominal swe\[\[in~ ~nd 
iaundice. 
In the sample text in Figure l, the first 
sentence, given in (l) requ i res  the following 
domain concepts :  
Patient: person identified by age, sex,  and 
profession, whose signs, symptoms, and laboratory 
data will be given. 
Symptoms: manifestations of abnormalities 
repor\[ed by the patient. Certain symptoms 
have to be further defined: swellin~ needs 
a characterization as to where it occurs. Pain 
can be characterized by its location, intensity. 
and nature (e.g., "shooting"). 
Signs: abnormalities found by the phys ic ian  
such as fever, jaundice, or swelling. 
4The notion of "key event" is further 
discussed in 4.3 "Key Events". 
Whether "fever" is a sign or a symptom 
is indicated by the verb. Therefore, the verbs 
have features which indicate if the following 
is a sign or a symptom. There are no explicit 
temporal indicators in (1), except the tense 
marker on the verb. The doctor, however, knows 
chat case histories ordinari ly use "admission" 
as a reference point.

(2) She had diabetes mellitus, treated with 
insulin for six veers before admission. 
The sentence in (2) requires a temporal 
concept "year" in conjunction with the numerical 
value "six", it also requires the concept "dur- 
ation" to represent the meaning of for. The 
"key event" at admission is mentioned explicit ly 
and must be recognized as a concept by the 
system. 
After selecting the facts on the basis 
of about 35 case descriptions as well as previous 
research of the medical sublanguage \[Hirschman 
83\] 5 , \[ organized them into schemas based on 
what is known" about the particular text type. 
\[n \]Bonnet 79\], a medical summary is  
characterized as "a sequence of episodes that 
correspond Co phrases, sentences, or groups 
of sentences dealing with a single topic. These 
constitute the model and are represented bv 
schemas" \[Bonnet 79, 80\]. Schemas for the 
medical domain in Bonnet's system are $PATIENT- 
iNFORMATION (e .g . ,  sex,  job) ,  SSICNS (e .g . ,  
\ [ever ,  jaund ice) .  \[n GROK, l use the schemas 
SREPORT-SICN, SREPORT-SYMPTOM, SREPORT-LAB-DATA, 
SPATIENT-\[NFO. Each of  my schemas ind icates  
"who reports, what co whom, and when". The 
$REPORT-SYMPTOM schema has the following ele- 
ments: verb(unknown), subject(patient), object- 
(symptom), indirect object(medic), time(default 
is admission). 
After selecting the facts on the basis 
of the domain, and organizing them on the basis 
of the text-type, \[ add one fact for putting 
the information into the target representation. 
The target representation consists of a temporal 
indicator attached to a domain-specific fact 
what \[ had referred to in as "event". The 
event structure contains the following elements: 
name of domain-specific concept, reference 
point, duration (known or unknown), and relation 
to reference point (e.g., before, after). 
51 use ten types  o f  domain -spec i f i c  fac ts :

use s ix  tempora l  fac ts :  month, year ,  day,  week, 
duration, period, i.e., "for how long". 
11 
3.2 The F low o f  Cont ro l  
In addition to domain-specif ic knowledge, 
a person reading a text also uses his linguistic 
knowledge of the English grammar. The problem 
for a NLPS is how to integrate linguistic and 
extra linguistic knowledge. The dominant 
paradigm in computational linguistics uses 
syntactic and morphological information before 
considering extra linguistic knowledge; i f  
extra linguistic knowledge is used at all. 
Considering syntactic knowledge before 
any other type of knowledge has the following 
problems which are avoided if enough contextual 
information can be detected by the knowledge 
base of the NIPS: 
? global ambiguities cannot be 
resolved (e.g., Visitin~ 
relatives can be bortn~) 
? word-class ambiguities (e.g., 
bank) and structural ambiguities 
cause mult ip le  parses (e.g. , 
\[ saw the man on the hill with 
the  telescope). 
Moreover, psycholinguistic experiments 
have shown \[Marslen-Wilson 75, Marslen-Wilson 
78, Marsten-Wilson 801 that the syntactic 
.,nalvsis of a sentence does not precede higher 
level processing bu~ interacts with seman=ic  
and pragmatic information. These findings 
are, to some extent, controversial, and not  
accepted  by a l l  psvcho l inRu is ts .  
In  my sys tem,  knowledge about  the  domain ,  
the  text - type ,  and the  ta rRet  representat ion  
is used before and together with syntactic 
information. The syntactic information helps 
to select the interpretation of the sentence. 
Syntax functions as a filter for processing 
information. \[t selects the constituents of 
a sentence, and groups them into larger "chunks", 
called phrases. The phrase types noun phrases 
\[NP\] and verb phrase \ [VP I  contain procedures 
to form concepts (e.g. ,  "abdominal pain"). These 
concepts are combined by function special ists.  
Function specialists consists of procedures 
attached to function words (e.~., prepositions, 
determiners), fnflectional morphemes, and 
boundary markers (e .g . ,  comma, period). 
Technically, \[ distinguish between phrase 
~pecialists and function specialists. The 
phrase  ~pecialists interact with extra\[tnguistic 
knowledge to determine which concepts are ey- 
pressed in a text, the function specialists 
de~ermine locally what relation these concepts 
have to each other. So in general, the phrase 
specialists are activated before the function 
specialists. 
To illustrate this process, consider the 
sentence: 
(3) The patient complained of shoottn~ pain 
across the flanks for three days before 
admission. 
The NP-specialist combines the and patient 
into a phrase. The central processing component 
in the sentence ls the VP-specialist. Its 
task is to find the verb-particle construction 
(complain of), and the object (e.g., shootin~ 
pain). The VP-specialist also looks at the 
syntactic and semantic characteristics of 
complain o__f_f. It notes that complain o f  expects 
a symptom in its object position. The 
expectation of a symptom invokes the schema 
"report-symptom". At this point, the schema 
could fill in missing information, e.~. ,  if 
no subject had been mentioned, it could indicate 
that the patient is the subject. The schema 
identifies the current topic of the sentence, 
vlz., "symptom". 
CROK next encounters the word shootin~. 
This word has no further specif ication besides 
that of bein~ used as an adjective. The head 
noun pain points to a more complex entity "pain" 
which expects further specif ications (e .~. ,  
location, type). It first tries to find any 
further specifications within the :malvzed 
part of the NP. \[t finds shootin~ and adds 
this characteristic to the entity "pain". Since 
"pain" is usually specified in terms of i t s  
location, a place adverbial is expected. Upon 
the eqtry of across, the entity "pain" includes 
"acro~s" as a local ion marker, expect in~ as 
the  next word a body-part. The next word, 
flank is a body-part, and the "pain" entity 
is  completed. Note here ,  that the attachment 
of the preposition was ~uided by the information 
contained in the knowledge base. 
The next word for is a function word which 
can indicate duration. To determine which 
adverbial for Lntroduces, the system has to 
wait for the information from the following 
Nl'-specialist. After the numeric value "three", 
the temporal indicator "dav" identifies fo r  
as a duration marker. 
Exp l i c i t  ~empora l  ind icators  such as day ,  
week,  o r  month ,  under  cer ta in  cond i t ions  in -  
t roduce  new events. As soon as GROK veri- 
fies that a temporal indicator started an event, 
it fills in the information from the "report- 
:<xx" ,~chema. The new event representation 
i nc ludes  the  s ign ,  symptom, or  laboratory  data ,  
and the temporal indicator. The last two words 
in the sample sentence before adm?ssion, pro- 
vide Khe missing information as to what "key 
event" the ~ewly created event \[s related to. 
Once a new event frame or domain-specific 
frame is instnntiated) GROK can use the in for -  
mation associated with each event frame (e.g.)  
duration, key-event), together with the in for -  
mation from the domain-specific f rame (e.g. ,  
the pain frame contains slots for specifying 
the location, intensity, and type of pain) to 
interpret the text.

4.0  TEMPORAL \[NFO\[~ATION PROCESSINC 
4.1 Prob lems 
The inherent problems of text comprehension 
from an information processing viewpoint are 
how to deal with the foremost problems in 
computational NLP (e.g., ambiguity, anaphora, 
ellipsis, conjunction), including the foremost 
problems in temporal information processing 
(e.g., implicit time reference, imprecision 
of reference). 
Within A\[ and computational linguistics, 
only a few theories have been proposed for 
the processing of temporal information \[Kahn 
77, Hirschman 8\[, Kamp 7g, Allen 83l. in parti- 
cular, a theory of how a NLP can comprehend 
temporal relations in a written text is  still 
missing. \[n my research, \[ present a theory 
for processing temporal information in a NLPS 
for a well-defined class of technical descrip- 
tive texts. The texts dea l  with a specific 
domain and tasks which require the processing 
of linguistic information into a chronological 
order of events. The problems for processing 
the temporal information contained in the text 
include: 
? a NLPS has to work with impli- 
cit temporal information. 
ALthough in ( I ) ,  no explicit 
temporal re ference  is  p resent ,  
the NLPS has to detect the 
implied information from the 
context and the extra Linguis- 
tic knowledge available. 
? a NLPS has to work with fuzzy 
information. The reference 
tO fo r  many years  in (} )  is  
fuzzy, and yet a NiPS has to 
relate it to the chrono logy  
of the case. 
? a NLPS has to order the events 
in their chronology although 
they are not temporally ordered 
in the text. 
4.2 So lut ions  
Hv solution to the problems discussed 
in the previous section lies within the 
computat iona l  parad igm as opposed co the  
Chomskyan generative paradi~m. The comFutationaL 
paradigm focuses nn how the comprehension pro- 
cesses are organized whereas within the gener- 
ative parad iRm,  l ingu is t i c  per fo rmance  is  of 
less importance for a Linguistic theory than 
Linguistic competence. Within the computational 
paradigm, the representation and use of extra- 
Linguistic knowledge is a maior part of studying 
Linguistic phenomena, whereas generative lin- 
guists separate  linguistic phenomena which 
fa l l  w i th in  the  rea lm o f  syntax  f rom other  
cogn i t ive  aspects  \[W~nograd 83 ,  21 \ ] .  
Functionality is the central theoretical 
concept upon which the design of GROK rests. 
What is important for comprehending language 
is the function of an utterance in a given 
situation. Words are used for their meaning, 
and the meaning depends on the use in a given 
context. The meaning of a word is subject 
to change according to the context, which is 
based on the function of the words that make 
up the text. Therefore, my approach to building 
a NLPS focuses on modeling the context of a 
text in a particular domain. \[ am primarily 
concerned with the relationship between writer- 
text-reader, rather than with the relationship 
between two sentences. The use of the context 
for parsing requLres a knowledge representation 
of the domain, and the type of text, in addition 
to linguistic and empirical knowledge. 
In contradistinction to NLPSs which use 
syntactic information first \[Thompson 8\[\], 
and which possibly generate unnecessary 
structural descriptions, mv system uses higher 
\ [eve \ [  in fo rmat ion  (e .~. ,  domain ,  text - type)  
before and together with usuaLLv a smaller 
amount o\[ syntactic information, in GROK, 
the syntactic information selects between 
contextually interpretations o\[ the text 
~untax  acts  as  ~ i l l=or  for the N\[.IJS. 
in contradistinction to NLPSs which use 
conceptual information first \[Schank 75\], GROK, 
partially due to the limited information pro- 
cessin? task and the particular domain, starts 
out with a small knowledge base and builds 
up datastructures which are used subsequently 
in the processing of the text. The knowledge 
base of my system contains only the information 
it absolutely needs, whereas Schankian scripts 
have problems with when to activate scripts 
and when to exit them. 
4.3 Key Events  
Tempora l  in fo rmat ion  in a text  is  conveyed 
by exp l i c i t  tempora l  ind icators ,  imp l i c i t  
temporal relations based on what one knows 
about written texts (e.g., "time moves forward"), 
and "key events". \[ define a key event as 
a domain-specif ic concept which is used ro 
order  and group events  a round a par t i cu la r  
key event .  \[n my theorv ,  tempora l  p rocess ing  
is based on the identification of key events 
far a parti=uLar domain, and their subsequent 
reco~uition bv the NLPS in the text. 
Tempora l  ind icators  . in a sentence  are  
not  o f  equa l  impor tance .  The tense  mark in?  
on the  verb  has been the  Least  in f luent ia l  
{'or f i l l i ng  in the  event  s t ructure .  For  the  
program,  the  most impor tant  sources  are

the temporal  reference of the subordinate c lause

"Key events"  are s igni f icant  since they 
are used to relate events to one another. \[n 
my theory of text processing,  key events bui ld 
up the temporal  s t ructure of a text. \[f key 
events for other  domains can be identi f ied, 
they could be used to expla in  how a NLPS can 
"comprehend"  the texts of the domain in question. 
The representat ion  of temporal  in format ion 
is s igni f icant  \[n my theory. \[ def ine an event 
as the result of the ass ignment  of a temporal  
value to a domain-spec i f i c  concept.  The 
structure of an event is Renera l i zab le  to other 
domains. An event consists  of a domain-spec i f i c  
concept,  a key event, a re lat ion to ke~ event, 
and a durat ion.  \[n the medica l  domain, the 
instant iated event conta ins  informat ion about 
how long, and when a symptom or sign occurred,  
and what the kev event of the instant iated 
event  was. 
, \par t  from the  tempora l  i ssue ,  my research  
has shown that \[f the domain and the task of 
the NLPS are suf f ic ient ly  constra ined,  the 
use of frames as a knowledge representat ion  
~cheme is ef f ic ient  in implement ing CROK. in 
,nv program, \[ f lare used individual  frames to 
represent single concepts  (e.g., pain). These 
concepts  help the NLPS to access the 
domain -spec i f i c  knowledge base. To?ether  with 
the temporal  indicators,  the information from 
tne knowledge base is then t ransferred to the 
topmost event frame. Procedures are then used 
to relate var ious event frames to each other. 
The restr ic t ions  and checks on the instant iat ion 
of the individual  frames preclude an erroneotls 
act ivat ion of a frame. 
The v iab i l i ty  of this approach shows that 
the idea of s tereotyp ica l  representdL\ [on of 
information is useful  for NLPS \[f proper ly  
constra ined.  Mv program checks for the access-  
abi l i ty  of the var ious levels of the knowledge 
representat ion whenever  new information is 
coming in. This mul t i laver  approach constra ins  
the ~nstant iat ton of the event frame suff i -  
c ient ly  in  o rder  to prevent erroneous event 
tnstant iat ion.  
4.4 Compar ison  to  Extant  Theor ies  on Tempora l  
P rocess inR  
The overal l  ideas of GROK .is they re\[are 
~,r d i f fer  from ~he extant theories and svstems 
are introduced by looking at four major  issues 
concern ing  temporal proces:~ing. 
? temporai i ry:  how is an event 
def ined in the system; ho~ 
is temporal  information treated 
vis-a-. !.; =he whole system? 
What search  algor i thms or in- 
ference procedures are pro- 
vided? 
? o rgan izat ion:  are events  or -  
gan ized  on a time line, by 
key events,  ca lendar  dates, 
be fore /a f ter  chains? 
? problems: how is imprecis ion,  
fuzziness, and incompleteness  
of data handled? 
? test ing: how can the system 
be tested; by queries,  proofs, 
etc.? Does it have a cons is tency  
checker?  
In GROK, \[ use an interva l -based approach 
to temporal  informat ion processing.  An event 
is def ined as an ent i ty  of f inite durat ion.  
As in IKamp 79, 3771, event st ructures  are 
t ransformed into instants by the Russe l l -Wiener  
construct ion.  
\[n GROK, the NLPS processes temporal  
(nformat\[on by first assoc ia t ing  a concept  
with a temporal  reference, then eva luat ing  
the extens ion  of this event. The eva luat ion  
cons iders  syntact ic  (e.~., adverb ia ls )  and 
pragmat ic  information (current time focus). 
Each event is represented in the knowledge 
base with information about when, for how long, 
and what occurred.  
The parser whi le ana lyz ing  the sentences,  
orders these events accord ing to a "key event".  
The single events contain information about 
the tempora l  indicator which is at tached to 
a domain -soec~f ic  fact. The single events 
are connected to the respect ive "key event".  
"Key events"  are domain-spec i f i c .  \[n general ,  
\[ qc ipulate that everv domain has a l imited 
number of such "key events"  which provide the 
"hooks" for the temporal  structure of a 
domain-spec i  fic text. 
CROK also d i f fers  from logical theor ies 
\[n that it deals with d iscourse st ructures  
and their conceptual  representat ions,  not with 
:solated sentences and their truth value. \[t 
is d i f ferent  from Kahn's rime special ist  {Kahn 
771 in that it uses domain knowledge and "knows" 
about temporal  re lat ions of a par t icu lar  domain. 
Moreover,  Kahn's program only accepts  L iSP- l ike  
input and handled only expl ic i t  temporal  
information. The use of domain -spec i f i c  temporal  
knowledKe also qet=; CROK apart from Al len 's  
l,\\[len 83\] temporal  inference engine approach.  
GROK d i f fe rs  from Kamp's d i scourse  
s t ruc tures  in that  i t  uses  the  not ion  of  
reference intervals that are based on 
convent iGnal  temporal  units  (e.g., day, week, 
month, year) to organize s ingle events into 
chronological order .  
GROK i s  in  many respects  s imi la r  to  research  
repor ted  in  \ [H i rschman \ [98 l \ ] :  both  sys tems 
dea l  w i th  tempora l  re la t ions  in  the  med ica l  
domain ;  both  syatems dea l  w i th  imp l i c i t  and 
exp l i c i t  tempora l  in fo rmat ion .  GROK d i f fe rs  
14 
from Hirschman's system in that GROK uses  
domain-specif ic and other extra linguistic 
information for analyzing the text, whereas 
Hirschman relies primarily on available syntactic 
information. Therefore, Hirschman's system 
as presented in \[Hirschman 81\] can neither 
handle anaphoric references to continuous s ta tes  
nor represent imprecision in time specification. 
4.5  State of  \[=q~tememtatiou 
GROK is a h igh ly  exploratory program.  
The limitations of the current implementation 
are in three areas: 
? The parser itself does not 
provide the  capabil ity of a 
chart parser since it will 
not give different 
interpretations of a structurally 
ambiguous sentences. This 
type of structural ambiguity, 
where one constituent can belong 
to two or more different 
constructions, would not be 
detected. 
? The knowledge base does not 
have a fully implemented frame 
structure. Each ~eneric frame 
has a certain number of slots 
that define the concept. A 
generic concept  (e.g., sign) 
must have slots which contain 
possible attributes of the 
specific frame (e .g . ,  where 
is  the  s ign  found;  how severe  
is i t s  manifestation). These 
slots have not yet been 
imp lemented .  The number o f  
frames is strictly i /m i red  
to the temporal f rames and 
a few exemplary ~eneric frames 
necessary to process the text. 
? The range of phenomena is 
l im i ted .  Only "before-admission" 
references are recogn ized  by 
the system. Fur thermore ,  s lo ts  
that prevent the i nher i tance  
of events of limited durations 
are not  yet  in p lace .  
in genera l ,  GROK is s t i l l  in a deve lopmenta l  
s tage at  which  a number o f  phenomena have vet  
to be accounted  fo r  =hrough an imp lementat ion .  
5.0  CONCLUSION 
\[n th i s  paper ,  \[ argued fo r  an in tegrat ion  
o f  ins i%hcs  Rained from l ingu is t i c ,  
psychological, and Al-based research  to prov ide  
a pragmatic theory and cognitive mode\[ of how 
temporal inferences can be explained within 
the framework of computat iona l  in fo rmat ion  
process ing .  A pragmat ic  theory  focuses  on 
the in fo rmat ion  from the context  (e .g . ,  co - text ,  
discourse situation, intentions of interlocutors) 
to  exp la in  linguistic behavior. 
I have shown how an integration of 
linguistic and extra linguistic knowledge 
achieves a form of comprehension, where 
comprehension i s  characterized as a conversion 
of information based on knowledge from on 
representation into another. \[ have also shown 
how this approach leads to a parsing technique 
which avoids corm~on pitfalls, and, at the same 
time, is consistent with results in 
psycholinguistic research. \[ have further- 
more shown that such a procedural approach 
is a basis for an event-based theory for temporal 
information processing. 
In particular, the findings implemented 
in GROK show the shortcomings of the orthodox 
rule-based approach to language processing 
which reduces words to tokens in a larger context 
while overemphasizing the role of the phrase 
and sentence level. It does this by providing 
a temporal knowledge representation and 
algorithms for processing pragmatic information 
which are applicable to a wider range of 
phenomena than most of the notable computational 
NL theories within the field of A\[ Schank 
8\[, R/eger 79, Wi lks  75I, or  linguistics Marcus 
801. 
\[n particular, my research shows that 
? NL can be processed  realistically 
by a deterministic algorithm 
which can be interpreted in 
a mental model. A realistic 
NLPS tries to emulate human 
behavior. A deterministic 
parser works under the assumption 
that ( \ [ )  a human NLPS makes 
i r revocab le  decisions during 
processing and (2) that humans 
are  not unconstrained 
"wait-and-see-parsers" {Kac 
821. A mental model provides 
an i n te rna l  representat ion  
of the state of affairs that 
are described in a given sentence
