ABSTRACT 
On what basis are the input processing capabilities of Natural 
Language software judged? That is, what are the capabilities to 
be described and measured, and what are the standards against 
which we measure them? Rome Laboratory is currently 
supporting an effort to develop a concise terminology for 
describing the linguistic processing capabilities of Natural 
Language Systems, and a uniform methodology for 
appropriately applying the terminology. This methodology is
meant o produce quantitative, objective profiles of NL system 
capabilities without requiring system adaptation to a new test 
domain or text corpus. The effort proposes to develop a 
repeatable procedure that produces consistent results for 
independent evaluators. 
1. INTRODUCTION 
An appreciable drawback to current corpus-based (eg., 
\[BBN; 1988\], \[Flickinger, et al 1987\], \[Hendrix, et al 
1976\], \[Malhotra; 1975\]) and task-based (eg., 
\["Proceedings"; 1991\]) methodologies for evaluating 
Natural Language Processing Systems is the requirement 
for transportation of the system to a test domain. The 
expense and time consumption are sizable and, as the port 
may be minimal or incomplete, the evaluation may be 
based on a demonstration f less than the full potential of 
the system. Further, current evaluation methodologies do 
not fully elucidate NLP system capabilities for possible 
future applications. 
Under contract o Rome Laboratory, Dr. Jeannette Neal 
(Calspan Corporation) and Dr. Christine Montgomery 
(Language Systems Incorporated) are in the final months of 
developing an NLP system evaluation methodology that 
produces descriptive, objective profiles of system linguistic 
capabilities without a requirement for system adaptation to
a new domain. The evaluation methodology is meant o 
produce consistent results for varied haman users. 
1.1. Evaluation Methodology Description 
Within the Neal-Montgomery NLP System Evaluation 
Methodology each identified linguistic (lexical, syntactic, 
semantic, or discourse) feature is first carefully defined and 
explained in order to establish a standard elimitation of the 
feature. Illustrative language patterns and sample sentences 
then guide the human evaluator to the formulation of an 
input that tests the feature on the NLP system within the 
system's native domain. 
Based on clear and specific evaluation criteria for test item 
inputs, NLP system responses are scored as follows: 
S: The system successfully met the stated criteria nd 
demonstrated understanding with respect to the feature under 
test. 
C: The system responded in a way that was correct 
(that is, correctly answered the question posed), but the 
criteria were not met. 
P: The system responded in a way that was only 
partially correct. 
F: The system responded in a way that was incorrect, 
failing to meet he criteria. 
N: The system was unable to accept he input or form 
a response (for example, the system vocabulary lacks 
appropriate words to complete a test inpu0. 
Each linguistic feature is tested by more than one 
methodology item to make sure that results are not based 
on spurious responses, and each item examines only one as- 
yet-untested capability, or one as-yet-untested combination 
of capabilities. Test inputs that are dependent on 
capabilities previously shown to be unsuccessful are 
avoided. Scores are then aggregated into percentages for 
hierarchically-structured classes of linguistic capabilities 
which produce descriptive profiles of NLP systems. The 
profiles can be viewed at varying levels of granularity. 
Figure 1 shows a sample system profile from the top level 
of the hierarchy. 
Note that he scoring nomenclature (above) has been refined 
and expanded since project experiments produced the profiles 
and results presented in this paper. In Figures 1 and 2, 
"Unable to Compose Input" is equivalent to an 'N' in the 
newer nomenclature. A score of "Indeterminate" arlier 
meant he human evaluator could not determine if the NLP

Figure 1: A Top Level Evaluation Profile of an NLP System 
system correctly processed the test input. The new system 
of scores will be applied for the final project self- 
assessment activities. 
The columns at the far fight of Figure 1 display the total 
time (in hours and minutes) the user required to complete 
that section of the evaluation, and the average time per item 
(hours:minutes:seconds) for the section. 
Figure 2 displays part of the evaluation to the 
methodology's most detailed level of granularity. 
2. PROJECT SELF-ASSESSMENT 
In March and September of 1991 rigorous project 
assessments provided valuable feedback into the design of 
the Neal-Montgomery NLP System Evaluation 
Methodology. For each assessment, three people applied 
the methodology toeach of three NLP systems, for a total 
of eighteen applications. Assessment personnel, 
knowledgeable with respect to interface technology but not 
trained linguists, were distinct from the methodology 
development team. 
The consistency of system profiles resulting from these 
applications, the examination of test inputs composed 
during the assessments, records of oral commentary by 
evaluators, and responses to a post-evaluation questionnaire 
have been used as measures of the accuracy of methodology 
results. For the September assessment phase, Figure 3 
shows, for each section of the methodology, the percentage 
of items for which the assessment team gave the same score 
to each system. For example: the data points for the 
adverbial section indicate that all three people gave the same 
assessment of System 2's skills for adverbials (they agreed 
in every instance), they agreed 60% of the time on System 
l's adverbial skills, and they agreed only 20% of the time 
for System 3's adverbial skills. The inconsistency of 
scores in this section has prompted the development team 
to refine the methodology's adverbial section. 
NLP systems used for assessments to date have included 
three NL database query systems and two MUC-3 systems. 
Focusing on reliability rather than feedback into 
methodology design, four people will apply the Neal- 
Montgomery NLP Evaluation Methodology to each of two 
systems for the third (and final) project self-assessment i  
April 1992. 
3. TOWARD THE FUTURE 
Evaluation "standards" are not developed and adopted 
without a period of review, rumination, and tweaking by 
the relevant user community. It is our hope therefore, in 
distributing the Neal-Montgomery NLP System Evaluation 
Methodology to the technical community, to stir interest 
that may lead to the eventual consideration of the 
methodology as the basis for a standard evaluation tool for 
NLP system capabilities. 
The Neal-Montgomery NLP System Evaluation 
Methodology is due for completion and delivery to Rome 
Laboratory in May of 1992. It will become immediately 
available at that time to all interested parties. Requests 
should be made to the author of this paper. Reviewer 
comment, critique, and suggestions for the methodology are 
invited.
