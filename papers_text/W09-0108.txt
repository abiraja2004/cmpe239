Abstract
I will try to position the fields of Linguis-
tics and Computational Linguistics by ex-
amining  their  objects  of  research,  their 
objectives, approaches, and success crite-
ria, drawing on the concepts shown in the 
text  cloud  below.  This  should  give  a 
clearer view of the commonalities, differ-
ences and potential synergies.
