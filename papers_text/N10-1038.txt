Abstract
We consider the problem of predicting a
movie?s opening weekend revenue. Previous
work on this problem has used metadata about
a movie?e.g., its genre, MPAA rating, and
cast?with very limited work making use of
text about the movie. In this paper, we use
the text of film critics? reviews from several
sources to predict opening weekend revenue.
We describe a new dataset pairing movie re-
views with metadata and revenue data, and
show that review text can substitute for meta-
data, and even improve over it, for prediction.
1 Introduction
Predicting gross revenue for movies is a problem
that has been studied in economics, marketing,
statistics, and forecasting. Apart from the economic
value of such predictions, we view the forecasting
problem as an application of NLP. In this paper, we
use the text of critics? reviews to predict opening
weekend revenue. We also consider metadata for
each movie that has been shown to be successful for
similar prediction tasks in previous work.
There is a large body of prior work aimed at pre-
dicting gross revenue of movies (Simonoff and Spar-
row, 2000; Sharda and Delen, 2006; inter alia). Cer-
tain information is used in nearly all prior work on
these tasks, such as the movie?s genre, MPAA rating,
running time, release date, the number of screens on
which the movie debuted, and the presence of partic-
ular actors or actresses in the cast. Most prior text-
based work has used automatic text analysis tools,
deriving a small number of aggregate statistics. For
example, Mishne and Glance (2006) applied sen-
timent analysis techniques to pre-release and post-
release blog posts about movies and showed higher

correlation between actual revenue and sentiment-
based metrics, as compared to mention counts of the
movie. (They did not frame the task as a revenue
prediction problem.) Zhang and Skiena (2009) used
a news aggregation system to identify entities and
obtain domain-specific sentiment for each entity in
several domains. They used the aggregate sentiment
scores and mention counts of each movie in news
articles as predictors.
While there has been substantial prior work on
using critics? reviews, to our knowledge all of this
work has used polarity of the review or the number
of stars given to it by a critic, rather than the review
text directly (Terry et al, 2005).
Our task is related to sentiment analysis (Pang et
al., 2002) on movie reviews. The key difference is
that our goal is to predict a future real-valued quan-
tity, restricting us from using any post-release text
data such as user reviews. Further, the most im-
portant clues about revenue may have little to do
with whether the reviewer liked the movie, but rather
what the reviewer found worth mentioning. This pa-
per is more in the tradition of Ghose et al (2007) and
Kogan et al (2009), who used text regression to di-
rectly quantify review ?value? and make predictions
about future financial variables, respectively.
Our aim in using the full text is to identify partic-
ular words and phrases that predict the movie-going
tendencies of the public. We can also perform syn-
tactic and semantic analysis on the text to identify
richer constructions that are good predictors. Fur-
thermore, since we consider multiple reviews for
each movie, we can compare these features across
reviews to observe how they differ both in frequency
and predictive performance across different media
outlets and individual critics.
In this paper, we use linear regression from text
and non-text (meta) features to directly predict gross
revenue aggregated over the opening weekend, and
the same averaged per screen.

2 Data
We gathered data for movies released in 2005?2009.
For these movies, we obtained metadata and a list
of hyperlinks to movie reviews by crawling Meta-
Critic (www.metacritic.com). The metadata
include the name of the movie, its production house,
the set of genres it belongs to, the scriptwriter(s),
the director(s), the country of origin, the primary
actors and actresses starring in the movie, the re-
lease date, its MPAA rating, and its running time.
From The Numbers (www.the-numbers.com),
we retrieved each movie?s production budget, open-
ing weekend gross revenue, and the number of
screens on which it played during its opening week-
end. Only movies found on both MetaCritic and The
Numbers were included.
Next we chose seven review websites that most
frequently appeared in the review lists for movies at
Metacritic, and obtained the text of the reviews by
scraping the raw HTML. The sites chosen were the
Austin Chronicle, the Boston Globe, the LA Times,
Entertainment Weekly, the New York Times, Vari-
ety, and the Village Voice. We only chose those
reviews that appeared on or before the release date
of the movie (to ensure that revenue information is
not present in the review), arriving at a set of 1718
movies with at least one review. We partitioned this
set of movies temporally into training (2005?2007),
development (2008) and test (2009) sets. Not all
movies had reviews at all sites (see Table 1).
3 Predictive Task
We consider two response variables, both in
U.S. dollars: the total revenue generated by a movie
during its release weekend, and the per screen rev-
enue during the release weekend. We evaluate these
predictions using (1) mean absolute error (MAE) in
U.S. dollars and (2) Pearson?s correlation between
the actual and predicted revenue.
We use linear regression to directly predict the
opening weekend gross earnings, denoted y, based
on features x extracted from the movie metadata
and/or the text of the reviews. That is, given an input
feature vector x ? Rp, we predict an output y? ? R
using a linear model: y? = ?0 + x>?. To learn val-
ues for the parameters ? = ??0,??, the standard
approach is to minimize the sum of squared errors
for a training set containing n pairs ?xi, yi? where
xi ? Rp and yi ? R for 1 ? i ? n:
?? = argmin
?=(?0,?)

A penalty term P (?) is included in the objective for
regularization. Classical solutions use an `2 or `1
norm, known respectively as ridge and lasso regres-
sion. Introduced recently is a mixture of the two,
called the elastic net (Zou and Hastie, 2005):
P (?) =
?p
j=1
(

)
where ? ? (0, 1) determines the trade-off be-
tween `1 and `2 regularization. For our experi-
ments we used the elastic net and specifically the
glmnet package which contains an implementa-
tion of an efficient coordinate ascent procedure for
training (Friedman et al, 2008).
We tune the ? and ? parameters on our develop-
ment set and select the model with the ??, ?? com-
bination that yields minimum MAE on the develop-
ment set.
4 Experiments
We compare predictors based on metadata, predic-
tors based on text, and predictors that use both kinds
of information. Results for two simple baselines of
predicting the training set mean and median are re-
ported in Table 2 (Pearson?s correlation is undefined
since the standard deviation is zero).
4.1 Metadata Features
We considered seven types of metadata features, and
evaluated their performance by adding them to our
pool of features in the following order: whether the
294
film is of U.S. origin, running time (in minutes), the
logarithm of its budget, # opening screens, genre
(e.g., Action, Comedy) and MPAA rating (e.g., G,
PG, PG-13), whether the movie opened on a holiday
weekend or in summer months, total count as well as
of presence of individual Oscar-winning actors and
directors and high-grossing actors. For the first task
of predicting the total opening weekend revenue of
a movie, the best-performing feature set in terms of
MAE turned out to be all the features. However, for
the second task of predicting the per screen revenue,
addition of the last feature subset consisting of infor-
mation related to the actors and directors hurt perfor-
mance (MAE increased). Therefore, for the second
task, the best performing set contained only the first
six types of metadata features.
4.2 Text Features
We extract three types of text features (described be-
low). We only included feature instances that oc-
curred in at least five different movies? reviews. We
stem and downcase individual word components in
all our features.
I. n-grams. We considered unigrams, bigrams, and
trigrams. A 25-word stoplist was used; bigrams
and trigrams were only filtered if all words were
stopwords.
II. Part-of-speech n-grams. As with words, we
added unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams. Tags
were obtained from the Stanford part-of-speech
tagger (Toutanova and Manning, 2000).
III. Dependency relations. We used the Stanford
parser (Klein and Manning, 2003) to parse the
critic reviews and extract syntactic dependen-
cies. The dependency relation features consist
of just the relation part of a dependency triple
?relation, head word, modifier word?.
We consider three ways to combine the collec-
tion of reviews for a given movie. The first (???)
simply concatenates all of a movie?s reviews into
a single document before extracting features. The
second (?+?) conjoins each feature with the source
site (e.g., New York Times) from whose review it was
extracted. A third version (denoted ?B?) combines
both the site-agnostic and site-specific features.

4.3 Results
Table 2 shows our results for both prediction tasks.
For the total first-weekend revenue prediction task,
metadata features baseline result (r2 = 0.521) is
comparable to that reported by Simonoff and Spar-
row (2000) on a similar task of movie gross predic-
tion (r2 = 0.446). Features from critics? reviews
by themselves improve correlation on both predic-
tion tasks, however improvement in MAE is only
observed for the per screen revenue prediction task.
A combination of the meta and text features
achieves the best performance both in terms of MAE
and r. While the text-only models have some high
negative weight features, the combined models do
not have any negatively weighted features and only
a very few metadata features. That is, the text is able
to substitute for the other metadata features.
Among the different types of text-based features
that we tried, lexical n-grams proved to be a strong
baseline to beat. None of the ?I ? ?? feature sets are
significantly better than n-grams alone, but adding
295
the dependency relation features (set III) to the n-
grams does improve the performance enough to
make it significantly better than the metadata-only
baseline for per screen revenue prediction.
Salient Text Features: Table 3 lists some of the
highly weighted features, which we have catego-
rized manually. The features are from the text-only
model annotated in Table 2 (total, not per screen).
The feature weights can be directly interpreted as
U.S. dollars contributed to the predicted value y? by
each occurrence of the feature. Sentiment-related
features are not as prominent as might be expected,
and their overall proportion in the set of features
with non-zero weights is quite small (estimated in
preliminary trials at less than 15%). Phrases that
refer to metadata are the more highly weighted
and frequent ones. Consistent with previous re-
search, we found some positively-oriented sentiment
features to be predictive. Some other prominent
features not listed in the table correspond to spe-
cial effects (?Boston Globe: of the art?, ?and cgi?),
particular movie franchises (?shrek movies?, ?Vari-
ety: chronicle of?, ?voldemort?), hype/expectations
(?blockbuster?, ?anticipation?), film festival (?Vari-
ety: canne? with negative weight) and time of re-
lease (?summer movie?).
5 Conclusion
We conclude that text features from pre-release re-
views can substitute for and improve over a strong
metadata-based first-weekend movie revenue pre-
diction. The dataset used in this paper has been
made available for research at http://www.
ark.cs.cmu.edu/movie$-data.
