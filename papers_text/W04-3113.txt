Abstract
Literature indexing tools provide re-
searchers with a means to navigate
through the network of scholarly scientific
articles in a subject domain. We propose
that more effective indexing tools may be
designed using the links between articles
provided by citations.
With the explosion in the amount of sci-
entific literature and with the advent of ar-
tifacts requiring more sophisticated index-
ing, a means to provide more information
about the citation relation in order to give
more intelligent control to the navigation
process is warranted. In order to navigate
a citation index in this more-sophisticated
manner, the citation index must provide
not only the citation-link information, but
also must indicate the function of the cita-
tion. The design methodology of an in-
dexing tool for scholarly biomedical lit-
erature which uses the rhetorical context
surrounding the citation to provide the ci-
tation function is presented. In particular,
we discuss how the scientific method is re-
flected in scientific writing and how this
knowledge can be used to decide the pur-
pose of a citation.
1 Introduction
1.1 The aim of citation indexing
Indexing tools, such as CiteSeer (Bollacker et al, 1999),
play an important role in the scientific endeavour by
providing researchers with a means to navigate through
the network of scholarly scientific papers using the con-
nections provided by citations. Citations relate articles
within a research field by linking together works whose
methods and results are in some way mutually relevant.
Customarily, authors include citations in their papers to
indicate works that are foundational in their field, back-
ground for their own work, or representative of comple-
mentary or contradictory research. Another researcher
may then use the presence of citations to locate articles
she needs to know about when entering a new field or to
read in order to keep track of progress in a field where she
is already well-established. But, with the explosion in the
amount of scientific literature, a means to provide more
information in order to give more intelligent control to the
navigation process is warranted. A user normally wants
to navigate more purposefully than ?Find all articles cit-
ing a source article?. Rather, the user may wish to know
whether other experiments have used similar techniques
to those used in the source article, or whether other works
have reported conflicting experimental results. In order to
navigate a citation index in this more-sophisticated man-
ner, the citation index must contain not only the citation-
link information, but also must indicate the function of
the citation in the citing article.
The goal of our research project is the design and im-
plementation of an indexing tool for scholarly biomedical
literature which uses the text surrounding the citation to
provide information about the binary relation between the
two papers connected by a citation. In particular, we are
interested in how the scientific method structures the way
in which ideas, results, theories, etc. are presented in sci-
entific writing and how the style of presentation indicates
the purpose of citations, that is, what the relationship is
between the cited and citing papers.
Our interest in the connection between scientific lit-
erature (our focus), ontologies, and databases is that the
content and structure of each of these three repositories
of scientific knowledge has its foundations in the method
of science. Our purpose here is twofold: to make explicit
our design methodology for an indexing tool that uses

the rhetoric of science as its foundation to see whether the
ideas that underly our methodology can cross-fertilize the
enquiry into the other two areas, and to discuss the tool
itself with the purpose of making known that there exists
a working tool which can assist the development of other
projects.
A citation may be formally defined as a portion of a
sentence in a citing document which references another
document or a set of other documents collectively. For
example, in sentence 1 below, there are two citations:
the first citation is Although the 3-D structure. . . progress,
with the set of references (Eger et al, 1994; Kelly, 1994);
the second citation is it was shown. . . submasses with the
single reference (Coughlan et al, 1986).
(1) Although the 3-D structure analysis by x-ray
crystallography is still in progress (Eger et al,
1994; Kelly, 1994), it was shown by electron
microscopy that XO consists of three submasses
(Coughlan et al, 1986).
A citation index enables efficient retrieval of docu-
ments from a large collection?a citation index consists
of source items and their corresponding lists of biblio-
graphic descriptions of citing works. The use of citation
indexing of scientific articles was invented by Dr. Eugene
Garfield in the 1950s as a result of studies on problems
of medical information retrieval and indexing of biomed-
ical literature. Dr. Garfield later founded the Institute
for Scientific Information (ISI), whose Science Citation
Index (Garfield, no date) is now one of the most popu-
lar citation indexes. Recently, with the advent of digi-
tal libraries, Web-based indexing systems have begun to
appear (e.g., ISI?s ?Web of Knowledge?, CiteSeer (Bol-
lacker et al, 1999)).
Authors of scientific papers normally include citations
in their papers to indicate works that are connected in an
important way to their paper. Thus, a citation connect-
ing the source document and a citing document serves
one of many functions. For example, one function is that
the citing work gives some form of credit to the work
reported in the source article. Another function is to
criticize previous work. Other functions include: foun-
dational works in their field, background for their own
work, works which are representative of complementary
or contradictory research.
The aim of citation analysis studies has been to cate-
gorize and, ultimately, to classify the function of scien-
tific citations automatically. Many citation classification
schemes have been developed, with great variance in the
number and nature of categories used. Garfield (1965)
was the first to define a classification scheme, while
Finney (1979) was the first to suggest that a citation clas-
sifier could be automated. Other classification schemes
include those by Cole (1975), Duncan, Anderson, and
McAleese (1981), Frost (1979), Lipetz (1965), Moravc-
sik and Murugesan (1975), Peritz (1983), Small (1978),
Spiegel-Ro?sing (1977), and Weinstock (1971). Within
this representative group of classification schemes, the
number of categories ranges from four to 26. Examples
of these categories include a contrastive, supportive, or
corrective relationship between citing and cited works.
But, the author?s purpose for including a citation is not
apparent in the citation per se. Determining the nature
of the exact relationship between a citing and cited paper
often requires some level of understanding of the text in
which the citation is embedded.
1.2 Citation indexing in biomedical literature
analysis
In the biomedical field, we believe that the usefulness
of automated citation classification in literature indexing
can be found in both the larger context of managing entire
databases of scientific articles or for specific information-
extraction problems. On the larger scale, database cura-
tors need accurate and efficient methods for building new
collections by retrieving articles on the same topic from
huge general databases. Simple systems (e.g., (Andrade
and Valencia, 1998), (Marcotte et al, 2001)) consider
only keyword frequencies in measuring article similarity.
More-sophisticated systems, such as the Neighbors utility
(Wilbur and Coffee, 1994), may be able to locate articles
that appear to be related in some way (e.g., finding related
Medline abstracts for a set of protein names (Blaschke et
al., 1999)), but the lack of specific information about the
nature and validity of the relationship between articles
may still make the resulting collection a less-than-ideal
resource for subsequent analysis. Citation classification
to indicate the nature of the relationships between articles
in a database would make the task of building collections
of related articles both easier and more accurate. And, the
existence of additional knowledge about the nature of the
linkages between articles would greatly enhance naviga-
tion among a space of documents to retrieve meaningful
information about the related content.
A specific problem in information extraction that may
benefit from the use of citation categorization involves
mining the literature for protein-protein interactions (e.g.,
(Blaschke et al, 1999), (Marcotte et al, 2001), (Thomas
et al, 2000)). Currently, even the most-sophisticated sys-
tems are not yet capable of dealing with all the difficult
problems of resolving ambiguities and detecting hidden
knowledge. For example, Blaschke et al?s system (1999)
is able to handle fairly complex problems in detecting
protein-protein interactions, including constructing the
network of protein interactions in cell-cycle control, but
important implicit knowledge is not recognized. In the
case of cell-cycle analysis for Drosophila, their system is
able to determine that relationships exist between Cak,
Cdk7, CycH, and Cdk2: Cak inhibits/phosphorylates
Cdk7, Cak activates/phosphorylates Cdk2, Cdk7 phos-
phorylates Cdk2, CycH phosphorylates Cak and CycH
phosphorylates Cdk2. However, the system is not able
to detect that Cak is actually a complex formed by Cdk7
and CycH, and that the Cak complex regulates Cdk2.
While the earlier literature describes inter-relationships
among these proteins, the recognition of the generaliza-
tion in their structure, i.e., that these proteins are part
of a complex, is contained only in more-recent articles:
?There is an element of generalization implicit in later
publications, embodying previous, more dispersed find-
ings. A clear improvement here would be the generation
of associated weights for texts according to their level
of generality? (Blaschke et al, 1999). Citation catego-
rization could provide just these kind of ?ancestral? re-
lationships between articles?whether an article is foun-
dational in the field or builds directly on closely related
work?and, if automated, could be used in forming col-
lections of articles for study that are labelled with ex-
plicit semantic and rhetorical links to one another. Such
collections of semantically linked articles might then be
used as ?thematic? document clusters (cf. Wilbur (2002))
to elicit much more meaningful information from docu-
ments known to be closely related.
An added benefit of having citation categories avail-
able in text corpora used for studies such as extract-
ing protein-protein interactions is that more, and more-
meaningful, information may be obtained. In a potential
application for our research, Blaschke et al (1999) noted
that they were able to discover many more protein-protein
interactions when including in the corpus those articles
found to be related by the Neighbors facility (Wilbur and
Coffee, 1994) (285 versus only 28 when relevant protein
names alone were used in building the corpus). Lastly,
very difficult problems in scientific and biomedical infor-
mation extraction that involve aspects of deep-linguistic
meaning may be resolved through the availability of cita-
tion categorization in curated texts: synonym detection,
for example, may be enhanced if different names for the
same entity occur in articles that can be recognized as
being closely related in the scientific research process.
2 Our Guiding Principles
2.1 Scientific writing and the rhetoric of science
The automated labelling of citations with a specific ci-
tation function requires an analysis of the linguistic fea-
tures in the text surrounding the citation, coupled with
a knowledge of the author?s pragmatic intent in placing
the citation at that point in the text. The author?s pur-
pose for including citations in a research article reflects
the fact that researchers wish to communicate their results
to their scientific community in such a way that their re-
sults, or knowledge claims, become accepted as part of
the body of scientific knowledge. This persuasive na-
ture of the scientific research article, how it contributes to
making and justifying a knowledge claim, is recognized
as the defining property of scientific writing by rhetori-
cians of science, e.g., (Gross, 1996), (Gross et al, 2002),
(Hyland, 1998), (Myers, 1991). Style (lexical and syntac-
tic choice), presentation (organization of the text and dis-
play of the data), and argumentation structure are noted as
the rhetorical means by which authors build a convincing
case for their results.
Our approach to automated citation classification is
based on the detection of fine-grained linguistics cues in
scientific articles that help to communicate these rhetori-
cal stances and thereby map to the pragmatic purpose of
citations. As part of our overall research methodology,
our goal is to map the various types of pragmatic cues
in scientific articles to rhetorical meaning. Our previous
work has described the importance of discourse cues in
enhancing inter-article cohesion signalled by citation us-
age (Mercer and Di Marco, 2003), (Di Marco and Mercer,
2003). We have also been investigating another class of
pragmatic cues, hedging cues, (Mercer, Di Marco, and
Kroon, 2004), that are deeply involved in creating the
pragmatic effects that contribute to the author?s knowl-
edge claim by linking together a mutually supportive net-
work of researchers within a scientific community.
2.2 Results of our previous studies
In our preliminary study (Mercer and Di Marco, 2003),
we analyzed the frequency of the cue phrases from
(Marcu, 1997) in a set of scholarly scientific articles. We
reported strong evidence that these cue phrases are used
in the citation sentences and the surrounding text with
the same frequency as in the article as a whole. In sub-
sequent work (Di Marco and Mercer, 2003), we analyzed
the same dataset of articles to begin to catalogue the fine-
grained discourse cues that exist in citation contexts. This
study confirmed that authors do indeed have a rich set
of linguistic and non-linguistic methods to establish dis-
course cues in citation contexts.
Another type of linguistic cue that we are studying is
related to hedging effects in scientific writing that are
used by an author to modify the affect of a ?knowledge
claim?. Hedging in scientific writing has been exten-
sively studied by Hyland (1998), including cataloging the
pragmatic functions of the various types of hedging cues.
As Hyland (1998) explains, ?[Hedging] has subsequently
been applied to the linguistic devices used to qualify a
speaker?s confidence in the truth of a proposition, the kind
of caveats like I think, perhaps, might, and maybe which
we routinely add to our statements to avoid commitment
to categorical assertions. Hedges therefore express tenta-
tiveness and possibility in communication, and their ap-
propriate use in scientific discourse is critical (p. 1)?.
The following examples illustrate some of the ways in
which hedging may be used to deliberately convey an atti-
tude of uncertainty or qualifification. In the first example,
the use of the verb suggested hints at the author?s hesi-
tancy to declare the absolute certainty of the claim:
(2) The functional significance of this modulation
is suggested by the reported inhibition of MeSo-
induced differentiation in mouse erythroleukemia
cells constitutively expressing c-myb.
In the second example, the syntactic structure of the sen-
tence, a fronted adverbial clause, emphasizes the effect
of qualification through the rhetorical cue Although. The
subsequent phrase, a certain degree, is a lexical modifier
that also serves to limit the scope of the result:
(3) Although many neuroblastoma cell lines show
a certain degree of heterogeneity in terms of neu-
rotransmitter expression and differentiative po-
tential, each cell has a prevalent behavior in re-
sponse to differentiation inducers.
In Mercer (2004), we showed that the hedging cues pro-
posed by Hyland occur more frequently in citation con-
texts than in the text as a whole. With this information
we conjecture that hedging cues are an important aspect
of the rhetorical relations found in citation contexts and
that the pragmatics of hedges may help in determining
the purpose of citations.
We investigated this hypothesis by doing a frequency
analysis of hedging cues in citation contexts in a corpus
of 985 biology articles. We obtained statistically signifi-
cant results (summarized in Table 1 indicating that hedg-
ing is used more frequently in citation contexts than the
text as a whole. Given the presumption that writers make
stylistic and rhetorical choices purposefully, we propose
that we have further evidence that connections between
fine-grained linguistic cues and rhetorical relations exist
in citation contexts.
Table 1 shows the proportions of the various types
of sentences that contain hedging cues, broken down by
hedging-cue category (verb or nonverb cues), according
to the different sections in the articles (background, meth-
ods, results and discussion, conclusions). For all but one
combination, citation sentences are more likely to contain
hedging cues than would be expected from the overall fre-
quency of hedge sentences (  ). Citation ?window?
sentences (i.e., sentences in the text close to a citation)
generally are also significantly ( 	
  ) more likely to
contain hedging cues than expected, though for certain
combinations (methods, verbs and nonverbs; res+disc,
verbs) the difference was not significant.
Tables 2, 3, and 4 summarize the occurrence of hedg-
ing cues in citation ?contexts? (a citation sentence and the
surrounding citation window). Table 5 shows the propor-
tion of hedge sentences that either contain a citation, or
fall within a citation window; Table 5 suggests (last 3-
column column) that the proportion of hedge sentences
containing citations or being part of citation windows is
at least as great as what would be expected just by the
distribution of citation sentences and citation windows.
Table 1 indicates (statistically significant) that in most
cases the proportion of hedge sentences in the cita-
tion contexts is greater than what would be expected
by the distribution of hedge sentences. Taken together,
these conditional probabilities support the conjecture that
hedging cues and citation contexts correlate strongly. Hy-
land (1998) has catalogued a variety of pragmatic uses of
hedging cues, so it is reasonable to speculate that these
uses can be mapped to the rhetorical meaning of the text
surrounding a citation, and from thence to the function of
the citation.
3 Our Design Methodology
3.1 The Tool
The indexing tool that we are designing enhances a stan-
dard citation index by labelling each citation with the
function of that citation. That is, given an agreed-upon
set of citation functions, our tool will categorize a cita-
tion automatically into one of these functional categories.
To accomplish this automatic categorization we are using
a decision tree: given a set of features, which combina-
tions of features map to which citation function. Our cur-
rent focus is the biomedical literature, but we are certain
that our tool can be used for the experimental sciences.
We are not certain whether the tool can be generalized
beyond this corpus (Frost, 1979).
In the following we describe in more detail the three as-
pects of our design methodology: the research program,
the tool implementation, and its evaluation. Our basic
assumption is that citations form links to other articles
for much the same purpose and in much the same way as
links to other parts of the same article. These intra-textual
and inter-textual linkages are made to create a coherent
presentation to convince the reader that the content of the
article is of value. The presentation is made cohesive by
use of linguistic and stylistic devices that have been cata-
logued by rhetoricians and which we believe may be de-
tected by automated means.
The research program will
 develop a catalogue of linguistic and non-
linguistic cues that capture both the linguistic
and stylistic techniques as well as the extensive
body of knowledge that has accumulated about
the rhetoric of science and how science is written
about;

 develop computationally realizable methods to
detect these cues;
 connect these cues to rhetorical relations; and
 organize the knowledge that these rhetorical rela-
tions represent as features in a decision tree that
produces the intended function of the citation.
Our purpose in using a decision tree is three-fold.
Firstly, the decision tree gives us ready access to the
citation-function decision rules. Secondly, we aim to
have a working indexing tool whenever we add more
knowledge to the categorization process. This goal ap-
pears very feasible given our design choice to use a
decision tree: adding more knowledge only refines the
decision-making procedure of the previous version. And
thirdly, as we gain more experience (currently, we are
building the decision tree by hand), we intend to use ma-
chine learning techniques to enhance our tool by inducing
a decision tree.
3.2 The Research Program
Our basic assumption is that the rhetorical relations that
will provide the information that will allow the tool to cat-
egorize the citations in a biomedical article are evident to
the reader through the use of surface linguistic cues, cues
which are linguistically-based but require some knowl-
edge that is not directly derivable from the text, and some
cues which are known to the culture of scientific readers-
writers because of the practice of science and how this
practice influences communication through the writing.
We rely on the notion that rhetorical information is
realized in linguistic ?cues? in the text, some of which,
although not all, are evident in surface features (cf. Hy-
land (1998) on surface hedging cues in scientific writing).
Since we anticipate that many such cues will map to the
same rhetorical features that give evidence of the text?s
argumentative and pragmatic meaning, and that the inter-
action of these cues will likely influence the text?s overall
rhetorical effect, the formal rhetorical relation (cf. (Mann
and Thompson, 1988)) appears to be the appropriate fea-
ture for the basis of the decision tree. So, our long-term
goal is to map between the textual cues and rhetorical re-
lations. Having noted that many of the cue words in the
prototype are discourse cues, and with two recent impor-
tant works linking discourse cues and rhetorical relations
((Knott, 1996; Marcu, 1997)), we began our investigation
of this mapping with discourse cues. We have some early
results that show that discourse cues are used extensively
with citations and that some cues appear much more fre-
quently in the citation context than in the full text (Mercer
and Di Marco, 2003). Another textual device is the hedg-
ing cue, which we are currently investigating (Mercer, Di
Marco, and Kroon, 2004).
Although our current efforts focus on cue words which
are connected to organizational effects (discourse cues),
and writer intent (hedging cues), we are also interested
in other types of cues that are associated more closely
to the purpose and method of science. For example, the
scientific method is, more or less, to establish a link to
previous work, set up an experiment to test an hypothe-
sis, perform the experiment, make observations, then fi-
nally compile and discuss the importance of the results of
the experiment. Scientific writing reflects this scientific
method and its purpose: one may find evidence even at
the coarsest granularity of the IMRaD structure in scien-
tific articles. At a finer granularity, we have many target-

ted words to convey the notions of procedure, observa-
tion, reporting, supporting, explaining, refining, contra-
dicting, etc. More specifically, science categorizes into
taxonomies or creates polarities. Scientific writing then
tends to compare and contrast or refine. Not surpris-
ingly, the morphology of scientific terminology exhibits
comparison and contrasting features, for example, exo-
and endo-. Science needs to measure, so scientific writ-
ing contains measurement cues by referring to scales (0?
100), or using comparatives (larger, brighter, etc.). Ex-
periments are described as a sequence of steps, so this is
an implicit method cue.
Since the inception of the formal scientific article in
the seventeenth century, the process of scientific discov-
ery has been inextricably linked with the actions of writ-
ing and publishing the results of research. Rhetoricians
of science have gradually moved from a purely descrip-
tive characterization of the science genre to full-fledged
field studies detailing the evolution of the scientific arti-
cle. During the first generation of rhetoricians of science,
e.g., (Myers, 1991), (Gross, 1996), (Fahnestock, 1999),
the persuasive nature of the scientific article, how it con-
tributes to making and justifying a knowledge claim, was
recognized as the defining property of scientific writing.
Style (lexical and syntactic choice), presentation (orga-
nization of the text and display of the data), and argu-
mentation structure were noted as the rhetorical means
by which authors build a convincing case for their results.
Recently, second-generation rhetoricians of science (e.g.,
(Hyland, 1998), (Gross et al, 2002)) have begun to me-
thodically analyze large corpora of scientific texts with
the purpose of cataloguing specific stylistic and rhetorical
features that are used to create the pragmatic effects that
contribute to the author?s knowledge claim. One particu-
lar type of pragmatic effect, hedging, is especially com-
mon in scientific writing and can be realized through a
wide variety of linguistic choices.
To catalogue these cues and to propose a mapping from
these cues to rhetorical relations, we suggest a research
program that consists of two phases. One phase is theory-
based: we are applying our knowledge from computa-
tional linguistics and the rhetoric of science to develop a
set of principles that guide the development of rules. An-
other phase is data-driven. This phase will use machine-
learning techniques to induce a decision tree.
Our two approaches are guided by a number of factors.
Firstly, the initial set of 35 categories ((Garzone, 1996),
(Garzone and Mercer, 2000)) were developed by combin-
ing and adding to the previous work from the information
science community with a preliminary manual study of
citations in biochemistry and physics articles. Secondly,
our next stages, cataloguing linguistic cues, will require
manual work by rhetoricians. Thirdly, and perhaps most
importantly, one group of cues is not found in the text,
but is rather a set of cultural guidelines that are accepted
by the scientific community for which the article is being
written. Lastly, we are interested not in the connection
between the citation functions and these cues per se, but
rather the citation functions and the rhetorical relations
that are signalled by the cues.
3.3 The Tool Implementation
Concerning the features on which the decision tree makes
its decisions, we have started with a simple, yet fully
automatic prototype (Garzone, 1996) which takes jour-
nal articles as input and classifies every citation found
therein. Its decision tree is very shallow, using only sets
of cue-words and polarity switching words (not, however,

etc.), some simple knowledge about the IMRaD struc-
ture1 of the article together with some simple syntactic
structure of the citation-containing sentence. The proto-
type uses 35 citation categories. In addition to having
a design which allows for easy incorporation of more-
sophisticated knowledge, it also gives flexibility to the
tool: categories can be easily coalesced to give users a
tool that can be tailored to a variety of uses.
Although we anticipate some small changes to the
number of categories due to category refinement, the ma-
jor modifications to the decision tree will be driven by
a more-sophisticated set of features associated with each
citation. When investigating a finer granularity of the IM-
RaD structure, we came to realize that the structure of
scientific writing at all levels of granularity was founded
on rhetoric, which involves both argumentation structure
as well as stylistic choices of words and syntax. This was
the motivation for choosing the rhetoric of science as our
guiding principle.
3.4 Evaluation of the Tool
Finally, as for our prototype system, at each stage of de-
velopment the tool will be evaluated:
 A test set of citations will be developed and
will be initially manually categorized by humans
knowledgeable in the scientific field that the arti-
cles represent.
 Of most essential interest, the classification accu-
racy of the citation-indexing tool will be evalu-
ated: we propose to use a combination of statisti-
cal testing and validation by human experts.
 In addition, we would like to assess the tool?s util-
ity in real-world applications such as database cu-
ration for studies in biomedical literature analy-
sis. We have suggested earlier that there may be
many uses of this tool, so a significant aspect of
the value of our tool will be its ability to enhance
other research projects.
1The corpus of biomedical papers all have the standard In-
troduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion or a slightly mod-
ified version in which Results and Discussion are merged.
4 Conclusions and Future Work
The purposeful nature of citation function is a feature of
scientific writing which can be exploited in a variety of
ways. We anticipate more-informative citation indexes as
well as more-intelligent database curation. Additionally,
sophisticated information extraction may be enhanced
when better selection of the dataset is enabled. For ex-
ample, synonym detection in a corpus of papers may be
made more tractable when the corpus is comprised of re-
lated papers derived from navigating a space of linked
citations.
In this paper we have motivated our approach to devel-
oping a literature-indexing tool that computes the func-
tions of citations. We have proposed that the function of a
citation may be determined by analyzing the rhetorical in-
tent of the text that surrounds it. This analysis is founded
on the guiding principle that the scientific method is in-
trinsic to scientific writing.
Our early investigations have determined that linguis-
tic cues and citations are related in important ways. Our
future work will be to map these linguistic cues to rhetor-
ical relations and other pragmatic functions so that this
information can then be used to determine the purpose of
citations.
