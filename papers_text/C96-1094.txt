In this paper, I discuss machine trans- 
lation of English text into a relatively 
"free" word order language, specifically 
Turkish. I present algorithms that 
use contextual information to determine 
what the topic and the focus of each sen- 
tence should be, in order to generate the 
contextually appropriate word orders in 
the target language. 
1 In t roduct ion  
Languages uch as Catalan, Czech, Finnish, Ger- 
man, Hindi, Hungarian, Japanese, Polish, Rus- 
sian, Turkish, etc. have much freer word order 
than English. For example, all six permutations 
of a transitive sentence are grammatical in Turk- 
ish (although SOV is the most common). When 
we translate an English text into a "free" word or- 
der language, we are faced with a choice between 
many different word orders that are all syntacti- 
cally grammatical but are not all felicitous or con- 
textually appropriate. In this paper, I discuss ma- 
chine translation (MT) of English text into 2hrk- 
ish and concentrate on how to generate the appro- 
priate word order in the target language based on 
contextual information. 
The most comprehensive project of this type is 
presented in (Stys/Zemke, 1995) for MT into Pol- 
ish. They use the referential form and repeated 
mention of items in the English text in order to 
predict the salience of discourse entities and or- 
der the Polish sentence according to this salience 
ranking. They also rely on statistical data, choos- 
ing the most frequently used word orders. I argue 
for a more generative approach: a particular in- 
formation structure (IS) can be determined from 
the contextual information and then can be used 
to generate the felicitous word order. This paper 
concentrates on how to determine the IS from con- 
textual information using centering, old vs. new 
information, and contrastiveness. (Hajifiov?/etal, 
1993; Steinberger, 1994) present approaches that 
determine the IS by using cues such as word order, 
definiteness, and complement semantic types (e.g. 
temporal adjuncts vs arguments) in the som:cc 
language, English. I believe that we cannot rely 
upon cues in the source language in order to de- 
termine the IS of the translated text. Instead, I
use contextual informati<)n i the target language 
to determine the IS of sentences in the target lan- 
guage. 
In section 2, I discuss the Information Struc- 
ture, and specifically th<~ topic and the focus in 
naturally occurring Turkish data. Then, in section 
3, I present algorithms for determining the topic 
and the focus, and show that we can generate con- 
textually appropriate word orders in '\[~/rkish using 
these algorithms in a simple MT implementation. 
2 In fo rmat ion  St ructure  
\]n the Information Structure (IS) that I use for 
Turkish, a sentence is first divided into a topic 
and a comment. The topic is the maiu ele- 
ment that the sentence is about, and the com- 
ment is the information conveyed about this toI)ic. 
Within the comment, we tind the focus, the most 
information-bearing const.itnent in the senten(:e, 
and the ground, the rest of the sentence. The fo 
cus is the new or important information in the sen- 
tence and receives prosodic prominence in speech. 
In Turkish, the pragmatic fimction of topic is 
assigned to the sentence-initial position mM the 
focus to the immediately preverbM position, fol- 
lowing (Erguvanh, 11984). The rest of the sentence 
forms the ground. 
In (Iloffman, 1995; Iloffman, 1995b), I show 
that the information structure components of 
topic and focus can be suecessfiflly used in gener- 
ating the context-appropriate nswer to database 
queries. Determining the topic and focns is fairly 
easy in the context of a simple question, however 
it is much more complica.ted in a text. In the fol-

lowing sections, I will describe the characteristics 
of topic, focus, and ground components of the 1S 
in natural ly occurring texts analyzed in (l loffman, 
1995b) and allude to possible algorithms for deter- 
mining them. The algorithms will then be spelled 
out in section 3. 
An example text from the cortms 1 is shown be- 
low. The noncanonical OSV word order in (1)b is 
contextual ly appropr iate because the object t)ro- 
noun is a discourse-old topic that links the se.n- 
tence to the previous context, and the sul)jeet, 
"your father",  is a discourse-new focus that is be- 
ing contrasted with other relatives. Discourse-old 
entities are those that  were previously mentioned 
in the discourse while discourse-new entil, ics are 
those that  were not (Prince, 1992).

(CHILDES lba.cha) 
Many people have suggested that "free" word 
order languages order information from old to new 
information. However, the Old-to-New ordering 
prim:iple is a generalization to which exceptions 
can be found. 1 believe that the order in which 
speakers place old vs. new items in a sentence re- 
flects the information structures that are awdlable 
to the speakers. The ordering is actually tile ' Ibpic 
followed by the Focus. Tile qbpic tends to be 
discourse-old in lbrmation and the focus disconrse- 
new. However, it is possible to have a disconrse- 
NEW topic and a discourse-OLD focus, as wc will 
see in the following sections, which explains the 
exceptions to the Old-To-New ordering principle.

sations, contemporary novels, and adult speedl from 
the CHILDES corpus.

the tol)ic of a sentence is, the tradit ional delinition

Figure 2: Given/New Status in Different Sentence Positions 
The Cb analyses of the canonical SOV and the 
noncanonical OSV word orders in 251rkish are 
summarized in Figure 1 (forthcoming study in 
(Hoffman, 1996)). As expected, the subject is 
often the Cb in the SOV sentences. However, 
in the OSV sentences, the object, not the sub- 
ject, is most often the Cb of the utterance. A 
comparison of the 20 discourses in the first two 
rows 2 of the tables in Figure 1 using the chi- 
square test shows that the association between 
sentence-position and Cb is statistically signifi- 
cant (X 2 = 10.10, p < 0.001). a Thus, the Cb, 
when it is not dropped, is often placed in the sen- 
tence initial topic position in Turkish regardless of 
whether it is the subject or the object of the sen- 
tence. The intditive reason for this is that speak- 
ers want to form a coherent discourse by imme- 
diately linking each sentence to the previous ones 
by placing the Cb and discourse-old topic in the 
sentence-initial position. 
There are also situations where no Cb or 
discourse-old topic can be found. Then, a 
discourse-new topic can be placed in the sentence- 
initial position to start a new discourse seg- 
ment. Discourse-new topics are often subjects or 
situation-setting adverbs (e.g. yesterday, in the 
morning, in the garden) in 3Mrkish. 
2.2 Focus 
The term focus has been used with many differ- 
ent meanings. Focusing is often associated with 
new information, but it is well-known that old in- 
formation, for example pronouns, can be focused 
as well. I think part of the confusion lies in the 
distinction between contrastive and presentational 
2The centering analysis is inconclusive in some 
cases because the subject and the object in the sen- 
tence are realized with the same referential form (e.g. 
both as overt pronouns or as full NPs). 
ZAlternatively, using the canonical SOV sentences 
as the expected frequencies, the observed frequencies 
for the noncanonical OSV sentences significantly di- 
verge from the expected frequencies (X 2 = 8.8, p < 
0.005). 
focus. Focusing discourse-new information is of- 
ten called presentational or informational focus as 
shown in (3)a. Broad/wide focus (focus projec- 
tion) is also possible where the rightmost element 
in the phrase is accented, but the whole phrase is 
in focus. However, we can also use focusing in or- 
der to contrast one item with another, and in this 
case the focus can be discourse-old or discourse- 
new, e.g. (3)b. 
(3) a. What did Mary do this summer? 
She \[wandered around TURKEY\]F.  
b. It wasn't \[ME\],., - It was \[HF, R\]e. 
(VMlduvf, 1992) defines fbcns as the most 
information-bearing constituent, and this defini- 
tion encompasses both contrastive and presenta- 
tional focusing. I use this definition of focus as 
well. However, as will see, we still need two differ- 
ent algorithms in order to determine which items 
are in focus in the target sentence in MT. We must 
check to see if they are discourse-new informat ion 
as well as checking if they are being contrasted 
with another item in the discourse model. 
In Turkish, items that are presentationally or
contrastively focused are placed in the immedi- 
ately preverbM (IPV) position and receive the pri- 
mary accent of the phrase. 4 As seen in Figure 2, 
brand-new discourse ntities are found in the,,IPV 
position, but never in other positions in the sen- 
tence in my Turkish corpus. The distribution of 
brand-new (the starred line of the table) versus 
discourse-old information (the rest of the table 5) 
is statistically significant, (X 2 = 10.847, p < .001). 
This supports the association of discourse-new \[b- 
cus with the IPV position. 
4Some languages uch as Greek and Russian treat 
presentational nd contrastive focus differently in 
word order. 
5 lnferrables refer to entities that the hearer can eas- 
ily accmnmodate based on entities already in the dis-. 
course model or the situation. Hearer-old entities are 
well-known to the speaker and hearer but not neces- 
sarily mentioned in the prior discourse (Prince, 1992). 
They both behave like discourse-oM entities. 
558 
However, as can be seen in Figure 2, most 
of the focused subjects in the OSV sentences in 
my corpus were actually discourse-old informa- 
tion. Discourse-old entities that occur in the IPV 
position are contrastively focused. In (Rooth, 
1985)'s alternative-set heory, a contrastively fo- 
cused item is interpreted by constructing a set 
of alternatives from which the focused item must 
be distinguished. Generalizing from his work, we 
can determine whether an entity should be con- 
trastively focused by seeing if we can construct an 
alternative set from the discourse model. 
2.3 Ground 
Those items that do not play a role in IS of the 
sentence as the topic or the focus form the ground 
of the sentence. In Turkish, discourse-old informa- 
tion that is not the topic or focus can be 
(4) a. dropped, 
b. postposed to the right of the verb, 
c. or placed unstressed between the topic and 
the focus. 
Postposing plays a backgrounding fnnction in 
Turkish, and it is very common. Often, speak- 
ers will drop only those items that are very salient 
(e.g. mentioned just in the previous sentence) and 
postpose the rest of the discourse-old items, lIow- 
ever, the conditions for dropping arguments can 
be very complex. (Turan, 1995) shows that there 
are semantic considerations; for instance, generic 
objects are often dropped, but specific objects 
are often realized as overt pronouns and fronted. 
Thus, the conditions governing dropping and post- 
posing are areas that require more research. 
3 The  Implementat ion  
In order to simplify the MT implementation, I 
concentrate on translating short and simple En- 
glish texts into Turkish, using an interlingua rep- 
resentation where concepts in the semantic repre- 
sentation map onto at most one word in the En- 
glish or Turkish lexicons. The translation pro- 
ceeds sentence by sentence (leaving aside ques- 
tions of aggregation, etc.), but contextual infor- 
mation is used during the incremental generation 
of the target text. These simplifications allow 
me to test out the algorithms for determining the 
topic and the focus presented in this section. 
In the implementation, first, an English sen- 
tence is parsed with a Combinatory Categorial 
Grammar, CCG, (Steedman, 1985). The semantic 
representation is then sent to the sentence plan- 
ner for Turkish. The Sentence Planner uses the 
algorithms in the following subsections to deter- 
mine the topic, focus, and ground from the given 
semantic representation ~md the discourse model. 
Then, the sentence planner sends the semantic 
representation and the information strncture it 
has determined to the sentence realization com- 
ponent for Turkish. This component consists of a 
head-driven bottom up generation algorithm that 
uses the semantic as well as the information strnc- 
ture features given by the planner to choose an ap- 
propriate head in the lexicon. The grammar used 
for the generation of 3hlrkish is a lexicalist formal- 
ism called Multiset-CCG (Hoffman, 1995; Iloff- 
man, 1995b), an extension of CCGs. Multiset- 
CCG was developed in order to capture formal 
and descriptive properties of "free" and restricted 
word order in simple and complex sentences (with 
discontinuous constituents and long distance de- 
pendencies). Mnltiset-CCG captures the context- 
dependent meaning of word order in 'Fnrkish by 
compositionally deriving the predicate-argument 
structure and the information strnctm'e of a sen- 
tence in parallel. 
The following sections describe the algorithms 
used by the sentence plauner to determine the IS 
of the 'lSlrkish sentence, given the semantic repre- 
sentation of a parsed English sentence. 
3.1 The  Top ic  A lgor i thm 
As each sentence is translated, we update the dis- 
course model, and keep track of the forward look- 
ing centers list (Cflist) of the last processed sen- 
tence. This is simply a list of all the discourse 
enities realized in that sentence ranked according 
to the theta-role hierarchy found in the semantic 
representation. Thus, the Cf list for the reI)re- 
sentation give(Pat, Chris, book) is the ranked list 
\ [Pat ,Chr i s ,book \ ] ,  where the subject is assmned 
to be more salient than the objects. 
Given the semantic representation for the sen- 
tence, the discourse model of the text processe(l 
so far, and the ranked C\[ lists of the current and 
previous sentences in the discourse, the follow- 
ing algorithm determines the topic of (;he sen- 
tence. First, the algorithm tries to choose the 
most salient discourse-old entity as the sentence 
topicf  If there is no discourse-old entity realized 
in the sentence, then a situation-setting adverb o, 
the subject is chosen as the discourse-new topic. 
l. Compare the current Cf list with the previous 
sentence's Cf list; and choose the firs( item 
that is a member of both of the ranked lists 
(the Cb). 
6(Stys/Zemke, 1995) use the saliency ranking to 
order the whole sentence in Polish. tIowever, \[ I)clieve 
that there is a distinct notion of topic and fo(:as in 
Turkish. 
559 
2. If 1 fails: Choose the first item in the current 
sentence's Cf list that is discourse-old (i.e. is 
already in the discourse model). 
3. If 2 fails: If there is a situation-setting ad- 
verb in the semantic representation (i.e. a 
predicate modifying the main event, in rep- 
resentation), choose it as the discourse-new 
topic. 
4. If 3 fails: choose the first item in the Cf list 
(i.e. the subject) as the discourse-new topic. 
Note that the determination of the sentence 
topic is distinct from the question of how to realize 
the salient Cb/topic (e.g. as a dropped or overt 
pronoun or full NP). In the MT domain, this can 
be determined by the referential form in the source 
text. This trick can also be used for accommodat- 
ing inferrable or hearer-old entities that behave as 
if they are discourse-old even though they are lit- 
erally discourse-new. If an item that is not; in the 
discourse model is nonetheless realized as a defi- 
nite NP in the source text, the speaker is treating 
the entity as discourse-old. This is very similar to 
(Stys/Zemke, 1995)'s MT system which uses the 
referential form in the source text to predict the 
topicality of a phrase in the target text. 
3.2 The Focus  Algor i thm 
Given the rest of the semantic representation for 
the sentence and the discourse model of the text 
processed so far, the following algorithm deter- 
mines the focus of the sentence. The first step is 
to determine presentational focusing of discourse- 
new information. Note that the focus, unlike the 
topic, can contain more than one element; this al- 
lows broad focus as well as narrow focusing. If 
there is no discourse-new information, the second 
step in the algorithm allows contrastive focusing 
of discourse-old information. In order to construct 
the alternative sets, a small knowledge base is used 
to determine the semantic type (agent, object, or 
event) of the entities in the discourse model. 
1. If there are any discourse-new entities (i.e. 
not in the discourse model) in the sentence, 
put their semantic representations into focus, 
2. Else for each discourse ntity realized in the 
sentence, 
(a) Look up its semantic type in the KB and 
construct an alternative set that consists 
of all objects of that type in the discourse 
model, 
(b) If the constructed alternative set is not 
empty, put the discourse ntity's eman- 
tic representation i to the focus. 
Once the topic and focus are determined, the re- 
mainder of the semantic representation is assigned 
as the gronnd. For now, items in the ground are ei- 
ther generated in between the topic and the focus 
or post-posed behind the verb as backgrounded 
information. Further research is needed to disa.m- 
biguate the use of the two possible word orders. 
Further esearch is also needed on the exact role 
of verbs in the IS. Verbs can be in the focus or 
the ground in Turkish; this cannot be seen in the 
word order, but it is distinguished by sentential 
stress for narrow focus readings. The algorithm 
above works for verbs since I place events that 
are realized as verbs in the sentence into the dis- 
course model as well. ltowever, verbs are usu- 
ally not in focus unless they are surprising or con- 
trastive or in a discourse-initiM context. Thus, the 
algorithm needs to be extended to a(:comnaodate 
discourse-new verbs that are nonetheless expected 
in some way into the ground component. In addi- 
tion, verbs often participate in broad focus read- 
ings, and fllrther research is needed to account for 
the observation that broad focus readings are only 
available in canonical word orders. 
3.3 Examples  
The English text in (5) is translated using the 
word orders in (6) following the Mgorithrns given 
above. In (6), the numbers following T and F indi- 
cate the step in the respective algorithm which de- 
termined the topic or focus for that sentence. Note 
that the inappropriate word orders (indicated by 
#)  cannot be generated by the algorithm. 
(5) a. Pat will meet Chris today. 
b. There is a tMk at four. 
c. Chris is giving the talk. 
d. Pat cannot come. 
(6) a. 
b. 
Bugiin Pat Chris'le bulu~acak. (AdvSOV) 
Today Pat Chris-with meet-flit. (T:3,F~I) 
D6rtde bir konu~ma vat. (AdvSV,#SAdvV) 
Four-Lot one talk exist. (T:3,F:I) 
c. Konu~mayl Chris w'.riyor. (OSV,#SOV) 
Talk-Ace Chris give-Prog. (T:I,F:2) 
d. 
Pat gelemiyecek. (SV,@VS) 
Pat come-Neg-Fu|;. ('F:2,F:I for the verb) 
The algorithms can also utilize long distance 
scrambling in 3~rkish, i.e. constructions where 
an element of an embedded clause has been ex- 
560 
tracted and scrambled into the matrix clause in 
order to play a role in the IS of the matrix clause. 
For example the b sentence in the following text is 
translated using long distance scrambling because 
"the talk" is the Cb of the utterance and there- 
fore the best sentence topic, even though it is the 
argument of an embedded clause. 
(7) a. There is a talk at four. 
b. Pat thinks that Chris will give the talk. 
(8) a. D6rtde bir konu~ma var. (AdvSV) 
Four-Lot one talk exist.

4 Conc lus ions  
In the machine translation task from Fnglish into 
a "free" word order language, it is crucial to 
choose the contextnally appropriate word order in 
the target language. In this paper, I discussed how 
to determine the appropriate word order using 
contextual information in translating into Turk- 
ish. I presented algorithms for deterndning the 
topic and the focus of the sentence. These algo- 
rithms are sensitive to whether the information is
old or new in the discourse model (incrementally 
constructed from the translated text); whether 
they refer to salient entities (using Centering The- 
ory); and whether they can be contrasted with 
other entities in the discourse model. Once the im 
formation structure for a semantic representation 
is constructed using these algorithms, the sentence 
with the contextually appropriate word order is 
generated in the target language using Multiset 
CCG, a grammar which integrates syntax and in- 
formation structure.
