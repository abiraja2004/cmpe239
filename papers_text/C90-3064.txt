This paper presents a report processing method with ohjcct-centered semantics. The syntactic 
analysis is performed along classical generative principles, though with a deliberately simple output 
as a list of index-value doublets, which the semantic module pr(messes using methods in an object- 
oriented framework. The final representation is made of two types of object-centered structures : llrst, 
case-like, event level dated structures corresponding to the Input clauses; second, detailed 
representation f the culTent state of an agent of the reference world, plus rccords tbr tile follow-up of 
a task over time. Uncertainty, imprecision and prevision are handled using specialized fields. This 
framework is applied to the processing of daily naval reports in English. 
I. In t roduct ion  
The objective of the project is the processing of 
messages in English reporting the daily evolution of 
naval  s i tuat ion  in the Medi ter ranean.  The 
information extracted is exploited for s i tuat ion 
monitoring, maintenance of a historical database, 
formulat ion of previs ions,  and detect ion of 
highlights and anomalies. 
A report typically gives information on the activity 
of one ship during the past 24 hours; for example: 
"La Belle Poulc is performing oceanographical 
measurement in the northern Mediterranean, while moving 
south at a speed of 5 knots. La Belle Poule was 
approxinlately 40 nautical miles south of Ma.rseille at 
10:00, April 14." 
This example exhibits discursive information on the 
c.urrcnt activity and movement of the ship and a 
spatio-temporal  plott ing relative to a reference 
location. 
2. Representat ion  
2. I. The taxonomy of  '~ermanent objects" 
The permanent  objects (Figure 1) are relatively 
perennial, non-event-based ntities which make up 
the fixed knowledge background or reference world. 
They ,are : 
- ships: instances of known ships; 
- spatial items : instances of zones and places, plus 
geographical directions; 
action types, down to preterminal c ass level (action 
instances are created upon parsing, as detailed 
Imreunder). Actions subclassit~ into activities and 
I I l ovcn lent : i ;  
Unlike action types, which arc not expectcd to be 
modified, new instances of ships and locations can be 
added intcractively to the taxonorny.

2.2. Sh~ame 
The ship frame indicates both the current state of a 
ship and indications on its activity. 
The general structure of a ship frame is : 
- status, a boolean (active/inactive) 
- ongoing tasks 
- c o m p l e t e d  tasks. This and the preceding field 
contain pointers to instances of the class "task", 
whose fields are : type (an activity}, start date, 
intermediate {last recorded) date, end date and 
location. 
- temporary  information : current  location, and, 
when available : goal, destination, geographical 
direction, companion ship, and speed; 
- list of spatio-temporal plottings. 
1 333  
2.3. Action frame 
Actions {event-level representat ion) are instances of 
the subc lasses  of the class "action". Modality va lues 
are attached : 
- to the action itself : 
- tempora l  aspect  : "previs ional",  "under-way",  
"completed". 
- d e g r e e  of cer ta in ty  : "observed" ,  "certa in"  
(meaning given as certain; this is the default  
value) ,  "probable" ,  "possible",  o rdered  by 
decreas ing cert~nty .  
- to the action parameters : 
- certainty, as above 
- precision : "exact", "approximate" 
2.4, lr~ference procedures 
The inference procedures,  implemented as methods 
and demons,  perform the following tasks : 
- check and complete new information 
- manage correspondence between fields (e.g, between 
the "goal" and "ongoing tasks" fields), tak ing 
modality values into account  
- l ook  for bet te r  moda l i t ies  (uncer ta in ty ,  
imprec is ion)  
- l aunch previsions 
- try to conf i rm active previsions 
- signal sal ient and anomalous  points. 
Previsions can be explicit in the text (future action; 
goal or destination), or scenario-related.

3. Syntactic analysis 
3.1, The ~ma;~:t~r 
Syntact ic  analys is  is per ibrmed by an augmented  
I)CG grauu',~ar. The output  is a list of doublets <p,v>, 
where p is either a preposit ion or a syntactic category, 
apd v the lcxical-semantic translat ion of the item(s), 
The \[risk of the analyzer is not domain-neutra l  and 
t'(:t purely grammat ica l  : 
- d~e "p" c lement of the doublets is in fact filtered and 
somet imes  t rans formed : p repos i t ions  wh ich  
trar~slate identical ly end up the same (but inversely, 
ambiguit ies caused Ey plurivocal preposit ions arc left 
for the sc~:i:antic processor to solve, mainly by the use 
of domain filtering); 
a lot of lexicon entr ies  are complex nouns  and 
vet-bai phrases  
A clause is represented in the output under the form : 
<ap, x-np,>.<vp, x-vp>.<x-prepl , Xl> . . . . .  
'QX - p1'cPI l ,  X l l>. l l \ [ l  
3.2. IVhat is ~ted  frorn s~jntact~a kncxvledge? 
There have been deeply contrasted posit ions on the 
role of syntax. It can be thought  of as a full-fledged 
first stage, as an auxi l iary  which  is suff ic ient ly 
informative ven when a complete syntactic st ructure 
per se (e.g. an x-barred tree) is not bui l t  (conceptual 
analysis : \ [Schank & Riesbeck 81\]), as a co-process in 
close cooperat ion with semant ics  (since SHRDLU), as 
the first in an ordered sequence of increasingly costly 
means (as suggested by \[Rau & Jacobs  87\], who then 
list slot-f i l l ing involv ing fi ltering, heur is t ics  when 
cho ices  a re  to be made,  and  genera l  domain  
knowledge). 
Grossly, syntax in itself  carr ies information on : 
- const i tuent  ordering and const i tuent  relat ionship 
- f lex ion  and syntact ic  funct ion (if the grammar  is 
re lat ional) .  
13ut more act ively,  syntact ic  ana lys is  backed by 
lexical semant ics ,  even if less sophist icated than in 
LFG or Mel 'cuk 's  model  for example,  can play an 
active part  in sorting i tems out  and ascribing them an 
adequate  t rans lat ion,  as for prepos i t ions  with an 
ident ical  meaning.  In fact, bes ides apply ing weil- 
formedness  rules,  the analyzer  and lexicon can do 
some rear rangements  o as to have the job all 
prepared for case attr ibut ion to function nicely. 
4. Semantic processing 
The system first searches a c lause for an action in the 
verb doublet  or, if the verb has translated as "empty"  
(for verbs like "perform", conduct"),  in the tbllowing 
noun phrase.  The field va luat ion mechan ism of the 
object env i ronment  checks that  the action value does 
belong to the declared domain.  An instance of the 
act ion type is created, and the system fills its fields 
with the va lues  it f inds in the second e lement  of the 
doublets; the condit ion on the first place \[preposition) 
is expressed as a parameter .  Domain  checking is 
again performed. A case-l ike structure is obtained. 
When t i le ac t ion  ins tance  has  completed  the 
va luat ion of its fields, it pours itself into an existing 
active task of the same ship if available, or else into a 
new task  it c reates .  Temporary  data  {current 
334 2 
direction, destination, speed, company and goal) are 
replaced without testing if the new values are 
different. If the new action is an activity rather than 
a movement, it will either merge into the last 
recorded task If it is the same or a compatible one, or 
will generate a new task, If it is declared to be 
completed, it is (re-)written into the completed-tasks 
field after its status flag has been set to "Inactive". If it 
is incompatible with an existing ongoing task, that 
task is closed 
For all of the above, a new modality for an already 
valuated field will be checked against the existing 
modality : a "better" modality (e.g. certain vs 
probable} supersedes the previous one, whereas a 
worse one is anomalous and can be signalled. The 
processing of the above example thus results in the 
crcaetion/updating of the following frames :
Output lists : 
(<np,I.a-Belle-Pmfle>.<vp,empty>.<oceanographical 
met~smement>. <in,northern-Mediterraaean>).

5. Related work 
The principled appl ication of structured object 
representat ion to semantic  processing had its 
operational landmarks in Bobrow and Winograd's 
KPd, and the systems developed by the Yale AI group 
(e.g. \[Schank & Riesbeck 811\]. \[Itirst 87\] proposes an 
overaU application of the object paradigrn, including 
to synta?, rather in the spirit of {Srnall & Rieger 82\]'s 
and (Flnck 89\]'s word experts. \[Fargues, Catach, 
I)ugourd 86\] use logic grammars, but with a semantic 
representation based on networks \[Sowa's conceptual 
graphs) rather than fi'ames. 
6. Implementation 
The system is implemented in Objlog (\[Dugerdil 89\]), a 
frame language based on Prolog II and featuring 
multiple inheritance with points of view, selective 
inheritance for value-sharing in relationships other 
than taxonomical ,  and dynamic facets. The 
grammar Itself is written in Prolog It. A menu-and- 
mouse interface has been developed for the 
IntexTogation module. 
7. Conclusion 
I have tried to show that objects are a convenient and 
efficient way to implement semantic representation 
as well as analysis in a reasonably small domain. 
Syntax based on a moderately strict set of well- 
formedness condit ions and some init iative In 
renaming is an appropriate partner for such a 
semantic analyzer.
