ABSTRACT 
We report on some recent improvements o an HMM- 
based, continuous peech recognition system which is 
being developed at AT&T Bell Laboratories. These 
advances, which include the incorporation of inter-word, 
context-dependent units and an improved feature 
analysis, lead to a recognition system which achieves 
better than 95% word accuracy for speaker independent 
recognition of the 1000-word, DARPA resource 
management task using the standard word-pair grammar 
(with a perplexity of about 60). It will he shown that the 
incorporation of inter-word units into training results in 
better acoustic models of word juncture coarticulation 
and gives a 20% reduction in error rate. The effect of an 
improved set of spectral and log energy features is to 
further reduce word error rate by about 30%. We also 
found that the spectral vectors, corresponding to the same 
speech unit, behave differently statistically, depending on 
whether they are at word boundaries or within a word. 
The results suggest hat intra-word and inter-word units 
should be modeled independently, even when they appear 
in the same context. Using a set of sub-word units 
which included variants for intra-word and inter-word, 
context-dependent phones, an additional decrease of 
about 10% in word error rate resulted. 
1. INTRODUCTION 
In the past few years there have been proposed a number 
of systems for large vocabulary, speaker-independent, 
continuous peech recognition which have achieved high 
word recognition accuracy \[1-5\]. The approach to large 
vocabulary speech recognition we adopt in this paper is a 
pattern recognition based approach. The basic speech 
units in the system use phonetic labels and are modeled 
acoustically based on a lexical description of words in 
the vocabulary. No assumption is made, a priori, about 
the mapping between acoustic measurements and sub- 
word linguistic units such as phonemes; such a mapping 
t Now with CSELT, Torino, Italy. 
is entirely learned via a finite training set of utterances. 
The resulting speech units, which we call phone-like 
units (PLU's) are essentially acoustic descriptions of 
linguistically-based units as represented in ttle words 
occurring in the given training set. 
In the baseline system reported in \[1\], acoustic modeling 
techniques for intra-word context-dependent PLU's were 
discussed. The focus of this paper is to extend the basic 
acoustic modeling techniques developed in \[1\] to include 
modeling of word juncture coarticulation and to 
incorporate higher-order time derivatives of cepstral and 
log energy parameters into the feature vector in order to 
improve speech recognition performance. 
We tested the improved acoustic modeling techniques on 
speaker-independent recognition of the DARPA Naval 
Resource Management task using both the word-pair 
(WP) and the no grammar (NG) conditions. For the 
FEB89 test set using the WP grammar, the word 
accuracy improved from 91.3% to 95.0% when both the 
inter-word context-dependent PLU's and an improved 
feature analysis were incorporated into the baseline 
system. We also observed that, for the first time, over 
70% sentence accuracy was achieved. The same level of 
improvement was also obtained for the OCF89 and the 
JUN90 test sets. 
2. BASELINE RECOGNITION SYSTEM 
There are three main modules in the baseline recognition 
system, namely a feature analysis module, a word-level 
acoustic match module and a sentence-level language 
match module. The speech is filtered from 100 Hz to 
3.8 kHz, and sampled at an 8 kHz rate and converted 
into a sequence of feature vectors at a frame rate of 10 
msec. Each (24-element) feature vector consists of 12 
liftered cepstral coefficients and 12 delta cepstral 
coefficients. The reader is referred to \[1\] for a detailed 
description of the acoustic analysis procedure. We will 
show later that higher order time derivatives of cepstral 
319 
and energy parameters can also be incorporated into the 
feature vectors to improve recognition performance. 
The word-level match module evaluates the similarity 
between the input feature vector sequence and a set of 
acoustic word models to determine what words were 
most likely spoken. The word models are generated via 
a lexicon and a set of sub-word models. In our current 
implementation, we use a slightly modified version of a 
lexicon provided by CMU. Every word in the 
vocabulary is represented by exactly one entry in the 
lexicon, and each lexical entry is characterized by a 
linear sequence of phone units. Each word model is 
composed as a concatenation of the sequence of sub- 
word models according to its corresponding lexical 
representation. A set of 47 context-independent phone 
labels is extracted from the lexicon and is used as the set 
of basic speech units throughout his study. Context- 
dependent units are also derived from this basic unit set. 
The sentence-level match module uses a language model 
(based on a set of syntactic and semantic rules) to 
determine the word sequence in a sentence. In our 
current implementation, we assume that the language 
model is fixed and can be represented by a finite state 
network (FSN). The word-level match module and the 
sentence-level match module work together to produce 
the mostly likely recognized sentence. 
2.1 PLU Modeling 
Each PLU is modeled as a left-to-fight hidden Markov 
model (HMM). All PLU models have three states, except 
for the silence PLU model which has only one state. 
Furthermore, no transition probabilities are used; forward 
and self transitions from a state are assumed equally 
likely. The state observation density of every PLU is 
represented by a multivariate Gaussian mixture density 
with a diagonal covariance matrix. 
To avoid singularity caused by an under-estimation f
the variance, we replaced all estimates whose values 
were in the lowest 20% with an estimate of the 20 
percentile value of the variance histogram. It can be 
shown \[7\] that such a variance clipping strategy results in 
the maximum a postedori estimate for the variance 
parameter, if we assume that the variance is known a 
priori to exceed a fixed threshold (which has to be 
estimated from a set of training data). 
Training of the set of sub-word units is accomplished by 
a modified version of the segmental k-means training 
procedure \[1,8\]. Since acoustic segments for different 
PLU labels are assumed independent, models for each 
unit can be constructed independently. By doing so, the 
computation requirement for HMM training is much less 
than the standard forward-backward HMM training. 
2.2 Creation of Context Dependent PLU's 
The idea behind creating context dependent PLU's is to 
capture the local acoustic variability associated with a 
known context and thereby reduce the acoustic variability 
of the set of PLU's. One of the earliest attempts at 
exploiting context dependent PLU's was in the BBN 
BYBLOS system where left and right context PLU's 
were introduced \[9\]. Given the set of 47 PLU's, a total 
of 473 -- 103823 CD PLU's could be obtained m theory. 
In practice, only a small fraction of them appear in 
words for a given task. However the number of CD 
PLU's is still very large (on the order of 2000-7000), 
making even a reasonable amount of training material 
insufficient to estimate all the CD PLU models with 
acceptable accuracy. Several techniques have been 
devised to overcome these training difficulties. Perhaps 
the simplest way is to use a unit reduction rule \[1\] based 
on the number of occurrences of a particular unit in the 
training set. 
2.3 Experimental Setup and Baseline Results 
Throughout his study, we used the training and testing 
materials for the DARPA naval resource management 
task. The speech database was originally provided by 
DARPA at a 16 kHz sampling rate. To make the 
database compatible with telephone bandwidth, we 
filtered and down-sampled the speech to an 8 kHz rate 
before analysis. The training set consists of a set of 
3990 read sentences from 109 talkers (30-40 
sentences/talker). For most of our evaluations, we used 
the so-called FEB89 test data which consisted of 300 
sentences from 10 new talkers (30 sentences/talker) as
distributed by DARPA in February 1989. 
A detailed performance summary of the baseline system 
and the techniques we used to achieve such a 
performance is given in \[1\]. In order to provide a 
consistent base of performance for comparison with the 
new results, we used a threshold of 30 in the unit 
reduction rule for all performance evaluations. When no 
inter-word units were used, a threshold of 30 resulted in 
a set of 1090 PLU's. With this set of units, we obtained 
a word accuracy of 91.3% and a sentence accuracy of 
58.7% on the FEB89 test set. 
3. WORD JUNCTURE MODELING 
Coarticulafion phenomena arising at the boundary 
between words are a major cause of acoustic variability 
for the initial and final parts of a word when spoken in 
continuous peech. If  this type of contextual variability 
is not adequately represented in the recogmtion system, 
errors are likely to occur. This is the case, for instance, 
when words in the dictionary are phonetically transcribed 
according to their pronunciations in isolation. The 
320 
solution to this problem is to provide a more precise 
phonetic representation of the region across word 
boundaries. Different approaches may be taken to achieve 
this goal, depending on which type of coarticulation 
phenomenon is handled. In \[10\] we characterized two 
different types of pronunciation changes at word 
junctures, namely soft and hard changes. In soft 
changes, the alteration of a phone due to neighboring 
phones is comparatively small and the actual realization 
is perceived as a variation of the original phone rather 
than a transformation to a different phone. This alteration 
is of the same nature as the one observed in intra-word 
phones. By contrast, in hard changes, a boundary phone 
may undergo a complete deletion or a substitution by a 
totally different phone. It was experimentally shown that 
phonological rules were effective in coping with errors 
generated by hard changes (a 10% error rate reduction 
\[10\]). However for soft changes, it has been shown that 
the use of context-dependent phone-like units is most 
effective. Such units specify context-independent phones 
according to their context, i.e. the preceding phone and 
the following phone. Context-dependent phones are not 
very effective with hard changes because these changes 
are comparatively rare and the training material is not 
sufficient o model the units that would represent them. 
Soft changes occur more frequently in the training set 
and hence we can model such changes imilar to the way 
we model the set of intra-word units. 
3.1 Word Juncture Phonological Rules 
In the current set-up, phonological rules are employed 
with the set of 47 context-independent phone units. The 
phonological rules have been implemented both in the 
training as well as in the recognition procedure. The 
reason for introducing the rules during training is that 
they give a more precise phonetic transcription of the 
training sentences and hence allow a better segmentation 
and, consequently, better estimation of model parameters. 
In preliminary experiments, it was seen that about 50% 
of the rule corrective power is actually due to training. 
Recognition is based on a modified version of the 
frame-synchronous beam search algorithm described in 
\[1\]. A detailed summary of the experimental results 
using phonological rules can be found in \[10\]. Based on 
the set of 47 context-independent PLU's, training on 
3200 utterances and testing on 750 utterances, we found 
that a 10% error rate reduction can he obtained. 
Although the set of phonological rules was applied rarely 
in both training and in recognition, the application of 
phonological rules was shown very effective in dealing 
with the hard word juncture changes which are difficult 
to model statistically. 
321 
3.2 Inter-word Context-Dependent Units 
Several schemes have been proposed for modeling and 
incorporating inter-word, context-dependent phones into a 
continuous peech recognition system. The methodology 
we adopted for inter-word unit modeling is described in 
detail in \[11\]. Since the initial phone of each word 
depends on the final phone of the preceding word and 
similarly for the final phone of each word, there are 
many more context-dependent, inter-word units than 
intra-word units. In the 109 speaker training set, there 
are roughly 5500 inter-word units compared to only 
1,800 intra-word units. Therefore the training issues 
outlined above become even more complicated. 
Moreover, in recognition, since it is not known a priori 
which words will precede or follow any given word, the 
words have to be represented with all their possible 
initial and final phones. In addition, for reasons that will 
he explained below, words consisting of one single 
phone (e.g. "a") have to be treated with special care; thus 
further increasing the complication of the recognition and 
training procedures. 
The complete set of units, including both intra-word and 
inter-word units, was chosen according to the same unit 
reduction rule described in \[1\]. By varying the value of 
the threshold T different PLU inventories can be obtained 
and tested. Based on the reduction rules, the inter-word 
units generated include double-context units (triphones), 
single-context units (diphones) and context-independent 
units (monophones). A typical implementation discussed 
in the literature \[2\] use only tliphones and monophones; 
however we found diphones quite helpful in our 
implementation. Using the same threshold, i.e. T=30, 
we obtain a set of 1282 units, including 1101 double- 
context units, 99 left-context units, 35 right-context units 
and 47 context-independent uni s. It is noted here that in 
our modeling strategy, every acoustic segment in the 
training data has only one PLU label and is used only 
once in training to create a sub-word model of the 
particular phone unit. 
Training is based on a modified version of the segmental 
k-means training procedure \[1,8\]. However, due to the 
presence of inter-word units, cross-word connections 
need to be handled properly in the segmentation part of 
the procedure. Segmentation is carried out on the finite 
state network (FSN) that represents each utterance in 
terms of PLU's. Since context-dependent i er-word 
PLU's are available, there is no discontinuity between 
words. However, optional silences are allowed between 
words; in such cases PLU's having either a left or right 
silence context are used. 
The recognizer used in our research is based on a 
modified version of the flame-synchronous beam search 
algorithm \[1\]. However due to the presence of the 
compficated inter-word connection structure, the finite 
state network representing the task grammar is converted 
into an efficient compiled network to minimize 
computation and memory overhead. The reader is 
referred to \[12\] for a detailed description of the 
recognizer implementation. The recognizer is run with 
no grammar (i.e. every word can follow every other 
word) or with a word pair grammar. 
A detailed summary of the experimental results using 
inter-word units can be found in \[l l\]. Based on the set 
of 1282 PLU's, the recognition performance was 93.0% 
word accuracy and 63.7% sentence accuracy for the 
FEB89 test set. A comparison with the results obtained 
without using inter-word units (i.e. the 1090 PLU set) 
shows that a 20% error rate reduction resulted. 
After a close examination of the recognition results, 
several observations can be made. First, there are less 
errors on function words (e.g. "a", "the", etc.), because a
better word juncture coarticulation model gives a better 
representation of those highly variable short words. 
Second, we observed a much higher likelihood score 
when inter-word units are used in both training and 
recognition. We also found that, when an utterance was 
misrecognized, the likelihood difference between the 
recognized and the correct strings was smaller than that 
with only intra-word units. This shows that the 
misrecognized utterance is more likely to be corrected 
when better acoustic modeling techniques are 
incorporated into the system. We now discuss some 
techniques for obtaining an improved feature set. 
4. IMPROVED FEATURE ANALYSIS 
So far, we have discussed the criteria for the selection of 
the set of fundamental units, shown how to expand the 
set to include both intra-word and inter-word, context- 
dependent PLU's and discussed how to properly model 
these units. In this section, we focus our discussion on 
an improved front-end feature analysis. Since we are 
using a continuous density HMM approach for 
characterizing each of the sub-word units, it is fairly 
straightforward to incorporate new features into our 
feature vectors. Specifically, we study the incorporation 
of higher order time derivatives of short-time cepstral 
features and log energy features, such as the second 
cepstral derivatives (delta-delta cepstrum), the log energy 
derivative (delta energy), and the second log energy 
derivative (delta-delta energy), into our system. 
Second Order Cepstral Time Derivatives 
The incorporation of first order time derivatives of 
cepstral coefficients has been shown useful for both 
speech recognition and speaker verification. Thus we 
322 
were interested in investigating the effects of 
incorporating higher order cepstral time derivatives. 
There are several ways to incorporate the second order 
time-derivative of the cepstral coefficients. All the 
existing approaches evaluate the second derivatives 
(called delta-delta cepstrum) as the time derivatives of 
the first order time derivative - so called delta cepstrum. 
The degree of success m using such a strategy for the 
delta-delta cepstrum computation was mixed. The only 
continuous peech recognition system which used using 
the delta-delta cepstral features was reported by Ney 
\[13\]. Ney tested the system using speaker independent 
recognition of the DARPA naval resource management 
task, and showed a very significant improvement when 
testing the recognizer without using any grammar. 
However, for the word-pair grammar, there was no 
significant improvement in performance. 
In our evaluation, we used a 3-frame window (i.e. an 
overall window of 70 msecs for both delta and delta- 
delta cepstrum). The m 'h delta-delta cepstral coefficient 
at frame I was approximated as
Azct(m) = K - \ [Act+ l (m) -Act_ l (m) l  (1) 
where Act(m) is the estimated m 'n delta cepstral 
coefficient evaluated at frame l, and K is a scaling 
constant which was fixed to he 0.375 (no optimization 
was attempted to find a better value of the normalization 
constant o optimize the k-means clustering part of the 
training algorithm). 
We augment he original 24-dimensional feature vector 
with 12 additional delta-delat cesptral features giving a 
36-dimensional feature vector. We then tested this new 
feature analysis procedure on the resource management 
task using the word-pair grammar. We tested cases both 
with and without the use of inter-word units. The per 
speaker word accuracies are summaried in Table 1. The 
effect of adding the delta-delta cepstral parameters on 
recognition performance (using both inter-word and 
intra-word units) on the set of 1282 PLU's, was that the 
performance improved from 93.0% (column 2) to 93.8% 
(column 3) on the FEB89 test set. The error rate 
reduction for the latter case was not as much as the 
former case. For the inter-word case (1282 PLU), we 
ran four iterations of the segmental k-means training 
procedure. We also tested models generated in all four 
iterations. It is worth noting that the best average 
performance was achieved using the model generated 
from the fourth iteration (shown in column 3). When 
comparing performance on a per speaker basis, the 
results showed that the addition of the delta-delta cepstral 
features to the overall spectral feature vector is not 
always beneficial for each speaker. For example, there is 
a significant performance degradation for speaker 1 
(cmhl8) in the 1282 PLU case. We also observed a 
large variability in speaker performance using models 
obtained from various iterations. We therefore manually 
extracted the best performance among all four iterations, 
for each speaker, and list the results in column 4 of 
Table 1. It is interesting to note that the average best 
performance is much better (16% reduction in error rate) 
than the results listed in column 3. Our conjecture is 
that the second order cepstral analysis produces very 
noisy observations based on a 30 msec window and a 10 
msec frame shift. Another concem is the effectiveness of
each of the additional features. In Ney \[13\], a pre- 
selected set of delta and delta-delta cepstral features was 
used. To be more effective, an automatic feature 
selection algorithm should be used to determine the 
relative importance of all spectral analysis features.

cepstmm test results 
A few observations can be made from the above results. 
Overall it can be seen that the incorporation of second 
order time derivatives of cepstral parameters improves 
recognition performance significantly. However the 
second order time derivatives are very noisy in the sense 
that they produce features which are not always 
beneficial and they are not stable over the segmental k- 
means training iterations. From the last column of Table 
1, it is clear that improved performance could be 
achieved if we could stablize the features across training 
iterations. One way to improve the feature analysis is to 
carefully select new features o that only features that are 
useful for discrimination are included in the feature 
vector. Another way is to combine features through a 
principal component analysis. 
323 
4.1 Log Energy Time Derivatives 
The first order time derivatives of the log energy values, 
known as delta energy, have been shown useful in a 
number of recognition systems. Most systems use both 
energy and delta energy parameters as features. In order 
to use the energy parameter, careful normalization is 
required. In our baseline system, the energy parameter 
was normalized syllabically. We did not include the 
energy parameter m the feature vector; instead we used 
the energy parameter to assign a penalty term to the 
likelihood of the observed feature vector. However, we 
have found that the delta and delta-delta energy 
parameters are more robust and more effective 
recognition features. Similar to the evaluation of the 
delta cepstrum, the delta energy at frame l is 
approximated as a linear combination of the energy 
parameters m a 5 frame window centered at frame l. 
Since the energy parameter has a wider dynamic range 
in value, we used a smaller constant (0.0375) for the 
evaluation of the delta energy. Again, we did not 
attempt to optimize the k-means clustering part by 
adjusting the normalization constant. 
The second order time derivatives of the energy 
parameters, called the delta-delta energy, are computed 
similar to the way the delta-delta cepstral features are 
evaluated. Starting with the 24-element feature vector, 
by adding delta-delta cepstrum, delta energy and delta- 
delta energy to the feature set, for every frame 1, we have 
a 38-element feature vector O~ of the form 
Ot = {cl(l:12), A~t(l:12), A2ct(l:12), Aet, A2et} (2) 
where ~t(l:12) and A~t(l:12) are the 12 liftered cepstral 
coefficients and the 12 delta cepstral coefficients; and 
A2ct(l:12), Aet and A2e t are the additional 12 delta-delta 
cepstral coefficients, the delta energy parameter and the 
delta-delta energy parameter at frame l respectively. 
We tested the use of energy time derivatives on the 
FEB89 test with the word pair grammar. All the tests 
used the set of 1282 PLU's, and the test results are 
summarized in Table 2. When compared with the results 
shown in Table 1, we observed a very significant overall 
improvement when delta energy is incorporated (shown 
in column 2). We also note that the improvement varies 
from speaker to speaker. For example, delta energy 
helps eliminate a lot of word errors for speaker 1 
(cmhl8). When delta-delta energy is added to form a 
38-dimensional feature vector, we observe the same 
effect as shown in Table 1, i.e. delta-delta energy is not 
always beneficial. However, for some talkers (cmhl8, 
dwa05 and lns03) the improvement is significant. There 
is no overall improvement; however all the test speakers 
achieve over 92% word accuracy. We show in column 4, 
the best achievable performance for each talker using 
various feature combinations. The best achievable 
average performance is over 96% word accuracy.

5. POSITION-DEPENDENT UNIT MODELING 
For all our experiments we have selected the set of basic 
speech units based on context. However, it is believed 
that the spectral features of units within words behave 
differently acoustically from those of units at the word 
boundaries even when the units appear in the same 
context. We investigated this conjecture by selecting 
intra-word and inter-word units independently based on 
the same unit reduction rule. We call such a selection 
strategy position-dependent unit selection. With a 
threshold of 30, we obtained a total of 1769 units, 
including 913 intra-word and 856 inter-word units. For 
the ihtra-word units, we have 639 units in double 
context, 98 left-context and 176 right-context units and 
47 context-independent u its. For the inter-word units, 
we end up with 480 units in double context, 310 left- 
context, 2 right-context units and 46 context-independent 
units. We use the same modeling strategy described in 
Section 3, except that when creating the FSN for 
segmentation and recognition, only inter-word units can 
appear at the word boundaries and only intra-word units 
can appear within words. 
Using such a position-dependent unit selection strategy, 
we found that all the sub-word unit models are more 
focused in the sense that the spectral variability is less 
than the case in which we combine common intra-word 
and inter-word unit models. Two interesting 
observations are worth mentioning. First, when 
recognition is performed with the beam search algorithm, 
the number of alive nodes is much less in the 1769 PLU 
case than that in the 1282 PLU case. Second, the unit 
separation (in terms of likelihood) distance is larger for 
the 1769 PLU set than that for the 1282 PLU set. The 
unit separation distance is measured as follows. We first 
collect all sets of PLU's such that all the units which 
have the same middle phone symbol p are grouped into 
the same set S e regardless of their context and 
environment. We compute the distance between each 
pair of units m a set. The distance between units P2 and 
P1 is defined as the difference between average 
likelihoods of observing all acoustic segments with label 
P2 and observing all acoustic segments with label P1 
given the model for unit P l .  For each unit, we then 
define the unit separation distance as the smallest 
distance among all other units m the same set. When 
examing the histogram for the unit separation distances 
for the 1769 PLU set, we found a quite remarkable unit 
separation. Almost all the unit separation distances are 
larger than 2 (in log likelihood). It is also interesting to 
note that units appearing in the same context but in a 
different environment (i.e. intra-word versus inter-word) 
show the same behavior as units appearing in different 
context. The average unit separation distance is about 9. 
For the 1282 PLU set, the histogram plot is skewed to 
the left and the unit separation characteristics are not as 
pronounced as those of the 1769 PLU set. 
Results on the resource management task using the 1769 
PLU set showed a significant improvement (about 10% 
error reduction) in performance over the 1282 PLU set 
using both the WP grammar and the NG grammar. We 
also tested the OCT89 set which consists of 300 test 
utterance (30 each from a group of 10 speakers), and the 
JUN90 set which consists of 480 test utterances (120 
each from a group of two female and two male talkers). 
Detailed results for all three test sets using both the WP 
and NG cases are summarized in Tables 3 and 4 
respectively. A careful examination of the word error 
patterns hows that function words still account for about 
60% of the word errors. The second dominant category, 
which accounts for more than 20% of the errors, are 
confusions involving the same root word (e.g. location 
versus locations, six versus sixth, Flint versus Flint's, 
chop versus chopped, etc.) appearing in different forms. 
This type of errors can easily be corrected with a simple 
set of syntactic and semantic rules.

It is interesting to note that for the speaker-independent 
part of the evaluation data, we achieved virtually the 
same level of performance, 95.5% word accuracy and 
over 70% sentence accuracy, for both the FEB89 and 
OCT89 test data. However, for the JUN90 test set, the 
word accuracy fell to 94.9%. The sentence accuracy of 
70.2% was also considerably lower than that for the 
FEB89 and OCT89 test sets. This was due to the fact 
that one of the female test talkers 0rm08) gave a very 
poor result, namely 90.8% word accuracy. The median 
word accuracy among all four JUN90 test talkers was 
over 95.5%. Another possible explanation for this 
performance degradation is that the speaker-dependent 
part of the test utterances was generated from a set of 
sentence patterns whose context was significantly 
different from the set of sentences used to generate the 
109-speaker t aining set. This bnngs up the issue of the 
adequacy of training data. The above discussion 
suggests that a task-specific training set is more useful 
than a task-independent training set. This agrees 
somewhat with results reported in \[14\], where the so 
called "vocabulary-independent" training procedure is 
effective only when most of the task-specific tfiphone 
contexts appear in the training corpus. 
Even though only a small improvement in performance 
was obtained in our test, we believe the real benefit of 
incorporating position-dependent PLU modeling lies in 
the area of model prediction for units appearing rather 
infrequently in the training data. We are now 
experimenting with a unit expansion rule, which uses the 
unit reduction nile first (based on a lower count 
threshold) to get a set of auxiliary speech units which are 
the units to be expanded into a complete set. The only 
remaining issue is how to predict the model for units in 
the auxiliary set. For each existing model, we compute 
the likelihood of observing all the acoustic segments 
corresponding to each auxiliary unit. Then we assign the 
model that is the closest to each of the auxiliary speech 
units. The effectiveness of such an approach is yet to be 
evaluated. 
6. SUMMARY 
We have reported on several improvements to one of the 
speaker-independent, continuous speech recognition 
systems developed at AT&T Bell Laboratories. The 
improved acoustic modeling, including incorporation of 
inter-word units and an improved feature analysis, 
provided high word accuracies for all three DARPA 
evaluation sets using the word pair grammar. We have 
also developed a unit selection rule for selecting intra- 
word and inter-word units independently. We anticipate 
that with the proposed unit expansion rule, an even better 
set of units can be obtained which will further improve 
acoustic modeling techniques for continuous speech 
recognition. 
Based on current recognition performance it seems fair to 
say that when task-specific training data are provided for 
acoustic modeling of the set of basic speech units using 
HMM's, high performance can be achieved for a large 
vocabulary, speaker-independent, continuous speech 
recognition task with a perplexity of about 60. However, 
there are still some open issues that need to be 
addressed. The reader is referred to a recent paper \[15\] 
for a discussion of some of those issues related to using 
HMM's for speech recognition. We list, in the following, 
a number of acoustic modeling issues which we believe 
to be essential for expanding the capabilities of our 
current continuous peech recognition system. They are: 
(1) Speech unit selection and modeling for task- 
independent applications; (2) Improved word 
discrimination based on some form of corrective training 
for continuous density HMM parameters (e.g. \[16\]); (3) 
Lexical modeling to deal with lexical variability in 
baseform pronunciation; and (4) Improved feature 
selection so that only those features useful to 
discrimination are included in the feature vector. 
Our tasks so far have been mainly focused on speech 
recognition. We observed that short function words (e.g. 
"a", "the") are a major source of recognition errors. 
However, most of those errors can be corrected using a 
set of simple syntactic and semantic rules operating in a 
325 
post-processing mode. For example, for the resource 
management task, we have developed a language decoder 
(decoupled from the acoustic decoder) that incorporates a 
set of simple rules. Our preliminary results \[17\] indicate 
that sentence accuracy for the FEB89 test set improved 
from 70% to close to 90% (with 98% word accuracy) 
when the top candidate string decoded using the word- 
pair grammar is used as input to this language decoder. 
When no grammatical constraints were used in speech 
decoding, the sentence accuracy improved from 24% to 
67% (with 90% word accuracy). Except in cases where 
some key content words were misrecognized, the simple 
language analyzer properly decoded the noisy strings 
provided by the speech decoder without going back to 
the acoustic domain to request mismatch information. 
We believe the language decoder can be more effective if
the speech decoder can provide more word and string 
hypotheses. One way to get more information is to use 
the N-best string search strategies. Another way is to 
construct, in acoustic decoding, a phone lattice and a 
word lattice that contain more word hypotheses, and then 
generate recognized strings according to the language 
constraints. The effectiveness of such approaches in real 
spoken language tasks, such as the DARPA Air Travel 
Information System (ATIS) task, is yet to be evaluated.
