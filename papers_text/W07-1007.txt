Abstract
We present a corpus-driven method for
building a lexicon of semantically equiva-
lent pairs of technical and lay medical terms.
Using a parallel corpus of abstracts of clin-
ical studies and corresponding news sto-
ries written for a lay audience, we identify
terms which are good semantic equivalents
of technical terms for a lay audience. Our
method relies on measures of association.
Results show that, despite the small size of
our corpus, a promising number of pairs are
identified.
1 Introduction
The field of health literacy has garnered much at-
tention recently. Studies show that most docu-
ments targeted at health consumers are ill-fitted to
the intended audience and its level of health liter-
acy (Rudd et al, 1999; McCray, 2005). While there
are many components involved in health literacy that
are specific to the reader (e.g., reading level and cul-
tural background), we investigate what can be done
from the standpoint of the text to adapt it to the liter-
acy level of a given reader. As such, we set ourselves
in the context of a text-to-text generation system,
where a technical text is edited to be more compre-
hensible to a lay reader. An essential resource for
such an editing tool is a lexicon of paraphrases, or
semantically equivalent terms. In this paper, we in-
vestigate a corpus-driven method for building such
a lexicon. We focus on terms that are recognized by
the UMLS (UMLS, 1995), both for technical and lay
candidate terms for equivalence.
Because we have lay audiences in mind, our defi-
nition of semantic equivalence must be broader than
a notion of strict medical equivalence utilized by
medical experts. Thus, while a medical dictionary
like UMLS assigns different concept unique identi-
fiers (CUIs) to two particular terms, such as percu-
taneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and an-
gioplasty, these terms should be considered seman-
tically equivalent for the purposes of lay readers.
Besides enabling a text tailoring system to adapt
technical texts for a lay audience, a lexicon of
semantically equivalent technical/lay terms would
benefit other tools as well. For instance, the Con-
sumer Health Vocabulary initiative1 is a comprehen-
sive list of UMLS terms familiar to lay readers. Our
lexicon could help augment the terms with equiva-
lence links to technical terms. While much research
of late has been devoted to identifying terms incom-
prehensible to lay readers, such research has not es-
tablished links between technical terms and equiva-
lent lay terms beyond their CUI information (Zeng
et al, 2005; Elhadad, 2006).
The key points of our approach are: (1) the use
of combined measures of association to identify
pairs of semantically equivalent terms, and (2) a
knowledge-based heuristic which acts as a powerful
filter for identifying semantically equivalent pairs.
Our method does not rely on human labeling of se-
mantically equivalent term pairs. As such, it is un-
supervised, and achieves results that are promising
considering the small size of the corpus from which
the results are derived.
This paper is organized as follows. The next sec-
tion describes our parallel corpus of paired techni-
cal/lay documents. The Methods section describes
the different measures of association we experi-
mented with, how we combine them to leverage their
complimentary strengths, and our semantic filter.
The Results section reports the evaluation against
our gold standard and a discussion of our results.

2 Data Description
Because our ultimate goal is to learn, in a data-
driven fashion, semantic equivalents of terms that
are too technical for lay readers, we can benefit from
having instances of texts which relay similar infor-
mation but are conveyed in different styles. We
collect a corpus similar in structure to those used
in the field of statistical machine translation. But,
instead of having two collections in different lan-
guages, we collect texts written for two different au-
diences: medically trained readers (technical collec-
tion) and health consumers (lay collection).
The lay collection is composed of news stories
from the ReutersHealth E-line newsfeed2 summariz-
ing research in the medical field. Reuters journalists
take technical publications and report the main find-
ings and methods and, on occasion, include inter-
views with the authors of the scientific publication.
The stories are targeted at a lay audience with a 12th-
grade reading level. Furthermore, every story in our
collection contains a reference to the original scien-
tific publication. Thus, it is possible to gather the
original texts, which convey similar information but
were written for a technical audience. The stories
draw upon studies from reputable medical journals,
such as Annals of Internal Medicine, New England
Journal of Medicine and Lancet.
The technical collection in our corpus is com-
posed of the original scientific articles correspond-
ing to each news story in the lay collection. Accord-
ingly, the lay and technical collections contain the
same number of documents and are parallel at the
document level. That is, each technical document
has a lay equivalent and vice-versa. Because a lay
document is a summary of a technical article and is,
hence, much shorter than the original scientific ar-
ticle, we decided to include only the abstract of the
technical document in our collection. This way, the
technical and lay documents are comparable in con-
tent and length. It should be noted, however, that
the content in a technical/lay document pair is not
parallel, but comparable (McEnery and Xiao, 2007):
there is no natural sentence-to-sentence correspon-
dence between the two texts. This is to be expected:
technical abstracts contain many technical details,
while lay stories, to provide background, introduce

information entirely absent from abstracts. In addi-
tion, the lay stories drastically rearrange the order in
which information is typically conveyed in technical
abstracts. For these reasons, our corpus is not paral-
lel at the sentence level and, thus, differs from other
bilingual parallel corpora used in machine transla-
tion.
To ensure that some significant number of terms
appears with sufficient frequency in our corpus in
order to induce equivalent pairs automatically, we
focused on articles and stories in a single domain:
cardiology. We identified the original scientific ar-
ticle manually, as the lay document only contains a
reference, not an actual link. For this reason, only a
relatively small amount of data could be collected:
367 pairs of documents (see Table 1 for statistics).
3 Methods
3.1 Data Processing
We focus in this paper on finding term equiva-
lents when both terms are recognized by the UMLS.
Thus, our first step in processing our collections is to
identify terms as defined by the UMLS. Both collec-
tions are processed by our tool TermFinder (Teufel
and Elhadad, 2002). Sentences are identified and the
texts are tokenized and tagged with part-of-speech
information. Noun phrases are identified with a shal-
low parser. Next, terms are identified by looking up
the noun phrases in the meta-lexicon of UMLS for
an exact match. Terms are tagged with their con-
cept unique identifier (CUI) and a semantic type,
both provided by UMLS. For our purposes, we only
consider a subset of all the terms listed in UMLS,
based on their semantic type. This is due to the
fact that certain UMLS semantic types are unlikely
to yield technical terms in need of simplification.
As such, terms belonging to semantic types such
as ?Activity,? ?Family Group? or ?Behavior? were
left untagged. Terms with semantic types such as
?Disease or Syndrome? or ?Therapeutic or Preven-

tive Procedure,? on the other hand, were considered
terms. For instance, both the terms PTCA and percu-
taneous transluminal coronary angioplasty have the
same CUI C0002997, as they are considered syn-
onyms by UMLS. The term balloon angioplasty has
the CUI C0002996. Both C0002997 and C0002996
have the semantic type ?Therapeutic or Preventive
Procedure.?
3.2 Contingency Table
We call (tech term, lay term) a term pair, where
tech term is a term occurring in one or more tech-
nical documents and lay term is a term present
in at least one of the corresponding lay docu-
ments.3 For any such pair, we can compute a
contingency table based on co-occurrence. Our
definition of co-occurrence is slightly unusual:
tech term and lay term co-occur in one document
pair if tech term appears at least once in the techni-
cal document and lay term appears at least once in
the corresponding lay document. Our unit of content
is document frequency for a CUI, i.e., the number of
documents in which a given CUI appears. For in-
stance, in our data, the contingency table for the term
pair (MI, heart attack) shows the following counts:
the document frequency of the CUI corresponding
to MI in the technical collection is 98; the docu-
ment frequency of the CUI corresponding to heart
attack in the lay collection is 161. Among these doc-
uments, there are 84 technical/lay document pairs
(out of the total of 367 paired documents) in which
the CUI for MI occurs on the technical side and the
CUI for heart attack occurs on the lay side. Hence,
the contingency table for this term pair is, following
3This means that if tech term and lay term have no tech-
nical/lay document in common, lay term is not considered a
possible candidate for semantic equivalence for tech term.
the notations of Table 2: a = 84, b = 98-84 = 14, c =
161-84 = 77, and d = 367-98-161+84 = 192.
At this stage of processing, lexical terms are ab-
stracted by their CUIs. We do this to maximize the
possible evidence that two terms co-occur. For in-
stance, the document frequency for MI in our tech-
nical collection is 20, while the document frequency
for its corresponding CUI is 98. Section 3.7 de-
scribes how we proceed from identifying equivalent
terms at the CUI level to finding lexical equivalents.
3.3 Gold Standard
To evaluate the validity of our approach, we col-
lected all possible term pairs at the CUI level in our
corpus (that is, all the term pairs for which a con-
tingency table is computed). We then whittled this
set down to those pairs where each CUI occurs in
at least two documents. This resulted in 2,454 pairs
of CUIs. We asked our medical expert, an internist
in practice who interacts with patients on a daily ba-
sis, to indicate for each pair whether the terms were
equivalent from a medical standpoint in the con-
text of communicating with a patient.4 An opera-
tional test for testing the equivalence of two terms is
whether he would use one term for the other when
talking to a patient. We indicated to our expert that
the terms should be equivalent out of context. So,
for instance, while the pair (myocardial infarction,
complication) could be deemed equivalent in certain
specific contexts, these terms are not generally con-
sidered equivalent. Table 3 shows examples of pairs
annotated as semantic equivalents for lay readers.5
The list of terms contained only the actual lexical
terms and no information from the UMLS to avoid
biasing our expert.
Out of the 2,454 CUI pairs provided to our medi-
cal expert, 152 pairs were labeled as equivalent. Out
of the 152 pairs, only 8 (5.3%) had different seman-
tic types. Interestingly, 84 pairs (55.3%) had differ-
ent CUIs. This confirms our intuition that the notion
of semantic equivalence for lay readers is looser than
for medically knowledgeable readers.
4While it is in some ways counterintuitive to rely on a tech-
nical expert to identify lay semantic equivalents, this expertise
helps us validate equivalences from a medical standpoint.

3.4 Measures of Association
Given a term pair (tech term, lay term) and its cor-
responding contingency table, we want to determine
whether lay term is a valid semantic equivalent of
tech term from the standpoint of a lay reader. We
rely on three alternative measures of association in-
troduced in the Statistics literature: the ?2 statis-
tic, the ? measure, and odds ratio. All of these
measures are computed as a function of the contin-
gency table, and do not rely on any human labeling
for equivalence. Measures of association have been
used traditionally to identify collocations (Manning
and Schu?tze, 1999). Here we investigate their use
for building a lexicon.
3.4.1 The ?2 Statistic
The standard chi-square statistic (?2) is used
to determine whether the deviation of observed
data from an expected event occurs solely by
chance (Goodman and Kruskal, 1979). Our null
hypothesis for this task is that the presence of
lay term in a lay document is independent of the
presence of tech term in its correspondent techni-
cal document. Thus, any pair of terms for which the
?2 is above the critical value at a given level of sig-
nificance are considered semantic equivalents. One
important constraint for the measures to be valid is
that the observed data be large enough (more than
five observations per cell in the contingency table).
The ?2 statistic for our 2x2 contingency table,
and with N being the total number of document
pairs, is calculated as follows:
?2 = N(ad ? bc)
2
(a + b)(a + c)(c + d)(b + d)
Since ?2 is a true statistic, we can rely on critical
values to filter out pairs with low associative power.
In our case, we set the significance level at .001
(with a critical value for ?2 of 10.83).

Sum 53 314 367

C0011847).
3.4.2 The ? and ?* Measures
The lambda measure (?) assesses the extent to
which we can predict the presence of lay term in a
lay document by knowing whether the original tech-
nical document contained tech term (Goodman and
Kruskal, 1979). ? is an asymmetrical measure of
association. Since a lay document is always writ-
ten based on an original technical document, it is
a plausible assumption that the presence of a spe-
cific term in the technical document influenced the
lexical choices of the author of the lay document.
Thus, we consider the presence of tech term in a
technical document the antecedent to the presence
of lay term in the corresponding lay document, and,
accordingly, operate in the setting of predicting the
presence of lay term.
We present the intuition behind ? in the context
of the following example. Consider the contingency
table for the technical CUI C0011849 (diabetes mel-
litus) and C0011847 (diabetes) in Table 4. The task
is, given a random lay document, to predict which of
two available categories it belongs to: either it con-
tains the lay CUI (in our example, CUI C0011847
for diabetes) or it does not. There are two possi-
ble cases: either (1) we do not have any knowl-
edge about the original technical document, or (2)
we know the original technical document and, there-
fore, we know whether it contains the antecedent (in
our example, CUI C0011849 for diabetes mellitus).
Without any prior knowledge (case (1)), the
safest prediction we can make about the lay doc-
ument is the category with the highest probabil-
52
ity. The probability of error in case (1) is Perr1 =
N?Max(a+c,b+d)
N .In our example, the safest bet is ? C0011847, with
a raw count of 314 documents, and a probability of
error of Perr1 = 0.1444.
If we have prior knowledge about the original
technical document (case (2)), then our safest pre-
diction differs. If we know that the technical doc-
ument contains the CUI C0011849 (diabetes melli-
tus), then our safest prediction is the category with
the highest probability: C0011847, with a raw count
of 13 documents. If, on the other hand, we know
that the technical document does not contain the
CUI C0011849, our safest prediction is the category
? C0011847, with a raw count of 306 documents.
Thus, overall the probability of error in case (2) is
Perr2 = N?(Max(a,b)+Max(c,d))N .In our example, knowledge about the original tech-
nical document lowers the probability of error to
Perr2 = 0.1308.
The ? measure is defined as the relative decrease
in probability of error in guessing the presence of
lay term in a lay document ? = Perr1?Perr2Perr1which, using our notation for contingency tables,
can be expressed as
? = Max(a, b) + Max(c, d) ? Max(a + c, b + d)N ?Max(a + c, b + d)
In our example, ? = 0.094. ? ranges between 0
and 1. A value of 1 means that knowledge about
the presence of tech term in the original techni-
cal document completely specifies the presence of
lay term in its corresponding lay document. A value
of 0 means that knowledge about the presence of
tech term in the original technical document does
not help in predicting whether lay term is present in
its corresponding lay document.
The ? measure is not a test of significance like
?2. For instance, while two independent variables
necessarily have a ? of 0, the opposite is not neces-
sarily true: it is possible for two dependent variables
to have a ? of 0. In our setting in particular, any
contingency table where a=b will provide a ? of 0.
Since ? is computed as a function of maxima of
rows and columns, ? can easily be biased toward the
original proportions in the antecedent. In our exam-
ple, for instance, a very large proportion of technical
documents has no occurrence of C0011849, diabetes
mellitus (94.3% of the technical documents). But
for our purposes, such contingencies should not af-
fect our measure of association, as the proportion of
technical documents happening not to contain a par-
ticular term is just an artificial consequence of cor-
pus collection. ?* is a variant of ? also proposed by
Goodman and Kruskal (1979) and is able to take this
fact into account. It is computed using the same for-
mula as ?, but the elements of the contingency table
are modified so that each category of the antecedent
is equally likely. In our case, this means: N*=1,
a*=0.5a/N(a+b), b*=0.5b/N(a+b), c*=0.5c/N(c+d),
and d*=0.5d/N(c+d). Going back to our example of
diabetes mellitus and diabetes, we now find ?? =
0.324, which is much higher than the original ? of
0.094, and which indicates a strong association.
We focus on ?* as a measure of association for
semantic equivalence of term pairs. Since ? and ?*
are not true statistics, there is no significance level
we can rely on to set a threshold for them. Instead,
we estimate an optimal threshold from the perfor-
mance of ?* on a development set. The develop-
ment set was obtained in the same manner as the
gold standard and contains 50 term pairs. This is
a small number of pairs, but the term pairs in the
development set were carefully chosen to contain
mostly semantically equivalent pairs. In our experi-
ments, the optimal value for ?* was 0.3. Thus, ?* is
used as a binary test for our purposes: tech term and
lay term are considered semantically equivalent if
their ?* is above 0.3.
3.4.3 Odds Ratio
Odds ratio is a measure of association that focuses
on the extent to which one category in the contin-
gency table affects another (Fleiss et al, 2003). For
our contingency table, the odds ratio is expressed as
follows:
OR = adbc
For instance, given the contingency table of Ta-
ble 4, the odds ratio for the pair (diabetes mellitus,
diabetes) is 12.43, which means that a lay docu-
ment is 12.43 times more likely to contain the CUI
C0011847, for diabetes, if its original technical doc-
ument contains the term C0011849, for diabetes
mellitus.
53
Like ?*, odds ratio is not a true statistic and,
therefore, does not have any critical value for sta-
tistical significance. We estimated the optimal value
of a threshold for OR based on the same develop-
ment set described above. The threshold for OR is
set to 6. Thus, OR is used as a binary test for our
purposes: tech term and lay term are considered
semantically equivalent if their OR is above 6.
3.5 Combining the Measures of Association
Each of the measures of association described above
leverages different characteristics of the contingency
tables, and similarly, each has its limitations. For
instance, ?2 cannot be computed when there are
not sufficient observations, and ?* can equal 0, even
when there is a strong association between the two
terms. We combine measures of association in the
following fashion: two terms are considered equiva-
lent if at least one of the measures determined so.
3.6 Semantic Filtering
The measures of association described above and
their combination provide information solely based
on corpus-derived data. Since all our counts are
based on co-occurrence, a measure of association by
itself can encompass many types of semantic rela-
tions. For instance, the pair for (stroke, brain) tests
positive with our three measures of association. In-
deed, there is a strong semantic association between
the two terms: strokes occur in the brain. These
terms, however, do not fit our definition of seman-
tic equivalence.
We rely on knowledge provided by the UMLS,
namely semantic types, to help us filter equiv-
alent types of associations among the candidate
term pairs. One can assume that sharing semantic
types is a necessary condition for semantic equiva-
lence. Our semantic filter consists of testing whether
tech term and lay term share the same semantic
types, as identified by our tool TermFinder.
3.7 Lexical Choice
So far, term pairs are at the CUI level. The measures
of association and the semantic filter provide a way
to identify candidates for semantic equivalence. We
still have to figure out which particular lexical items
among the different lexical terms of a given CUI are
appropriate for a lay reader. For instance, the pair
(C0027051, C0027051) is considered a good candi-
date for semantic equivalence. In the technical col-
lection, the lexical terms contributing to the CUI are
AMI, AMIs, MI, myocardial infarction, myocardial
infarct and myocardial necrosis. In the lay collec-
tion, however, the lexical terms contributing to the
same CUI are heart attack, heart attacks, and my-
ocardial infarction. Clearly, not all lexical items for
a given CUI are appropriate for a lay reader.
To select an appropriate lay lexical term, we rely
on the term frequency of each lexical item in the
lay collection (Elhadad, 2006). In our example, the
lexical term ?heart attack? has the highest term fre-
quency in the lay collection among all the variants
with the same CUI. Thus, we chose it as a semantic
equivalent of any lexical term of the CUI C0027051
in the technical collection.
If a technical term has several candidate semantic
equivalents at the CUI level, the lexical lay term is
chosen among all the lay terms. For instance, (ad-
verse effect, side effect) and (adverse effect, compli-
cations) are two valid equivalents, but side effects
has a term frequency of 16 in our lay collection, and
complications has a lay term frequency of 35. Thus,
complication is selected as the lay equivalent for ad-
verse effect.
4 Results
We report on the two steps of our system: (1) find-
ing semantic equivalents at the CUI level, and (2)
finding an appropriate lay lexical equivalent.
Finding Semantic Equivalents at the CUI Level
Table 5 shows the precision, recall and F-measure
(computed as the harmonic mean between precision
and recall) against our gold standard for the three
alternative measures of association, including dif-
ferent combinations of these, and also adding the
semantic filter. In addition, we report results for a
competitive baseline based solely on CUI informa-
tion, where tech term and lay term are considered
equivalent if they have the same CUI.
The baseline is fairly competitive only because
of its perfect precision (CUI in Table 5). Its recall,
however (44.7), indicates that building a lexicon of
technical and lay equivalents based solely on CUI
information would miss too many pairs within the
UMLS.

Table 5: Precision, Recall and F measures for different variants of the system.
Relying on only one measure of association with-
out any semantic filtering to determine semantic
equivalents is not a good strategy: ?* (lam in Ta-
ble 5), ?2(chi) and OR (odds), by themselves, yield
the worst F measures. Interestingly, the measures
of association identify different equivalent pairs in
the pool of candidate pairs. Thus, combining them
increases the coverage (or recall) of the system.
For instance, ?* by itself has a low recall of 20.4
(lam). When combined with OR, it improves the re-
call from 74.3 (odds) to 77 (lam,odds); when com-
bined with ?2, it improves the recall from 23.7 (chi)
to 39.5 (chi,lam). Combining the three measures
of association (chi,lam,odds) yields the best recall
(80.3), confirming our hypothesis that the measures
are complementary and identify pairs with different
characteristics in our corpus.
While combining measures of association im-
proves recall, the semantic filter is very effective in
filtering inaccurate pairs and, therefore, improving
precision: ?*, for instance, improves from a pre-
cision of 40.8 (lam) to 76.3 (sem,lam) when the
filter is added, with very little change in recall.
The best variant of our system in terms of F mea-
sure is, not surprisingly, combining the three mea-
sures of association and adding the semantic filter
(sem,chi,lam,odds in Table 5).
The results of these experiments are surprisingly
good, considering that the contingency tables are
built from a corpus of only 367 document pairs and
rely on document frequency (not term frequency).
These quantities are much smaller than those used
in machine translation, for instance.
Finding Lay Lexical Equivalents We evaluate
our strategy for finding an appropriate lay lexical
item on the list of 152 term pairs identified by our
medical expert as semantic equivalents. Our strat-
egy achieves an accuracy of 86.7%.
5 Related Work
Our work belongs to the field of paraphrase identi-
fication. Much work has been done to build lexi-
cons of semantically equivalent phrases. In gener-
ation systems, a lexicon is built manually (Robin,
1994) or by relying on an electronic thesaurus like
WordNet (Langkilde and Knight, 1998) and setting
constraints on the type of accepted paraphrases (for
instance, accepting only synonyms as paraphrases,
and not hypernyms). Building paraphrase lexicons
from a corpus has also been investigated. Jacquemin
and colleagues (1997) identify morphological and
syntactic variants of technical terms. Barzilay and
McKeown (2001) identify multi-word paraphrases
from a sentence-aligned corpus of monolingual par-
allel texts. One interesting finding of this work is
that the mined paraphrases were distributed across
different semantic links in WordNet: some para-
phrases had a hypernym relation, while others were
synonyms, and others had no semantic links at all.
The composition of our gold standard confirms this
finding, since half of the semantically equivalent
terms had different CUIs (see Table 3 for examples
of such pairs).
If we consider technical and lay writing styles as
two sublanguages, it is easy to see an analogy be-
tween our task and that of machine translation. Iden-
tifying translations for words or phrases has been
deeply investigated in the field of statistical machine
translation. The IBM models of word alignments are
the basis for most algorithms to date. All of these are
instances of the EM algorithm (Expectation Maxi-
mization) and rely on large corpora aligned at the
sentence level. We cannot apply an EM-based model
to our task since we have a very small corpus of
paired technical/lay documents, and EM requires
large amounts of data to achieve accurate results.
Moreover, the technical and lay documents are not
parallel, and thus, we do not have access to a sen-
55
tence alignment. Of course, our task is easier than
the one of machine translation, since we focus on
?translating? only technical terms, rather than every
single word in a technical document.
Gale and Church (1991) do not follow the EM
model, but rather find French translations of English
words using a ?2-like measure of association. Their
corpus is the parallel, sentence-aligned Hansard cor-
pus. Our method differs from theirs, as we do build
the contingency table based on document frequen-
cies. Gale and Church employ sentence-level fre-
quencies. Our corpus is much smaller, and the sen-
tences are not aligned (for comparison, we have
367 document-pairs, while they have nearly 900,000
sentence pairs). Another difference between our ap-
proach and theirs is our use of the semantic filter
based on UMLS. We can afford to have such a filter
because we focus on finding semantic equivalents of
UMLS terms only.
6 Conclusions and Future Work
We presented an unsupervised method for identi-
fying pairs of semantically equivalent technical/lay
terms. Such a lexicon would benefit research in
health literacy. In particular, it would benefit a sys-
tem which automatically adapts a medical technical
text to different levels of medical expertise.
We collected a corpus of pairs of technical/lay
documents, where both documents convey similar
information, but each is written for a different au-
dience. Based on this corpus, we designed a method
based on three alternative measures of association
and a semantic filter derived from the UMLS. Our
experiments show that combining data-driven statis-
tics and a knowledge-based filter provides the best
results.
Our method is concerned specifically with pairs
of terms, as recognized from UMLS. While UMLS
provides high coverage for technical terms, that is
not the case for lay terms. In the future, we would
like to extend our investigation to pairs consisting
of a technical term and any noun phrase which is
sufficiently frequent in our lay collection. Finding
such pairs would have the side effect of augmenting
UMLS, a primarily technical resource, with mined
lay terms. One probable step towards this goal will
be to increase the size of our corpus of paired tech-
nical and lay documents.
