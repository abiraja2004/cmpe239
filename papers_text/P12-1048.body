Abstract
To adapt a translation model trained from
the data in one domain to another, previous
works paid more attention to the studies of
parallel corpus while ignoring the in-domain
monolingual corpora which can be obtained
more easily. In this paper, we propose a
novel approach for translation model adapta-
tion by utilizing in-domain monolingual top-
ic information instead of the in-domain bilin-
gual corpora, which incorporates the topic in-
formation into translation probability estima-
tion. Our method establishes the relationship
between the out-of-domain bilingual corpus
and the in-domain monolingual corpora vi-
a topic mapping and phrase-topic distribution
probability estimation from in-domain mono-
lingual corpora. Experimental result on the
NIST Chinese-English translation task shows
that our approach significantly outperforms
the baseline system.
1 Introduction
In recent years, statistical machine translation(SMT)
has been rapidly developing with more and more
novel translation models being proposed and put in-
to practice (Koehn et al., 2003; Och and Ney, 2004;
Galley et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2006; Chiang, 2007;
Chiang, 2010). However, similar to other natural
language processing(NLP) tasks, SMT systems of-
ten suffer from domain adaptation problem during
practical applications. The simple reason is that the
underlying statistical models always tend to closely

ship at Baidu.
approximate the empirical distributions of the train-
ing data, which typically consist of bilingual sen-
tences and monolingual target language sentences.
When the translated texts and the training data come
from the same domain, SMT systems can achieve
good performance, otherwise the translation quality
degrades dramatically. Therefore, it is of significant
importance to develop translation systems which can
be effectively transferred from one domain to anoth-
er, for example, from newswire to weblog.
According to adaptation emphases, domain adap-
tation in SMT can be classified into translation mod-
el adaptation and language model adaptation. Here
we focus on how to adapt a translation model, which
is trained from the large-scale out-of-domain bilin-
gual corpus, for domain-specific translation task,
leaving others for future work. In this aspect, pre-
vious methods can be divided into two categories:
one paid attention to collecting more sentence pairs
by information retrieval technology (Hildebrand et
al., 2005) or synthesized parallel sentences (Ueffing
et al., 2008; Wu et al., 2008; Bertoldi and Federico,
2009; Schwenk and Senellart, 2009), and the other
exploited the full potential of existing parallel cor-
pus in a mixture-modeling (Foster and Kuhn, 2007;
Civera and Juan, 2007; Lv et al., 2007) framework.
However, these approaches focused on the studies of
bilingual corpus synthesis and exploitation while ig-
noring the monolingual corpora, therefore limiting
the potential of further translation quality improve-
ment.
In this paper, we propose a novel adaptation
method to adapt the translation model for domain-
specific translation task by utilizing in-domain
459
monolingual corpora. Our approach is inspired by
the recent studies (Zhao and Xing, 2006; Zhao and
Xing, 2007; Tam et al., 2007; Gong and Zhou, 2010;
Ruiz and Federico, 2011) which have shown that a
particular translation always appears in some spe-
cific topical contexts, and the topical context infor-
mation has a great effect on translation selection.
For example, ?bank? often occurs in the sentences
related to the economy topic when translated into
?y?inha?ng?, and occurs in the sentences related to the
geography topic when translated to ?he?a`n?. There-
fore, the co-occurrence frequency of the phrases in
some specific context can be used to constrain the
translation candidates of phrases. In a monolingual
corpus, if ?bank? occurs more often in the sentences
related to the economy topic than the ones related
to the geography topic, it is more likely that ?bank?
is translated to ?y?inha?ng? than to ?he?a`n?. With the
out-of-domain bilingual corpus, we first incorporate
the topic information into translation probability es-
timation, aiming to quantify the effect of the topical
context information on translation selection. Then,
we rescore all phrase pairs according to the phrase-
topic and the word-topic posterior distributions of
the additional in-domain monolingual corpora. As
compared to the previous works, our method takes
advantage of both the in-domain monolingual cor-
pora and the out-of-domain bilingual corpus to in-
corporate the topic information into our translation
model, thus breaking down the corpus barrier for
translation quality improvement. The experimental
results on the NIST data set demonstrate the effec-
tiveness of our method.
The reminder of this paper is organized as fol-
lows: Section 2 provides a brief description of trans-
lation probability estimation. Section 3 introduces
the adaptation method which incorporates the top-
ic information into the translation model; Section
4 describes and discusses the experimental results;
Section 5 briefly summarizes the recent related work
about translation model adaptation. Finally, we end
with a conclusion and the future work in Section 6.
2 Background
The statistical translation model, which contains
phrase pairs with bi-directional phrase probabilities
and bi-directional lexical probabilities, has a great
effect on the performance of SMT system. Phrase
probability measures the co-occurrence frequency of
a phrase pair, and lexical probability is used to vali-
date the quality of the phrase pair by checking how
well its words are translated to each other.
According to the definition proposed by (Koehn
et al., 2003), given a source sentence f = fJ1 =
f1, . . . , fj , . . . , fJ , a target sentence e = eI1 =
e1, . . . , ei, . . . , eI , and its word alignment a which
is a subset of the Cartesian product of word position-
s: a ? (j, i) : j = 1, . . . , J ; i = 1, . . . , I , the phrase
pair (f? , e?) is said to be consistent (Och and Ney,
2004) with the alignment if and only if: (1) there
must be at least one word inside one phrase aligned
to a word inside the other phrase and (2) no words
inside one phrase can be aligned to a word outside
the other phrase. After all consistent phrase pairs are
extracted from training corpus, the phrase probabil-
ities are estimated as relative frequencies (Och and
Ney, 2004):
?(e?|f?) =
count(f? , e?)
?
e??
count(f? , e??)
(1)
Here count(f? , e?) indicates how often the phrase pair
(f? , e?) occurs in the training corpus.
To obtain the corresponding lexical weight, we
first estimate a lexical translation probability distri-
bution w(e|f) by relative frequency from the train-
ing corpus:
w(e|f) =
count(f, e)
?
e?
count(f, e?)
(2)
Retaining the alignment a? between the phrase pair
(f? , e?), the corresponding lexical weight is calculated
as
pw(e?|f? , a?) =
|e?|?
i=1
1
|{j|(j, i) ? a?}|
?
?(j,i)?a?
w(ei|fj) (3)
However, the above-mentioned method only
counts the co-occurrence frequency of bilingual
phrases, assuming that the translation probability is
independent of the context information. Thus, the
statistical model estimated from the training data is
not suitable for text translation in different domains,
resulting in a significant drop in translation quality.

3 Translation Model Adaptation via
Monolingual Topic Information
In this section, we first briefly review the principle
of Hidden Topic Markov Model(HTMM) which is
the basis of our method, then describe our approach
to translation model adaptation in detail.
3.1 Hidden Topic Markov Model
During the last couple of years, topic models such
as Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (Hof-
mann, 1999) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation mod-
el (Blei, 2003), have drawn more and more attention
and been applied successfully in NLP community.
Based on the ?bag-of-words? assumption that the or-
der of words can be ignored, these methods model
the text corpus by using a co-occurrence matrix of
words and documents, and build generative model-
s to infer the latent aspects or topics. Using these
models, the words can be clustered into the derived
topics with a probability distribution, and the corre-
lation between words can be automatically captured
via topics.
However, the ?bag-of-words? assumption is an
unrealistic oversimplification because it ignores the
order of words. To remedy this problem, Gruber et
al.(2007) propose HTMM, which models the topics
of words in the document as a Markov chain. Based
on the assumption that all words in the same sen-
tence have the same topic and the successive sen-
tences are more likely to have the same topic, HTM-
M incorporates the local dependency between words
by Hidden Markov Model for better topic estima-
tion.
HTMM can also be viewed as a soft clustering
tool for words in training corpus. That is, HT-
MM can estimate the probability distribution of a
topic over words, i.e. the topic-word distribution
P (word|topic) during training. Besides, HTMM
derives inherent topics in sentences rather than in
documents, so we can easily obtain the sentence-
topic distribution P (topic|sentence) in training
corpus. Adopting maximum likelihood estima-
tion(MLE), this posterior distribution makes it pos-
sible to effectively calculate the word-topic distri-
bution P (topic|word) and the phrase-topic distribu-
tion P (topic|phrase) both of which are very impor-
tant in our method.
3.2 Adapted Phrase Probability Estimation
We utilize the additional in-domain monolingual
corpora to adapt the out-of-domain translation mod-
el for domain-specific translation task. In detail, we
build an adapted translation model in the following
steps:
? Build a topic-specific translation model to
quantify the effect of the topic information on
the translation probability estimation.
? Estimate the topic posterior distributions of
phrases in the in-domain monolingual corpora.
? Score the phrase pairs according to the prede-
fined topic-specific translation model and the
topic posterior distribution of phrases.
Formally, we incorporate monolingual topic in-
formation into translation probability estimation,
and decompose the phrase probability ?(e?|f?)1 as
follows:
?(e?|f?) =
?
tf
?(e?, tf |f?)
=
?
tf
?(e?|f? , tf ) ? P (tf |f?) (4)
where ?(e?|f? , tf ) indicates the probability of trans-
lating f? into e? given the source-side topic tf ,
P (tf |f?) denotes the phrase-topic distribution of f? .
To compute ?(e?|f?), we first apply HTMM to re-
spectively train two monolingual topic models with
the following corpora: one is the source part of
the out-of-domain bilingual corpus Cf out, the oth-
er is the in-domain monolingual corpus Cf in in the
source language. Then, we respectively estimate
?(e?|f? , tf ) and P (tf |f?) from these two corpora. To
avoid confusion, we further refine ?(e?|f? , tf ) and
P (tf |f?) with ?(e?|f? , tf out) and P (tf in|f?), respec-
tively. Here, tf out is the topic clustered from the
corpus Cf out, and tf in represents the topic derived
from the corpus Cf in.
However, the two above-mentioned probabilities
can not be directly multiplied in formula (4) be-
cause they are related to different topic spaces from
1Due to the limit of space, we omit the description of the cal-
culation method of the phrase probability ?(f? |e?), which can be
adjusted in a similar way to ?(e?|f?) with the help of in-domain
monolingual corpus in the target language.
461
different corpora. Besides, their topic dimension-
s are not assured to be the same. To solve this
problem, we introduce the topic mapping probabili-
ty P (tf out|tf in) to map the in-domain phrase-topic
distribution into the one in the out-domain topic s-
pace. To be specific, we obtain the out-of-domain
phrase-topic distribution P (tf out|f?) as follows:
P (tf out|f?) =
?
tf in
P (tf out|tf in) ? P (tf in|f?) (5)
Thus formula (4) can be further refined as the fol-
lowing formula:
?(e?|f?) =
?
tf out
?
tf in
?(e?|f? , tf out)
?P (tf out|tf in) ? P (tf in|f?) (6)
Next we will give detailed descriptions of the cal-
culation methods for the three probability distribu-
tions mentioned in formula (6).
3.2.1 Topic-Specific Phrase Translation
Probability ?(e?|f? , tf out)
We follow the common practice (Koehn et al.,
2003) to calculate the topic-specific phrase trans-
lation probability, and the only difference is that
our method takes the topical context information in-
to account when collecting the fractional counts of
phrase pairs. With the sentence-topic distribution
P (tf out|f) from the relevant topic model of Cf out,
the conditional probability ?(e?|f? , tf out) can be eas-
ily obtained by MLE method:
?(e?|f? , tf out)
=
?
?f ,e??Cout
count?f ,e?(f? , e?) ? P (tf out|f)
?
e??
?
?f ,e??Cout
count?f ,e?(f? , e??) ? P (tf out|f)
(7)
where Cout is the out-of-domain bilingual training
corpus, and count?f ,e?(f? , e?) denotes the number of
the phrase pair (f? , e?) in sentence pair ?f , e?.
3.2.2 Topic Mapping Probability P (tf out|tf in)
Based on the two monolingual topic models re-
spectively trained from Cf in and Cf out, we com-
pute the topic mapping probability by using source
word f as the pivot variable. Noticing that there
are some words occurring in one corpus only, we
use the words belonging to both corpora during the
mapping procedure. Specifically, we decompose
P (tf out|tf in) as follows:
P (tf out|tf in)
=
?
f?Cf out
?
Cf in
P (tf out|f) ? P (f |tf in) (8)
Here we first get P (f |tf in) directly from the top-
ic model related to Cf in. Then, considering the
sentence-topic distribution P (tf out|f) from the rel-
evant topic model of Cf out, we define the word-
topic distribution P (tf out|f) as:
P (tf out|f)
=
?
f?Cf out
countf (f) ? P (tf out|f)
?
tf out
?
f?Cf out
countf (f) ? P (tf out|f)
(9)
where countf (f) denotes the number of the word f
in sentence f .
3.2.3 Phrase-Topic Distribution P (tf in|f? )
A simple way to compute the phrase-topic distri-
bution is to take the fractional counts from Cf in
and then adopt MLE to obtain relative probability.
However, it is infeasible in our model because some
phrases occur in Cf out while being absent in Cf in.
To solve this problem, we further compute this pos-
terior distribution by the interpolation of two model-
s:
P (tf in|f?) = ? ? Pmle(tf in|f?) +
(1? ?) ? Pword(tf in|f?) (10)
where Pmle(tf in|f?) indicates the phrase-topic dis-
tribution by MLE, Pword(tf in|f?) denotes the
phrase-topic distribution which is decomposed into
the topic posterior distribution at the word level, and
? is the interpolation weight that can be optimized
over the development data.
Given the number of the phrase f? in sentence f
denoted as countf (f?), we compute the in-domain
phrase-topic distribution in the following way:
Pmle(tf in|f?)
=
?
f?Cf in
countf (f?) ? P (tf in|f)
?
tf in
?
f?Cf in
countf (f?) ? P (tf in|f)
(11)
462
Under the assumption that the topics of all word-
s in the same phrase are independent, we consid-
er two methods to calculate Pword(tf in|f?). One is
a ?Noisy-OR? combination method (Zens and Ney,
2004) which has shown good performance in calcu-
lating similarities between bags-of-words in differ-
ent languages. Using this method, Pword(tf in|f?) is
defined as:
Pword(tf in|f?)
= 1? Pword(t?f in|f?)
? 1?
?
fj?f?
P (t?f in|fj)
= 1?
?
fj?f?
(1? P (tf in|fj)) (12)
where Pword(t?f in|f?) represents the probability that
tf in is not the topic of the phrase f? . Similarly,
P (t?f in|fj) indicates the probability that tf in is not
the topic of the word fj .
The other method is an ?Averaging? combination
one. With the assumption that tf in is the topic of f?
if at least one of the words in f? belongs to this topic,
we derive Pword(tf in|f?) as follows:
Pword(tf in|f?) ?
?
fj?f?
P (tf in|fj)/|f? | (13)
where |f? | denotes the number of words in phrase f? .
3.3 Adapted Lexical Probability Estimation
Now we briefly describe how to estimate the adapted
lexical weight for phrase pairs, which can be adjust-
ed in a similar way to the phrase probability.
Specifically, adopting our method, each word is
considered as one phrase consisting of only one
word, so
w(e|f) =
?
tf out
?
tf in
w(e|f, tf out)
?P (tf out|tf in) ? P (tf in|f) (14)
Here we obtain w(e|f, tf out) with a simi-
lar approach to ?(e?|f? , tf out), and calculate
P (tf out|tf in) and P (tf in|f) by resorting to
formulas (8) and (9).
With the adjusted lexical translation probability,
we resort to formula (4) to update the lexical weight
for the phrase pair (f? , e?).
4 Experiment
We evaluate our method on the Chinese-to-English
translation task for the weblog text. After a brief de-
scription of the experimental setup, we investigate
the effects of various factors on the translation sys-
tem performance.
4.1 Experimental setup
In our experiments, the out-of-domain training cor-
pus comes from the FBIS corpus and the Hansard-
s part of LDC2004T07 corpus (54.6K documents
with 1M parallel sentences, 25.2M Chinese words
and 29M English words). We use the Chinese Sohu
weblog in 20091 and the English Blog Authorship
corpus2 (Schler et al., 2006) as the in-domain mono-
lingual corpora in the source language and target
language, respectively. To obtain more accurate top-
ic information by HTMM, we firstly filter the noisy
blog documents and the ones consisting of short sen-
tences. After filtering, there are totally 85K Chinese
blog documents with 2.1M sentences and 277K En-
glish blog documents with 4.3M sentences used in
our experiments. Then, we sample equal numbers of
documents from the in-domain monolingual corpo-
ra in the source language and the target language to
respectively train two in-domain topic models. The
web part of the 2006 NIST MT evaluation test da-
ta, consisting of 27 documents with 1048 sentences,
is used as the development set, and the weblog part
of the 2008 NIST MT test data, including 33 docu-
ments with 666 sentences, is our test set.
To obtain various topic distributions for the out-
of-domain training corpus and the in-domain mono-
lingual corpora in the source language and the tar-
get language respectively, we use HTMM tool devel-
oped by Gruber et al.(2007) to conduct topic model
training. During this process, we empirically set the
same parameter values for the HTMM training of d-
ifferent corpora: topics = 50, ? = 1.5, ? = 1.01,
iters = 100. See (Gruber et al., 2007) for the
meanings of these parameters. Besides, we set the
interpolation weight ? in formula (10) to 0.5 by ob-
serving the results on development set in the addi-
tional experiments.
We choose MOSES, a famous open-source

phrase-based machine translation system (Koehn
et al., 2007), as the experimental decoder.
GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003) and the heuristics
?grow-diag-final-and? are used to generate a word-
aligned corpus, from which we extract bilingual
phrases with maximum length 7. We use SRILM
Toolkits (Stolcke, 2002) to train two 4-gram lan-
guage models on the filtered English Blog Author-
ship corpus and the Xinhua portion of Gigaword
corpus, respectively. During decoding, we set the
ttable-limit as 20, the stack-size as 100, and per-
form minimum-error-rate training (Och and Ney,
2003) to tune the feature weights for the log-linear
model. The translation quality is evaluated by
case-insensitive BLEU-4 metric (Papineni et al.,
2002). Finally, we conduct paired bootstrap sam-
pling (Koehn, 2004) to test the significance in BLEU
score differences.
4.2 Result and Analysis
4.2.1 Effect of Different Smoothing Methods
Our first experiments investigate the effect of dif-
ferent smoothing methods for the in-domain phrase-
topic distribution: ?Noisy-OR? and ?Averaging?.
We build adapted phrase tables with these two meth-
ods, and then respectively use them in place of the
out-of-domain phrase table to test the system perfor-
mance. For the purpose of studying the generality of
our approach, we carry out comparative experiments
on two sizes of in-domain monolingual corpora: 5K
and 40K.

Noisy-OR (40K) 31.87 20.76
Averaging (40K) 31.89 21.11
Table 1: Experimental results using different smoothing
methods.
Table 1 reports the BLEU scores of the translation
system under various conditions. Using the out-of-
domain phrase table, the baseline system achieves
a BLEU score of 20.22. In the experiments with
the small-scale in-domain monolingual corpora, the
BLEU scores acquired by two methods are 20.45
and 20.54, achieving absolute improvements of 0.23
and 0.32 on the test set, respectively. In the exper-
iments with the large-scale monolingual in-domain
corpora, similar results are obtained, with absolute
improvements of 0.54 and 0.89 over the baseline
system.
From the above experimental results, we know
that both ?Noisy-OR? and ?Averaging? combination
methods improve the performance over the base-
line, and ?Averaging? method seems to be slight-
ly better. This finding fails to echo the promis-
ing results in the previous study (Zens and Ney,
2004). This is because the ?Noisy-OR? method in-
volves the multiplication of the word-topic distribu-
tion (shown in formula (12)), which leads to much
sharper phrase-topic distribution than ?Averaging?
method, and is more likely to introduce bias to the
translation probability estimation. Due to this rea-
son, all the following experiments only consider the
?Averaging?method.
4.2.2 Effect of Combining Two Phrase Tables
In the above experiments, we replace the out-of-
domain phrase table with the adapted phrase table.
Here we combine these two phrase tables in a log-
linear framework to see if we could obtain further
improvement. To offer a clear description, we repre-
sent the out-of-domain phrase table and the adapted
phrase table with ?OutBP? and ?AdapBP?, respec-
tively.

ter produces further improvements over the former.
Specifically, the BLEU scores of the ?OutBP +
AdapBP? method are 20.70 and 21.20, which ob-
tain 0.48 and 0.98 points higher than the baseline
method, and 0.16 and 0.09 points higher than the
?AdapBP? method. The underlying reason is that the
probability distribution of each in-domain sentence
often converges on some topics in the ?AdapBP?
method and some translation probabilities are over-
estimated, which leads to negative effects on the
translation quality. By using two tables together, our
approach reduces the bias introduced by ?AdapBP?,
therefore further improving the translation quality.
4.2.3 Effect of In-domain Monolingual Corpus
Size
Finally, we investigate the effect of in-domain
monolingual corpus size on translation quality. In
the experiment, we try different sizes of in-domain
documents to train different monolingual topic mod-
els: from 5K to 80K with an increment of 5K each
time. Note that here we only focus on the exper-
iments using the ?OutBP + AdapBP? method, be-
cause this method performs better in the previous
experiments.
Figure 1 shows the BLEU scores of the transla-
tion system on the test set. It can be seen that the
more data, the better translation quality when the
corpus size is less than 30K. The overall BLEU
scores corresponding to the range of great N val-
ues are generally higher than the ones correspond-
ing to the range of small N values. For example, the
BLEU scores under the condition within the range
[25K, 80K] are all higher than the ones within the
range [5K, 20K]. When N is set to 55K, the BLEU
score of our system is 21.40, with 1.18 gains on the
baseline system. This difference is statistically sig-
nificant at P < 0.01 using the significance test tool
developed by Zhang et al.(2004). For this experi-
mental result, we speculate that with the increment
of in-domain monolingual data, the corresponding
topic models provide more accurate topic informa-
tion to improve the translation system. However,
this effect weakens when the monolingual corpora
continue to increase.
5 Related work
Most previous researches about translation model
adaptation focused on parallel data collection. For
example, Hildebrand et al.(2005) employed infor-
mation retrieval technology to gather the bilingual
sentences, which are similar to the test set, from
available in-domain and out-of-domain training da-
ta to build an adaptive translation model. With
the same motivation, Munteanu and Marcu (2005)
extracted in-domain bilingual sentence pairs from
comparable corpora. Since large-scale monolin-
gual corpus is easier to obtain than parallel corpus,
there have been some studies on how to generate
parallel sentences with monolingual sentences. In
this respect, Ueffing et al. (2008) explored semi-
supervised learning to obtain synthetic parallel sen-
tences, and Wu et al. (2008) used an in-domain
translation dictionary and monolingual corpora to
adapt an out-of-domain translation model for the in-
domain text.
Differing from the above-mentioned works on
the acquirement of bilingual resource, several stud-
ies (Foster and Kuhn, 2007; Civera and Juan, 2007;
Lv et al., 2007) adopted mixture modeling frame-
work to exploit the full potential of the existing par-
allel corpus. Under this framework, the training cor-
pus is first divided into different parts, each of which
is used to train a sub translation model, then these
sub models are used together with different weights
during decoding. In addition, discriminative weight-
ing methods were proposed to assign appropriate
weights to the sentences from training corpus (Mat-
soukas et al., 2009) or the phrase pairs of phrase ta-
ble (Foster et al., 2010). Final experimental result-
s show that without using any additional resources,
these approaches all improve SMT performance sig-
465
nificantly.
Our method deals with translation model adap-
tation by making use of the topical context, so let
us take a look at the recent research developmen-
t on the application of topic models in SMT. As-
suming each bilingual sentence constitutes a mix-
ture of hidden topics and each word pair follows a
topic-specific bilingual translation model, Zhao and
Xing (2006,2007) presented a bilingual topical ad-
mixture formalism to improve word alignment by
capturing topic sharing at different levels of linguis-
tic granularity. Tam et al.(2007) proposed a bilin-
gual LSA, which enforces one-to-one topic corre-
spondence and enables latent topic distributions to
be efficiently transferred across languages, to cross-
lingual language modeling and translation lexicon
adaptation. Recently, Gong and Zhou (2010) also
applied topic modeling into domain adaptation in
SMT. Their method employed one additional feature
function to capture the topic inherent in the source
phrase and help the decoder dynamically choose re-
lated target phrases according to the specific topic of
the source phrase.
Besides, our approach is also related to context-
dependent translation. Recent studies have shown
that SMT systems can benefit from the utiliza-
tion of context information. For example, trigger-
based lexicon model (Hasan et al., 2008; Mauser et
al., 2009) and context-dependent translation selec-
tion (Chan et al., 2007; Carpuat and Wu, 2007; He
et al., 2008; Liu et al., 2008). The former gener-
ated triplets to capture long-distance dependencies
that go beyond the local context of phrases, and the
latter built the classifiers which combine rich con-
text information to better select translation during
decoding. With the consideration of various local
context features, these approaches all yielded stable
improvements on different translation tasks.
As compared to the above-mentioned works, our
work has the following differences.
? We focus on how to adapt a translation mod-
el for domain-specific translation task with the
help of additional in-domain monolingual cor-
pora, which are far from full exploitation in the
parallel data collection and mixture modeling
framework.
? In addition to the utilization of in-domain
monolingual corpora, our method is differen-
t from the previous works (Zhao and Xing,
2006; Zhao and Xing, 2007; Tam et al., 2007;
Gong and Zhou, 2010) in the following aspect-
s: (1) we use a different topic model ? HTMM
which has different assumption from PLSA and
LDA; (2) rather than modeling topic-dependent
translation lexicons in the training process, we
estimate topic-specific lexical probability by
taking account of topical context when extract-
ing word pairs, so our method can also be di-
rectly applied to topic-dependent phrase proba-
bility modeling. (3) Instead of rescoring phrase
pairs online, our approach calculate the transla-
tion probabilities offline, which brings no addi-
tional burden to translation systems and is suit-
able to translate the texts without the topic dis-
tribution information.
? Different from trigger-based lexicon model and
context-dependent translation selection both of
which put emphasis on solving the translation
ambiguity by the exploitation of the context in-
formation at the sentence level, we adopt the
topical context information in our method for
the following reasons: (1) the topic informa-
tion captures the context information beyond
the scope of sentence; (2) the topical context in-
formation is integrated into the posterior prob-
ability distribution, avoiding the sparseness of
word or POS features; (3) the topical context
information allows for more fine-grained dis-
tinction of different translations than the genre
information of corpus.
6 Conclusion and future work
This paper presents a novel method for SMT sys-
tem adaptation by making use of the monolingual
corpora in new domains. Our approach first esti-
mates the translation probabilities from the out-of-
domain bilingual corpus given the topic information,
and then rescores the phrase pairs via topic mapping
and phrase-topic distribution probability estimation
from in-domain monolingual corpora. Experimental
results show that our method achieves better perfor-
mance than the baseline system, without increasing
the burden of the translation system.
In the future, we will verify our method on oth-
466
er language pairs, for example, Chinese to Japanese.
Furthermore, since the in-domain phrase-topic dis-
tribution is currently estimated with simple smooth-
ing interpolations, we expect that the translation sys-
tem could benefit from other sophisticated smooth-
ing methods. Finally, the reasonable estimation of
topic number for better translation model adaptation
will also become our study emphasis.
