PROJECT GOALS 
The objective of the CSR Data Collection effort is to collect 
and deliver a large corpus of continuous speech data to sup- 
port ARPA research efforts in continuous speech recogni- 
tion (CSR). 
The CSR Corpus collection task is a high volume data pro- 
duction task. SRI's major goals have been improving ef f i -  
c iency  while defining and implementing data quality 
controls. Other goals include gathering data that is more 
representative of the real world by minimizing controls on 
vocabulary, microphones, background noise and speaker 
disflnencies, and defining documentation standards. 
RECENT RESULTS 
SRI completed two separate CSR Data Collection projects 
in 1993: 
Under the CSR Phase 2, Part 1 task, SRI delivered 86,000 
utterances from 275 speakers, including 8000 spontaneous 
sentences from 40 journalists. 
The CSR Development and Evaluation Spokes data collec- 
tion task yielded 4435 development test utterances fr~n 30 
speakers and 4878 evaluation test utterances from a differ- 
ent set of 30 speakers. The development test data covered 
eight different spoke conditions, each of which had its own 
distinct combination of subject, prompt ext, microphone 
and recording environment requirements. Similarly, the 
evaluation test data covered nine different spoke conditicm 
and two hub conditions, each of which had its own unique 
requirements. 
Efficiency - -  As a result of data collection software 
improvements the average data collection pace went from 
125 utts/hr during the CSR Pilot Corpus Collection to 200 
utts/hr for CSR Phase 2, Part 1. For a short-term non-jour- 
nalist subject collecting 190 read sentences, these changes 
and a faster paced orientation reduced subject ime from 
120 minutes to 90 minutes. A number of changes also 
yielded savings in terms of SILI labor. The data collection 
supervisor now spends only about 25 minutes instructing 
and observing while subjects collect heir first few utter- 
ances, and then leaves the room. Development of a new 
transcription tool led to a 15% to 20% reduction i  tran- 
scription time and improved accuracy. 
Data Quality - -  SRI has incorporated NIST data quality 
software into its procedures. Sample files are collected at 
the start of each day on each data collection system. These 
files are run through the wavmd program, which runs a sig- 
nal-to-noise (SNR) evaluation and other tests. Additional 
checks are performed on all files as they are collected to 
ensure that problems (e.g. dead microphone) are caught. 
More comprehensive data quality checks and calibration 
procedures were established as part of the CSR Dev and 
Eval Spokes collection. 
Documentation-- SRI delivered complete documentation 
of data collection procedures, subject instructions, ubject 
profiles, microphones and data collection environments for 
both the CSR Phase 2, Part 1 Corpus and the CSR Dev and 
Eval Spokes data. SRI views this as a first step in establish- 
ing documentation standards for speech corpora. 
PLANS FOR THE COMING YEAR 
SRI is currently between projects for CSR. We hope to par- 
ticipate in the CSR Phase 2, Part 2 data collection effort 
beginning in spring 1994. As part of this anticipated 
project, SRI plans to: 
? Provide the CCCC with input from the data collection 
perspective. 
? Test and implement the new data collection system cur- 
renfly being developed atM1T. 
? Work with the CCCC, LDC and NIST to further 
improve and automate quality tests of speech files. 
? Implement improved transcription conventions. 
? Work with the LDC and CCCC to further define and 
improve documentation standards.
