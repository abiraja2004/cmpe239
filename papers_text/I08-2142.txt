Abstract 
This paper brings together the practical ap-
plications and the evaluation of the first 
Text-to-Speech (TTS) system for Sinhala 
using the Festival framework and an Opti-

hala. 
1 Introduction 
Language Technology Research Laboratory ? 
(LTRL) of the University of Colombo School of 
Computing (UCSC), was established in 2004 
evolving from work engaged in by academics of 
the university since the early 1990?s in local lan-
guage computing in Sri Lanka. 
Under the scope of the laboratory, numerous 
Natural Language Processing projects are being 
carried out with the relevant national bodies, inter-
national technology partners, local industry and the 
wider regional collaboration particularly within the  
PAN Localization Initiative*. The Sri Lankan com-
ponent of the PAN Localization Project concen-
trated on developing some of the fundamental re-
sources needed for language processing and some 
software tools for immediate deployment at the 
end of the project. Among the resources produced 
is a Sinhala Language Corpus of 10m words, and a 
tri-lingual Sinhala-English-Tamil lexicon. The two 
main software tools developed include a Sinhala 
Text-to-Speech (TTS) system and an Optical Char-
acter Recognition (OCR) system for recognizing 
commonly used Sinhala publications.

This paper focuses primarily on the end-user ap-
plications developed under the above project; Sin-
hala TTS system and OCR system. The paper de-
scribes the practical applications of these tools and 
evaluates it in the light of experience gained so far. 
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: 
Section 2 gives an overview of the Sinhala TTS 
system; Section 3 describes the Sinhala OCR sys-
tem. A summary along with future research direc-
tions and improvements are discussed in the last 
section. 
2 Sinhala Text-to-Speech System 
Sighted computer users spend a lot of time reading 
items on-screen to do their regular tasks such as 
checking email, fill out spreadsheets, gather infor-
mation from internet, prepare and edit documents, 
and much more. However visually impaired people 
cannot perform these tasks without an assistance 
from other, or without using assistive technologies. 
A TTS (text-to-speech) system takes computer 
text and converts the words into audible speech 
(Dutoit, 1997). With a TTS engine, application, 
and basic computer hardware, one can listen to 
computer text instead of reading it. A Screen 
Reader (2007) is a piece of software that attempts 
to identify and read-aloud what is being displayed 
on the screen. The screen reader reads aloud text 
within a document, and it also reads aloud infor-
mation within dialog boxes and error messages. In 
other words, the primary function of any-screen 
reading system is to become the ?eye? of the visu-
ally impaired computer user. These technologies 
enable blind or visually impaired people to do 
things that they could not perform before by them-
963
selves. As such, text-to-speech synthesizers make 
information accessible to the print disabled. 
Within Sri Lanka, there is a great demand for a 
TTS system in local languages, particularly a 
screen reader or web browser for visually impaired 
people. In the case of the Tamil language, work 
done in India could be used directly. Until the 
LTRL of UCSC initiatives were launched in 2004, 
there was no viable TTS system found developed 
for Sinhala, the mother tongue of 74 % Sri 
Lankans (Karunatillake, 2004). 
A project was launched to develop a ?commer-
cial grade? Sinhala text-to-speech system in UCSC 
in year 2004. Later, it was extended to develop a 
Screen Reader which can be used by visually im-
paired persons for reading Sinhala texts. 
The Sinhala TTS system was implemented 
based on the Festival speech synthesizer (Taylor et 
al., 1998). The Festival speech synthesis system is 
an open-source, stable and portable multilingual 
speech synthesis system developed at Center for 
Speech Technology Research (CSTR), University 
of Edinburgh (Taylor et al, 1998, Black and 
Lenzo, 2003). TTS systems have been developed 
using the Festival framework for different lan-
guages, including English, Japanese, Welsh, Turk-
ish, Hindi, and Telugu (Black and Lenzo, 2003). 
However, efforts are still continuing to develop a 
standard Sinhala speech synthesizer in Sri Lanka.  
The Sinhala text-to-speech system is developed 
based on the diphone concatenation approach. 
Construction of a diphone database and implemen-
tation of the natural language processing modules 
were key research areas explored in this project. In 
this exercise, 1413 diphones were determined. The 
diphones were extracted from nonsensical words, 
and recordings were carried out in a professional 
studio. Moreover, language specific scripts (phone, 
lexicon, tokenization) and speaker specific scripts 
(duration and intonation) were defined for Sinhala. 
It is worthy to mention the development of con-
text-sensitive letter-to-sound conversion rule set 
for Sinhala. Incorporation of a high accuracy na-
tive syllabification routine (Weerasinghe et al, 
2005) and implementation of comprehensive text 
analysis facilities (capable of producing the accu-
rate pronunciation of the elements such as num-
bers, currency symbols, ratios, percentages, abbre-
viations, Roman numerals, time expressions, num-
ber ranges, telephone numbers, email addresses, 
English letters and various other symbols) have 
been found unique for the language (Weerasinghe 
et al, 2007). Despite the Festival's incomplete 
support for UTF-8, the above rules were re-
writtenin UTF-8 multi-byte format following the 
work done for Telugu language (Kamisetty, 2006). 
The current Sinhala TTS engine accepts Sinhala 
Unicode text and converts it into Speech. A male 
voice has been incorporated. Moreover, the system 
has been engineered to be used in deferent plat-
forms, operating systems (i.e. Linux and Windows) 
and by different software applications (Weeras-
inghe et al, 2007).  
2.1 Applications of TTS Synthesis Engine 
Sinhala text is made accessible via two interfaces, 
by the TTS engine. A standalone software named 
?Katha Baha? primarily reads documents in Sin-
hala Unicode text format aloud. The same applica-
tion can also be used to record the synthesized 
speech.  
In this way, local language news papers and text 
books can be easily transformed into audio materi-
als such as CDs. This software provides a conven-
ient way to disseminate up-to-date news and in-
formation for the print disabled. e.g. Newspaper 
company may podcast their news paper, enabling 
access for print disabled and everyone else. Fur-
thermore, the same application can be utilized to 
produce Sinhala digital talking books. To ensure 
the easy access by print disabled, keyboard short 
cuts are provided.  
Owing to the prevalent use of Windows among 
the visually impaired community in Sri Lanka, it 
becomes essential that a system is developed 
within the Windows environment which offers 
Sinhala speech synthesis to existing applications. 
The standard speech synthesis and recognition in-
terface in Microsoft Windows is the Microsoft 
Speech Application Programming Interface (MS-
SAPI) (Microsoft Corporation, n.d.). MS-SAPI 
enabled applications can make use of any MS-
SAPI enabled voice that has been installed in Win-
dows. Therefore, steps were taken to integrate Sin-
hala voice into MS-SAPI. As a result, the MS-
SAPI compliant Sinhala voice is accessible via any 
speech enabled Windows application. The Sinhala 
voice is proved to work well with ?Thunder?? a 
freely available screen reader for Windows. Addi-
tionally, steps were taken to translate and integrate

common words found related to Thunder screen 
reader (e.g. link=????????, list item= ????????? 
??????) (Weerasinghe et al, 2007).  
Since most Linux distributions now come with 
Festival pre-installed, the integration of Sinhala 
voice in such platforms is very convenient. Fur-
thermore, the Sinhala voice developed here was 
made accessible to GNOME-Orca and Gnoperni-
cus - powerful assistive screen reader software for 
people with visual impairments. 
It is noteworthy to mention that for the first time 
in Sri Lankan history, the print disabled commu-
nity will be able to use computers in their local 
languages by using the current Sinhala text-to-
speech system. 
2.2 Evaluation of the Text-to-Speech  Synthe-
sis Engine 
Text-to-speech systems have been compared and 
evaluated with respect to intelligibility (under-
standability of speech), naturalness, and suitability 
for used application (Lemmetty, 1999). As the 
Sinhala TTS system is a general-purpose synthe-
sizer, a decision was made to evaluate it under the 
intelligibility criterion. Specially, the TTS system 
is intended to be used with screen reader software 
by visually impaired people. Therefore, intelligibil-
ity is a more important feature than the naturalness. 
A Modified Rhyme Test (MRT) (Lemmetty, 
1999), was designed to test the Sinhala TTS sys-
tem. The test consists of 50 sets of 6 one or two 
syllable words which makes a total set of 300 
words. The words are chosen to evaluate phonetic 
characteristics such as voicing, nasality, sibilation, 
and consonant germination. Out of 50 sets, 20 sets 
were selected for each listener.  The set of 6 words 
is played one at the time and the listener marks the 
synthesized word. The overall intelligibility of the 
system measured from 20 listeners was found to be 
71.5% (Weerasinghe et al, 2007). 
3 Optical Character Recognition System 
Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology 
is used to convert information available in the 
printed form into machine editable electronic text 
form through a process of image capture, process-
ing and recognition (Optical Character Recogni-
tion, 2007).  
There are three essential elements to OCR tech-
nology. Scanning ? acquisition of printed docu-
ments as optical images using a device such as 
flatbed scanner. Recognition- involves converting 
these images to character streams representing let-
ters of recognized words and the final element in-
volves accessing or storing the converted text. 
Many OCR systems have been developed for 
recognizing Latin characters (Weerasinghe et al, 
2006). Some OCR systems have been reported to 
have a very high accuracy and most of such sys-
tems are commercial products. Leaving a land 
mark, a Sinhala OCR system has been developed 
at UCSC (Weerasinghe et al, 2006).  
Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Template 
Matching are two popular and widely used algo-
rithms for optical character recognition. However, 
the  application of above algorithms to a highly 
inflected languages such as Sinhala is arduous due 
to the high number of input classes. Empirical es-
timation of least number of input classes needed 
for  training a neural net for Sinhala character rec-
ognition suggested about  400 classes (Weeras-
inghe et al, 2006). Therefore, less-complicated K-
nearest neighbor algorithm (KNN) was employed 
for the purpose of Sinhala character recognition.  
The current OCR system is the first ever re-
ported OCR system for Sinhala and is capable of 
recognizing printed Sinhala letters typed using 
widely used fonts in the publishing industry. The 
recognized content is presented as editable Sinhala 
Unicode text file (Weerasinghe et al, 2006). 
A large volume of information is available in the 
printed form. The current OCR system will expe-
dite the process of digitizing this information. 
Moreover, the information available via printed 
medium is inaccessible to the print disabled, and 
the OCR system, especially when coupled with 
Sinhala TTS, will provide access to these informa-
tion for the print disabled.  
3.1 Evaluation of the Optical Character Rec-
ognition System 
The performance of the Sinhala OCR system has 
been evaluated using 18000 sample characters for 
Sinhala. These characters have been extracted from 
various books and newspapers (Weerasinghe et al, 
2006). Performance of the system has been evalu-
ated with respect to different best supportive fonts. 
The results have been summarized in the Table 1 
(Weerasinghe et al, 2006).

From this evaluation it can be concluded that the 
current Sinhala OCR has average accuracy of 95% 
(Weerasinghe et al, 2006). 
4 Conclusion and Future Work 
This paper brings together the development of a 
diphone voice for Sinhala based on the Festival 
speech synthesis system and an Optical Character 
Recognizer for Sinhala. 
Future work on the Sinhala TTS engine will 
mainly focus on improving the prosody modules. 
A speech corpus containing 2 hours of speech has 
been already recorded. The material is currently 
being segmented, and labeled. We are also 
planning to improve the duration model using the 
data obtained from the annotated speech corpus. It 
is also expected to develop a female voice in near 
future. The current Sinhala OCR system is font 
dependent. Work is in progress to make the OCR 
system font independent and to improve the accu-
racy. Sinhala OCR and the TTS systems, which are 
currently two separate applications, will be inte-
grated enabling the user friendliness to the print 
disabled. 
A number of other ongoing projects are aimed at 
developing resources and tools such as a POS tag 
set, a POS tagger and a tagged corpus for Sinhala, 
an on-the-fly web page translator, a translation 
memory application and several language teaching 
-learning resources for Sinhala, Tamil and English. 
All resources developed under this project are 
made available (under GNU General Public Li-
cense) through the LTRL website.
