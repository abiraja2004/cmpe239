Abstract 
This paper presents a study on optimizing sen-
tence pair alignment scores of a bilingual sen-
tence alignment module. Five candidate 
scores based on perplexity and sentence 
length are introduced and tested. Then a linear 
regression model based on those candidates is 
proposed and trained to predict sentence pairs? 
alignment quality scores solicited from human 
subjects. Experiments are carried out on data 
automatically collected from Internet. The 
correlation between the scores generated by 
the linear regression model and the scores 
from human subjects is in the range of the in-
ter-subject agreement score correlations. Pear-
son's correlation ranges from 0.53 up to 0.72 
in our experiments.  
1 Introduction 
In many instances, multilingual natural language 
systems like machine translation systems are developed 
and trained on parallel corpora.  When faced with a dif-
ferent, unseen text genre, however, translation perform-
ance usually drops noticeably.  One way to remedy this 
situation is to adapt and retrain the system parameters 
based on bilingual data from the same source or at least 
a closely related source.  A bilingual sentence alignment 
program (Gale and Church, 1991, and Brown et al, 
1991) is the crucial part in this adaptation procedure, in 
that it collects bilingual document pairs from the Inter-
net, and identifies sentence pairs, which should have a 
high likelihood of being correct translations of each 
other.  The set of identified bilingual parallel sentence 
pairs is then added to the training set for parameter re-
estimation. 
As is well known, text mined from the Internet is 
very noisy.  Even after careful html parsing and filtering 
for text size and language, the text from comparable 
html-page pairs still contains mismatches of content or 
non-parallel junk text, and the sentence order can be too 
different to be aligned.  Together with a large mismatch 
of vocabulary, the aligned sentence pairs, which are 
extracted from these collected comparable html-page 
pairs, contain a number of low translation quality 
alignments.  These need to be removed before the re-
training of the MT system. 
In this paper, we present an approach to automati-
cally optimizing the alignment scores of such a bilingual 
sentence alignment program.  The alignment score is a 
combination (by linear regression) of two word transla-
tion lexicon scores and three sentence length scores and 
predicts the translation quality scores from a set of hu-
man annotators.  We also present experiments analyzing 
how many different human scorers are needed for good 
prediction and also how many sentence pairs should be 
scored per human annotator. 
The paper is structured as follows: in section 2, the 
text mining system is briefly described.  In section 3, 
five sentence alignment models based on lexical infor-
mation and sentence length are explained. In section 4, a 
regression model is proposed to combine the five mod-
els to get further improvement in predicting alignment 
quality.  We describe alignment experiments in section 
5, focusing on the correlation between the alignment 
scores predicted by the sentence alignment models and 
by humans.  Conclusions are given in section 6. 
2 System of Mining Parallel Text 
One crucial component of statistical machine trans-
lation (SMT) system is the parallel text mining from 
Internet. Several processing modules are applied to col-
lect, extract, convert, and clean the text from Internet.  
The components in our system include: 
? A web crawler, which collects potential parallel 
html documents based on link information follow-
ing (Philip Resnik 1999); 
? A bilingual html parser (based on flex for effi-
ciency), which is designed for both Chinese and 
English html documents.  The paragraphs? bounda-
ries within the html structure are kept.  
? A character encoding detector, which judges if the 
Chinese html document is GB2312 encoding or 
BIG5 encoding.  
? An encoding converter, which converts the BIG5 
documents to GB2312 encoding.  
? A language identifier to ensure that source and tar-
get documents are both of the proper language. 
(Noord?s Implementation).  
? A Chinese word segmenter, which parses the Chi-
nese strings into Chinese words.   
? A document alignment program, which judges if 
the document pair is close translation candidates, 
and filters out those non-translation pairs. 
? A sentence boundary detector, which is based on 
punctuation and capitalized characters; 
? And the key component, a sentence alignment pro-
gram, which aligns and extracts potential parallel 
sentence pairs from the candidate document pairs. 
   
After sentence alignment, each candidate of a par-
allel sentence pair is then re-scored by the regression 
models (to be described in section 5). These scores are 
used to judge the quality of the aligned sentences.  Thus 
one can select the aligned sentence pairs, which have 
high alignment quality scores, to re-estimate the sys-
tem?s parameters.  
2.1 Sentence Alignment 
Our sentence alignment program uses IBM Model-1 
based perplexity (section 2.2) to calculate the similarity 
of each sentence pair. Dynamic programming is applied 
to find Viterbi path for sentence alignments of the bilin-
gual comparable document pair. In our dynamic pro-
gramming implementation, we allow for seven 
alignment types between English and Chinese sentences: 
 
? 1:1 ? exact match, where one sentence is the trans-
lation of the other one; 
? 2:2 ? the break point between two sentences in the 
source document is different from the segmentation 
in the target document.  E.g. part of sentence one in 
the source might be translated as part of the second 
sentence in the target; 
? 2:1, 1:2, and 3:1 ? these cases are similar to the 
case before: they handle differences in how a text is 
split into sentences. The case 1:3 has not been used 
in the final configuration of the system, as this type 
did not occur in any significant number; 
? 1:0 (deletion) and (0:1) insertion ? a sentence in the 
source document is missing in the translation or 
vice versa. 
 
The deletion and insertion types are discarded, and 
the remaining types are extracted to be used as potential 
parallel data. In general, one Chinese sentence corre-
sponds to several English sentences. In (Bing and 
Stephan, 2002), experiments on a 10-year XinHua news 
story collection from the Linguistic Data Consortium 
(LDC) show that alignment types like (2:1) and (3:1) 
are common, and this 7-type alignment is shown to be 
reliable for English-Chinese sentence alignment.  How-
ever, only a small part of the whole 10-year collection 
was pre-aligned (Xiaoyi, 1999) and extracted for sen-
tence alignment.   
The picture can be very different when directly min-
ing the data from Internet. Due to the mismatch between 
the training data and the data collected from Internet, 
the vocabulary coverage can be very low; the data is 
very noisy; and the data aligned is not strictly parallel. 
The percentage of alignment types of insertion (0:1) and 
deletion (1:0) become very high as shown in section 5. 
The aligned sentence pairs are subject to many align-
ment errors. The alignment errors are not desired in the 
re-training of the system, and need to be removed.  
Though the sentence alignment outputs a score from 
Viterbi path for each of the aligned sentence pairs, this 
score is only a rough estimation of the alignment quality. 
A more reliable re-scoring of the data is desirable to 
estimate the alignment quality as a post processing step 
to filter out the errors and noise from the aligned data.  
2.2 Statistical Translation Lexicon 
We use a statistical translation lexicon known as IBM 
Model-1 in (Brown et al, 1993) for both efficiency and 
simplicity.  
In our approach, Model-1 is the conditional probabil-
ity that a word f in the source language is translated 
given word e in the target language, t(f|e). This prob-
ability can be reliably estimated using the expectation-
maximization (EM) algorithm (Cavnar, W. B. and J. M. 
Trenkle, 1994). 
Given training data consisting of parallel sen-
tences: }..1),,{( )()( Sief ii = , our Model-1 training for 
t(f|e) is as follows:

The probability of alignment F given E: )|( EFP is 
shown to achieve the global maximum under this EM 
framework as stated in (Brown et al,1993).  
In our approach, equation (1) is further normalized 
so that the probability for different lengths of F is com-
parable at the word level:

The alignment models described in (Brown et al, 
1993) are all based on the notion that an alignment 
aligns each source word to exactly one target word.  
This makes this type of alignment models asymmetric.  
Thus by using the conditional probability t(e|f) trans-
lation lexicon trained from English (source) to Chinese 
(target), different aspects of the bilingual lexical 
information can be captured. A similar probability to (2) 
can be defined based on this reverse translation lexicon:

Starting from the Hong Kong news corpora provided 
by LDC, we trained the translation lexicons to be used 
in the parallel sentence alignment.  Each sentence pair 
has a perplexity, which is calculated using the minus log 
of the probability eg. equation (2).  
3 Alignment Models 
The alignment model is aimed at automatically pre-
dicting the alignment scores of a bilingual sentence 
alignment program. By scoring the alignment quality of 
the sentence pairs, we can filter out those mis-aligned 
sentence pairs, and save our SMT system from being 
corrupted by mis-aligned data. 
3.1 Lexicon Based Models 
It is necessary to include lexical features in the 
aligned quality evaluation. One way is to use the trans-
lation lexicon based perplexity as in our sentence 
alignment program.  
For each of the aligned sentence pairs, the sentence 
alignment generated a score, which is solely based on 
equation (2). Using this score only, we can do a simple 
filtering by setting a threshold of perplexity. The sen-
tence pairs which have a higher perplexity than the 
threshold will be removed. However the perplexity 
based on (2) is definitely not discriminative enough to 
evaluate the quality of aligned sentence pairs.  
In our experiment, it showed that perplexity (3) has 
more discriminative power in judging the quality of the 
aligned sentence pairs for Chinese-English sentence 
alignment. It is also possible that equation (2) is more 
suitable for other language pairs.  Both (2) and (3) are 
applied in our sentence alignment quality judgment, 
which is to be explained in section 4.  
3.2 Sentence Length Models 
As was shown in the sentence alignment literature 
(Church, K.W. 1993), the sentence length ratio is also a 
very good indication of the alignment of a sentence pair 
for languages from a similar family such as French and 
English.  For language pairs from very different families 
such as Chinese and English, the sentence length ratio is 
also a good indication of alignment quality as shown in 
our experiments.  
For the language pair of Chinese and English, the 
sentence length can be defined in several different ways.  
3.2.1 Sentence Length 
In general, a Chinese sentence does not have word 
boundary information; so one way to define Chinese 
sentence length is to count the number of bytes of the 
sentence. Another way is to first segment the Chinese 
sentence into words (section 3.2.2) and count how many 
words are in the sentence. For English sentences, we 
can similarly define the length in bytes and in words.  
The length ratio is assumed to be a Gaussian distri-
bution. The mean and variance are calculated from the 
parallel training corpus, which, in our case, is the Hong 
Kong parallel corpus with 290K parallel sentence pairs.  
3.2.2 A Chinese Word Segmenter 
The word segmenter for Chinese is to parse the Chi-
nese string into words. Different word segmenters can 
generate different numbers of words for the same Chi-
nese sentence.  
There are many word segmenters publicly available. 
In our experiments, we applied a two-pass strategy to 
segment the word according to the dictionary of the 
LDC bilingual dictionary of Chinese-English. The two-
pass started first from left to right, and then from right 
back to left, to calculate the maximum word frequency 
and select one best path to segment the words.  
In general, the sentence length is not sensitive to the 
segmenters used. But for reliability, we want each seg-
mented word can have an English translation, thus we 
used the LDC bilingual dictionary as a reference word 
list for segmentation.  
3.2.3 Sentence Length Model 
Assume the alignment probability of ),|( tsAP  is 
only related to the length of source sentence s and target 
sentence t:

where || s and || t are the sentence lengths of s and t.  
The difference of the length |)||,(| ts? is assumed 
to be a Gaussian distribution (Church, K.W. 1993) and 
can be normalized as follows: 
)1,0(~

=  (4) 
where c is a constant indicating the mean length ratios 
between source and target sentences and 2? is the vari-
ance of the length ratios.  
In our case, we applied three length models de-
scribed in the following Table 1: 
 
Table 1. Three Length Models description 
L-1 Both English and Chinese sentence are meas-
ured in bytes 
L-2 Both English and Chinese sentence are meas-
ured in words 
L-3 English sentence is measured in words and 
Chinese sentence is measured in bytes 
 
The means and 2? of the length ratios for each of the 
length models are calculated from Hong Kong news 
parallel corpus. The statistics of the three sentence 
length models are shown in Table 2. 
 
Table 2. Sentence length ratio statistics 
  L-1  L-2 L-3: 
Mean 1.59 1.01 0.33 
Var 3.82 0.79 0.71 
 
In general, the smaller the variance, the better the 
sentence length model can be. From Table 2 we observe 
that the bytes based length ratio model has significantly 
larger variance (3.82) than the other two models (L-2: 
0.79, L-3: 0.71).  This means L1 is not as reliable as L2 
and L3. Both L2 and L3 have similar variance, which 
indicates measuring English sentences in words will 
entail smaller variance in length model; measuring Chi-
nese sentences in bytes or words entails only a slight 
difference in variance. This also indicates that the length 
model is not so sensitive to the Chinese word segmenter 
applied. L-1, L-2 and L-3 capture the length relationship 
of parallel sentence in different views. Their modeling 
power has overlap, but they also compensate each other 
in capturing the parallel characteristics of good transla-
tion quality. A combination of these models can poten-
tially bring further improvement, which is shown in our 
experiment in section 6.  
4 Regression Model 
Rather than doing a binary decision (classification) that 
the aligned sentence pair is either good or not, the re-
gression can give a confidence score indicating how 
good the alignment can be, thus offering more flexibil-
ity in decisions.   Predicting the alignment quality using 
the candidate models is considered as a regression prob-
lem in that different scores are combined together.   
There are many ways such as genetic programming, 
to combine the candidate models, and regression is one 
of the straight forward and efficient ones.  So in this 
work, we explored linear regression. 
4.1 Candidate Models 
We have five candidate models described in section 
3. They are: PP1, the perplexity based on the word pair 
conditional probability p(f|e) in equation (2); PP2, the 
perplexity based on the reverse word pair conditional 
probability p(e|f) in equation (3); L-1, Length ratio 
model measured in bytes (mean=1.59, var=3.82); L-2, 
length ratio model measured in words (mean=1.01, 
var=0.79); L-3, length ratio model, where the English 
sentence is measured in words and the Chinese sentence 
is measured in bytes (mean=0.33, var=0.71).  These five 
models capture different aspects of the aligned quality 
of the sentence pair. The idea is to combine these five 
models together to get better prediction of the aligned 
quality. 
Linear regression is applied to combine these five 
models. It is trained from the observation of the five 
models together with the label of human judgment on a 
training set. 
4.2 Regression Model Training 
The linear regression model tries to discover the 
equation for a line that most nearly fits the given data 
(Trevor Hastie et al 2001). That linear equation is then 
used to predict values for the data.  
Now given human subject judgment of the aligned 
translation quality of sentence pairs, we can train a re-
gression model based on the five models we described 
in section 4.1 under the objective of least square errors.  
The human evaluation is measures translation qual-
ity of aligned pairs on a discrete 6-point scale between 1 
(very bad) and 5 (perfect translation). The score 0 was 
used for alignments that were not genuine translation 
e.g., both sentences were from the same language. We 
will use n for the number of total sentence pairs labeled 
by humans and used in training.  
Let A= [PP1, PP2, L-1, L-2, L-3] be the machine-
generated scores for each of the sentence pairs. In our 
case, A is a 5?n  matrix.  
Let H= [Human-Judgment-Score] be the human 
evaluation of the sentence pairs on a 6-point scale. In 
our case, H is a 1?n  matrix. 
In linear regression modeling, a linear transforma-
tion matrix W should satisfy the least square error crite-
rion: 
||}{||min* HAWW
w
?=  (5) 
where W is in fact a 5x1 weight matrix. The equation 
can be solved as:  
HAAAW TT 1* )( ?=  (6) 
The inverse of matrix AAT  is usually calculated using 
singular vector decomposition (SVD). After W is calcu-
lated, the predicted score from the regression model is: 
*
' AWH =  (7) 
where 'H  is the final predicted alignment quality score 
of the regression model. We can also view 'H  as a 
weighted sum of the five models shown in section 4.1. 
The calculation of 'H  reduces to a linear weighted 
summation, which is very efficient to compute.  
5 Experiments 
1500 pairs of comparable html document pairs were 
obtained from bilingual web pages crawled from Inter-
net. After preprocessing, filtering, and sentence align-
ment, the alignment types were distributed as shown in 
Table 3. Ignoring the alignment type of insertion (0:1) 
and deletion (1:0), we extracted around 5941 parallel 
sentences.  
 
Table 3. Alignment types? distribution of mined 
data from noisy web data crawled 
 1:0 0:1 1:1 2:1 1:2 2:2 3:1 
% 23.7 41.9 29.4 1.99 0.01 0.02 2.79 
 
From Table 3, we see the data is very noisy, con-
taining a large portion of insertions (23.7%) and dele-
tions (41.9%).  This is very different from the LDC 
XinHua pre-aligned collection provided by LDC, which 
is relatively clean.  
For this set of English-Chinese bilingual sentences, 
we randomly selected 200 sentence pairs, focusing on 
Viterbi alignment scores below 12.0 from sentence 
alignment, which was an empirically determined 
threshold (The alignment scores here were purely re-
flecting the Model-1 parameters using equation (2)).  
Three human subjects then had to score the 'translation 
quality' of every sentence pair, using a 6 point scale 
described in section 4.2. We further excluded very short 
sentences from consideration and evaluated 168 remain-
ing sentences. 
Pearson R correlation is applied to calculate the mag-
nitude of the association between two variables (human-
human or human-machine in our case) that are on an 
interval or ratio scale. The correlation coefficients 
(Pearson R) between human subjects were in Table 4 
(all are statistically significant): 
 
Table 4. Correlation between Human Subjects 
 H2 H3 
H1 0.786 0.615 
H2 ---- 0.568 
 
Overall, more than 2/3 of the human scores are identical 
or differ by only 1 (between subjects). 
For the automatic score prediction, the five compo-
nent scores described in section 4.1 are used, which are 
then combined using a standard Linear Regression as 
described in section 4.2. Table 5 shows the correlation 
between alignment scores based on Model X and human 
subjects' predicted quality scores:

L-3 .40 .38 .29 
Na?ve .58 .56 .38 
Regression  .72 .68 .53 
 
The data we used in our training of the lexicon is Hong 
Kong news parallel data from LDC. There are 290K 
parallel sentence pairs, with 7 million words of English 
and 7.3 million Chinese words after segmentation. The 
IBM Model-1 for PP-1 and PP-2 are both trained using 
5 EM iterations. The other three length models are also 
calculated from the same 290K sentence pairs. Punctua-
tion is removed before the calculation of all automatic 
score prediction models. 
The regression model here is the standard linear re-
gression using the observations from three human sub-
jects as described in section 4.1. The average 
performance of the regression model is shown in the 
bottom line of the above Table 5. The average correla-

tion varies from 0.53 upto 0.72, which shows that the 
regression model has a very strong positive correlation 
with the human judgment.  
Also from Table 5, we see both lexicon based mod-
els: PP-1 and PP-2 are better than the length models in 
term of correlation with human scorer. Model PP-2 has 
the largest correlation, and is slightly better than PP-1. 
PP-2 is based on the conditional probability of p(e|f), 
which models the generation of an English word from a 
Chinese word. The vocabulary size of Chinese is usu-
ally smaller than English vocabulary size, so this model 
can be more reliably estimated than the reverse direction 
of p(f|e). This explains why PP-2 is slightly better than 
PP-1.  
For sentence length models, we see L-2, for which 
the lengths of both the English sentence and the Chinese 
sentence are measured in words, has the best perform-
ance among the three settings of a sentence length 
model. This indicates that the length model measured in 
words is more reliable.  
Also shown in Table 5, the na?ve interpolation of 
these different models, i.e. just using each model with 
equal weight, resulted in lower correlation than the best 
single alignment model. 
We also performed correlation experiments with 
varied numbers of training sentences from either Hu-
man-1/Human-2/Human-3 or from all of the three hu-
man subjects.  We picked the first 30/60/90/120 labeled 
sentence pairs for training and saved the last 48 sen-
tence pairs for testing.  The average performance of the 
regression model is as follows:

120 .760 .721 .464 
 
The average correlation of the regression models 
showed here increased noticeably when the training set 
was increased from 30 sentence pairs to 90 sentence 
pairs. More sentence pairs caused no or only marginal 
improvements (esp. for the third human subject).  
Figure 1 shows a scatter plot, which illustrates a 
good correlation (here: Pearson R=0.74) between our 
regression model predictors and the human scorers. 
6 Conclusion 
In this paper, we have demonstrated ways to effi-
ciently optimize a sentence alignment module, such that 
it is able to select aligned sentence pairs of high transla-
tion quality automatically. This procedure of alignment 
score optimization requires (a) a small number of hu-
man subjects who annotate a set of about 100 sentence 
pairs each for translation quality; and (b) a set of align-
ment scores, based on perplexity and sentence length 
ratio, to be able to learn to predict the human scores. 
Based on the learned predictions, by means of linear 
regression, the alignment program can choose the best  
sentence pair candidates to be included in the training 
data for the SMT system re-estimation. 
Our experiments showed that, for Chinese-English 
language pair, perplexity based on the reverse word pair 
conditional probability p(e|f) (PP-2) gives the most reli-
able prediction among the five models proposed in this 
paper; the regression model, which combines those five 
models, give the best correlation between human score 
and automatic predictions. Our approach needs only a 
fairly limited number of human labeled sentences pairs, 
and is an efficient optimization of the sentence 
alignment system.
