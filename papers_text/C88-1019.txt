Abstract 
After the first work on machine-readable dictionaries 
(MRDs) in the seventies, and with the recent development of 
the concept of a lexical database (LI)B) in which interaction, 
flexibility and multidim;ensionality can be achieved, but 
everything must be  explicitly stated in advance, a new 
possibility which is now emerging is that of a procedmal 
exploitation of the full range of semantic in!brmation implicitly 
contained in MRI)s. The dictionary is considered in this 
framework as a prima~'y source of basic general knowledge. In 
the paper we describe a project to develop a system which has 
word-sense acquisition fi'om information contained in 
computerized ictionaries and knowledge organization as its 
main objectives. The approach consists in a discovery proce- 
dure technique operating on natural anguage delinitions, which 
is recursively applied and relined. We start \[i'om free-text 
definitions, in natural language linear form, analyzing and 
converting them into infbrmationally equivalent structured 
forms. This new approach, which aims at reorganizing ti'ee text 
into elaborately structured information, could be called the 
Lcxical Knowledge Base (I.KB) approach. 
1. Baekgromld 
For a cmlsidcrable period in theoretical and computational 
linguistics, there was a predominant lack of interest in lexical 
problems, which were regarded as being of minor importance 
with respect o "core" issues concerning linguistic phenomena, 
mainly of a syntactic nature, l)uring the last few years, 
howevcr, this trend has been ahnost reversed. The role of the 
lexicon in both linguistic thcories and computational 
applications is now being greatly revalued and one aspect on 
which a number of research groups are now focussing their 
attention is the possibility of reusing the large quantity of data 
contained in alrcady existing machine-readable lcxical sources, 
mainly dictionaries prepared for photocomposition, as a short 
cut in the construction of extensive NLl'-oriented lexicons. 
This position was formulated very clearly in a number of papers 
presented at a recent workshop organized in Grosseto (Italy) 
and sponsored by the European Community (see Walker, 
Zampolli, Calzolari, furthcoming), and can be found in the set 
el" recommendations which was one of" the results of this 
workshop (Zampolli 1987, pp.332-335). 
After the first work on machine-readable dictiona,'ies 
(MRI)s) in the seventies (see Olney 1972, Sherman 1974), and 
with the recent development oI~the concept of'a lexical database 
(l.l)B) in which interaction, flexibility and multidiinensionality 
can be achieved, but everything must be explicitly stated in 
advance (see e.g. Amsler 1980, Byrd 1983, Calzolari 1982, 
Michiels 1980), a new possibility which is now emerging is that 
o1" a procedural exploitation of the lull range of semantic 
intbrmation implicitly contained in MRI)s (see Wilks 1987, 
Binot 1987, Alshawi forthcoming, Calzolari forthcoming). 
\ [he  dictionary is now considered as a prilnary source not 
only of lcxical knowledge but also of basic general knowledge 
(ranging over the entire "world"), and some of tim dictionary 
systems which are being developed have knowled~,e acquisition 
and knowledge organization as their principal objectives (see 
also l.enat al/d \[:eigenbaum 1987). In this paper we describe at 
project which we are now conducting on the acquisition of 
semantic inlbrmation ti'om computerized dictionaries. 
2. I)ata and estal)lished methods fiw hierarchic'd semantic 
classifying 
The data we use in our research include the lexical 
information contained in the Italian Machine I)ictionary 
(I)MI), which is ah'eady structured as a LI)B and is nrainly 
based on the Zingarelli Italian dictionary (1970); the DM l-l)B 
has different types o\[" linguistic inIormation already accessible 
on-line. A morphological module generates and analy,'es the 
intlected word-forms: approximately I million fiom 120,000 
lemmas, l.cnm/as, word-forms, deriwitivcs/suflixes, POS, usage 
codes, and specialized terminology codes, can be used its direct 
access search keys through which the user can query the 
database dictionary. On the semantic side, synonyms, 
hyponyms, and hypcrnyms constitute already implemented 
access paths covering all of the approximately 200,000 
definitions contained in the dictionary. Examples of possible 
queries arc the lbllowing: give me all the nouns defined as 
names of vehicles, of sounds, of games, all the verbs defined by 
a particular genus term, for example 'M UOVEII.E' (to move), 
'TAGLIARI.:' (to cut), etc. The procedures used to find 
B7 
hypernyms in definitions and to create taxonomies are similar 
to those used by other groups (see Chodorow 1985, Calzolari 
1983, Amslcr 1981). 
We have now begun work on restructuring another dictionary 
available in MRF, the Garzanti Italian dictionary (1984). A 
parser has been implemented which, on the basis of the 
typesetting codes for photocomposition, identifies the rough 
structure of each lexical entry. Fig. 1 displays the output of a 
parsed entry of the Garzanti dictionary. Fig. 2 represents the 
provisional model for a monolingual lexical entry as we have 
defined it so far. Fig. 3 gives the projection of the first 
interpretation of the typesetting codes into this model; other 
kinds of information will be added afterwards (for example, that 
obtained by the inductive procedures described in the paper).

The merging of part of the data of tile DM I and the Garzanti 
dictionary into a single LI)B has already been completed, e.g. 
for lemmas, POSs, usage codes, etc. We now have to tackle the 
problcm of reorganizing the semantic data (dcfinitions and 
examples). Itcre our strategy is to design a new procedural 
system which is ablc to gradually "learn" and acquire semantic 
infornlation from dictionary definitions, going well bcyond thc 
IS-A hierarchies constructed so far, in order to attempt o also 
capturc what is prescnt in the "diffcrcntia" part of the definition. 
This can be achieved with some success given the particular 
nature of lexicographic definitions, with: a) a generic (and 
pe'rhaps over simplistic) description of the "world"; b) a rather 
lcxically and syntactically constrained and a somewhat regular 
natural anguage tcxt (Calzolari 1984, Wilks 1987). 
After having mappcd the codcs for photocomposition i to 
linguistically relevant codes, all the preliminarily parsed data of 
the Garzanti have been organized on a PC in the form of a 
Textual Database (DBrl'), a fuEl-text Information Retrieval (IR) 
system in which all occurrences of any word-form or lermna can 
be directly accessed (Picchi 1983). The I)BT has been found to 
be a very powerful tool in evidencing lexical units and particular 
syntagms which can then be exploited in our "pattern- 
matching" procedure. With the text in DBT form it is possible 
to search occurrences of single word-forms in definitions and 
examples, lemmas, codes of various types (POS, specialized 
languages, usage labels, etc.), and also cooccurrences of any of 
these items throughout he entire dictionary. In addition, 
structures composed of combinations of the above elements 
connected by the logical operators "and" and "or" to any degree 
of complexity can also be searched. The results of such queries 
are returned together with the pertinent dictionary entries. 
Obviously frequencies can also be obtained. All this 
information can be retrieved with Fast interactive access. 
We have therefore already implemented two types of 
organization for dictionary data: 
1) DB-type organization with the DM1 (we have not used a 
standard DBMS, but an ad hoc designed relational 1)B system); 
2) a full-text IR system for the Garzanti dictionary. 
Although both types of organization have proved to be very 
powerful tools for different scopes, at tile same time each 
presents certain drawbacks and difficulties, due to the particular 
nature of dictionary data which in neither case has it been 
possible to fully exploit. Dictionary data is in fact of a very 
particular nature, consisting of a combination of free text in a 
highly organized structure. The DB approach copes well with 
the second characteristic, while the \[R approach is successful in 
handling free text. tlowever neither is capable of fully 
exploiting the two features in combination. A new method 
must be envisaged, capable of reorganizing free text into 
elaborately structured information: this could be called the 
Lexical Knowledge Base (LKB) approach, and is the aim of the 
project described here. 
3. Techniques fi~r word-sense acquisit ion 
Discow:ry procedure techniques prove to be useful in 
extracting semantic information from definition texts. In 
general, our approach consists in starting from fi'ee-tcxt 
definitions, in natural languagc linear form, analyzing and 
converting them into inlormationally equivalent structured 
tbrms. The preliminary step of the work consisted in applying 
the morphological analyzer to the definitions; tim result of this 
process tbr one definition appears in Fig. 4. A program 
designed for homograph disambignation was then run on the 
otput produced by this morphological processor. The 
disambiguator consists partly in rules generally valid for Italian, 
based on the immediate right and left context, and partly in ad 
hoc rules written for the particular syntax used in lexicographic 
definitions. Fig. 5 shows the result of applying this 
disambiguation procedure to all the homographs shown in the 
preceding example. We then had to implement a set of 
discovery procedures acting on dictionary definitions.

The first analysis of the definitional data was performed 
manually for single definitimls, and quantitatively for the most 
frequently occurring words and syntagms. From this analysis 
we have established a number of broadly defined and simplified 
Categories of knowledge and Relations, which on the one hand 
intuitively reflect basic "conceptual categories" and on the other 
represenl attested lexicographic definitional categories. They 
also rely on past experience of similar work (both on Italian and 
on English), or of AI research. In order to allow the inductive

correctly and so that nlore coherent retrieval operations are 
possible, a "basic vocabulary" has been established (bolh for the 
"(k~tegories" and for the "Relations") mainly (m the basis o1" 
quantitative and intuitive considerations, and is constituted by 
v<ords acting its Labels. As an example, the following lcmma~i: 
'arnese, attrczzo, dispositivo, strumcnto, congcgno', which 
altogether appear in dictionary definitions 761 dines, have been 
grouped under the l.abel 'INSTR.UMI:~NT'. Other examples

I.IQUII), Pl.ANT, INI \[AIHTANT, SO1.;ND, G:\M F, 
TI'XTII.I-, MOVIi, BliCOMI!, l/)Sl-, etc. 
This is, therefore, ou.r approach. We begin with a system 
which has simple and general pnrpose pattern-matching 
capabilities, designing it as an incremental system. To cope 
with the fact that there are ~ariations in the way the same 
conceptual category or the same relation is linguistically 
(lcxically a ider  syntactically) rendered in natural language 
definitions, each sttcll category or relation is associated with a 
list of specilicd lcxical units and or syntactic t'caturcs which give 
the variant Ibrms. The search is then driven by these lists of 
patterns to handle the grammatical nd lexical variations. 
The "pattcn>nmtching" strategy has bccn obviously 
integrated with the Italian morphological analyzer to handle 
inflectional variation. The patterns may contain either l.abcls, 
or Lemmas, or Word-tbrms. For the Labels, the system 
searches for all the associated lcmmas and all their word-fornas 
(unless otherwise spccificd); in the same way l.emmas are 
automatically expanded to cover their inllccted word-fo,'ms, 
Generally, wc look for recurring patterns in the definitions 
and attempt o associate them with corresponding relations or 
conceptual categories. Fig. 6 lists some of the entries and 
delinitimts obtained when querying the dictionary in t)BT form 
for cooccurrcnces of items such as 'science, discipline, 
branch,...' together with 'studies, concerns, " Analyzing the 
89 
results of similar queries to the dictionary we are able to better 
identify a number of patterns to be used in the semantic 
scanning of the definitions.

This is an example of a pattern where the Labels SCIENCE

where the tbllowing are the lemmas associated to the Labels:

The results of a first run through the whole dictionary using 
an initial set of patterns can afterwards be recursively revised 
when new data are acquired. Our practical global research 
strategy is to develop a system which at the beginning has only 
a generalized expertise. This system obviously breaks down at 
many points on its first rtm; we can then evaluate all these 
90 
points, and consider when and where measures must be taken 
to overcome specilic difficulties. In this way, ncw capabilities 
can be added incrementally to the system so that gradually it is 
able to cope with increasingly difficult data. Thus wc 
systematically add new "knowledge" to the system, prompted 
each time by a failure to cope with the given data. It seems to 
us that this is a practical research strategy For cliciting and 
modelling vague and fuzzy knowledge. 
liven though the methodological approach has been 
deliberately simplified at the beginning (in order to introduce 
problems gradually, a few at a time), the dimensions of the data 
have not bccn limited in any way. 
4. The knowledge organization. 
Although the body of knowledge with which we are dealing 
is at least partly based on intuition, on vague and not even 
coherent data (as lexicographic definitions often are), and on 
inductive empirical strategies, we must attempt o model the 
knowledge as the system acquires it. The formalism for the 
representation f word-senses i  as follows. 
Each element is defined as a Function characterized by a 
Type and Arguments. The Type qualifies the function. The 
main types include: tlypernym, Relation, Qualifier, etc. 
Examples of the Type.Relation are: USED, PRODU('I~D, 
IN-TIIIM:OP, M, SI'IJI)Y, LACK, etc. The type l lypernym 
can be instantiated by: !lyperriym proper, PART, SliT, etc. 
Arguments may be either Terms, or Terms plus Function, or 
Functions. A Term can be a Label, a Word, or a combination 
of these with the logical operators 'and/or'. A Word can be 
either a Word-form, or a Lemma plus Grammatical 
Information (e.g. INpl means plural Noun). 
The following definitions: 
Battcrio, s.m., microrganismo vcgetale unicellularc priw) di 
clorofilla. 
Batteriologia, s.f., parte della microbioloNa che studia i battcri. 
are now represented as: 
Batterio --def-- > f(T. t tYP,IN Imicrorganismo, 
f(T.QUAL,lAlvegetale, \]AlunicelMare), 
f(-I'.REL-I.,XCK,\[ N\[clorofilla)) 
Baltcliolo~a --def-- > f(T.IIYI'-PART, 
f(T.REL-SPEC,lNImicrobiologia), 
f(T.I~,I-I ,-ST U D,I Nplbanerio) ) . 
As the metalanguage and the rules are declared separately 
from the pattern-matching parser, the system is incremental, 
flexible, portable (it can be used with other languages or other 
dictionaries), and testable. In fact, the system has been 
designed so that it is easy to test alternative strategies or sets 
of rules or constraints. 
This kind of organization will allow us to draw inferences, 
using part of the formal structure associated to an entry and 
inserting it in other structures in which that entry appears as 
an Argument. For example, 'microbiologia' present in tile 
second definition above is dclined in its turn as 'parle della 
biologia the studia i microrganismi...', translated as 
(T.IIYI'-PAIUI',f(T.Rlil..SI'IiC,IN\[I~iologia)), and 'biologia' 
which is "scienza che studia i fenomeni della vita...' is finally 
defined as T.1IYP-SCII!NCIL This last l.abcl SCIENCE is 
obviously also inherited by 'Battcriologia' and by.. 
'Microbiologia',

The analysis in SOmE cases is thercfbrc t',urposcly delayed 
until more relevant information has been acquired, and wi\]l 
eventually be based on the results of dclinitions already 
successl'ully handled. This analysis o\[" the litst resuhs will lead 
to an improven~ent of the system, adding other patterns or 
other surface realizations of already existing patterns to the lirst 
simple list of t)atterns, and also imposing constraints on given 
hypernyms or on given relations. I'heretbre, after the first 
stage, the system consists of patterns augmented with 
conditioning rules which will then drive subsequent runnings of 
tile procedure (\[br those cases which are lexically or 
grammatically conditioned). In this way, the system can be 
gradually retined. The analysis procedure is envisaged as a 
series of cycles which lind relevant cooccurrenccs of categories 
and relations that can then be set as conditioning rules to 
further guide successive searches. Art interactive phase is also 
foreseen so that, when necessary, definitions can be modified \[br 
a normalization i  accordance to acceptable analysis tructures. 
From succes!ive passes through the data, applying different and 
increasingly <efined sets of patterns and rules, the procedure 
huilds up, as completely as possible with this methodology, a 
formal description of the structure of the lexical definitions. 
At the end, from a comparison of the different formalized 
stuctures generated, we will be able to associate structures 
which differ for only one element (a conceptual category or 
relation). In this way, we can construct something like 
"minimal pairs" of sense-definitions, which only differ in one 
conceptual or relational feature. It can be reasonably supposed 
that this teature is related or realizes one of the differences 
between these words. It will also be possible to build 
hierarchies not only for hypcrnyms, but also, and more 
interestingly, for complex conceptual structures considered as a 
whole.
