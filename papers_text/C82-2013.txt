P r in ted  d ic t ionar ies  are gres t  repos i to r ies  of in fo rmat -  
ion ,  and i t  i s  important  that  they can be exp lo i ted  as fu l l~  
as poss ib le ,  w i th  regard to a l l  the d i f fe rent  types of data  
they conta in .  This was one of the aims when organ iz ing  the 
Machine D?otionax7 of the I ta l ian  language on a database 
s t ruc ture .  
The des ign  and organ izat ion  of the iex ica l  database fo r  
the f i r s t  two re la t ions  implemented, i .e .  the set  of Le~s  
(106, 091) and the set  of Word-forms (1 ,016,320) ,  has been 
descr ibed  in  o ther  papers (see fo r  example Ca lzo la r i  and Ce?~ 
oot t? ,  1980). 
These two very la rge  arch ives  are mainta ine~ cont inuous -  
\].7 on - l ine  and are in teract ive ly  invoked through a query lang-  
uage whioh permi ts  to the user  to access ,  in  t ransparent  mode, 
the data ,  and to have h i s  par t i cu la r  "view" of the data .  The 
database concept and methodology g ive r i se ,  in  fac t ,  to a 
rad ica l  change in  perspect ive  when conf ronted with  sequent ia l  
o rgan izat ion  of data .  We have a dynamic ra ther  than a s ta t io  
ob jec t  which i s  f lex ib le  and easy to query,  update,  extend.  
This lex ica l  database i s  now be ing  extended by the 
inser t ion  of lex ioa l  de f in i t ions  (185,899) and semantic  data .  
The gu id ing  pr inc ip le  behind th i s  pro~ect i s  the ?onv ic t ion  
that  the study of the de f in ing  vocabulary  of an ac tua l  d ic t -  
i onary  can provide a prec ious  too l  in  the semantic ana lys i s  
- 61  - 
of a language (see Noel, 1981). 
The logical or~ni~-atlon of this definitional Infoz:at- 
ion is not a trivial task, and must be performed bearing in 
.~nd the goals to be achieved. It must in fact be possible to 
~ve  dlrect access to each and every piece of l~fo~t lon  
contained in the definitions. The significance of "piece of 
lnfo1~atlon" in this context is in ~Lreot relationship to the 
eventual use to be made of it. By "piece of information" in- 
side the definitions, we intend not only the single woe-fezes, 
as they are  wr i t ten  in  the  de f in i t ions ,  but a l so  the lemma, 
to which every  word-form i s  connected;  moreover,  a t  a fu r ther  
s tage  o f  ana lys i s ,  the spec i f i c  sense o f  every  polysemio lemma 
in  the par t i cu l~r  context  (context :de f in i t ion)  must be cons id -  
ered? 
The log ica l  o r~ isat ton  o f  the de f in i t iona l  par t  o t  the 
database  must,  there fore ,  be s t ruc tured  to prov ide ,  fo r  each 
word in  every  de f iu i t ion ,  d i rec t  access  to :  a) the word. form 
i t se l f ,  w i th  the assoc ia ted  in fo rmat ion  (morpho log ica l ,  usage 
leve l ,  e tco) ;  b) the lama to which the word-form per ta ins ,  
w i th  the assoc ia ted  in fo rmat ion  (par t -o f  speech,  var iants ,  
usage leve l  o ther  word forms i ce .  parad i~n) ;  c) the spec i f i c  
sense o f  the le~ma? The implementat ion  o f  a de f in i t iona l  a rch -  
i ve  thus requ i res  an enormous task  o f  d i ssmbi~at ion  a t  a l l  
the th ree  leve ls :  word- forms,  lemmas and senses ,  in  o rder  to  
produce mater ia l  which can be used e f fec t ive ly  to  ext rac t  
semant ic  in fo rmat ion  f ran  the d ic t ionary .  ~ 
The f i r s t  s tep  in  th i s  d i rec t ion  ~s the lemmat iza t ion  o f  
the  de f in i t ions  themselves?  For  th i s  task , the  o ther  two arch iv -  
es of  the database ( the  word-form and lemma~ arch ives )  ere  be-  
ing  used,  together  w i th  ad hoo prooedu_~es, to  produce an auto -  
rust ic lemmat iza t lon  o f  a la rge  percentage  of  the words con-  
ra ined  in  the de f i~ i t ions?  For  the o ther  words, those fo r  
which automat ic  lemmat iza t ion  has not  7et  been ach ieved ,  a 
d i ssmbiguat lon  s t ra te~ has been developed in  which the human 
- 62  - 
operator  works iu teraot ive ly  wi th  the computer, and the 
computer can  memorize choices on homographic forms as they 
are made. 
A f te r  lemmat izat ion ,  each word i s  assoc ia ted  in  the 
computer memory to the addresses  of i t s  word-form and of i t s  
lamina. Therefore,  the de f in i t ions  are organized in  the memory 
not  as ac tua l  s t r ings  of words, but as l i s t s  of addresses  of  
word-forms and laminas. In  th i s  way, a number of important  
resu l t s  are achieved:  a) a great  reduct ion  in  s torage s i ze ;  
b) data  types (addresses  i .e .  b inary  numbers) which are eas i -  
l y  bandied by the computer; c) data  which are s t r i c t ly  assoc -  
ia ted  to the f i r s t  two arch ives ,  ~ at  the eventua l  const -  
ruc t ion  of an in tegrated  system; d) much more rap id  data  
process ing  and d i rec t  accesses  to each k ind of data ,  in  each 
pos i t ion  of the de f in i t ion  i t se l f ;  e) the poss ib i l i ty  of be-  
ing  able  to immediately re t rams la te  addresses  in to  character  
str J .ugs, and l i s t  of  addresses  in to  phrases ,  i .e .  de f in i t ions ;  
f )  the poss ib i l i ty  of cor rec t ing ,  updat ing  and iuser t i~  
w i th in  the de le t ions .  
0mly once th i s  prel iminsa-y stage has been completed i s  
i t  poss ib le  to ext rac t  many k inds of semantic  in fo rmat ion  
from the d io t ionaxT.  The memorized e f in i t ions  have an in tern -  
a l  l og ica l  s t ruc ture  which permits  the const ruct ion  of semant-  
i c  cha ins  ( to  evidence taxonomic re la t ionsh ips )and  a lso  of 
o ther  types of semantic l inks  ( to  evidence other  types of 
semantic re la t ionsh ips ,  such as "part o f ' ,  "set o f ' ,  " in the 
form o f ' ,  "apt to ' ,  e tc . )  between words in  the lex icon .  These 
cha ins  and l inks ,  which can be not  only d i sp layed ,  but  a l so  
handled by computer procedures in  many d i f fe rent  ways, sure ly  
provide a good s tar t ing  po in t  fo r  the study of the semantic 
s t ruc ture  of the lex icon .  In  fac t ,  i t  i s  hoped that  the com- 
puter i zed  d~ct i0nary  w i l l  o f fe r  a model of the I ta l ian  lex ica l  
system in  the var ious  aspects  which can be assoc ia ted  w i th  a
