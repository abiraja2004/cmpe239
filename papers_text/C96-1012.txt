Word sense disambugation has re- 
cently been utilized in corpus-based aI)- 
proaches, reflecting the growth in the 
number of nmehine readable texts. One 
(:ategory ()f al)l)roa(:hes disambiguates an 
input verb sense based on the similar- 
ity t)etween its governing (:its(; fillers and 
those in given examl)les. In this palter ,

this existing method, in this, greater di-

ext)eriment, in which the t)erfornlance of
disaml)igui~tion is iml)rt)ved t)y consider-

1 I n t roduct ion  
Word sense disambiguation is a crucial task in 
many kinds of natural anguage I)rot:essing at)l)li- 
cations, such as word selection in iIla(;hine trans- 
lation (Sato, 1991), pruning of syntactic struc- 
tures in parsing (l,ytinen, 1986; Nagao, 11994) 
an(l text retrieval (Krovets and Croft, 1992; 
Voorht'.es, 1993). Various researches on word 
sense disamil)ignation have recently been utilized 
in (:orlms-based apt)roache.s, reflecting the growth 
in the numlmr of machine readable texts. Unlike 
rule-basel1 ~l)l)roa('.hes, eortms-l)asext al)proa(:hes 
free us fl'om the task of generalizing observed 1)he- 
nt)Illena to l)roduce rnles for word sense, disaln- 
\])igmttion, e.g. subt:ittegorization rules. Cortms- 
based al)proaches are exet:ut(;(1 based on the in- 
tuitively t'easibh', assmnption that the higher the 
degree of similarity betwee, n the context of an ill- 
put word and tim context ill which tit(; word ap- 
l)cars in a sens(~' in a tort)us , the more plausible it 
becomes that the word is used in the same s(.~nse. 
Corpus-/)ased m(;thotls are. classified into two ap- 
1)rt)aches: examI)le-I)ased approaches (Kurohashi 
and Nagao, 1994; Urmnoto, 1994) and statistic- 
based apl)roa(:hes (l~rown et al, 1991; 1)tLglm and 
Itai, 1!)94; Niwa and Nitta, 11994; Schiitze, 1992; 
Ym'owsky, 1995). We follow the examt)h>based 
apl)roach ill exl)laining its effe.etivity for verb sense 
disamibiguation i Japanese. 
A representative example-based method for 
verb sense disambiguation was proposed by Kuro- 
hashi and Nagao (Kurohashi's inethod) (Kuro- 
hashi rand Nagao, 1994). Their method uses an 
0,xamph; database, containing examples of colloca- 
tions as in figure 1. Figure 1 shows a fragment 
of tim entry associated wittl the Japan(;se verb 
to'ru. As with most words, the ve, rb to'r"?t has multi- 
pie senses, examples of whit:h are "to take/steal," 
"to attain," "to subst'ril)e" and "to reserve," The 
database gives one or more case frame(s) associ- 
ated with tilt', verbs for each of their senses. In 
.Japanese, a coutI)lelnt;nt Of a verb, which is a con- 
stituent of the case frame of the verb, consists 
of a nonii phrase (case filler) followed by a case 
marker such ms ga (nominative) or o (accusative). 
The database has ~m example set of case fillers for 
each case. As shown in figure 1, examples of a 
comi)lement c.an be considered as an extensional 
description of the selectional restriction on it. 
The task (:onside.red in this paper is %o in- 
terpret" a verb in an input s('.ntcnt:e, i.e. to 
choose ()lit) sense from a set of candidate senses 
of the verb. Given an input sentence, Kuro- 
hashi's method interprets the verb in the input by 
computing semantic similarity between the input 
and exalnples. For this computation, Kurohashi's 
nmthod experimeIltally uses the Ja,panese word 
thesaurus Bunruigoihyo (National-Language R(> 
search Institute, 1964). As with Inost thesauruses, 
the length of the 1lath between two words in Bun- 
r'uigoihyo is exl)e, eted tt) reflect the similarity be,- 
tween them. Figure 2 ilhlstrates a fragment of 
B'unruigoihyo in(:hlding some of the nouns in fig- 
ure 1. I,et us take the example sentence (1).

Sl)ectively, which are cxamI)les that collocate with 
t(rru ("to reserve"). As sut'h, the sense of rot'u, in 
(1) can be interpreted as "to reserve." llowever, 
in Kurohashi's nmthod, several usefifl properties 
for verb disambuguatittn are missing:

2. The seleetional restriction of a certain case is 
stronger than those of others. For example, 
in tile accusative, the selectional restriction 
of "to subscribe" is stronger than that of "to 
take/steal" which Mlows various kinds of ob- 
jects as its case filler. 
In this p~tt)er, we improve on Kurohashi's method 
by introducing a formalization of these notions, 
and report the result of a comparative experiment. 
2 Mot iw,  t ion 
Property 1 in section 1 is exemplified by the 
input sentence (2). 
(2) shach5 ga sh?kanshi o toru. 
(presideut-NOM) (magazine-ACe) (?) 
The nominative, shachd ("company president"), 
in (2) is found in the %o attaiIf ' ease frame of torn 
and there is no other co-occurrence in any other 
sense of toru; therefore, the nominative supports 
an interpretation "to attain." On the other hand, 
? 
nominative accusative 
Figure 3: The semantic ranges of the nominative and 
accusative with verb torn 
the accusative, ,sh, gtkanshi ("magazine"), is most 
similar to the examples included ill tile accusative 
of the "to subscribe" and therefore the accusative 
supports another interpretation "to snt)scribe." 
Although tile most plausible interpretation here 
is actually the latter, Kurohashi's method would 
choose tile former since (a) the degree in which 
the nominative sut)ports "to attain" happe.ns to be 
stronger than the degree in which the accusatiw'~ 
supports "to subscribe," and (b) their method al- 
ways relies equally on the similarity in the nomi- 
native and the accusative. Itowever, in the case of 
torn, since the semantic range of nouns collocating 
with the verb in the nominative does not seem to 
have a strong delinearization i a semantic sense, 
it would be difficult, or even risky, to properly 
interpret the verb sense based on tile similarity 
in the nominative. In contrast, since the ranges 
are diverse in the accusative, it would lm fe.asible. 
to rely more strongly on the similarity in the ac- 
cusative. This argument can be illustrated as in 
figure 3, in which the symbols "1" and "2" de- 
note example case fillers of different case fraines 
respectively, and an input sentence includes two 
case fillers denoted by "x" and "y." The figure 
shows the distribution of example case fillers tie- 
noted by those symbols in a semantic space, where 
the semantic similarity between two case fillers is 
represented by the physical distance between two 
symbols. In the nominative, since "x" ha.ptmns to

be estimated to belong to the range of "2"s al- 
l, hough "x" ae('.ually belongs to both sets of " l"s 
a.nd "2"s. Ill the accusative, however, "y" would 
he prol)erly estimated to belong to " l"s due. to 
(;tie mutuM indet)en(lence of the two ac(:usative 
case filler sets, even though examples (lid not fully 
(:over e~tch of the ranges of "t"s  and "2"s. Note 
that this diiferen(:e would he critieM if example

we introduce, the degree of (:ontribution of case to 
verb sense disaml)iguation. One may argue that 
this l)roperty ca.n tie generMized as the notion tha.t 
the system Mways r(~lies only on the similarity in 
the a(;(:usa.tiv(~ \[or v(;r\[) setlse (lisami)iguation. Al-

We assume that inputs ~re simple sentences, 
e~mh one of which consists of a sequel lce of eases 
fl)llowe.d by their governing verb. The. task is to 
identify the sense of each input verb. The set of 
verl) senses we use are those defined in the existing 
machine re~tdal)le (li(:ti()llary "IPAL" (IPA, 1987), 
which also (:olltains example case fillers as shown 
in figure .t. As well as Kuroh~tshi's method the 
similarity between two (:as(; tillers, or more pre-

sibility of interpreting the input verb as sense 3, 
and SIM(nc, $~,c) is the degree of the similarity 
between the input complement nc and example 
complements $s,c. ws is the weight on an inter- 
pretation 3 such that more obligatory cases im- 
posed by s being found in tile input, will lead to 
a greater value of the weight a. 
P(3) = w3 E SIM(nc, Ss,c) (1)

SIM(nc, ?3,c) is the maximum degree of similar- 
ity between nc and each of ?3,e as in equation 
(2). 
SIM(,  c, &,e) = max sim(,+c, (2) 
ec~8,c 
In our method, on the other hand, for the rea- 
son indicated in section 1, we introduce two new 
factors: 
? contribution of case to verb sense disambigna- 
lion (CCD), 
? relative strength of selectional restriction 
(RSSR). 
First, in regard to CCD, we compute the plausi- 
bility of an interpretation by the weighted average 
of the degree of similarity for each case as in equa- 
tion (a), replacing equation (1). 
P(3) = w3 Ec  g3,e)" CCD(c) 
Ec CUD(c) (3) 
Here, CCD(c) is a newly introduced weight, such 
that CCD(c) is greater when the degree of case 
e's contribution is higher. 
Second, in regard to RSSR, the stronger the se- 
lectional restriction on a case of a case frame is, 
the less plausible all input complement satisfies 
that restriction as mentioned in section 1. Note 
here that tile plausibility of an interpretation of an 
input verb can be regarded as the plausibility that 
the input complements satisfy the selectional re- 
striction associated with that interpretation. This 
leads us to replace SIM(nc, Es,c) in equation (3) 
with PSS(nc, ?s,c), which denotes the plausibil- 
ity that the case filler nc satisfies the selectional 
restriction described by the example case fillers 
~S,C. 
P(3) = w3 Ec PSS('nc, g3,c) ? CCD(c) 
EcCCD(c) (4) 
From the assumption that PSS(nc,Es,c) should 
be greater for a larger SIM(ne,?s,c) and lesser 
relative strength of the selectional restriction de- 
scribed by ?s,c, we can derive equation (5). 
PSS(nc, ?s,c) = SIM(nc, Ss,c) - RSSR(3, c) 
Here, RSSR(3, c) denotes the relative strength of 
tile selectional restriction on a case c associated 
with a sense 3. 
3For more  detail, see Kurohashi's paper  (Kuro- 
hashi and Nagao, 1994). 
4 Computat ion  o f  CCD and RSSR 
The degree of contribution of case to verb sense 
disambiguation (CCD) is computed in the follow- 
ing way. The degree of contribution of a case 
should be high if the semantic range of the exam- 
ple case fillers in that case is diverse in the case 
frame (see figure 3). Let a certain verb have n 
senses (sl, 32, . . . ,  s~) and the set of example case 
fillers of a case c associated with 3~ be $3~,c. Then, 
the degree of c's contribution to disambiguation, 
CCD(c), is expected to be higher if the example 
case filler sets {?si,c I i = 1 , . . . ,  n} share less ele- 
ments. This can be realized by equation (6). 
CCD( ) = 
1 I& .d  + I&j, l - n &j, l 
i=1 j= i+t  
(6) 
a is the constant for parameterizing to what ex- 
tent CCD influences verb sense disambiguation. 
When a is larger, CCD more strongly influences 
the system's output. Considering the data sparse- 
ness problem, we do not distinguish two nonns 
X and Y in equation (6) if X and Y are similar 
enough, as in equation (7). 
{X} + {Y} = {X} if 3im(X,Y) >= 9 (7) 
Relative strength of selectional restriction 
(RSSR) is computed in the following way. Tile 
selectional restriction on a ease of a case frame is 
expected to be strong if the example case fillers 
of tile case are similar to each ()tiler. Given a set 
of example case fillers ill a case associated with 
a verb sense, the strength of the selectional re- 
striction on that case (SSR) can be estimated by 
averaging the similarity between any combination 
of two elements of that set. Thus, given a set Es,c 
of example case fillers in a case c associated with 
a verb sense s, tile SSR of c associated with s Call 
be estimated by equation (8), where ?~,c is an i4h 
element of ?3,c, and m is the number of elements 
in ?s,c, i . e .  m = \[$3,c\[. 
E =I Ej=++, 
SSR(s, c) = ,+C2 if m > 1 
maximum otherwise 
(8) 
In the case m = 1, that is, the case has only one 
example case filler, tile SSR becomes maxinmm, 
because the selectional constraint associated with 
the case is highest (following table 1, we assign 11 
as the maximum to SSR). The relative strength of 
selectional restriction (RSSR) of a case associated 
with a verb sense is estimated by the ratio of tile 
SSR of tile case to the summation of the SSRs 
of each case associated with the verb sense, as in 
62

Our experiment compared the performance of 
the following methods: 
1. tOlrohashi's method: equation (1) 
2. our method (considering CCD): equation (3) 
3. our method (considering /)oth CCD and 
RSSR): equation (4) 
In method 2 and 3, the influence of CCD, i.e. (~ in 
equation (6), was extremely large. We will show 
the relation between the w~riation of c~ and tile 
performance of the system later in this section. 
The training/test data used in tile ext)eriment 
contained over one thousand simple Japanese sen- 
tences collected from slews articles. The examples 
given by IPAL were also used as training data s. 
!),ach of tile sentences in the training/test data 
used in our experiment consisted of one or more 
complement(s) followed by one of the ten verbs 
enumerated in table 2. For each of the ten verbs, 
we conducted six-fold cross validation; that is, we 
divided the training/test data into six equal parts, 
and conducted six trials in each of which a differ- 
ent one of the six parts was used as test data and 
the rest was used as training data. We shall call 
the former the "test set" and the latter the "train- 
ing set," in each (:ase. 
When inore than one interpretation of an input 
verb is assigned the highest t)lausibility score, any 
of the above methods will (;hoose as its outt)ut the 
one that appears most frequently in the training 
data. Therefore, tile applicability in each method 
is 100%, given that the applicability is tile ratio 
of the number of the cases where the system Rives 
only one intert)retation, to the numt)er of inputs. 
Thus, in tile ext)eriment, we compared the preci- 
sion of each method, which is in our case equal to 
the ratio of the nuinber of correct outputs, to tile 
nulnt)er of int)uts. 
Since tile 1)erformance of any corpus-based 
method depends on the size of training data, we 
tirst investigated how the precision of each method 
was improved as the training data increased. In 
this, we initially used only the examples given by 
IPAL, and progressively increased the size of the 
training data used, by considering an extra part 
of the training set (five parts of the total six data 
portions used) at each iteration, until finally tak- 
ing all five l)arts in the training of our system. 
4Note that., in equation (5), while SIM is an integer, 
PlSSI/. ranges in its value h'om 0 to 1. Therefore, II, SSI{, 
is influential only when several verb senses take the 
same value of SIM for a given ease. 
'~The number of examples given by IPAL was, on 
~verage, :1.7 for each ease of each case frame. 
The results are shown in figure 5, in which the 
x-axis denotes the ratio of the data used froln the 
training set, to tile total size of the training set.

size of training data. (liven the whole training 
set, the precision improved from 75.2% to 82.4% 
(7.2% gain). Third, the introduction of the notion 
of RSSR did not fltrther improve on the inethod 
using only CCD. 
Table 2 shows tile performance for each verb 
on using the whole training set. The column of 
"lower bound" denotes tile precision gained in a 
naive method such that the system always chooses 
tile interpretation most frequently al)pearing in 
the training data (Gale et al, 1992). Tile col- 
umn of "two highest CCD" gives the two highest 
CCD values from the cases for each verb, which 
are calculated using whole training set. 
Finally, let us see to what extent we should al-. 
low CCD to influence verb sense disambiguation. 
Figure 6 shows the performance with the paramet- 
ric constant ~ in equation (6) set to w~rious val- 
ues. c~ = (/ corresponds with Kurohashi's method, 
in which CCD is never considered. As shown in 
figure 6, the stronger influence we allow CCD to 
have, the better performance we gain. 
6 Conc lus ion  
In this paper, we proposed a slew example-based 
method for verb sense (tisambiguation, which lin- 
t)roved the performance of the existing method by 
considering the degree of contribution of case to 
verb sense disambigu~tion. 
The performance ofour method significantly de- 
pends on the method of assigning degree of sim- 
ilarity to a t)air of case fillers. Since Bunr'i~itloi- 
hyou is fundamentally based on human intuition, 
it does not reflect the similarity between a pair 
of case fillers computationaly. Proposed methods

Figure 6: The relation between the degree of CCD 
and 1)recision 
of word clustering (Tokunaga et al, 1995, etc.) 
can 1)otentially be used ill conjunction with our 
method to overcome this human reliance. 
In our current implenmntat ion,  we consider the 
col location between case fillers and verbs, but ig- 
nore the combinat ion of case fillers. Instead of a 
database as in figure 1, we could store a set of com- 
binat ions of example case fillers, e.g. the combina- 
tion of s~wi ("pickpocket")  and saifu ("wallet"),  
but not that  of suri and otoko ("man") .  Itow- 
ever, this way of data  storage would require the 
collection of a much larger number of examples 
than the current method.  This issue needs to be 
fl~rther investigated.
