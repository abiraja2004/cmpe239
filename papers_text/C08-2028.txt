Abstract
We present a complete system that gen-
erates Japanese stand-up comedy. Differ-
ent modules generating different types of
jokes are tied together into a performance
where all jokes are connected in some way
to the other jokes. The script is converted
to speech and two robots perform the com-
edy routine. Evaluations show that the per-
formances are perceived as funny by many,
almost half the evaluation scores for the to-
tal impression were 4 or 5 (top score).
1 Introduction
When it comes to computer processing of humor
two main areas exist, humor recognition and hu-
mor generation (Binsted et al, 2006). This paper
falls under generation. We present a system that
automatically creates short stand-up comedy like
performances. Most generation systems only gen-
erate simple types of jokes, by themselves. There
are few systems generating complete comic shows.
Our system combines several different methods for
generating quite simple jokes and then combines
these into one short performance made for two per-
formers. This is then automatically converted into
speech audio, and presented by two small robots.
The performances generated are in Japanese,
and similar to Japanese manzai, a form of stand
up comedy. Manzai is generally performed by two
comedians, one straight-man (tsukkomi) and one
funny man (boke). Boke misunderstands or says
stupid things, and tsukkomi has to berate or cor-

rect, for instance by exclaiming ?Idiot!? and hit-
ting boke on the head.
2 System
Several components are combined to produce short
comedy performances. We first give an overview
of the system and then explanations of the com-
ponents. Though the system only generates jokes
in Japanese, for ease of understanding examples in
English similar to the Japanese original jokes are
used in the explanations.
2.1 Overall System
First a script for the performance is generated. It
starts with an introduction like ?Hi, we are two
not very proficient joke robots, please listen to
our performance.?, simply selected from a short
list. Next, one robot uses a proverb or saying in
Japanese, along the lines of ?Recently my life has
felt like ?jack of all trades, master of none?, you
know.? The other robot then makes a vulgar joke
by modifying this, perhaps like ?For me it has been
more like ?jacking off all trades, masturbate none?,
I must say.?. The way of berating your stupid part-
ner common in Japanese comedy has been incor-
porated in the system. After the vulgar joke above,
the first (tsukkomi) robot says a phrase from a list
of fairly generic put-down phrases, like ?What the
hell are you saying??.
Then the boke robot tells a joke from a database
of wordplay jokes, selected from those with one
noun already in the script. So in the example
above, perhaps: ?Speaking of ?life? [mentioned be-
fore], ?shotgun wedding: a case of wife or death?
comes to mind.? Again followed by a put-down by
the tsukkomi robot.
Next comes a simple punning riddle generator.
A noun already used that also sounds like a rude
111
word is selected and a riddle is created. The rid-
dle jokes are quite weak, similar to: ??speaking?
[used earlier] is ?speaking?, but what is a naughty
kind of speaking??, ?What??, ?Spanking the mon-
key!? (?speak? sounds like ?spank? and ?spanking
the monkey? is a euphemism). Again followed by
a put-down, ?Idiot! Would you please stop.?.
Finally, one more joke from the database and
another put-down are used. The robots then close
with ?Thank you, the end.? or similar. All the lines
are then converted to speech using a text-to-speech
tool. The audio files are then input into two small
robots, that perform the routine.
2.2 Proverb Jokes
The proverb joke module has a list of almost 1,000
proverbs and sayings in Japanese. These were
collected by simply downloading a few lists of
Japanese proverbs. Since many of these are quite
rare and thus people in general would not un-
derstand them or any joke based on them, rare
proverbs are filtered out automatically. This is
done by simply searching the web for the proverb
verbatim. If it occurs more times than some thresh-
old value (currently arbitrarily set to 50) it is con-
sidered common and can be used to make jokes,
starting with a generic statement like ?Recently my
life has felt like <proverb>?.
To make a joke, a proverb is twisted into a
new variant by changing words to similar sound-
ing dirty words instead. The dirty words are taken
from a collection a few hundred dirty words in
Japanese. These have been grouped into three
categories, sex related, feces related, and insults.
Words can belong to several or all of these groups
(e.g. ?asshole?) and are then present in all groups.
A dirty variant of a proverb has to contain at
least two new words, and these must be of the
same type, and they must also sound reasonably
similar to the words they replace. This is deter-
mined using a table of which sounds are how sim-
ilar in Japanese, which is almost the same as the
one used in (Takizawa et al, 1996). Since the
same character in Japanese can have several dif-
ferent readings, we use a standard morphological
analyzer for Japanese called ChaSen (Matsumoto
et al, 1997) to get the pronunciation for the words.
This leads to some problems, since the analyzer
does not work all that well on proverbs (often us-
ing rare grammatical constructions, words, etc.),
nor on dirty words (often missing from ChaSen?s
lexicons). If there are more than one way to change
a proverb into a new variant, one is selected at ran-
dom. The joke is then presented as described in the
overview section, i.e. one robot saying the original
proverb and the other saying the variant.
2.3 Riddle Jokes
There have been a few systems that generate word
play riddles (Binsted, 1996; Binsted and Takizawa,
1998) and our module is not very innovative, it fol-
lows the same basic ideas. First, the script that has
been created so far is run through the ChaSen mor-
phological analyzer also used earlier. Nouns and
their pronunciations are then checked against the
collection of dirty words to see if there are any
dirty words with similar pronunciation. A random
noun sounding similar to a dirty word is then used.
The riddle is built with this noun and the corre-
sponding dirty word using a simple pattern. The
boke robot says :?A <noun> is a <noun>, but
what kind of <noun> is <hint>?? followed by:
?What??, and the answer: ?<Dirty word>?. The
most difficult part is finding a hint that describes
the dirty word in a good but not too obvious
way without also being a good description of the
original word. Hints are generated by searching
the Internet for phrases like ?a <dirty word> is
<hint>.? Things found in this way are then as-
sumed to be reasonable descriptions of the dirty
word (often not true, unfortunately), and are then
checked to see if they are also often used for the
original word. This is done by checking the co-
occurrences of the hint and the original noun, and
the hint and the dirty word, also using web fre-
quencies. The log-likelihood ratios are then com-
pared, and if the hint is more closely connected to
the dirty word it is used. There is also a short stop
list of hints that are very common but useless, such
as Japanese particles similar to the word ?exist?.
Since the dirty words in our collection are not
that common on the Internet, it happens that no
usable hints are found at all. In such cases a sim-
ple hint meaning ?naughty?, ?rude?, or ?dirty?, is
used for sex related words, insults, and feces re-
lated words respectively. It is also happens that no
noun used in the script sounds similar to a dirty
word. Currently, for such cases, the whole script is
abandoned and the system starts over.
2.4 Database of Puns
We automatically collected a database of word
play jokes in Japanese, using a few seed jokes. If
112
for instance a seed joke occurred in an HTML list
on the Internet, all other list items were taken as
jokes too. The database consists of almost 2,200
jokes, mostly very weak word play jokes, though
some are perceived as quite funny by many peo-
ple. The jokes are often written using contrac-
tions (e.g. ?dontcha?), dialectal pronunciation in-
stead of standard orthography, strange punctuation
or choice of alphabets etc. This causes problems
for the morphological analyzer, leading to errors.
When a joke from the database is needed, all
the nouns from the script up until this point are
extracted as above. A joke from the database con-
taining at least one of these is then selected and
presented along the lines of ?Speaking of<noun>,
this reminds me of <joke with noun>?.
2.5 Put-Downs and Come-Backs
We asked an amateur comedian to write a short
list of generic put-down phrases, giving things like
?Ha ha, very funny?, ?What the hell are you talk-
ing about??, ?Idiot?, ?That is not what I meant?,
and similar. Put-downs are drawn at random from
the list, excluding any phrase already used.
For database jokes, two other put-downs are also
possible. There is a a simple web frequency check
to see if the joke is old. Any joke occurring more
than 20 times on the Internet is currently consid-
ered ?Old!?. Jokes that are not old can instead get
the ?Stupid foreigner!? put-down (quite common
in Japanese comedy). This is used on jokes with
words written either in English letters or katakana
letters. Katakana is mainly used for foreign loan
words in Japanese, but is also other things (simi-
lar perhaps to using upper case in English), which
leads to some errors.
For some put-downs it is also possible for the
boke robot to make a come-back. When possible
this is also added to the script. For instance, when
the tsukkomi robot says ?Old!? it goes on to say for
example: ?By the way, how is the new apartment
you moved into??, and the boke robot replies with
the phrase used on him, ?Old!?.
2.6 Robots
The script is converted into audio for the robots
using the AquesTalk
1
text-to-speech system, and
the robots are given different synthetic voices. The
text-to-speech conversion works fairly well, but
sometimes the speech is hard to understand.

Figure 1: The robots used.
The two robots used in the performances are
both Robovie-i robots, see Figure 1, one blue and
one gold. The Robovie-i can move its legs and
lean its body sideways. It has a small speaker at-
tached, to produce the speech. This is the weak-
est link in the system so far, since the speaker is
quite weak. The sound quality is not great, and
the volume is low. This is also compounded by
the text-to-speech system output sometimes being
quite hard to understand to begin with, and also
by the generated jokes sometimes being incompre-
hensible. The main merits of the Robovie-i are that
it is easily programmable, cheap, and cute. The
robots did not move very much. They walked a
little bit forward and bowed during the introduc-
tion, then remained stationary, leaning their torsos
a little to one side when speaking.
3 Evaluation
We generated two scripts and had the robots per-
form them for evaluators. Script 1 was shown first,
then a short questionnaire for script 1 was filled
out, then script 2 was performed and another ques-
tionnaire filled out. The impression of each whole
performance was rated from 1 (not funny) to 5
(funny). Each individual joke was also rated.
Evaluators were found by going to a student
cafeteria and offering chocolate for participating.
Since the speech from the robot was a bit diffi-
cult to understand it was sometimes very difficult
to hear some jokes when there was a lot of back-
ground noise. The evaluators where also given the
script in written form after they had watched the
performance and could thus read any parts they did
not hear before evaluating the funniness. 33 eval-
uators took part in the evaluations. How funny the
jokes are thought to be of course varies a lot from
person to person. The highest and lowest means
of an evaluator were 4.2 and 1.2 respectively. The
results are shown in Tables 1 and 2.
Table 1 shows the overall impression of the
scripts, 3.3 on a scale from 1 to 5. Joke genera-
113

Table 1: Mean (and standard deviation) evaluation
scores and the number of 4s or 5s assigned, for the
total impression of the two evaluated scripts.
tion systems tend to get fairly low scores, so we
believe a score of over 3 is good. What meaning
evaluators put into a 3 on a scale from 1 to 5 is hard
to estimate, but many seemed to enjoy the perfor-
mances. It was also not uncommon to laugh a lot
during the performance and still rate everything as
1 or 2 so, for some, laughter does not equal funny.
A score of 4 or more should reasonably indicate a
funny joke. For the total impression of the perfor-
mances, 30 scores (of 66) were either a 4 or a 5, so
almost half of the evaluators though it was funny
in this sense. We believe this is a good result, con-
sidering that individual tastes in humor vary a lot.
In Table 2 the scores of the individual jokes are
shown. It seems that the proverb jokes are of about
the same level as the human made jokes from the
Internet. The riddle jokes lag a little behind, as
does the come-back joke that was included.
While the system makes mistakes, joke gen-
eration seems rather robust to errors. Since the
robots are supposed to say stupid things anyway,
if they do so by mistake instead of on purpose it
can still be funny. There were comments from
evaluators about mistakes that they disliked too,
though: ?This put-down is inappropriate for that
joke?, ?They should bow while saying thank you,
not after.?, ?The dirty jokes are too direct, subtle is
funnier?.
The biggest problem was the robot speakers.
This should be fairly easy to fix. The other prob-
lems stem mainly from the generated jokes not be-
ing overly funny, which seems harder to deal with.
4 Conclusions
We have implemented a complete system for auto-
matically generating and performing short stand-
up comedy routines in Japanese. Different mod-
ules generate different types of jokes then tied to-
gether so that the jokes used have something in
common. This is then converted to speech and up-
loaded into two robots that perform the comedy.
In the evaluation, the performances were rated

as 3.3 on a scale from 1 (not funny) to 5 (funny)
and many evaluators enjoyed the performances.
Almost half of the evaluation scores assigned to
the total impression of the system were 4 or 5. This
seems quite promising, though there are still many
things that can be improved in the system.
