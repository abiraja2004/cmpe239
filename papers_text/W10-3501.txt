Abstract 
This paper presents a method for con-
structing a large-scale Person Ontology 
with category hierarchy from Wikipe-
dia. We first extract Wikipedia category 
labels which represent person (hereafter, 
Wikipedia Person Category, WPC) by 
using a machine learning classifier. We 
then construct a WPC hierarchy by de-
tecting is-a relations in the Wikipedia 
category network. We then extract the 
titles of Wikipedia articles which 
represent person (hereafter, Wikipedia 
person instance, WPI). Experiments 
show that the accuracy of WPC extrac-
tion is 99.3% precision and 98.4% re-
call, while that of WPI extraction is 
98.2% and 98.6%, respectively. The ac-
curacies are significantly higher than 
the previous methods. 
1  Introduction 
In recent years, we have become increasingly 
aware of the need for, up-to-date knowledge 
bases offering broad coverage in order to im-
plement practical semantic inference engines 
for advanced applications such as question 
answering, summarization and textual entail-
ment recognition. General ontologies, such as 
WordNet (Fellbaum et al, 1998), and Nihongo 
Goi-Taikei (Ikehara et al, 1997), contain gen-
eral knowledge of wide range of fields. How-
ever, it is difficult to instantly add new know-
ledge, particularly proper nouns, to these gen-
eral ontologies. Therefore, Wikipedia has 
come to be used as a useful corpus for know-
ledge extraction because it is a free and large-
scale online encyclopedia that continues to be 
actively developed. For example, in DBpedia 
(Bizer et al 2009), RDF triples are extracted 
from the Infobox templates within Wikipedia 
articles. In YAGO (Suchanek et al 2007), an 
appropriate WordNet synset (most likely cate-
gory) is assigned to a Wikipedia category as a 
super-category, and Wikipedia articles are ex-
tracted as instances of the category.  
As a first step to make use of proper noun 
and related up-to-date information in Wikipedia, 
we focus on person names and the articles and 
categories related to them because it contains a 
large number of articles and categories that in-
dicate person, and because large-scale person 
ontology is useful for applications such as per-
son search and named entity recognition. Ex-
amples of a person article are personal name 
and occupational title such as ?Ichiro? and ?Fi-
nancial planner,? while an example of a person 
category is occupational title such as 
?Sportspeople.? 
The goal of this study is to construct a large-
scale and comprehensive person ontology by 
extracting person categories and is-a relations1 
among them. We first apply a classifier based 
on machine learning to all Wikipedia categories 
to extract categories that represent person. If 
both of the linked Wikipedia categories are per-
son categories, the category link is labeled as 
an is-a relation. We then use a heuristic-based 
rule to extract the title of articles that represent 
person as person instance from the person cate-
gories. 
In the following sections, we first describe 
the language resources and the previous works. 
We then introduce our method for constructing 
the person ontology and report our experimen-
tal results.

2 Language Resources 
2.1  Japanese Wikipedia 
Wikipedia is a free, multilingual, on-line en-
cyclopedia that is being actively developed by a 
large number of volunteers. Wikipedia has ar-
ticles and categories. The data is open to the 
public as XML files2. Figure 1 shows an exam-
ple of an article. An article page has a title, 
body, and categories. In most articles, the first 
sentence of the body is the definition sentence 
of the title.  Although the Wikipedia category 
system is organized in a hierarchal manner, it is 
a thematic classification, not a taxonomy. The 
relation between category and subcategory and 
that between a category and articles listed on it 
are not necessarily an is-a relation. A category 
could have two or more super categories and 
the category network could have loops.

2.2 Nihongo Goi-Taikei  
To construct the ontology, we first apply a ma-
chine learning based classifier to determine if a 
category label indicates a person or not. A Wi-
kipedia category label is often a common com-
pound noun or a noun phrase, and the head 
word of a Japanese compound noun and noun 
phrase is usually the last word. We assume the 
semantic category of the last word is an impor-
tant feature for classification.  
Nihongo Goi-Taikei (hereafter, Goi-Taikei) 
is one of the largest and best known Japanese 
thesauri. Goi-Taikei contains different semantic 
category hierarchies for common nouns, proper 
nouns, and verbs. In this work, we use only the

common noun category (Figure 2). It consists 
of approximately 100,000 Japanese words (he-
reafter, instance) and the meanings of each 
word are described by using about 2,700 hie-
rarchical semantic categories. Words (In-
stances) with multiple meanings (ambiguous 
words) are assigned multiple categories in Goi-
Taikei. For example, the transliterated Japanese 
word (instance) raita (???? ) has two 
meanings of ?writer? and ?lighter,? and so be-
longs to two categories, ?353:author 3 ? and 
?915:household.?  
Japanese WordNet (approximately 90,000 
entries as of May 2010), which has recently 
been released to the public (Bonds et al, 2008), 
could be an alternative to Goi-Taikei as a large-
scale Japanese thesaurus. We used Goi-Taikei 
in this work because Japanese WordNet was 
translated from English WordNet and it is not 
known whether it covers the concepts unique to 
Japanese. 
3 Previous Works 
3.1 Ponzetto?s method and Sakurai?s me-
thod 
Ponzetto et al (2007) presented a set of 
lightweight heuristics such as head matching 
and modifier matching for distinguishing is-a 
links from not-is-a links in the Wikipedia cate-
gory network. The main heuristic, ?Syntax-
based methods? is based on head matching, in 
which a category link is labeled as is-a relation 
if the two categories share the same head lem-
ma, such as CAPITALS IN ASIA and CAPI-
TALS. Sakurai et al (2008) presented a method 
equivalent to head matching for Japanese Wi-
kipedia. As Japanese is a head final language, 
they introduced the heuristic called suffix 
matching; it labels a category link as a is-a rela-
tion if one category is the suffix of the other 
category, such as ?????(airports in Ja-
pan) and ??(airports). In the proposed me-
thod herein, if a Wikipedia category and its 
parent category are both person categories, the 
category link is labeled as is-a relation. There-
fore, is-a relations, which cannot be extracted 
by Ponzetto?s or Sakurai?s method, can be ex-
tracted.

3.2 Kobayashi?s method 
Kobayashi et al (2008) presented a tech-
nique to make a Japanese ontology equivalent 
to YAGO; it assigns Goi-Taikei categories to 
Japanese Wikipedia categories. These two me-
thods and our method are similar in that a Wi-
kipedia category and the title of an article are 
regarded as a category and an instance, respec-
tively. Kobayashi et al automatically extract 
hypernyms from the definition sentence of each 
article in advance (referred to hereafter as ?D-
hypernym.?) They apply language-dependent 
lexico-syntactic patterns to the definition sen-
tence to extract the D-hypernym. Here are some 
examples. 
 
??[hypernym]?????? <EOS> 
one of [hypernym] 
 
??[hypernym]???<EOS> 
is a [hypernym] 
 
 [hypernym] <EOS> 
is a [hypernym] ? 
 
where <EOS> refer to the beginning of a 
sentence 
For example, from the article in Figure 1, the 
words ?????? (golf player)? is extracted 
as the D-hypernym of the article ??????
??? (Michelle Wie).? 
Figure 3 outlines the Kobayashi?s method. 
First, for a Wikipedia category, if its last word 
matches an instance of Goi-Taikei category, all 
such Goi-Taikei categories are extracted as a 
candidate of the Wikipedia category?s super-
class. If the last word of the D-hypernym of the 
Wikipedia article listed on the Wikipedia cate-
gory matches an instance of the Goi-Taikei cat-
egory, the Goi-Taikei category is extracted as 
the super-class of the Wikipedia category and 
its instances (Wikipedia articles) (Figure 3). 
Although the Kobayashi?s method is a general 
one, it can be used to construct person ontology 
if the super-class candidates are restricted to 
those Goi-Taikei categories which represent 
person. Titl             ????????

3.3 Yamashita?s method 
Yamashita made an open source software 
which extracts personal names from Japanese 
Wikipedia4. He extracted the titles of articles 
listed on the categories ???(? births) (e.g., 
2000 births). As these categories are used to 
sort the names of people, horses, and dogs by 
born year, he used a simple pattern matching

rules to exclude horses and dogs. In the expe-
riment in Section 5, we implemented his me-
thod by using not only ??? (births)? but also 
???  (deaths)? and ????  (th-century 
deaths),? ????  (s deaths),? ????  (s 
births),? and ????  (th births)? to extract 
personal names. As far as we know, it is the 
only publicly available software to extract a 
large number of person names from the Japa-
nese Wikipedia. For the comparison with our 
method, it should be noted that his method 
cannot extract person categories. 
4 Ontology Building Method 
4.1 Construction of Wikipedia person cat-
egory hierarchy (WPC) 
We extract the WPC by using a machine learn-
ing classifier. If a Wikipedia category and its 
parent category are both person categories, the 
category link is labeled as an is-a relation. This 
means that all is-a relations in our person on-
tology are extracted from the original Wikipe-
dia category hierarchy using only a category 
classifier. This is because we investigated 
1,000 randomly sampled links between person 
categories and found 98.7% of them were is-a 
relations. Figure 4 shows an example of the 
Wikipedia category hierarchy and the con-
structed WPC hierarchy.

Figure 4: Example of Wikipedia category hie-
rarchy (top) and constructed Wikipedia person 
category hierarchy (bottom) 
We detect whether the Wikipedia category 
label represents a person by using Support Vec-
tor Machine (SVM). The semantic category of 
the words in the Wikipedia category label and 
those in the neighboring categories are used for 
the features. We use the following three aspects 
of the texts that exist around the target category 
for creating the features: 
 
1. Structural relation between the target cat-
egory and the text in Wikipedia.  (6 kinds) 
 
2.  Span of the text.  (2 kinds) 
 
3. Semantic category of the text derived 
from Goi-Taikei. (4 kinds) 
 
We examined 48 features by combining the 
above three aspects (6*2*4). 
   The following are the six structural relations 
in Wikipedia between the target category and 
the text information: 
 
Structural relation 
A. The target Wikipedia category label.  
 
B. All parent category labels of the target cat-
egory.  
 
C. All child category labels of the target   cat-
egory.  
 
D. All sibling category labels of the target 
category.  
 
E. All D-hypernym5 from each article listed on 
the target category.  
 
F. All D-hypernyms extracted from the ar-
ticles with the same name as the target cate-
gory. 
 
As for F, for example, when the article ??
???(bassist) is listed on the category: ?
? ? ? ? (bassist), we regard the D-
hypernym of the article as the hypernym of  
the category. 
 
As most category labels and D-hypernyms are 
common nouns, they are likely to match in-
stances in Goi-Taikei which lists possible se-
mantic categories of words.  
                                                 
5As for D-hypernym extraction patterns, we used almost 
the same patterns described in previous works on Japa-
nese sources such as (Kobayashi et al 2008; Sumida et al, 
2008), which are basically equivalent to the works on 
English sources such as (Hearst, 1992). 
4
   After the texts located at various structural 
relations A-F are collected, they are matched to 
the instances of Goi-Taikei in two different 
spans: 
 
Span of the text 
?. All character strings of the text 
 
?. The last word of the text 
 
For the span ?, the text is segmented into 
words using a Japanese morphological analyzer. 
The last word is used because the last word 
usually represents the meaning of the entire 
noun phrase (semantic head word) in Japanese.  
In the proposed method, hierarchical seman-
tic categories of Goi-Taikei are divided into 
two categories; ?Goi-Taikei person categories? 
and other categories. Goi-Taikei person catego-
ry is defined as those categories that represent 
person, that is, all categories under ?5:humans? 
and ?223:officials,? and ?1939: occupation? 
and ?1066:name? in Goi-Taikei hierarchy as 
shown in Figure 1.  
For each structural relation A-F  and span ? 
and ?, we calculate four relative frequencies 
a-d, which represents the manner in which the 
span of texts match the instance of Goi-Taikei 
person category. It basically indicates the de-
gree to which the span of text is likely to mean 
a person.  
 
Semantic type 
a. The span of text matches only instances of 
Goi-Taikei person categories. 
 
b. The span of text matches only instances of 
categories other than Goi-Taikei person cat-
egories. 
 
c. The span of text matches both instances of 
Goi-Taikei person categories and those of 
other categories. 
 
d. The span of text does not match any in-
stances of Goi-Taikei. 
 
For example, when the target category is ???
?? (musicians) in Figure 5 and the feature in 
question is B-? (the last word of its parent 
categories), the word ??? (whose senses are 
family and house) falls into semantic type c, 
and the word ???? (music) falls into seman-
tic type b. Therefore, the frequency of semantic 
types a, b, c, d are 0, 1, 1, 0, respectively, in the 
features related to B-?, and the relative fre-
quencies used for the feature value related B-? 
are 0, 0.5, 0.5, 0, respectively. In this way, we 
use 48 relative frequencies calculated from the 
combinations of structural relation A-F, span 
? and ?, and semantic type a-d, as the feature 
vector for the SVM.  
 ?Target category
?Similar category
?Last word
???_Artists ??_Music
???_Musicians
??????_Jazz composers
???_Composers
???_Musicians by instrument
?? Art ??????_People by occupation
 
Figure 5: Example of Wikipedia category hie-
rarchy when the target category is ????? 
4.2  Similar category 
In Wikipedia, there are categories that do not 
have articles and those with few neighboring 
categories. Here, we define the neighboring 
categories for a category as those categories 
that can be reached through a few links from 
the category. In these cases, there is a possibili-
ty that there is not enough text information 
from which features (mainly semantic category 
of words) can be extracted, which could de-
grade the accuracy. 
The proposed method overcomes this prob-
lem by detecting categories similar to the target 
category (the category in question) from its 
neighboring categories for extracting sufficient 
features to perform classification. Here, "simi-
lar category" is defined as parent, child, and 
sibling categories whose last word matches the 
last word of the target category. This is because 
there is a high possibility that the similar cate-
gories and the target category have similar 
meaning if they share the same last word in the 
category labels. If the parent (child) category is 
determined as a similar category, its parent 
(child) category is also determined as a similar 
category if the last word is the same. The pro-
cedure is repeated as long as they share the 
same last word.  
Figure 5 shows an example of similar cate-
gories when the target category is ?Musicians.? 
In this case, features extracted from A-F of 
5
similar categories are added to features ex-
tracted using A-F of the target category, ?Mu-
sicians.? For example, similar category ?Art-
ists? has ?Art? and ?People by occupation? as 
B (parent categories of the target category) in 
Figure 5, therefore ?Art? and ?People by occu-
pation? are added to B of ?Musicians.? 
4.3 Extracting Wikipedia person instance 
(WPI) 
The proposed method extracts, as WPIs the 
titles of articles listed as WPCs that meet the 
following four requirements.  
 
1. The last word of the D-hypernym of the 
title of the Wikipedia article matches an in-
stance of Goi-Taikei person category.  
 
2. The last word of the title of Wikipedia ar-
ticle matches an instance of Goi-Taike per-
son category. 
 
3. At least one of the Wikipedia categories as-
signed to the Wikipedia article matches the 
following patterns: 
 
(??|???|???|??|???|???)<EOS> 
( deaths | th-century deaths | ?s deaths | births | th-births | ?s 
births ) <EOS> 
 
These categories are used to sort a large 
number of person names by year.  
 
 
4. Wikipedia categories assigned to the Wiki-
pedia article satisfy the following condition: 
 
   
5.0categories  Wikipediaofnumber  All
4.1Section in   WPCsextracted ofNumber ???
 
 
This condition is based on the observation 
that the more WPCs a Wikipedia article is 
assigned to, the more it is likely to be a WPI. 
We set the threshold 0.5 from the results of a 
preliminary experiment.  
5 Experiments  
5.1 Experimental setup 
We used the XML file of the Japanese Wiki-
pedia as of July 24, 2008. We removed irrele-
vant pages by using keywords (e.g., ?image:,? 
?Help:?) in advance. This cleaning yielded 
477,094 Wikipedia articles and 39,782 Wiki-
pedia categories. We manually annotated each 
category to indicate whether it represents per-
son (positive) or not (negative). For ambiguous 
cases, we used the following criteria:  
 
?Personal name by itself (e.g., Michael Jack-
son) is not regarded as WPC because usually 
it does not have instances. (Note: personal 
name as article title is regarded as WPI. )  
 
?Occupational title (e.g., Lawyers) is regarded 
as WPC because it represents a person. 
 
?Family (e.g., Brandenburg family) and Eth-
nic group (e.g., Sioux) are regarded as WPC. 
 
?Group name (e.g., The Beatles) is not re-
garded as WPC. 
 
In order to develop a person category classifier, 
we randomly selected 2,000 Wikipedia catego-
ries (positive:435, negative:1,565) from all cat-
egories for training6. We used the remaining 
37,767 categories for evaluation. To evaluate 
WPI extraction accuracy, we used Wikipedia 
articles not listed on the Wikipedia categories 
used for training. 417,476 Wikipedia articles 
were used in the evaluation.  
To evaluate our method, we used TinySVM-
0.09 7  with a linear kernel for classification, 
and the Japanese morphological analyzer JU-
MAN-6.0 8  for word segmentation. The com-
parison methods are Kobayashi?s method and 
Yamashita?s method under the same conditions 
as our method. 
5.2 Experimental results  
Table 1 shows the WPCs extraction accuracy. 
Precision and recall of proposed method are 6.5 
points and 14.8 points better than those of Ko-
bayashi's method, respectively.

To confirm our assumption on the links be-
tween WPCs, we randomly selected 1,000 pairs 
of linked categories from extracted WPCs, and 
manually investigated whether both 
represented person and were linked by is-a re-
lation. We found that precision of these pairs 
was 98.3%. 
Errors occurred when the category link be-
tween  person categories in the Wikipedia cate-
gory network was not an is-a relation, such as 
???(Chiba clan) ? ????(Ohsuga clan). 
However, this case is infrequent, because 
98.7% of the links between person categories 
did exhibit an is-a relation (as described in Sec-
tion 4.1).  
Table 2 shows the WPIs extraction accuracy. 
We randomly selected 1,000 Wikipedia articles 
from all categories in Wikipedia, and manually 
created evaluation data (positive:281, nega-
tive:719). The recall of the proposed method 
was 98.6%, 21.0 points higher than that of Ya-
mashita?s method. Our method topped the F-
measure of Kobayashi?s method by 3.4 points. 
Among 118,552 extracted as WPIs by our me-
thod, 116,418 articles were expected be correct. 
In our method, errors occurred when WPI was 
not listed on any WPCs. However, this case is 
very rare. Person instances are almost always 
assigned to at least one WPC. Thus, we can 
achieve high coverage for WPIs even if we fo-
cus only on WPCs. We randomly selected 
1,000 articles from all articles and obtained 277 
person instances by a manual evaluation. Fur-
thermore, we investigated the 277 person in-
stances, and found that only two instances were 
not classified into any WPCs (0.7%).

6 Discussions 
We constructed a WPC hierarchy using the 
8,357 categories created by combining ex-
tracted categories and training categories. The 
resulting WPC hierarchy has 224 root catego-
ries (Figure 4). Although the majority of the 
constructed ontology is interconnected, 194 
person categories had no parent or child (2.3 % 
of all person categories). In rare cases, the cat-
egory network has loops (e.g., ?Historians? and 
?Scholars of history? are mutually interlinked).  
Shibaki et al (2009) presented a method for 
building a Japanese ontology from Wikipedia 
using Goi-Taikei, as its upper ontology. This 
method can create a single connected taxono-
my with a single root category. We also hope 
to create a large-scale, single-root, and inter-
connected person ontology by using some up-
per ontology.   
Our method is able to extract WPCs that do 
not match any Goi-Taikei instance (e.g., Vi-
olinists and Animators). Furthermore, our me-
thod is able to detect many ambiguous Wikipe-
dia category labels correctly as person category. 
For example, ?????????? (fashion 
model)? is ambiguous because the last word 
???? (model)? is ambiguous among three 
senses: person, artificial object, and abstract 
relation. Kobayashi?s method cannot extract a 
WPC if the last word of the category label does 
not match any instance in Goi-Taikei. Their 
method is error-prone if the last word has mul-
7
tiple senses in Goi-Taikei because it is based on 
simple pattern matching. Our method can han-
dle unknown and ambiguous category labels 
since it uses machine learning-based classifiers 
whose features are extracted from neighboring 
categories. 
Our method can extract is-a person category 
pairs that could not be extracted by Ponzetto et 
al. (2007) and Sakurai et al (2008). Their me-
thods use head matching in which a category 
link is labeled as an is-a relation only if the 
head words of category labels are matched. 
However, our method can extract is-a relations 
without reference to surface character strings, 
such as ????????(Journalists)? and 
?????????(Sports writers).? Among 
all 14,408 Wikipedia category pairs extracted 
as is-a relations in our method, 5,558 (38.6%) 
did not match their head words.  
We investigated the learning curve of the 
machine learning-based classifier for extracting 
WPCs, in order to decide the appropriate 
amount of training data for future updates.  
As we have already manually tagged all 
39,767 Wikipedia categories, we randomly se-
lected 30,000 categories and investigated the 
performance of our method when the number 
of the training data was changed from 1,000 to 
30,000. The evaluation data was the remaining 
9,767 categories.

Figure 6: The effect of training data size to 
WPC extraction accuracy 
 
Figure 6 shows the precision, recall, and F-
measure for different training data sizes. F-
measure differed only 0.4 points from 1,000 
samples (98.5%) to 30,000 samples (98.9%). 
Figure 6 shows that the proposed method of-
fers high accuracy in detecting WPCs with only 
a few thousand training examples.  
Our method uses similar categories for 
creating features as well as the target Wikipe-
dia category (Section 4.1). We compared the 
proposed method to a variant that does not use 
similar categories to confirm the effectiveness 
of this technique. Furthermore, our method 
uses the Japanese thesaurus, Goi-Taikei, to 
look up the semantic category of the words for 
creating the features for machine learning. We 
also compared the proposed method with the 
one that does not use semantic category (de-
rived from Goi-Taikei) but instead uses word 
surface form for creating features (This one 
uses similar categories).  
   Figure 7 shows the performance of the clas-
sifiers for each type of features. We can clearly 
observe that using similar categories results in 
higher F-measure, regardless of the training 
data size. We also observe that when there is 
little training data, the method using word sur-
face form as features results in drastically low-
er F-measures. In addition, its accuracy was 
consistently lower than the others even if the 
training data size was increased. Therefore, we 
can conclude that using similar category and 
Goi-Taikei are very important for creating good 
features for classification.

In future, we will attempt to apply our method 
to other Wikipedia domains, such as organiza-
tions and products. We will also attempt to use 
other Japanese thesauri, such as Japanese 
WordNet. Furthermore, we hope to create a 
large-scale and single connected ontology. As a 
final note, we plan to open the person ontology 
constructed in this paper to the public on Web 
in the near future.
