Abstract
For extractive meeting summarization, previ-
ous studies have shown performance degrada-
tion when using speech recognition transcripts
because of the relatively high speech recogni-
tion errors on meeting recordings. In this pa-
per we investigated using confusion networks
to improve the summarization performance
on the ASR condition under an unsupervised
framework by considering more word candi-
dates and their confidence scores. Our ex-
perimental results showed improved summa-
rization performance using our proposed ap-
proach, with more contribution from leverag-
ing the confidence scores. We also observed
that using these rich speech recognition re-
sults can extract similar or even better sum-
mary segments than using human transcripts.
1 Introduction
Speech summarization has received increasing in-
terest recently. It is a very useful technique that
can help users to browse a large amount of speech
recordings. The problem we study in this paper is
extractive meeting summarization, which selects the
most representative segments from the meeting tran-
scripts to form a summary. Compared to text sum-
marization, speech summarization is more challeng-
ing because of not only its more spontaneous style,
but also word errors in automatic speech recogni-
tion (ASR) output. Intuitively the incorrect words
have a negative impact on downstream summariza-
tion performance. Previous research has evaluated
summarization using either the human transcripts or
ASR output with word errors. Most of the prior
work showed that performance using ASR output is
consistently lower (to different extent) comparing to
that using human transcripts no matter whether su-
pervised or unsupervised approaches were used.
To address the problem caused by imperfect
recognition transcripts, in this paper we investigate
using rich speech recognition results for summariza-
tion. N-best hypotheses, word lattices, and confu-
sion networks have been widely used as an inter-
face between ASR and subsequent spoken language
processing tasks, such as machine translation, spo-
ken document retrieval (Chelba et al, 2007; Chia
et al, 2008), and shown outperforming using 1-
best hypotheses. However, studies using these rich
speech recognition results for speech summariza-
tion are very limited. In this paper, we demonstrate
the feasibility of using confusion networks under an
unsupervised MMR (maximum marginal relevance)
framework to improve summarization performance.
Our experimental results show better performance
over using 1-best hypotheses with more improve-
ment observed from using confidence measure of the
words. Moreover, we find that the selected summary
segments are similar to or even better than those gen-
erated using human transcripts.
2 Related Work
Many techniques have been proposed for the meet-
ing summarization task, including both unsuper-
vised and supervised approaches. Since we use un-
supervised methods in this study, we will not de-
scribe previous work using supervised approaches
because of the space limit. Unsupervised meth-
46
ods are simple and robust to different corpora, and
do not need any human labeled data for training.
MMR was introduced in (Carbonell and Goldstein,
1998) for text summarization, and was used widely
in meeting summarization (Murray et al, 2005a; Xie
and Liu, 2008). Latent semantic analysis (LSA) ap-
proaches have also been used (Murray et al, 2005a),
which can better measure document similarity at the
semantic level rather than relying on literal word
matching. In (Gillick et al, 2009), the authors intro-
duced a concept-based global optimization frame-
work using integer linear programming (ILP), where
concepts were used as the minimum units, and the
important sentences were extracted to cover as many
concepts as possible. They showed better perfor-
mance than MMR. In a follow-up study, (Xie et al,
2009) incorporated sentence information in this ILP
framework. Graph-based methods, such as LexRank
(Erkan and Radev, 2004), have been originally used
for extractive text summarization, where the docu-
ment is modeled as a graph and sentences as nodes,
and sentences are ranked according to its similarity
with other nodes. (Garg et al, 2009) proposed Clus-
terRank, a modified graph-based method in order
to take into account the conversational speech style
in meetings. Recently (Lin et al, 2009) suggested
to formulate the summarization task as optimizing
submodular functions defined on the document?s se-
mantic graph, and showed better performance com-
paring to other graph-based approaches.
Rich speech recognition results, such as N-best
hypotheses and confusion networks, were first used
in multi-pass ASR systems to improve speech recog-
nition performance (Stolcke et al, 1997; Mangu et
al., 2000). They have been widely used in many sub-
sequent spoken language processing tasks, such as
machine translation, spoken document understand-
ing and retrieval. Confusion network decoding was
applied to combine the outputs of multiple machine
translation systems (Sim et al, 2007; Matusov et
al., 2006). In the task of spoken document retrieval,
(Chia et al, 2008) proposed to compute the expected
word counts from document and query lattices, and
estimate the statistical models from these counts,
and reported better retrieval accuracy than using
only 1-best transcripts. (Hakkani-Tur et al, 2006)
investigated using confusion networks for name en-
tity detection and extraction and user intent classifi-
cation. They also obtained better performance than
using ASR 1-best output.
There is very limited previous work using more
than 1-best ASR output for speech summarization.
Several studies used acoustic confidence scores in
the 1-best ASR hypothesis in the summarization sys-
tems (Valenza et al, 1999; Zechner and Waibel,
2000; Hori and Furui, 2003). (Liu et al, 2010) eval-
uated using n-best hypotheses for meeting summa-
rization, and showed improved performance with the
gain coming mainly from the first few candidates. In
(Lin and Chen, 2009), confusion networks and po-
sition specific posterior lattices were considered in
a generative summarization framework for Chinese
broadcast news summarization, and they showed
promising results by using more ASR hypotheses.
We investigate using confusion networks for meet-
ing summarization in this study. This work differs
from (Lin and Chen, 2009) in terms of the language
and genre used in the summarization task, as well
as the summarization approaches. We also perform
more analysis on the impact of confidence scores,
different pruning methods, and different ways to
present system summaries.
3 Summarization Approach
In this section, we first describe the baseline sum-
marization framework, and then how we apply it to
confusion networks.
3.1 Maximum Marginal Relevance (MMR)
MMR is a widely used unsupervised approach in
text and speech summarization, and has been shown
perform well. We chose this method as the basic
framework for summarization because of its sim-
plicity and efficiency. We expect this is a good
starting point for the study of feasibility of us-
ing confusion networks for summarization. For
each sentence segment Si in one document D, its
score (MMR(i)) is calculated using Equation 1
according to its similarity to the entire document
(Sim1(Si, D)) and the similarity to the already ex-
tracted summary (Sim2(Si, Summ)).
MMR(i) =
?? Sim1(Si, D)? (1? ?)? Sim2(Si, Summ)
(1)
47
where parameter ? is used to balance the two factors
to ensure the selected summary sentences are rel-
evant to the entire document (thus important), and
compact enough (by removing redundancy with the
currently selected summary sentences). Cosine sim-
ilarity can be used to compute the similarity of two
text segments. If each segment is represented as a
vector, cosine similarity between two vectors (V1,
V2) is measured using the following equation:
sim(V1, V2) =
?
i t1it2i??
i t
2
1i ?
??
i t
2
2i
(2)
where ti is the term weight for a word wi, for which
we can use the TFIDF (term frequency, inverse doc-
ument frequency) value, as widely used in the field
of information retrieval.
3.2 Using Confusion Networks for
Summarization
Confusion networks (CNs) have been used in many
natural language processing tasks. Figure 1 shows
a CN example for a sentence segment. It is a di-
rected word graph from the starting node to the end
node. Each edge represents a word with its associ-
ated posterior probability. There are several word
candidates for each position. ?-? in the CN repre-
sents a NULL hypothesis. Each path in the graph is
a sentence hypothesis. For the example in Figure 1,
?I HAVE IT VERY FINE? is the best hypothesis
consisting of words with the highest probabilities for
each position. Compared to N-best lists, confusion
networks are a more compact and powerful repre-
sentation for word candidates. We expect the rich in-
formation contained in the confusion networks (i.e.,
more word candidates and associated posterior prob-
abilities) can help to determine words? importance
for summarization.
Figure 1: An example of confusion networks.
The core problems when using confusion net-
works under the MMR summarization framework
are the definitions for Si, D, and Summ, as shown
in Equation 1. The extractive summary unit (for
each Si) we use is the segment provided by the rec-
ognizer. This is often different from syntactic or se-
mantic meaningful unit (e.g., a sentence), but is a
more realistic setup. Most of the previous studies
for speech summarization used human labeled sen-
tences as extraction units (for human transcripts, or
map them to ASR output), which is not the real sce-
nario when performing speech summarization on the
ASR condition. In the future, we will use automatic
sentence segmentation results, which we expect are
better units than pause-based segmentation used in
ASR. We still use a vector space model to represent
each summarization unit Si. The entire document
(D) and the current selected summary (Summ) are
formed by simply concatenating the corresponding
segments Si together. In the following, we describe
different ways to represent the segments and how to
present the final summary.
A. Segmentation representation
First, we construct the vector for each segment
simply using all the word candidates in the CNs,
without considering any confidence measure or pos-
terior probability information. The same TFIDF
computation is used as before, i.e., counting the
number of times a word appears (TF) and how many
documents it appears (used to calculate IDF).
Second, we leverage the confidence scores to
build the vector. For the term frequency of word wi,
we calculate it by summing up its posterior proba-
bilities p(wik) at each position k, that is,
TF (wi) =
?
k
p(wik) (3)
Similarly, the IDF values can also be computed us-
ing the confidence scores. The traditional method
for calculating a word?s IDF uses the ratio of the
total number of documents (N ) and the number of
documents containing this word. Using the confi-
dence scores, we calculate the IDF values as follows,
IDF (wi) = log(
N
?
D (maxk p(wik))
) (4)
If a word wi appears in the document, we find its
maximum posterior probability among all the posi-
tions it occurs in the CNs, which is used to signal
wi?s soft appearance in this document. We add these
soft counts for all the documents as the denomina-
tor in Equation 4. Different from the traditional IDF
48
calculation method, where the number of documents
containing a word is an integer number, here the de-
nominator can be any real number.
B. Confusion network pruning
The above vectors are constructed using the entire
confusion networks. We may also use the pruned
ones, in which the words with low posterior prob-
abilities are removed beforehand. This can avoid
the impact of noisy words, and increase the system
speed as well. We investigate three different pruning
methods, listed below.
? absolute pruning: In this method, we delete
words if their posterior probabilities are lower
than a predefined threshold, i.e., p(wi) < ?.
? max diff pruning: First for each position k,
we find the maximum probability among all
the word candidates: Pmaxk = maxj p(wjk).
Then we remove a word wi in this position if
the absolute difference of its probability with
the maximum score is larger than a predefined
threshold, i.e., Pmaxk ? p(wik) > ?.
? max ratio pruning: This is similar to the above
one, but instead of absolute difference, we use
the ratio of their probabilities, i.e., p(wik)Pmaxk < ?.
Again, for the last two pruning methods, the com-
parison is done for each position in the CNs.
C. Summary rendering
With a proper way of representing the text seg-
ments, we then extract the summary segments using
the MMR method described in Section 3.1. Once the
summary segments are selected using the confusion
network input, another problem we need to address
is how to present the final summary. When using
the human transcripts or the 1-best ASR hypothesis
for summarization, we can simply concatenate the
corresponding transcripts of the selected sentence
segments as the final summary for the users. How-
ever, when using the confusion networks as the rep-
resentation of each sentence segment, we only know
which segments are selected by the summarization
system. To provide the final summary to the users,
there are two choices. We can either use the best hy-
pothesis from CNs of those selected segments as a
text summary; or return the speech segments to the
users to allow them to play it back. We will evaluate
both methods in this paper. For the latter, in order to
use similar word based performance measures, we
will use the corresponding reference transcripts in
order to focus on evaluation of the correctness of the
selected summary segments.
4 Experiments
4.1 Corpus and Evaluation Measurement
We use the ICSI meeting corpus, which contains 75
recordings from natural meetings (most are research
discussions) (Janin et al, 2003). Each meeting is
about an hour long and has multiple speakers. These
meetings have been transcribed, and annotated with
extractive summaries (Murray et al, 2005b). The
ASR output is obtained from a state-of-the-art SRI
speech recognition system, including the confusion
network for each sentence segment (Stolcke et al,
2006). The word error rate (WER) is about 38.2%
on the entire corpus.
The same 6 meetings as in (Murray et al, 2005a;
Xie and Liu, 2008; Gillick et al, 2009; Lin et al,
2009) are used as the test set in this study. Fur-
thermore, 6 other meetings were randomly selected
from the remaining 69 meetings in the corpus to
form a development set. Each meeting in the de-
velopment set has only one human-annotated sum-
mary; whereas for the test meetings, we use three
summaries from different annotators as references
for performance evaluation. The lengths of the ref-
erence summaries are not fixed and vary across an-
notators and meetings. The average word compres-
sion ratio for the test set is 14.3%, and the mean de-
viation is 2.9%. We generated summaries with the
word compression ratio ranging from 13% to 18%,
and only provide the best results in this paper.
To evaluate summarization performance, we use
ROUGE (Lin, 2004), which has been widely used
in previous studies of speech summarization (Zhang
et al, 2007; Murray et al, 2005a; Zhu and Penn,
2006). ROUGE compares the system generated
summary with reference summaries (there can be
more than one reference summary), and measures
different matches, such as N-gram, longest com-
mon sequence, and skip bigrams. In this paper,
we present our results using both ROUGE-1 and
49
ROUGE-2 F-scores.
4.2 Characteristics of CNs
First we perform some analysis of the confusion net-
works using the development set data. We define
two measurements:
? Word coverage. This is to verify that CNs con-
tain more correct words than the 1-best hy-
potheses. It is defined as the percentage of
the words in human transcripts (measured us-
ing word types) that appear in the CNs. We
use word types in this measurement since we
are using a vector space model and the multi-
ple occurrence of a word only affects its term
weights, not the dimension of the vector. Note
that for this analysis, we do not perform align-
ment that is needed in word error rate measure
? we do not care whether a word appears in the
exact location; as long as a word appears in the
segment, its effect on the vector space model is
the same (since it is a bag-of-words model).
? Average node density. This is the average num-
ber of candidate words for each position in the
confusion networks.
Figure 2 shows the analysis results for these two
metrics, which are the average values on the devel-
opment set. In this analysis we used absolute prun-
ing method, and the results are presented for dif-
ferent pruning thresholds. For a comparison, we
also include the results using the 1-best hypotheses
(shown as the dotted line in the figure), which has an
average node density of 1, and the word coverage of
71.55%. When the pruning threshold is 0, the results
correspond to the original CNs without pruning.
We can see that the confusion networks include
much more correct words than 1-best hypotheses
(word coverage is 89.3% vs. 71.55%). When in-
creasing the pruning thresholds, the word coverage
decreases following roughly a linear pattern. When
the pruning threshold is 0.45, the word coverage of
the pruned CNs is 71.15%, lower than 1-best hy-
potheses. For node density, the non-pruned CNs
have an average density of 11.04. With a very small
pruning threshold of 0.01, the density decreases
rapidly to 2.11. The density falls less than 2 when
the threshold is 0.02, which means that for some

nodes there is only one word candidate preserved
after pruning (i.e., only one word has a posterior
probability higher than 0.02). When the threshold
increases to 0.4, the density is less than 1 (0.99),
showing that on average there is less than one candi-
date left for each position. This is consistent with the
word coverage results ? when the pruning thresh-
old is larger than 0.45, the confusion networks have
less word coverage than 1-best hypotheses because
even the top word hypotheses are deleted. There-
fore, for our following experiments we only use the
thresholds ? ? 0.45 for absolute pruning.
Note that the results in the figure are based on
absolute pruning. We also performed analysis us-
ing the other two pruning methods described in Sec-
tion 3.2. For those methods, because the decision
is made by comparing each word?s posterior proba-
bility with the maximum score for that position, we
can guarantee that at least the best word candidate is
included in the pruned CNs. We varied the pruning
threshold from 0 to 0.95 for these pruning methods,
and observed similar patterns as in absolute prun-
ing for the word coverage and node density analysis.
As expected, the fewer word candidates are pruned,
the better word coverage and higher node density the
pruned CNs have.
4.3 Summarization Results
4.3.1 Results on dev set using 1-best hypothesis
and human transcripts
We generate the baseline summarization result
using the best hypotheses from the confusion net-
50
works. The summary sentences are extracted using
the MMR method introduced in Section 3.1. The
term weighting is the traditional TFIDF value. The
ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-2 scores for the baseline are
listed in Table 1.
Because in this paper our task is to evaluate the
summarization performance using ASR output, we
generate an oracle result, where the summary ex-
traction and IDF calculation are based on the human
transcripts for each ASR segment. These results are
also presented in Table 1. Comparing the results for
the two testing conditions, ASR output and human
transcripts, we can see the performance degradation
due to recognition errors. The difference between
them seems to be large enough to warrant investiga-
tion of using rich ASR output for improved summa-
rization performance.

4.3.2 Results on the dev set using CNs
A. Effect of segmentation representation
We evaluate the effect on summarization using
different vector representations based on confusion
networks. Table 2 shows the results on the develop-
ment set using various input under the MMR frame-
work. We also include the results using 1-best and
human transcripts in the table as a comparison. The
third row in the table uses the 1-best hypothesis, but
the term weight for each word is calculated by con-
sidering its posterior probability in the CNs (denoted
by ?wp?). We calculate the TF and IDF values us-
ing Equation 3 and 4 introduced in Section 3.2. The
other representations in the table are for the non-
pruned and pruned CNs based on different pruning
methods, and with or without using the posteriors to
calculate term weights.
In general, we find that using confusion networks
improves the summarization performance compar-
ing with the baseline. Since CNs contain more can-
didate words and posterior probabilities, a natural

question to ask is, which factor contributes more to
the improved performance? We can compare the re-
sults in Table 2 across different conditions that use
the same candidate words, one with standard TFIDF,
and the other with posteriors for TFIDF, or that use
different candidate words and the same setup for
TFIDF calculation. Our results show that there is
more improvement using our proposed method for
TFIDF calculation based on posterior probabilities,
especially ROUGE-2 scores. Even when just us-
ing 1-best hypotheses, if we consider posteriors, we
can obtain very competitive results. There is also
a difference in the effect of using posterior proba-
bilities. When using the top hypotheses representa-
tion, posteriors help both ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-2
scores; when using confusion networks, non-pruned
or pruned, using posterior probabilities improves
ROUGE-2 results, but not ROUGE-1.
Our results show that adding more candidates in
the vector representation does not necessarily help
summarization. Using the pruned CNs yields bet-
ter performance than the non-pruned ones. There is
not much difference among different pruning meth-
ods. Overall, the best results are achieved by using
pruned CNs: best ROUGE-1 result without using
posterior probabilities, and best ROUGE-2 scores
when using posteriors.

Table 3: ROUGE results (%) on the development set
using different segment representations, with the sum-
maries constructed using the corresponding human tran-
scripts for the selected segments.
In the above experiments, we construct the final
summary using the best hypotheses from the con-
fusion networks once the summary sentence seg-
ments are determined. Although we notice obvious
improvement comparing with the baseline results,
the ROUGE scores are still much lower than using
the human transcripts. One reason for this is the
speech recognition errors. Even if we select the cor-
rect utterance segment as in the reference summary
segments, the system performance is still penalized
when calculating the ROUGE scores. In order to
avoid the impact of word errors and focus on evalu-
ating whether we have selected the correct segments,
next we use the corresponding human transcripts of
the selected segments to obtain performance mea-
sures. The results from this experiment are shown in
Table 3 for different segment representations.
We can see that the summaries formed using hu-
man transcripts are much better comparing with the
results presented in Table 2. These two setups use
the same utterance segments. The only difference
lies in the construction of the final summary for
performance measurement, using the top hypothe-
ses or the corresponding human transcripts for the
selected segments. We also notice that the differ-
ence between using 1-best hypothesis and human
transcripts is greatly reduced using this new sum-
mary formulation. This suggests that the incorrect
word hypotheses do not have a very negative im-
pact in terms of selecting summary segments; how-
ever, word errors still account for a significant part
of the performance degradation on ASR condition
when using word-based metrics for evaluation. Us-
ing the best hypotheses with their posterior proba-
bilities we can obtain similar ROUGE-1 score and
a little higher ROUGE-2 score comparing to the re-
sults using human transcripts. The performance can
be further improved using the pruned CNs.
Note that when using the non-pruned CNs and
posterior probabilities for term weighting, the
ROUGE scores are worse than most of other condi-
tions. We performed some analysis and found that
one reason for this is the selection of some poor
segments. Most of the word candidates in the non-
pruned CNs have very low confidence scores, result-
ing in high IDF values using our proposed methods.
Since some top hypotheses are NULL words in the
poorly selected summary segments, it did not affect
the results when using the best hypothesis for eval-
uation, but when using human transcripts, it leads to
lower precision and worse overall F-scores. This is
not a problem for the pruned CNs since words with
low probabilities have been pruned beforehand, and
thus do not impact segment selection. We will inves-
tigate better methods for term weighting to address
this issue in our future work.
These experimental results prove that using the
confusion networks and confidence scores can help
select the correct sentence segments. Even though
the 1-best WER is quite high, if we can con-
sider more word candidates and/or their confidence
scores, this will not impact the process of select-
ing summary segments. We can achieve similar
performance as using human transcripts, and some-
times even slightly better performance. This sug-
gests using more word candidates and their confi-
dence scores results in better term weighting and
representation in the vector space model. Some
previous work showed that using word confidence
scores can help minimize the WER of the extracted
summaries, which then lead to better summarization
performance. However, we think the main reason
for the improvement in our study is from selecting
better utterances, as shown in Table 3. In our ex-
periments, because different setups select different
segments as the summary, we can not directly com-
pare the WER of extracted summaries, and analyze
whether lower WER is also helpful for better sum-

perform more analysis along this direction.
4.3.3 Experimental results on test set
The summarization results on the test set are pre-
sented in Table 4. We show four different evalua-
tion conditions: baseline using the top hypotheses,
best hypotheses with posterior probabilities, pruned
CNs, and using human transcripts. For each condi-
tion, the final summary is evaluated using the best
hypotheses or the corresponding human transcripts
of the selected segments. The summarization system
setups (the pruning method and threshold, ? value in
MMR function, and word compression ratio) used
for the test set are decided based on the results on
the development set.
For the results on the test set, we observe sim-
ilar trends as on the development set. Using the
confidence scores and confusion networks can im-
prove the summarization performance comparing
with the baseline. The performance improvements
from ?Best hyp? to ?Best hyp (wp)? and from ?Best
hyp (wp)? to ?Pruned CNs? using both ROUGE-1
and ROUGE-2 measures are statistically significant
according to the paired t-test (p < 0.05). When the
final summary is presented using the human tran-
scripts of the selected segments, we observe slightly
better results using pruned CNs than using human
transcripts as input for summarization, although the
difference is not statistically significant. This shows
that using confusion networks can compensate for
the impact from recognition errors and still allow us
to select correct summary segments.
5 Conclusion and Future Work
Previous research has shown performance degrada-
tion when using ASR output for meeting summa-
rization because of word errors. To address this
problem, in this paper we proposed to use confu-
sion networks for speech summarization. Under the
MMR framework, we introduced a vector represen-
tation for the segments by using more word can-
didates in CNs and their associated posterior prob-
abilities. We evaluated the effectiveness of using
different confusion networks, the non-pruned ones,
and the ones pruned using three different methods,
i.e., absolute, max diff and max ratio pruning. Our
experimental results on the ICSI meeting corpus
showed that even when we only use the top hypothe-
ses from the CNs, considering the word posterior
probabilities can improve the summarization perfor-
mance on both ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-2 scores.
By using the pruned CNs we can obtain further im-
provement. We found that more gain in ROUGE-
2 results was yielded by our proposed soft term
weighting method based on posterior probabilities.
Our experiments also demonstrated that it is pos-
sible to use confusion networks to achieve similar
or even better performance than using human tran-
scripts if the goal is to select the right segments. This
is important since one possible rendering of summa-
rization results is to return the audio segments to the
users, which does not suffer from recognition errors.
In our experiments, we observed less improve-
ment from considering more word candidates than
using the confidence scores. One possible reason is
that the confusion networks we used are too confi-
dent. For example, on average 90.45% of the can-
didate words have a posterior probability lower than
0.01. Therefore, even though the correct words were
included in the confusion networks, their contribu-
tion may not be significant enough because of low
term weights. In addition, low probabilities also
cause problems to our proposed soft IDF computa-
tion. In our future work, we will investigate prob-
ability normalization methods and other techniques
for term weighting to cope with these problems.
