Abstract
Second language acquisition research since
the 90s has emphasized the importance of
supporting awareness of language categories
and forms, and input enhancement techniques
have been proposed to make target language
features more salient for the learner.
We present an NLP architecture and web-
based implementation providing automatic vi-
sual input enhancement for web pages. Learn-
ers freely choose the web pages they want to
read and the system displays an enhanced ver-
sion of the pages. The current system supports
visual input enhancement for several language
patterns known to be problematic for English
language learners, as well as fill-in-the-blank
and clickable versions of such pages support-
ing some learner interaction.
1 Introduction
A significant body of research into the effectiveness
of meaning-focused communicative approaches to
foreign language teaching has shown that input
alone is not sufficient to acquire a foreign lan-
guage, especially for older learners (cf., e.g., Light-
bown and Spada, 1999). Recognizing the important
role of consciousness in second-language learning
(Schmidt, 1990), learners have been argued to ben-
efit from (Long, 1991) or even require (Lightbown,
1998) a so-called focus on form to overcome incom-
plete or incorrect knowledge of specific forms or
regularities. Focus on form is understood to be ?an
occasional shift of attention to linguistic code fea-
tures? (Long and Robinson, 1998, p. 23).
In an effort to combine communicative and struc-
turalist approaches to second language teaching,
Rutherford and Sharwood Smith (1985) argued for
the use of consciousness raising strategies drawing
the learner?s attention to specific language proper-
ties. Sharwood Smith (1993, p. 176) coined the term
input enhancement to refer to strategies highlighting
the salience of language categories and forms.
Building on this foundational research in second
language acquisition and foreign language teaching,
in this paper we present an NLP architecture and a
system for automatic visual input enhancement of
web pages freely selected by language learners. We
focus on learners of English as a Second Language
(ESL), and the language patterns enhanced by the
system include some of the well-established diffi-
culties: determiners and prepositions, the distinction
between gerunds and to-infinitives, wh-question for-
mation, tense in conditionals, and phrasal verbs.
In our approach, learners can choose any web
page they like, either by using an ordinary search-
engine interface to search for one or by entering the
URL of the page they want to enhance. In contrast to
textbooks and other pre-prepared materials, allow-
ing the learner to choose up-to-date web pages on
any topic they are interested in and enhancing the
page while keeping it intact (with its links, multi-
media, and other components working) clearly has
a positive effect on learner motivation. Input en-
hanced web pages also are attractive for people out-
side a traditional school setting, such as in the vol-
untary, self-motivated pursuit of knowledge often
referred to as lifelong learning. The latter can be
particularly relevant for adult immigrants, who are
10
already functionally living in the second language
environment, but often stagnate in their second lan-
guage acquisition and lack access or motivation to
engage in language classes or other explicit lan-
guage learning activities. Nevertheless, they do use
the web to obtain information that is language-based
and thus can be enhanced to also support language
acquisition while satisfying information needs.
In terms of paper organization, in section 2 we
first present the system architecture and in 2.1 the
language phenomena handled, before considering
the issues involved in evaluating the approach in 2.2.
The context of our work and related approaches are
discussed in section 3, and we conclude and discuss
several avenues for future research in section 4.
2 The Approach
The WERTi system (Working with English Real
Texts interactively) we developed follows a client-
server paradigm where the server is responsible for
fetching the web page and enriching it with annota-
tions, and the client then receives the annotated web
page and transforms it into an enhanced version.
The client here is a standard web browser, so on the
learner?s side no additional software is needed.
The system currently supports three types of input
enhancement: i) color highlighting of the pattern or
selected parts thereof, ii) a version of the page sup-
porting identification of the pattern through clicking
and automatic color feedback, and iii) a version sup-
porting practice, such as a fill-in-the-blank version
of the page with automatic color feedback.
The overall architecture is shown in Figure 1.
Essentially, the automated input enhancement pro-
cess consists of the following steps:
1. Fetch the page.
2. Find the natural language text portions in it.
3. Identify the targeted language pattern.
4. Annotate the web page, marking up the lan-
guage patterns identified in the previous step.
5. Transform the annotated web page into the out-
put by visually enhancing the targeted pattern
or by generating interaction possibilities.
Steps 1?4 take place on the server side, whereas step
5 happens in the learner?s browser.1 As NLP is only
involved in step 3, we here focus on that step.

are the same for all patterns and activities, cf. section 2.1.
While the first prototype of the WERTi system2
presented at CALICO (Amaral, Metcalf and Meur-
ers, 2006) and EUROCALL (Metcalf and Meurers,
2006) was implemented in Python, the current sys-
tem is Java-based, with all NLP being integrated in
the UIMA framework (Ferrucci and Lally, 2004).
UIMA is an architecture for the management and
analysis of unstructured information such as text,
which is built on the idea of referential annotation
and can be seen as an NLP analysis counterpart
to current stand-off encoding standards for anno-
tated corpora (cf., e.g., Ide et al 2000). The input
we are developing a Firefox plugin, leaving only the NLP up to
the server. This increases compatibility with web pages using
dynamically generated contents and special session handling.

can be monotonically enriched while passing from
one NLP component to the next, using a flexible
data repository common to all components (Go?tz
and Suhre, 2004). Such annotation-based processing
is particularly useful in the WERTi context, where
keeping the original text intact is essential for dis-
playing it in enhanced form.
A second benefit of using the UIMA framework is
that it supports a flexible combination of individual
NLP components into larger processing pipelines.
To obtain a flexible approach to input enhancement
in WERTi, we need to be able to identify and an-
alyze phenomena from different levels of linguistic
analysis. For example, lexical classes can be iden-
tified by a POS tagger, whereas other patterns to be
enhanced require at least shallow syntactic chunk-
ing. The more diverse the set of phenomena, the
less feasible it is to handle all of them within a
single processing strategy or formalism. Using the
UIMA framework, we can re-use the same basic
processing (e.g., tokenizing, POS tagging) for all
phenomena and still be able to branch into pattern-
specific NLP in a demand-driven way. Given that
NLP components in UIMA include self-describing
meta-information, the processing pipeline to be run
can dynamically be obtained from the module con-
figuration instead of being hard-wired into the core
system. The resulting extensible, plugin-like archi-
tecture seems particularly well-suited for the task of
visual input enhancement of a wide range of hetero-
geneous language properties.
Complementing the above arguments for the
UIMA-based architecture of the current WERTi sys-
tem, a detailed discussion of the advantages of an
annotation-based, demand-driven NLP architecture
for Intelligent Computer-Assisted Language Learn-
ing can be found in Amaral, Meurers, and Ziai (To
Appear), where it is employed in an Intelligent Lan-
guage Tutoring System.
2.1 Implemented Modules
The modules implemented in the current system
handle a number of phenomena commonly judged
as difficult for second language learners of English.
In the following we briefly characterize each mod-
ule, describing the nature of the language pattern,
the required NLP, and the input enhancement results,
which will be referred to as activities.
Lexical classes
Lexical classes are the most basic kind of linguis-
tic category we use for input enhancement. The in-
ventory of lexical categories to be used and which
ones to focus on should be informed by second
language acquisition research and foreign language
teaching needs. The current system focuses on func-
tional elements such as prepositions and determiners
given that they are considered to be particularly dif-
ficult for learners of English (cf. De Felice, 2008 and
references therein).
We identify these functional elements using the
LingPipe POS tagger (http://alias-i.com/
lingpipe) employing the Brown tagset (Francis
and Kucera, 1979). As we show in section 2.2, the
tagger reliably identifies prepositions and determin-
ers in native English texts such as those expected for
input enhancement.
The input enhancement used for lexical classes is
the default set of activities provided by WERTi. In
the simplest case, Color, all automatically identified
instances in the web page are highlighted by color-
ing them; no learner interaction is required. This is
illustrated by Figure 2, which shows the result of en-
hancing prepositions in a web page from the British
Figure 2: Screenshot of color activity for prepositions, cf.
http://purl.org/icall/werti-color-ex
12
newspaper The Guardian.3
In this and the following screenshots, links al-
ready present in the original web page appear in light
blue (e.g., Vauban in Germany). This raises an im-
portant issue for future research, namely how to de-
termine the best visual input enhancement for a par-
ticular linguistic pattern given a specific web page
with its existing visual design features (e.g., bold-
facing in the text or particular colors used to indicate
links), which includes the option of removing or al-
tering some of those original visual design features.
A more interactive activity type is Click, where
the learner during reading can attempt to identify in-
stances of the targeted language form by clicking on
it. Correctly identified instances are colored green
by the system, incorrect guesses red.
Thirdly, input can be turned into Practice activi-
ties, where in its simplest form, WERTi turns web
pages into fill-in-the-blank activities and provides
immediate color coded feedback for the forms en-
tered by the learner. The system currently accepts
only the form used in the original text as correct.
In principle, alternatives (e.g., other prepositions)
can also be grammatical and appropriate. The ques-
tion for which cases equivalence classes of target an-
swers can automatically be determined is an interest-
ing question for future research.4
Gerunds vs. to-infinitives
Deciding when a verb is required to be realized as
a to-infinitive and when as a gerund -ing form can be
difficult for ESL learners. Current school grammars
teach students to look for certain lexical clues that
reliably indicate which form to choose. Examples
of such clues are prepositions such as after and of,
which can only be followed by a gerund.
In our NLP approach to this language pattern, we
use Constraint Grammar rules (Karlsson et al, 1995)
on top of POS tagging, which allow for straightfor-
ward formulation of local disambiguation rules such
as: ?If an -ing form immediately follows the prepo-
sition by, select the gerund reading.? Standard POS
3Given the nature of the input enhancement using colors, the
highlighting in the figure is only visible in a color printout.
4The issue bears some resemblance to the task of identify-
ing paraphrases (Androutsopoulos and Malakasiotis, 2009) or
classes of learner answers which differ in form but are equiva-
lent in terms of meaning (Bailey and Meurers, 2008).
tagsets for English contain a single tag for all -ing
forms. In order to identify gerunds only, we in-
troduce all possible readings for all -ing forms and
wrote 101 CG rules to locally disambiguate them.
The to-infinitives, on the other hand, are relatively
easy to identify based on the surface form and re-
quire almost no disambiguation.
For the implementation of the Constraint Gram-
mar rules, we used the freely available CG3 system.5
While simple local disambiguation rules are suffi-
cient for the pattern discussed here, through iterative
application of rules, Constraint Grammar can iden-
tify a wide range of phenomena without the need to
provide a full grammatical analysis.
The Color activity resulting from input enhance-
ment is similar to that for lexical classes described
above, but the system here enhances both verb forms
and clue phrases. Figure 3 shows the system high-
lighting gerunds in orange, infinitives in purple, and
clue phrases in blue.
Figure 3: Color activity for gerunds vs. to-infinitives, cf.
http://purl.org/icall/werti-color-ex2
For the Click activity, the web page is shown
with colored gerund and to-infinitival forms and the
learner can click on the corresponding clue phrases.
For the Practice activity, the learner is presented
with a fill-in-the-black version of the web page, as
in the screenshot in Figure 4. For each blank, the
learner needs to enter the gerund or to-infinitival
form of the base form shown in parentheses.
Wh-questions
Question formation in English, with its particu-
lar word order, constitutes a well-known challenge
for second language learners and has received sig-
nificant attention in the second language acquisi-

Figure 4: Practice activity for gerunds vs. to-infinitives,
cf. http://purl.org/icall/werti-cloze-ex
tion literature (cf., e.g., White et al, 1991; Spada
and Lightbown, 1993). Example (1) illustrates the
use of do-support and subject-aux inversion in wh-
questions as two aspects challenging learners.
(1) What do you think it takes to be successful?
In order to identify the wh-question patterns, we
employ a set of 126 hand-written Constraint Gram-
mar rules. The respective wh-word acts as the lex-
ical clue to the question as a whole, and the rules
then identify the subject and verb phrase based on
the POS and lexical information of the local context.
Aside from the Color activity highlighting the rel-
evant parts of a wh-question, we adapted the other
activity types to this more complex language pattern.
The Click activity prompts learners to click on either
the subject or the verb phrase of the question. The
Practice activity presents the words of a wh-question
in random order and requires the learner to rearrange
them into the correct one.
Conditionals
English has five types of conditionals that are used
for discussing hypothetical situations and possible
outcomes. The tenses used in the different condi-
tional types vary with respect to the certainty of the
outcome as expressed by the speaker/writer. For ex-
ample, one class of conditionals expresses high cer-
tainty and uses present tense in the if -clause and fu-
ture in the main clause, as in example (2).
(2) If the rain continues, we will return home.
The recognition of conditionals is approached us-
ing a combination of shallow and deep methods. We
first look for lexical triggers of a conditional, such as
the word if at the beginning of a sentence. This first
pass serves as a filter to the next, more expensive
processing step, full parsing of the candidate sen-
tences using Bikel?s statistical parser (Bikel, 2002).
The parse trees are then traversed to identify and
mark the verb forms and the trigger word.
For the input enhancement, we color all relevant
parts of a conditional, namely the trigger and the
verb forms. The Click activity for conditionals re-
quires the learner to click on exactly these parts. The
Practice activity prompts users to classify the condi-
tional instances into the different classes.
Phrasal verbs
Another challenging pattern for English language
learners are phrasal verbs consisting of a verb and
either a preposition, an adverb or both. The meaning
of a phrasal verb often differs considerably from that
of the underlying verb, as in (3) compared to (4).
(3) He switched the glasses without her noticing.
(4) He switched off the light before he went to bed.
This distinction is difficult for ESL learners, who
often confuse phrasal and non-phrasal uses.
Since this is a lexical phenomenon, we ap-
proached the identification of phrasal verbs via a
database lookup in a large online collection of verbs
known to occur in phrasal form.6 In order to find out
about noun phrases and modifying adverbs possibly
occurring in between the verb and its particles, we
run a chunker and use this information in specifying
a filter for such intervening elements.
The visual input enhancement activities targeting
phrasal verbs are the same as for lexical classes, with
the difference that for the Practice activity, learners
have to fill in only the particle, not the particle and
the main verb, since otherwise the missing contents
may be too difficult to reconstruct. Moreover, we
want the activity to focus on distinguishing phrasal
from non-phrasal uses, not verb meaning in general.
2.2 Evaluation issues
The success of a visual input enhancement approach
such as the one presented in this paper depends on
a number of factors, each of which can in principle
6http://www.usingenglish.com/reference/
phrasal-verbs
14
be evaluated. The fundamental but as far as we are
aware unanswered question in second language ac-
quisition research is for which language categories,
forms, and patterns input enhancement can be effec-
tive. As Lee and Huang (2008) show, the study of
visual input enhancement sorely needs more experi-
mental studies. With the help of the WERTi system,
which systematically produces visual input enhance-
ment for a range of language properties, it becomes
possible to conduct experiments in a real-life foreign
language teaching setting to test learning outcomes7
with and without visual input enhancement under a
wide range of parameters. Relevant parameters in-
clude the linguistic nature of the language property
to be enhanced as well as the nature of the input en-
hancement to be used, be it highlighting through col-
ors or fonts, engagement in different types of activi-
ties such as clicking, entering fill-in-the-blank infor-
mation, reordering language material, etc.
A factor closely related to our focus in this pa-
per is the impact of the quality of the NLP analysis.8
For a quantitative evaluation of the NLP, one signif-
icant problem is the mismatch between the phenom-
ena focused on in second language learning and the
available gold standards where these phenomena are
actually annotated. For example, standard corpora
such as the Penn Treebank contain almost no ques-
tions and thus do not constitute a useful gold stan-
dard for wh-question identification. Another prob-
lem is that some grammatical distinctions taught to
language learners are disputed in the linguistic liter-
ature. For example, Huddleston and Pullum (2002,
p. 1120) eliminate the distinction between gerunds
and present participles, combining them into a class
called ?gerund-participle?. And in corpus annota-
tion practice, gerunds are not identified as a class by
the tagsets used to annotate large corpora, making it
unclear what gold standard our gerund identification
component should be evaluated against.
While the lack of available gold standards means
that a quantitative evaluation of all WERTi mod-
ules is beyond the scope of this paper, the deter-
miner and preposition classes focused on in the lex-
ical classes module can be identified using the stan-
7Naturally, online measures of noticing, such as eye tracking
or Event-Related Potentials (ERP) would also be relevant.
8The processing time for the NLP analysis as other relevant
aspect is negligible for most of the activities presented here.
dard CLAWS-7 or Brown tagsets, for which gold-
standard corpora are available. We thus decided
to evaluate this WERTi module against the BNC
Sampler Corpus (Burnard, 1999), which contains
a variety of genres, making it particularly appro-
priate for evaluating a tool such as WERTi, which
learners are expected to use with a wide range of
web pages as input. The BNC Sampler corpus is
annotated with the fine-grained CLAWS-7 tagset9
where, e.g., prepositions are distinguished from sub-
ordinating conjunctions. By mapping the relevant
POS tags from the CLAWS-7 tagset to the Brown
tagset used by the LingPipe tagger as integrated in
WERTi, it becomes possible to evaluate WERTi?s
performance for the specific lexical classes focused
on for input enhancement, prepositions and deter-
miners. For prepositions, precision was 95.07% and
recall 90.52% while for determiners, precision was
97.06% with a recall of 94.07%.
The performance of the POS tagger on this refer-
ence corpus thus seems to be sufficient as basis for
visual input enhancement, but the crucial question
naturally remains whether identification of the target
patterns is reliable in the web pages that language
learners happen to choose. For a more precise quan-
titative study, it will thus be important to try the sys-
tem out with real-life users in order to identify a set
of web pages which can constitute an adequate test
set. Interestingly, which web pages the users choose
depends on the search engine front-end we provide
for them. As discussed under outlook in section 4,
we are exploring the option to implicitly guide them
towards web pages containing enough instances of
the relevant language patterns in text at the appro-
priate reading difficulty.
3 Context and related work
Contextualizing our work, one can view the auto-
matic visual input enhancement approach presented
here as an enrichment of Data-Driven Learning
(DDL). Where DDL has been characterized as an
?attempt to cut out the middleman [the teacher] as
far as possible and to give the learner direct access
to the data? (Boulton 2009, p. 82, citing Tim Johns),
in visual input enhancement the learner stays in con-
9http://www.natcorp.ox.ac.uk/docs/
c7spec.html
15
trol, but the NLP uses ?teacher knowledge? about rel-
evant and difficult language properties to make those
more prominent and noticeable for the learner.
In the context of Intelligent Computer-Assisted
Language Learning (ICALL), NLP has received
most attention in connection with Intelligent Lan-
guage Tutoring Systems, where NLP is used to ana-
lyze learner data and provide individual feedback on
that basis (cf. Heift and Schulze, 2007). Demands
on such NLP are high given that it needs to be able
to handle learner language and provide high-quality
feedback for any sentence entered by the learner.
In contrast, visual input enhancement makes use
of NLP analysis of authentic, native-speaker text and
thus applies the tools to the native language they
were originally designed and optimized for. Such
NLP use, which we will refer to as Authentic Text
ICALL (ATICALL), also does not need to be able
to correctly identify and manipulate all instances of
a language pattern for which input enhancement is
intended. Success can be incremental in the sense
that any visual input enhancement can be beneficial,
so that one can focus on enhancing those instances
which can be reliably identified in a text. In other
words, for ATICALL, precision of the NLP tools is
more important than recall. It is not necessary to
identify and enhance all instances of a given pattern
as long as the instances we do identify are in fact
correct, i.e., true positives. As the point of our sys-
tem is to enhance the reading experience by raising
language awareness, pattern occurrences we do not
identify are not harmful to the overall goal.10
We next turn to a discussion of some interest-
ing approaches in two closely related fields, exercise
generation and reading support tools.
3.1 Exercise Generation
Exercise generation is widely studied in CALL re-
search and some of the work relates directly to the
input enhancement approach presented in this paper.
For instance, Antoniadis et al (2004) describe the
plans of the MIRTO project to support ?gap-filling?
and ?lexical spotting? exercises in combination with
a corpus database. However, MIRTO seems to fo-
10While identifying all instances of a pattern indeed is not
crucial in this context, representativeness remains relevant to
some degree. Where only a skewed subset of a pattern is high-
lighted, learners may not properly conceptualize the pattern.
cus on a general architecture supporting instructor-
determined activity design. Visual input enhance-
ment or language awareness are not mentioned. The
VISL project (Bick, 2005) offers games and visual
presentations in order to foster knowledge of syntac-
tic forms and rules, and its KillerFiller tool can cre-
ate slot-filler exercises from texts. However, Killer-
Filler uses corpora and databases as the text base and
it presents sentences in isolation in a testing setup.
In contrast to such exercise generation systems, we
aim at enhancing the reader?s second language input
using the described web-based mash-up approach.
3.2 Reading Support Tools
Another branch of related approaches consists of
tools supporting the reading of texts in a foreign lan-
guage. For example, the Glosser-RuG project (Ner-
bonne et al, 1998) supports reading of French texts
for Dutch learners with an online, context-dependent
dictionary, as well as morphological analysis and ex-
amples of word use in corpora. A similar system,
focusing on multi-word lexemes, was developed in
the COMPASS project (Breidt and Feldweg, 1997).
More recently, the ALPHEIOS project11 has pro-
duced a system that can look up words in a lexi-
con and provide aligned translations. While such
lexicon-based tools are certainly useful to learners,
they rely on the learner asking for help instead of
enhancing specific structures from the start and thus
clearly differ from our approach.
Finally, the REAP project12 supports learners in
searching for texts that are well-suited for provid-
ing vocabulary and reading practice (Heilman et al,
2008). While it differs in focus from the visual input
enhancement paradigm underlying our approach, it
shares with it the emphasis on providing the learner
with authentic text in support of language learning.
4 Conclusion and Outlook
In this paper we presented an NLP architecture and
a concrete system for the enhancement of authen-
tic web pages in order to support language aware-
ness in ESL learners. The NLP architecture is flexi-
ble enough to integrate any processing approach that
lends itself to the treatment of the language phe-

nomenon in question, without confining the devel-
oper to a particular formalism. The WERTi system
illustrates this with five language patterns typically
considered difficult for ESL learners: lexical classes,
gerunds vs. to-infinitives, wh-questions, condition-
als and phrasal verbs.
Looking ahead, we already mentioned the funda-
mental open question where input enhancement can
be effective in section 2.2. A system such as WERTi,
systematically producing visual input enhancement,
can help explore this question under a wide range of
parameters in a real-life language teaching setting.
A more specific future research issue is the auto-
matic computation of equivalence classes of target
forms sketched in section 2.1. Not yet mentioned
but readily apparent is the goal to integrate more
language patterns known to be difficult for language
learners into WERTi (e.g., active/passive, tense and
aspect distinctions, relative clauses), and to explore
the approach for other languages, such as German.
A final important avenue for future research con-
cerns the starting point of the system, the step where
learners search for a web page they are interested
in and select it for presentation with input enhance-
ment. Enhancing of patterns presupposes that the
pages contain instances of the pattern. The less
frequent the pattern, the less likely we are to find
enough instances of it in web pages returned by the
standard web search engines typically used by learn-
ers to find pages of interest to them. The issue is re-
lated to research on providing learners with texts at
the right level of reading difficulty (Petersen, 2007;
Miltsakaki and Troutt, 2008), but the focus for us
is on ensuring that texts which include instances of
the specific language pattern targeted by a given in-
put enhancement are ranked high in the search re-
sults. Ott (2009) presents a search engine prototype
which, in addition to the content-focused document-
term information and traditional readability mea-
sures, supports indexing based on a more general no-
tion of a text model into which the patterns relevant
to input enhancement can be integrated ? an idea we
are exploring further (Ott and Meurers, Submitted).
