A. Example of a dialog with the hybrid system.
Translation into English of a dialog between Samir
(the system) and Julie (the player) (Strategy 2), it
corresponds to the third dialog in Table 1
Samir: Hello my name is Samir, the product designer
Samir: What are you doing here young people?
Julie: we come to build the joystick of Professor Geekman
Samir: You are in the right place. The plans are in the closet
Samir: Before would you like to hear about my job, the studies
I did or my colleagues
Julie: Tell me about your job.
Samir: Well, for instance, is me who devise and design the
items we construct in this enterprise
Samir: Do you want to know more about my colleagues or
about the security measures applied here?
Julie: What do your colleagues do?
Samir: My job is universal! In fact it can please both girls that
boys...
Samir: In your opinion, what studies should be done to get
there
Julie: Designing studies?
Samir: This is a creative job. Several training can lead to the
job arts, industrial design, computer-aided design
Samir: And does the safety standards interest you?
Julie: That is important the safety yes, tell me more
Samir: You know, here you are in a strategic place.
The novelties, the products of tomorrow, is here that they are
born. They must be protected. For that reason we control the
entrance here.
Samir: Well, Good Luck. Bye!
B. Translation to English of a dialog with the
QA system. Dialog between the raw material opera-
tor (the system) and Julie (the player), it corresponds
to the 8th dialog in Table 1(Strategy 4).
Preparateur1: Hello I am the raw material responsible. I can
provide you a lot of information about this place.
Preparateur1: What can I do for you ?
Julie: What do you do here?
Preparateur1: My role is to ensure machines are supplied
with the right materials,in good colors. I turn on the drying
ovens and the whole supply system.
Julie: How does it work the supply system?
Preparateur1: Well when we get the pellet material, they are
wet ...
Julie: What does it happen when there is a problem?
Preparateur1: In that case, I call the technician, he is the best
for fixing everything
Julie:Thanks for the information, what should I do now?
Preparateur1: It is not complicated and you will learn things.
I have a new machine to supply but I can not find the right
material. Would you give me a hand?
Julie: yes
Preparateur1: You must supply this machine with a new
generation of plastic. This machine allows the manufacture of
plastic bags
Julie: ok
Preparateur1: Let?s go!
Julie: Ok, Let?s start!
Preparateur1: Great, Thanks!
Preparateur1: You are very kind, thank you.
