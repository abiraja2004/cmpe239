Abstract
The paper explores the options for build-
ing bilingual dictionaries by automated
methods. We define the notion ?ba-
sic vocabulary? and investigate how well
the conceptual units that make up this
language-independent vocabulary are cov-
ered by language-specific bindings in 40
languages.
Introduction
Globalization increasingly brings languages in
contact. At the time of the pioneering IBM work
on the Hansard corpus (Brown et al, 1990), only
two decades ago, there was no need for a Basque-
Chinese dictionary, but today there is (Saralegi et
al., 2012). While the methods for building dic-
tionaries from parallel corpora are now mature
(Melamed, 2000), there is a dearth of bilingual or
even monolingual material (Zse?der et al, 2012),
hence the increased interest in comparable cor-
pora.
Once we find bilingual speakers capable of car-
rying out a manual evaluation of representative
samples, it is relatively easy to measure the pre-
cision of a dictionary built by automatic meth-
ods. But measuring recall remains a challenge, for
if there existed a high quality machine-readable
dictionary (MRD) to measure against, building a
new one would largely be pointless, except per-
haps as a means of engineering around copyright
restrictions. We could measure recall against Wik-
tionary, but of course this is a moving target, and
more importantly, the coverage across language
pairs is extremely uneven.
What we need is a standardized vocabulary re-
source that is equally applicable to all language
pairs. In this paper we describe our work toward
creating such a resource by extending the 4lang
conceptual dictionary (Kornai and Makrai, 2013)
to the top 40 languages (by Wikipedia size) using
a variety of methods. Since some of the resources
studied here are not available for the initial list of
40 languages, we extended the original list to 50
languages so as to guarantee at least 40 languages
for every method. Throughout the paper, results
are provided for all 50 languages, indicating miss-
ing data as needed.
Section 1 outlines the approach taken toward
defining the basic vocabulary and translational
equivalence. Section 2 describes how Wiktionary
itself measures up against the 4lang resource
directly and after triangulation across language
pairs. Section 2.3 and Section 2.4 deals with ex-
traction from multiply parallel and near-parallel
corpora, and Section 3 offers some conclusions.
1 Basic vocabulary
The idea that there is a basic vocabulary composed
of a few hundred or at most a few thousand ele-
ments has a long history going back to the Renais-
sance ? for a summary, see Eco (1995). The first
modern efforts in this direction are Thorndike?s
(1921) Word Book, based entirely on frequency
counts (combining TF and DF measures), and
Ogden?s (1944) Basic English, based primarily
on considerations of definability. Both had last-
ing impact, with Thorndike?s approach forming
the basis of much subsequent work on readabil-
ity (Klare 1974, Kanungo and Orr 2009) and
Ogden?s forming the basis of the Simple En-
glish Wikipedia1. An important landmark is the
Swadesh (1950) list, which puts special emphasis
on cross-linguistic definability, as its primary goal
is to support glottochronological studies.
Until the advent of large MRDs, the frequency-
based method was much easier to follow, and
Thorndike himself has extended his original list of
ten thousand words to twenty thousand (Thorndike
1http://simple.wikipedia.org
52
1931) and thirty thousand (Thorndike and Lorge
1944). For a recent example see Davies and Gard-
ner (2010), for a historical survey see McArthur
(1998). The main problem with this approach is
the lack of clear boundaries both at the top of the
list, where function words dominate, and at the
bottom, where it seems quite arbitrary to cut the
list off after the top three hundred words (Diedrich
1938), the top thousand, as is common in foreign
language learning, or the top five thousand, es-
pecially as the frequency curves are generally in
good agreement with Zipf?s law and thus show no
obvious inflection point. The problem at the top
is perhaps more significant, since any frequency-
based listing will start with the function words
of the language, characterizing more its grammar
than its vocabulary. For this reason, the list is
highly varied across languages, and what is a word
(free form) in one language, like English the, often
ends up as an affix (bound form) in another, like
the Romanian suffix -ul. By choosing a frequency-
based approach, we inevitably put the emphasis on
comparing grammars and morphologies, instead
of comparing vocabularies.
The definitional method is based on the assump-
tion that dictionaries will attempt to define the
more complex words by simpler ones. Therefore,
starting with any word list L, the list D(L) ob-
tained by collecting the words appearing on the
right-hand side of the dictionary definitions will
be simpler, the list D(D(L)) obtained by repeat-
ing the method will be yet simpler, and so on, un-
til we arrive at an irreducible list of basic words
that can no longer be further simplified. Mod-
ern MRDs, starting with the Longman Dictionary
of Contemporary English (LDOCE), generally en-
force a strict list of words and word senses that can
appear in definitions, which guarantees that the ba-
sic list will be a subset of this defining vocabulary.
This method, while still open to charges of arbi-
trariness at the high end, in regards to the separa-
tion of function words from basic words, creates a
bright line at the low end: no word, no matter how
frequent, needs to be included as long as it is not
necessary for defining other words.
In creating the 4lang conceptual dictionary
(Kornai and Makrai, 2013), we took advantage
of the fact that the definitional method is robust
in terms of choosing the seed list L, and built a
seed of approximately 3,500 entries composed of
the Longman Defining Vocabulary (2,200 entries),
the most frequent 2,000 words according to the
Google unigram count (Brants and Franz 2006)
and the BNC, as well as the most frequent 2,000
words from Polish (Hala?csy et al2004) and Hun-
garian (Kornai et al2006). Since Latin is one of
the four languages supported by 4lang (the other
three being English, Polish, and Hungarian), we
added the classic Diederich (1938) list and Whit-
ney?s (1885) Roots.
The basic list emerging from the iteration has
1104 elements (including two bound morphemes
but excluding technical terms of the formal seman-
tic model that have no obvious surface reflex). We
will refer to this as the basic or uroboros set as it
has the property that each of its members can be
defined in terms of the others, and we reserve the
name 4lang for the larger set of 3,345 elements
from which it was obtained. Since 4lang words
can be defined using only the uroboros vocabu-
lary, and every word in the Longman Dictionary
of Contemporary English can be defined using the
4lang vocabulary (since this is a superset of LDV),
we have full confidence that every sense of every
non-technical word can be defined by the uroboros
vocabulary. In fact, the Simple English Wikipedia
is an attempt to do this (Yasseri et al, 2012) based
on Ogden?s Basic English, which overlaps with the
uroboros set very significantly (Dice 0.527).
The lexicographic principles underlying 4lang
have been discussed elsewhere (Kornai, 2012;
Kornai and Makrai, 2013), here we just summa-
rize the most salient points. First, the system is
intended to capture everyday vocabulary. Once
the boundaries of natural language are crossed,
and goats are defined by their set of genes (rather
than an old-fashioned taxonomic description in-
volving cloven hooves and the like), or derivative
is defined as lim??0(f(x + ?) ? f(x))/?, the
uroboros vocabulary loses its grip. But for the
non-technical vocabulary, and even the part of the
technical vocabulary that rests on natural language
(e.g. legal definitions or the definitions in philos-
ophy and discursive prose in general), coverage
of the uroboros set promises a strategy of grad-
ually extending the vocabulary from the simple
to the more complex. Thus, to define Jupiter as
?the largest planet of the Sun?, we need to define
planet, but not large as this item is already listed in
the uroboros set. Since planet is defined ?as a large
body in space that moves around a star?, by substi-
tution we will obtain for Jupiter the definition ?the
53
largest body in space that moves around the Sun?
where all the key items large, body, space, move,
around are part of the uroboros set. Proper nouns
like Sun are discussed further in (Kornai, 2010),
but we note here that they constitute a very small
proportion (less than 6%) of the basic vocabulary.
Second, the ultimate definitions of the uroboros
elements are given in the formal language of ma-
chines (Eilenberg, 1974), and at that level the En-
glish words serve only a mnemonic purpose, and
could in principle be replaced by any arbitrary
names or even numbers. Because this would make
debugging next to impossible, as in purposely ob-
fuscated code, we resort to using English print-
names for each concept, but it is important to keep
in mind that these are only weakly reflective of
the English word. For example, the system relies
heavily on an element has that indicates the pos-
sessive relation both in the direct sense, as in the
Sun?s planet, the planet of the Sun and in its more
indirect uses, as in John?s favorite actress where
there is no question of John being in possession
of the actress. In other languages, has will gen-
erally be translated by morphemes (often bound
morphemes) indicating possession, but there is no
attempt to cross-link all relevant uses. The el-
ement has will appear in the definition of Latin
meus and noster alike, but of course there is no
claim that English has underlies the Latin senses.
If we know how to express the basic vocabulary
elements in a given language, which is the task we
concentrate on here, and how to combine the ex-
pressions in that language, we are capable of defin-
ing all remaining words of the language.
In general, matching up function words cross-
linguistically is an extremely hard task, especially
as they are often expressed by inflectional mor-
phology and our workflow, which includes stem-
ming, just strips off the relevant elements. Even
across languages where morphological analysis is
a solved task, it will take a great deal of man-
ual work to establish some form of translational
equivalence, and we consider the issue out of
scope here. But for content words, the use of
language-independent concepts simplifies matters
a great deal: instead of finding
(40
2
)
translation
pairs for the 3,384 concepts that already have man-
ual bindings in four languages (currently, Latin
and Polish are only 90% complete), our goal is
only to find reasonable printnames for the 1,104
basic concepts in all 40 languages. Translation
pairs are only obtained indirectly, through the con-
ceptual pivot, and thus do not amount to fully valid
bilingual translation pairs. For example, he-goat
in one language may just get mapped to the con-
cept goat, and if billy-goat is present in another
language, the strict translational equivalence be-
tween the gendered forms will be lost because
of the poverty of the pivot. Nevertheless, rough
equivalence at the conceptual level is already a
useful notion, especially for filtering out candidate
pairs produced by more standard bilingual dictio-
nary building methods, to which we now turn.
2 Wiktionary
Wiktionary is a crowdsourced dictionary with
many language editions that aim at eventually
defining ?all words?. Although Wiktionary is pri-
marily for human audience, since editors are ex-
pected to follow fairly strict formatting standards,
we can automate the data extraction to a cer-
tain degree. While not a computational linguistic
task par excellence, undoing the MediaWiki for-
mat, identifying the templates and simply detect-
ing the translation pairs requires a great deal of
scripting. Some Wiktionaries, among others the
Bulgarian, Chinese, Danish, German, Hungarian,
Korean, and Russian, are formatted so heteroge-
neously that automated extraction of translation
pairs is very hard, and our results could be further
improved.
Table 1 summarizes the coverage of Wiktionary
on the basic vocabulary from the perspective of
translation pairs with one manual member, En-
glish, Hungarian, Latin, and Polish respectively.
The last column represents the overall coverage
combining all four languages. As can be seen,
the better resourced languages fare better in Wik-
tionary as well, with the most translations found
using English as the source language (64.9% on
the smaller basic set, and 64% on the larger 4lang
vocabulary), Polish and Hungarian faring about

equally well, although the Polish list of 4lang has
more missing bindings, and the least resourced
Latin faring the worst.
Another measure of coverage is obtained by
seeing how many language bindings are found on
the average for each concept: 65% on 4lang and
64% for the basic set (32 out of the 50 languages
considered here).
2.1 Triangulating
Next we used a simple triangulation method to
expand the collection of translation pairs, which
added new translation pairs if they had been linked
with the same word in a third language. An ex-
ample, the English:Romanian pair guild:breasla?,
obtained through a Hungarian pivot, is shown in
Figure 1.
hu:ce?h
en:guild ro:breasla?
Figure 1: The non-dashed edge represents transla-
tion pairs extracted directly from the Wiktionaries.
The pair guild?breasla? were found via triangulat-
ing.
While direct translation pairs come from the
manually built Wiktionaries and can be consid-
ered gold (not entirely without reservations, but
clearly over 90% correct in most language pairs
we could manually spot-check), indirect pairs
must be viewed with considerable suspicion, as
multiple word senses bring in false positives quite
often. Using 3,317,861 pairs extracted from 40
Wiktionaries, we obtained a total of 126,895,236
indirect pairs, but in the following table we con-
sider only those that were obtained through at least
two different third-language pivots with the pairs
originating from different Wiktionaries, and dis-
carded the vast majority, leaving 5,720,355 pairs
that have double confirmation. Manual checking
proved that the quality of these pairs is compara-
ble to that of the original data (see Table 7). A
similar method, within one dictionary rather than

across several, was used in (Saralegi et al, 2012)
to remove triangulation noise. Since recall would
be considerably improved by some less aggres-
sive filtering method, in the future we will also
consider improving the similarity scores of our
corpus-based methods using the single triangles
we now discard.
Triangulating by itself improves coverage from
65% to 85.8% (4lang) and from 64% to 87% (ba-
sic), see Table 2. Table 3 shows the combined cov-
erage which is not much different from Table 2 but
considering that the triangulating used the Wik-
tionary data as input, we expected a very large in-
tersection (it turned out to be more than 40% of
the pairs acquired through triangulating). The av-
erage number of language bindings also improves
significantly, to 43.5/50 (4lang) and 44/50 (basic).
2.2 Wikipedia titles
Another crowdsourced method that promises great
precision is comparing Wikipedia article titles
across languages: we extracted over 187m poten-
tial translation pairs this way. Yet the raw data is
quite noisy, for example French chambre points to
English Ca?mara, an article devoted to the fact that
?Ca?mara (meaning ?chamber?) is a common sur-
name in the Portuguese language? rather than to
some article on bedroom, room, or chamber. We
filtered this data in several ways. First, we dis-
carded all pairs that contain words that appear five
or fewer times in the frequency count generated
from the language in question. This reduced the
55

links (langlinks).

number of pairs to 15m. Most of these, unfortu-
nately, are string-identical across languages, leav-
ing us with a total of 6.15m nontrivial translation
pairs. A large portion of these are named entities
that do not always add meaningfully to a bilingual
dictionary.
The average number of language bindings is
16.5 and 12.6 respectively. The combined results
improve slightly as shown in Table 8.
2.3 Parallel texts
Using the Bible as a parallel text in dictionary
building has a long tradition (Resnik et al, 1999).
Somewhat surprisingly in the age of parallel
corpora, the only secular text available in all
our languages is the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights, which is simply too short to add
meaningfully to the coverage obtained on the
Bible. In addition to downloading the collection
at http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/s0787820/bible,
we used http://www.jw.org (for Dutch, Ar-
menian and Korean), www.gospelgo.com (for
Catalan, Kazakh, Macedonian, Malay and
Persian), http://www.biblegateway.com (for
Czech), http://biblehub.com (for English) and
http://www.mek.oszk.hu (for Hungarian). To the
extent feasible we tried to use modern Bible
translations, resorting to more traditional trans-
lations only where we could not identify a more
contemporary version.
The average number of languages with transla-
tions found is 19 (basic) and 17.8 (4lang). These

numbers are considerably weaker than the crowd-
sourced results, suggesting that the dearth of mul-
tiply parallel texts, even in the best resourced
group of 40 languages, needs to be addressed.
2.4 Comparable texts
Comparable corpora were built from Wikipedia ar-
ticles in the following manner. For each language
pair, we considered those articles that mutually
linked each other, and took the first 50 words, ex-
cluding the title itself. Article pairs whose length
differed drastically (more than a factor of five)
were discarded.

from Wikipedia as comparable corpora.

The 4lang coverage based solely on the trans-
lations acquired from comparable corpora is pre-
sented in Table 6. The average number of lan-
guages with translations found is 8 (basic) and 8.4
(4lang).
2.5 Evaluation
We used manual evaluation for a small subset of
language pairs. Human annotators received a sam-
ple of 100 translation candidate-per-method. The
samples were selected from translations that were
found by only one method, as we suspect that
translations found by several methods are more
likely to be correct. Using this strict data selection

criterion we evaluated the added quality of each
method. Results are presented in Table 7. It is
clear that set next to the crowdsourced methods,
dictionary extraction from either parallel or com-
parable corpora cannot add new translations with
high precision. When high quality input data is
available, triangulating appears to be a powerful
yet simple method.
3 Conclusions and future work
The major lesson emerging from this work is that
currently, crowdsourced methods are considerably
more powerful than the parallel and comparable
corpora-based methods that we started with. The
reason is simply the lack of sufficiently large par-
allel and near-parallel data sets, even among the
most commonly taught languages. If one is actu-
ally interested in creating a resource, even a small
resource such as our basic vocabulary set, with
bindings for all 40 languages, one needs to engage
the crowd.

The resulting 40lang resource, cur-
rently about 88% complete, is available
for download at http://hlt.sztaki.hu. The
Wiktionary extraction tool is available at
https://github.com/juditacs/wikt2dict. 40lang,
while not 100% complete and verified, can
already serve as an important addition to existing
MRDs in several applications. In comparing
corpora the extent vocabulary is shared across
them is a critical measure, yet the task is not
trivial even when these corpora are taken from the
same language. We need to compare vocabularies
at the conceptual level, and checking the shared
40lang content between two texts is a good first
cut. Automated dictionary building itself can
benefit from the resource, since both aligners
and dictionary extractors benefit from known
translation pairs.
