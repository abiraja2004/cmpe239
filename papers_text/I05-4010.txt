Abstract
In this paper we present our recent work
on harvesting English-Chinese bitexts
of the laws of Hong Kong from the
Web and aligning them to the subpara-
graph level via utilizing the number-
ing system in the legal text hierarchy.
Basic methodology and practical tech-
niques are reported in detail. The re-
sultant bilingual corpus, 10.4M English
words and 18.3M Chinese characters,
is an authoritative and comprehensive
text collection covering the specific and
special domain of HK laws. It is par-
ticularly valuable to empirical MT re-
search. This piece of work has also laid
a foundation for exploring and harvest-
ing English-Chinese bitexts in a larger
volume from the Web.
1 Introduction
Bitexts, also referred to as parallel texts or bilin-
gual corpora, collections of bilingual text pairs
aligned at various levels of granularity, have been
playing a critical role in the current development
of machine translation technology. It is such
large data sets that give rise to the plausibility
of empirical approaches to machine translation,
most of which involve the application of a variety
of machine learning techniques to infer various
types of translation knowledge from bitext data
to facilitate automatic translation and enhance
translation quality. Large volumes of training
data of this kind are indispensable for construct-
ing statistical translation models (Brown et al,
1993; Melamed, 2000), acquiring bilingual lex-
icon (Gale and Church, 1991; Melamed, 1997),
and building example-based machine translation
(EBMT) systems (Nagao, 1984; Carl and Way,
2003; Way and Gough, 2003). They also provide
a basis for inferring lexical connection between
vocabularies in cross-languages information re-
trieval (Davis and Dunning, 1995).
Existing parallel corpora have illustrated their
particular value in empirical NLP research, e.g.,
Canadian Hansard Corpus (Gale and Church,
1991b), HK Hansard (Wu, 1994), INTERSECT
(Salkie, 1995), ENPC (Ebeling, 1998), the Bible
parallel corpus (Resnik et al, 1999) and many
others. The Web is being explored not only as a
super corpus for NLP and linguistic research (Kil-
garriff and Grefenstette, 2003) but also, more im-
portantly to MT research, as a treasure for mining
bitexts of various language pairs (Resnik, 1999;
Chen and Nie, 2000; Nie and Cai, 2001; Nie
and Chen, 2002; Resnik and Smith, 2003; Way
and Gough, 2003). The Web has been the play-
ground for many NLPers. More and more Web
sites are found to have cloned their Web pages in
several languages, aiming at conveying informa-
tion to audience in different languages. This gives
rise to a huge volume of wonderful bilingual or
multi-lingual resources freely available from the
Web for research. What we need to do is to har-
vest the right resources for the right applications.
In this paper we present our recent work on
harvesting English-Chinese parallel texts of the
laws of Hong Kong from the Web and construct-
71
ing a subparagraph-aligned bilingual corpus of
about 20 million words. The bilingual texts of the
laws is introduced in Section 2, with an emphasis
on HK?s legislation text hierarchy and its num-
bering system that can be utilized for text align-
ment to subparagraph level. Section 3 presents
basic methodology and technical details for har-
vesting and aligning bilingual Web page pairs, ex-
tracting content texts from the pages, and align-
ing text structures in terms of the text hierarchy
via utilizing consistent intrinsic features in the
Web pages and content texts. Section 4 presents
XML schema for encoding the alignment results
and illustrates the display mode for browsing the
aligned bilingual corpus. Section 5 concludes
the paper, highlighting the value of the corpus in
term of its volume, translation quality, specificity
and comprehensiveness, and alignment granular-
ity. Our future work to explore the Web for har-
vesting more quantities of parallel bitexts is also
briefly outlined.
2 Bilingual Texts of the Laws of HK
The laws of Hong Kong (HK) before 1987 were
exclusively enacted in English. They were trans-
lated into Chinese in the run-up to the handover
in 1997. Since then all HK laws have been en-
acted in both English and Chinese, both versions
being equally authentic. This gives rise to a valu-
able set of bitexts in large quantity and high qual-
ity that can be utilized to facilitate empirical MT
research.
2.1 BLIS Corpus
The bilingual texts of the laws of Hong Kong
have been made available to the public in re-
cent years by the Justice Department of the HK-
SAR through the bilingual laws information sys-
tem (BLIS). All these texts are freely accessible
from http://www.justice.gov.hk/.
BLIS provides the most comprehensive docu-
mentation of HK legislation. It contains all statute
laws of Hong Kong currently in operation, includ-
ing all ordinances and subsidiary legislation of
HK (and some of their past versions dating back
to 60 June 1997), the Basic Law and the Sino-
British Joint Declaration, the constitution of PRC
and national laws that apply in HK, and other rel-
evant instruments. The entire bilingual corpus of
Figure 1: Illustration of BLIS hierarchy
BLIS legal texts contains approximately 10 mil-
lion English words and 18 million Chinese char-
acters. Lexical resources of this kind are particu-
larly useful in bilingual legal terminology studies
and text alignment work.
2.2 Text Hierarchy
BLIS organizes the legal texts in terms of the
hierarchy of the Loose-Leaf Edition of the Laws
of Hong Kong. At the top level, the ordinances
are arranged by chapters, each of which is identi-
fied by an assigned number and a short title, e.g.,
Chapter 5 OFFICIAL LANGUAGES ORDINANCE /
?5? ??????. The assigned number for a
subsidiary legislation chapter consists of a chap-
ter number and a following uppercase letter, e.g.,
CAP 5C HIGH COURT CIVIL PROCEDURE (USE
OF LANGUAGE) RULES / ?5C? ???????
?(????)??.
The content of an ordinance, exclusive of its
long title, is divided and identified according to a
very rigid numbering system which encodes the
hierarchy of the texts of the laws. Both the Chi-
nese and English versions of an ordinance fol-
low exactly the same hierarchical structures such
as chapters (?), parts (?), sections (?), sub-
sections (?), paragraphs (?) and subparagraphs
(?). This allows us to align the bitexts along
72
Figure 2: BLIS texts in pair
this hierarchical structure, once they are down-
loaded from the BLIS official site. To our knowl-
edge, a well-aligned bilingual corpus of this size
covering a special domain so comprehensively is
seldom readily available for the Chinese-English
language pair.
Excerpts from the BLIS corpus are illustrated
in Figure 1 and 2, one illustrating its hierarchy and
the other a pair of BLIS bitexts. From the excerpts
we can see that not everything has an exact match
between a pair of BLIS Web pages. For example,
the Chinese side has a gazette number ?25 of 1998
s. 2? and a piece of ?remarks? at the beginning of
content text, whereas its English counterpart has
none of them.
3 Harvesting Bitexts from the Web
Basically two phases are involved in construct-
ing the bilingual corpus of the laws of HK. The
first phase is to harvest the monolingual texts of
HK laws from the BLIS site and align them into
pairs. It involves the following steps: (1) down-
loading Web pages one by one with the aid of a
Web crawler, (2) extracting the texts from them
by filtering out the HTML markup, and (3) align-
ing the extracted monolingual texts into bilingual
Figure 3: BLIS web pages connected as two dou-
ble linked lists
pairs. The second phase is to align finer-grained
text structures within each text pair.
3.1 Downloading BLIS Web Pages
A BLIS Web page does not necessarily corre-
spond to any particular text structure such as a
chapter, a part, a section, a subsection, or a para-
graph in the BLIS hierarchy. A chapter, espe-
cially a short one, may be organized into a few
sections in a Web page or in several contiguous
pages. Some sections, e.g., the long ones, are di-
vided into several pages. In general, BLIS does
not maintain any reliable match between its Web
pages and any particular text hierarchical struc-
tures.
Fortunately, in most cases a BLIS page always
has a counterpart in the other language. There is
a ?switch language? button on each page to link
to the counterpart page. Such linkage allows us
to download the Web pages in pairs and, conse-
quently, harvest a list of page-to-page aligned bi-
texts.
In addition to the pair link, each BLIS page also
carries links for the ?next? and the ?previous sec-
tion of enactment?. These two kinds of linkage
turn the pages into two double linked lists, each
in a language, as illustrated in Figure 3, with each
page as a node. Nodes in pairs are also double
linked between the two lists.
However, the pairwise linkage is not reliable
in the BLIS site, because there are missing Web
pages in one of the two languages in question
(see Table 3 below for more details). In order to
download all bitexts of legislation from the site,
we need to go through one linked list and down-
load each page and its counterpart, if there is one,
in the other language. Such scanning gives a list
of text pairs, where some pages may have a null

counterpart. An alternative strategy is to down-
load each list separately, and then match the pages
into pairs sequentially with the aid of numbering
information in the header of each page ? see 3.2
below. These two strategies verify one another,
making sure that all pages are downloaded and
put in the right pairs.
The downloading is carried out by a Web
crawler implemented in Java. In order to accom-
plish the above strategies, it also has to handle a
number of technical issues.
? It sleeps for a while (e.g., 10 seconds) when
it finishes downloading a certain number of
pages (e.g., 50 pages), because the BLIS site
refuses continuous access from one site for a
too long time.
? When an error occurs, it remembers the cur-
rent URL. Then it re-starts from where it
stops.
The data about the file downloading from BLIS
site is given in Table 1. One can conceive that
if the time intervals for sleep and downloading
could be automatically tuned by the crawler to
maximize the downloading efficiency, it would
get the job done significantly more quickly. Our
option for 10 seconds sleep between every 50 files
is based on error records of a number of test runs.
3.2 Aligning Web Pages
Every BLIS Web page is identified by a subti-
tle that carries numbering information about the
page, as illustrated in Figure 1. Such a subtitle
is exactly retained in the page as its HTML title.

bExclusive of punctuation marks.
Table 3: The number of aligned and missing files
This feature is utilized to align BLIS pages: all
downloaded files are named in terms of the num-
bering information extracted from their HTML ti-
tles, as illustrated in Table 2. Consequently, all
files are naturally aligned in pairs by their names.
Any file names not in a pair indicate the missing
counterparts in the other language. The statistics
of file alignment are given in Table 3.
3.3 Text Extraction
Basically, this task involves two aspects, namely,
filtering HTML markup and extracting content
text. A straightforward strategy is that we first
clean up HTML tags in each page and then the
non-legal content. The tags are in brackets, and
non-legal content in a consistent pattern through-
out all BLIS pages. However, a more convenient
way to do it is to make use of a reliable feature
in the BLIS pages: legal content is placed in be-
tween two ? the only two ? horizontal bars in each
page. Accordingly, we implement a strategy to
first extract every thing in between the two bars
and then clean up remaining HTML tags. The
output from this procedure includes
? a header as a fixed set of items, including
chapter number, title, heading, etc., and
? a piece of content text as a list of numbered
items each in a line. (See the header and con-
tent text in Figure 2.)
The text in a BLIS page is displayed as a sequence
of hierarchically numbered items, such as subsec-
tions, paragraphs and subparagraphs.
3.4 Text Alignment within Text Pairs
After page (or file) alignment, each page finds its
counterpart in the other language. After text ex-
traction, a page gives a content text consisting of
a list of numbered items, each in a line. A such

Table 4: Anchors in a sample text
item can be divided into a numbering item and the
remaining content text in the line, as illustrated in
Table 4. The Chinese counterpart of this text car-
ries similar lines, if no missing line in any page of
the pair.
Unfortunately, missing lines are found in some
BLIS pages, as exemplified in Figure 2. There is
no guarantee that matching text lines one by one
in sequence would carry out the expected align-
ment within a page pair. However, the numbering
items at the beginning of each line can be utilized
as anchors to facilitate the alignment. The strat-
egy along this line is given as follows.
1. Anchor identification: numbering items at
the beginning of each line are recognized
as anchors, with the beginning and the end
of the whole content text as two special an-
chors, resulting in a list of anchors for each
page;
2. Anchor alignment: match the two lists of an-
chors sequentially. If a pair of anchors does
not match, give up the smaller one (in terms
of the BLIS numbering hierarchy) and move
on to the next possible pair, working in ex-
actly the same procedure as matching iden-
tical anchor pairs between two sorted lists of
anchors.
3. Text line alignment: a pair of matched an-
chors give a pair of matched lines; an un-
matched anchor indicates a missing line in
the other language.
4 XML Markup for the Aligned Corpus
XML is applied to encode the text alignment
outcomes output from the above alignment pro-
cedure. It has been a standard for data repre-
sentation and exchange on the Web, and also
accepted by the NLP community as a standard
for linguistic data annotation and representation
(Ide et al, 2000; Mengel and Lezius, 2000;
Kim et al, 2001). There are a series of yearly
NLPXML workshops for it since 2001. It pro-
vides a platform-independent flexible and sophis-
ticated plain text format for data encoding and
manipulation. It is particularly suitable for hier-
archical linguistic data such as the hierarchically-
aligned bilingual corpus that we have produced.
What?s more, converting data to XML format not
only significantly reduces the complexity of data
exchange among different computer systems but
also enhances data transmission reliability and
eases Web browsing.
There have been many corpora that are anno-
tated with XML, e.g., HCRC Map Task Corpus
(Anderson et al, 1991), American National Cor-
pus (Ide and Macleod, 2001), the La Republica
corpus (Baroni et al, 2004). Below we present
the XML schema for our subparagraph-aligned
BLIS bitexts, with sample annotation, and nec-
essary Web browsing.
4.1 XML Schema
The current version of the XML schema for the
bilingual BLIS corpus, as given in Figure 4, fo-
cuses on encoding all text structures in the BLIS
hierarchy, including all elements in each BLIS
Web page. It is to be extended to cover finer-
grained structures such as clauses, phrases and
words, as we proceed to align the BLIS bitexts
at these linguistic levels. For simplicity, we al-
low para to subsume all types of text line, be
they a section, subsection, paragraph or subpara-
graph. The annotation of a sample bitext with this
schema is illustrated in Figure 5. Annotation of
this kind is carried out by a Java program auto-
matically for the entire bitext corpus.
4.2 Corpus Browsing
A number of display modes are designed for
browsing the subparagraph-aligned bitexts, in-
cluding bilingual modes and monolingual modes.
75
Figure 4: XML schema for aligned BLIS bitexts
In a bilingual mode, text line pairs are displayed
in sequence. Switch of language order or from
one mode to another is allowed any time during
browsing. The bilingual display mode is illus-
trated in Figure 6.
5 Conclusion
We have presented in the above sections our re-
cent work on harvesting and aligning the bitexts
of the laws of Hong Kong, including basic tech-
niques for downloading English-Chinese bilin-
gual legal texts from BLIS official site, sound
strategies for aligning the bitexts by utilizing the
numbering system in the legal texts, and neces-
sary XML annotation for the alignment results.
The value of the outcomes, i.e., the subparagraph-
aligned bilingual corpus, can be evaluated in
terms of the following aspects.
Corpus size The entire corpus is of 10.4M En-
glish words and 18.3M Chinese characters,
several times larger than the well-known
Penn Treebank Corpus in size.
Figure 5: Sample bitext in XML encoding
Translation quality All texts of the corpus are
prepared by the Law Drafting Division of
the Department of Justice, Hong Kong Gov-
ernment. Legal texts are known to be more
precise and less ambiguous than most other
types of text.
Specificity and comprehensiveness The corpus
covers specifically the domain of Hong Kong
legislation. It is the most authoritative and
complete text collection of the laws of Hong
Kong.
Alignment granularity The entire corpus is
aligned precisely to the subparagraph level.
Most subparagraphs in the legal texts are
phrases, fragments of a clause, or clauses; as
shown in Table 4.

Figure 6: Illustration of browsing modes
A bilingual corpus of this size and quality cov-
ering a specific domain so comprehensively is
particularly useful not only in empirical MT re-
search but also in computational studies of bilin-
gual terminology and legislation. Our future work
will focus on word alignment for inferring bilin-
gual lexical resources and on automatic recogni-
tion of legal terminology.
Also, our experience in constructing this bilin-
gual corpus has laid a foundation for us to con-
tinue to harvest more bilingual text materials from
the Web, e.g., from Hong Kong government?s
Web sites. We find that almost all Hong Kong
government web sites, which are in large num-
bers, maintain their Web pages consistently par-
allel in English and Chinese. We are not sure if
such bitexts in such pages are larger than that in
the BLIS site in volume. We do know they cover
a large number of distinct domains. This is partic-
ularly useful for MT. If we can harvest and align
the bitexts from such Web pages efficiently via
utilizing their intrinsic characteristics of URL cor-
respondence and text structure, it would not be a
dream any more to put an end to the time of hav-
ing too few existing translation materials for em-
pirical MT studies, at least, for the language pair
of Chinese and English.
