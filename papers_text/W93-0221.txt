1. I n t roduct ion  
While communicative intention certainly plays a role in language generation, we have fimnd that there is a 
need for textual and rhetorical relations as well in our document generation system, PLANDoc. PLAN- 
Doc will produce multi-page narratives describing the activities of telephone network planning engineers. 
These narratives will be read by managers and auditors as well as other planning engineers. 
Since the reports contain summaries, ometimes deterlnining what infi~rlnation to include and how to 
organize it is based solely on textual constraints. Summaries must be concise and intbrmation can be 
packed in using constructions such as ellipsis, conjunction and modificalion. Thus, textual constraints hat 
rely on syntactic structure, lexical inlormation, and parallels in thc semantic types of the underlying infor- 
mation must play a role in organizing a summary. 
Since the intended audience of the narratives i broad, we often need to determine what information to 
include in the narrative based on general presentational f ctors that aim to improve the clarity of the text. 
Rhetorical relations are useful for modelling this sort of constraint. 
There are also cases where it is necessary to comnmnicate he planning engineer's intent in taking a 
specific action. However, we cannot model this computationally since we have no access to intbrmation 
about intention. While we cannot automatically generate information based on intent, we do allow the 
engineer to enter statements hat describe her reasons fi~r an action. These user-authored statements can 
be interspersed with machine-generated text. 
In the following sections, we first give some background on the PLANDoc system and the narratives that 
we are aiming to generate. We Ibllow this with examples that illustrate why different types of constraints 
are needed in determining the content and organization of a PLANDoc narrative. All examples are taken 
from a set of narratives written by an experienced planning engineer tbr actual runs of the underlying 
planning system that PLANDoc is based on. 
2. PLANDoc Background 
Currently, planning engineers use a powerful software tool, the PLAN system, that helps them derive 
20-year elief plans optimizing the timing, placement and cost of new fiicilities in a route in the telephone 
network. Documentation f relief plans is needed to justify their implied expenditures to managers, 
auditors, and regulators as well as to provide a record of the engineer's reasoning for future network 
studies. PLANDoc will generate documentation using a trace of an engineer's interaction with PLAN. 
Given a model of the current configuration of a route along with lbrecasts of future service demands, the 
planning engineer first calls upon PLAN to generate a Base relief plan Ibr the route. Although the Base 
plan is the most economical long-term solution, it generally needs to be refined to account or practical 
and intangible factors known to the engineer but unknown to the computer. For example, the engineer 
may need to postpone the placement of equipment in a certain CSA (Carrier Serving Area) due to a fixed 
cap on near-term expenditures, or she may decide to activate DLC (Digital Loop Carrier) equipment in 
another CSA because small manholes in that area make the placement of additional copper cables imprac- 
tical. For this reason PLAN includes a powerful Interactive Refinement Module that allows the engineer 
to do 'what-if modeling to explore the effects of various refinements Io the Base plan. The engineer 
draws upon her expertise to determine what refinements otry, olten including some that she lhlly expects 
78 
to be sub-optimal, if only for the purpose of proving the point to managers, auditors and regulators. In the 
end, some subset of refinements is selected as the final Proposed Relief Plan. 
3. PLANDoc  Narratives 
We employed an experienced planning engineer to write sample PLANDoc narratives based on actual 
PLAN runs. These manually-written narratives serve as models for our system development. The open- 
ing and closing paragraphs ofPLANDoc narratives are summaries of the Base Plan and the final Proposed 
Relief Plan. The main body of PLANDoc narratives i a sequence of one-paragraph descriptions of each 
refinement scenario the engineer chooses to include. In addition to the machine-generated r finement 
paragraphs, the engineer is given the opportunity to enter a manually-written E gineer's Note for each 
refinement. The purpose the Engineer's Note is to provide motivation or to describe the reasoning behind 
the refinement. Thus, the main body of the narrative consists of alternating refinement paragraphs and 
engineering notes. 
The Engineer's Notes are clearly meant o communicate intentions. In contrast, we have observed that 
some of our model refinement paragraphs (to be generated automatically): 1) appear to be organized by 
textual relations that govern their discourse structure; 2) include sentences that seem to be motivated by 
rhetorical relations; and 3) include sentences that require access to communicative goals in order to be 
generated. We provide xamples of each. 
3.1. Evidence of Textual Constraints in PLANDoc Paragraphs 
In the following refinement paragraph, 8 messages have been grouped together based on textual con- 
stralnts. Because of the similarity of each individual message and resulting sentence, the messages can be 
combined using conjunction to produce avery concise sentence. 
1) This refinement demanded the following changes: denied DLC activations to CSA 2119, 2653, 2755, 
and 2757; used a cutover strategy of "ALL" for CSA 2605 and 2713; changed the "ALL" DLC system to 
"idlc96" for CSA 2605; and demanded DLC activation for CSA 2651 in 1994Q 1. 
In a second summary example shown below, the sentence in italics appears to have been placed in this 
position based on its relation to the previous entences. In the body of the narrative, the date is usually 
included with each separate activation. To generate a summary like this, PLANDoc would have to note 
that it could group a series of activations initially and delay mentioning the date since it can refer back to 
them using a phrase such as "All these new activations." Such a decision can only be opportunistically 
based on similarities between data that can be grouped together and the available of an appropriate means 
for referring back to them. 
2) The BASE plan for this route called for activating new DLC sites with fiber T-1 support in CSA 2117, 
CSA 2651, CSA 2105, CSA 2113, CSA 2115, CSA 2703, CSA 2755 and CSA 2757. DLC activalions 
with copper conditioned pairs for T-1 support included CSA 2119, CSA 2653, CSA 2713, CSA 2523 and 
CSA 2451. Fiber was activated to CSA 2605. All these new activations are in tile first 10 years of the 
study. 
The use of constraints such as these for organizing content, which are opportunistically based on the 
surrounding text, seem only remotely related to rhetorical relations and communicative intentions, at least 
.relative to the following examples. Such constraints are more textual in nature. 
3.2. Evidence of Rhetorical Structure Relations in PLANDoc Paragraphs 
Unlike the previous examples, ome PLANDoc narrative paragraphs include sentences that appear to be 
motivated by rhetorical structure relations. Examples include the following: 
3) This refinement demanded that fiber be activated to CSA 2907 in 1996. This CSA was actiwttedfor 
DLC in 1994Q4 in RUNID 'dlc_2907'. 
4) This refinement denied activation of CSA 2119 and CSA 2120 (tile 2 DLC sites activated in the BASE 
plan). 
79 
5) This refinement demands DLC activation of CSA 2551 in 1996 with 40 pairs cutover from copper to 
DLC at that time. CSA 2551 was activated in 1997 in the BASE plan with no cutover. 
6) Tiffs refinement denied the new DLC activation in the BASEplan of CSA 4704. 
These paragraphs require intelligent content planning because the italicized sentences refer not to actions 
in the current refinement scenario but to actions in some previous cenarios, in the Base plan or input data. 
Their underlying propositions are not among those passed to the text generator tbr the current refinement 
paragraph. Hence, a content planner capable of exploiting factors uch as rhetorical relations is needed in 
order to seek out those propositions for inclusion. We take the rhetorical structure relation underlying all 
of the above examples to be that of CONTRAST since in each case the italicized sentence xplicitly 
contrasts old information with new information. 
One might surmise that the author had the communicative goal of calling the reader's attention to the 
contrast between the actions in the current refinement and previous intbrmation. However, tbr implemen- 
tation purposes it seems sufficient ot the content planning module to operate based on the interred 
rhetorical relation of CONTRAST. 
3.3. Evidence of  Communicat ive  Intentions in PLANDoc Paragraphs  
Although intentional relations are evident in the previous examples, it can be characterized as a general 
intention that might be attributed to any author. There is notlfing specific to the individual planning situa- 
tion that causes the information to be added as in every report he difference between ew refinements and 
the base plan must be clear. Thus, existing rhetorical relations are sufficient o make computational im- 
plementation possible. In contrast, the ti~llowing examples embody some intentional relations that are 
beyond our capacity to implement. 
7) This refinement activates CSA 4111 tbr DLC in 1994Q4. CSA 4111 was activated in 1997 in the BASE 
phm and 24 gauge cable was placed in section 4109 in 1994Q. 
ENGR NOTE: This is an attempt to defer/eliminate the coarse gauge cable. It doesn't. 
8) This refinement demands the activation of fiber to CSA 2168b in 1996 and to CSA 2115 in 1994Q4. 
These fiber activations eliminate manhole rebuilds in sections 2111, 2112 and 2115. Ducts and coarse 
gauge cable in sections 2165 and 2117 are also eliminated or dt(/erred. Plus, they get fiber turned up in 
business areas at a lower cost than serving the DLC on copper. 
The first example includes both the refinement paragraph and the its accompanying engineering note. In 
both examples, neither the italicized nor the bold sentences refer to actions in the current refinement 
scenario, so all would require the eflbrt of an intelligent content planner in order to be included. 
Note that the italicized sentences in these examples are similar to the ones in the previous examples in that 
an intelligent content planner could exploit he rhetorical relation CONTRAST as a basis for their inclu- 
sion. The bold sentences are far more problematic n that their only basis Ibr inclusion appears to be a 
communicative intention that can only be revealed in an engineering note. Note also that the communica- 
tive intention is related to a domain-specific telephone engineering principle. This principle is specific to 
the current planning problem and not to all planning problems. Unless we can discover and explicitly 
represent a finite set of such principles, it will not be possible to include such sentences in our machine- 
generated refinement paragraphs. 
4. Conc lus ion  
In written reports such as the ones PLANDoc will generate, communicative intent is not sufficient for 
determining the content and organization of the report. Since the audience is broad and planning scenarios 
are numerous, we cannot reason about the individual intentions and knowledge of writer and reader in 
determining what should go into the report. Often knowledge about he general kind of information that is 
needed is sufficient for determining what to include. This can be implemented using rhetorical relations. 
The opportunistic use of constraints based on the surrounding text, possible syntactic structures that can be 
80 
used, and available phrasings to determine content is distinct from current echniques Ibr organizing con- 
tent. However, this capability seems crucial when summaries are required.
