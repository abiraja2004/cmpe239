TECHNICAL CORRESPONDENCE 
CROSS-VOWEL PHONOTACTIC CONSTRAINTS 
Fudge (1969), Clements and Keyser (1983), and Davis 
(1984) have all pointed out a number of systematic 
phonotactic onstraints holding between a prevocalic 
and a postvocalic onsonant in English monosyllabic 
words. One of the strongest of these constraints, and 
one that has been observed by all three of the above 
mentioned researchers, is that there are no monosyl- 
labic words of the form sCVC in which the same 
non-coronal (labial or velar) consonant flanks both sides 
of the vowel. Hence there are no English words like 
"spep" or "skik". Another constraint, noted by Davis 
(1984), is that there are no monosyllabic words of the 
form sNVN (where N can be any nasal consonant). 
Thus there are no words in English like "snam" or 
"sming". Here, I point out that these two constraints 
are in fact more general. Both these constraints are 
more general in that they are not just constraints on 
monosyllabic words or on single syllables, rather they 
are constraints on any sequence of sCVC (or sNVN) 
regardless where in the word (or, rather, morpheme) 
that sCVC sequence (or sNVN gequence) occurs. Also, 
the constraint on sCVC sequences i not just a con- 
straint on identical consonants flanking both sides of the 
vowel, but on homorganic consonants (i.e., consonants 
having the same place of articulation) flanking both 
sides of the vowel. 
Are the systematic constraints on sCVC sequences 
(in which the Cs are identical noncoronal consonants) 
and sNVN sequences (in which the N is any nasal 
consonant) which hold for English monosyllabic words 
actually general constraints on English syllables as is 
assumed by Davis (1984) (and also by Clements and 
Keyser 1983)? If, in fact, these are constraints on 
English syllables, one would expect to find words 
containing the sequence sCVCV (or sNVNV) since the 
postvocalic C (or N) would not be part of the initial 
syllable. So, for example, one might expect hat there 
would be words like "skicky" or "spapoon" in which 
the postvocalic onsonant is not part of the initial 
syllable, but there would not be words like "skick" or 
"spap" in which the postvocalic onsonant is part of 
the initial syllable. If, on the other hand, the constraint 
on sCVC sequences (and sNVN sequences) is actually 
a constraint on a sequence of sounds, regardless of 
whether the sounds are all in the same syllable, then 
possible words or sequences like "skicky" or "spa- 
poon" would be non-occurring or at least extremely 
rare. A search was done on a computerized lexicon 
containing nearly 20,000 words from Webster's Pocket 
Dictionary to see if the sequences CVC and sNVN. 
occur in any polysyllabic words. The only word in this 
lexicon in which the sequence sCVC is found (where the 
Cs are identical non-coronal consonants) is the word 
"dyspepsia" where the sequence "spep" occurs. No 
other such words were found. Polysyllabic words hav- 
ing the sequence sCVC where the two Cs are not 
identical are much more common. A search through the 
20,000-word lexicon gives us such words as "spa- 
ghetti", "scaffold", "scuba", "eskimo", and "epis- 
copal". Thus it appears that the constraint on sCVC 
sequences i  not really a constraint only holding within 
a syllable, but is a constraint on a sequence of sounds 
holding within a word. (Notice that in the exceptional 
word "dyspepsia" the sequence "spep" spans a mor- 
pheme boundary since the s is part of the prefix "dys-", 
which occurs in words like "dysfunction", dyspha- 
sia", and "dystrophy".) 
At first glance, the search through the lexicon of 
polysyllabic words containing the sequence sNVN sug- 
gests that the constraint on the sequence sNVN does 
not hold for polysyllabic words, unlike the constraint on 
sCVC sequences. The following 12 words containing 
the sequence sNVN were found: casement, congress- 
man, dismantle, emplacement, fastening (with the or- 
thographic e between the t and the n being deleted in 
pronunciation), marksman, placement, pronouncement, 
replacement, spokesman, statesman, and talisman. 
However, these words, like the exceptional "dyspep- 
sia" mentioned above, are not monomorphemic; all of 
these words (with the possible xception of"talisman") 
involve morpheme boundaries between the s and the 
following nasal consonant. These data thus indicate that 
the constraint on sNVN sequences (as well as on sCVC 
sequences) are constraints on a sequence of sounds that 
hold within morphemes; they can be considered mor- 
pheme structure constraints, not word level or syllable 
structure constraints. 
The constraint disallowing (monomorphemic) sCVC 
sequences (in which the Cs are identical non-coronal 
consonants) on further investigation turns out to be a 
more general constraint in that the two Cs do not have

to be identical; rather, they cannot be articulated in the 
same place in the vocal tract. That is, there are virtually 
no monomorphemic words in English that have the 
sequence sCVC where the two Cs are either both labial 
or both velar. The only word in the 20,000-word lexicon 
that was found to violate this constraint is the word 
"skunk". The words "skag", "spam", and "spumoni" 
would also violate the constraint although they were not 
listed in the lexicon. That this constraiint really does 
involve identical place of articulation is made evident 
when we consider the situation where the two Cs in an 
sCVC sequence are not homorganic. A search through 
the 20,000-word computerized lexicon revealed that no 
constraint whatsoever held when the two Cs were made 
at different locations in the vocal tract. For example, 
the sequence skV was followed by a labial consonant in
58 entries (e.g., "skip", "scuba"), an alveolar conso- 
nant in 151 entries (e.g., skit, skate), and a palato- 
alveolar consonant in 25 entries (e.g., scotch, sketch). 
The fact that there were virtually no words with a velar 
consonant following an skV sequence is of interest. 
Moreover, the sequence spV was followed by a velar 
consonant in 56 entries (e.g., spike, spook), an alveolar 
consonant in 196 entries (e.g., spit, speed), and a 
palato-alveolar consonant in 20 entries (e.g., speech, 
special); there were virtually no words where a labial 
consonant followed an spV sequence. Thus it is con- 
cluded that the constraint on sCVC sequences originally 
formulated by Clements and Keyser (1983) and Davis 
(1984) as a constraint on the occurrence of identical 
non-coronal consonants i in fact a more general con- 
straint on consonants made in the same place of artic- 
ulation. 
Although the constraint against having homorganic 
(non-coronal) consonants flanking both sides of the 
vowel in a sCVC sequence seems to be a real constraint 
of English, it remains omewhat of a mystery why there 
should be such a constraint. The constraint crucially 
must include s since there is no constraint on English 
CVC sequences where the two Cs are homorganic. A 
check through the 20,000-word computerized lexicon 
found I18 entries for words having (non-nasal) labial 
consonants flanking both sides of the vowel in a CVC 
sequence: and 138 entries for words having a velar 
consonant flanking both sides of a vowel in a CVC 
sequence. Thus this constraint only involves an sCVC 
sequence and not any CVC sequence. I offer no expla- 
nation for why the presence of the s in an sCVC 
sequence ssentially places a restriction on the postvo- 
calic consonant. It is conjectured, though, that while the 
reason for such a constraint is a mystery, speakers of 
English make use of them for parsing words in contin- 
uous speech. For example, given the constraint on 
sCVC sequences discussed in this paper, phonetic se- 
quences like \[spalpleln\] (i.e., spy plane) and \[Itsmaln\] 
(i.e., it's mine) can only be parsed as "spy plane" and 
"it's mine", respectively. They cannot be parsed as 
"spipe lane" and "it smine", respectively, nor could 
they be parsed as single words. It is quite possible that 
speakers of English can and do make use of such 
phonotactic constraints.
