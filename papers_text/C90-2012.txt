1 In t roduct ion  
Beth & Nygaard (1988) have described a for- 
malism for NLP, the E-Framework (EFW). 
Two kinds of problem are emerging. Formally, 
there are problems with a complete formalisa- 
tion of certain details of the EFW, but these 
will not be examined in this paper. Substan- 
tively, the question arises as to what mileage 
there is in this formalism tbr the MT problem. 
Possibly this question arises about any new 
NLP formalism, but Raw et al(1988) describe 
the EFW in an MT context. 
The EFW arose in reaction to the CAT for- 
realism for MT (Arnold & des Tombe (1987), 
Arnold et al(1986)). This was a sequential s-
tratificational formalism in which each level of 
representation was policed by its own gram- 
mar. The essentials of this process can be di- 
agrammed:

British Group of the EUROTRA project, jointly fund- 
ed by the Conunission of the European Colranunities 
and the United Khlgdom's Department of Trade and 
Industry. I an1 grateful for suggestions and comments 
from Doug Arnold, Lee Hmnphreya, Louisa Sadler, 
Andrew Way, and a COLING reviewer. 
The "t-rules" of the t-grammars were the 
problem. 
In the most compact version of this nota- 
tion, that of Sharp (1988), the t-rules consist 
of little more than the annotated subtree on 
each end of the mapping. For instance, in a t,- 
grammar mapping from a predicate-argument 
representation to a surface one, such as might 
be necessary i n the monolingual modules of an 
MT system, there might be a t-rule like 
(2) 
(?,{cat:s}).\[ $GOV: (gov,{cat=v}), 
$ARGI: argl, 
$ARG2:arg2 \] 
=> 
(s).\[ SARG1, 
vp . \ [  $GOV, 
$ARG2 \]\] 
This had the attractiveness of explicitness 
and clarity, but when it was applied over a 
wider range of phenomena, two problems e- 
merged. Firstly, the right-hand side (RttS) 
of the t-rules repeated the target grammar. 
In (2), the RtlS repeats the statement of the 
surface grammar that the verb and object are 
dominated by a VP. Secondly, the set oft-rules 
exploded combinatorially. How this emerged 
depended on details of the grammars involved. 
For example, in the above case, if a second 
66 1 
rule were added Ibr passive sentences, then a 
third and fourth would be needed inserting will 
on the RHS in future active and passive sen- 
tences. \[t is impossible to nmke separate provi- 
sion for passive and future--there is a passive 
simple-tense rule and a passive future rule. To 
add provision to lower the negation operator 
into its surface adverbial position now requires 
not another ule but another four rules. 
The general route of the EFW to solving 
these problems is to separate the output of the 
t-grammar f om the finished representation i  
the following way, as described in Bech & Ny- 
gaard (1988): 
(3) Repni 
I 
t-grammar 
DI'~SCIIIP'I'OR~ 
I 
g r gi l l  lit a r j  
J. 
II,epn~ 
The RtIS of each t-rule specifies a local 
part of a special representation called a DE- 
SCRIPTOR. This descriptor is then further 
processed by the grammar to produce a true 
representation. So (2) becomes 
(4) 
S: {cat=s}\[ GOV: {role=gov}, 
ARGI: {role=argl}, 
ARG2: {rolo=arg2} \] 
=> 
S < ARGI, GOV, ARG2 > 
The descriptor %treed by the I~ttS is then, 
crucially, parsed according to the target gram- 
mar. All structures defined by the grammar 
with that mother at the top and those daugh- 
ters at the bottom are built: specifically, VP 
is inserted above the verb and object. Given 
the extra devices available within grammars, 
will could be added to the descriptor of a fu- 
ture tense sentence after t-rule application, so 
the four rules covering voice and simple/future 
tense mentioned above could be reduced to 
two (or one using the unorderedness device de- 
scribed in Bach & Nygaard (1988)). 
This is what makes the EFW the EFW. 
Without the separate ntity called the descrip- 
tor being parsed to create the representation, 
the EFW would lose its defining characteris- 
tic. So is there any mileage in this insight for 
MT? 
It should be noted that what is at issue here 
is the special characteristics of the EFW, those 
which distinguish it from other stratificational 
systems uch as CAT. The latter have no ana- 
logue of the EFW's "consolidation" idea and 
therefore no analogue of the particular prob- 
lems discussed here. The EFW is not in these 
respects representative of stratificationM T 
formalisms in general. 
2 Consol idat ion and Simple 
Transfer 
What target grammars do to the information 
specified oil the RHS in CA'I' can be viewed as 
a special case of what they do in EFW. The 
EFW can parse, inserting mid-tree nodes and 
even extra daughters. Successful consolidation 
includes a judgrnent that the output represen- 
tation is acceptable. A special case of this is 
the geometrical check, where the parser inserts 
nothing, and delivers an acceptability verdict 
on the output. CAT is limited to performing 
the latter special case, which we will refer to 
as "trivial consolidation". Its complement is
"non-trivial consolidation", and it is this lat- 
ter that is at issue in this section. 
There is a well-motivated research pro- 
gramme with the aim of making the transfer 
2 67 
stage of MT as simple as other factors per- 
mit (van Eynde (1986); Arnold, des Tombe & 
Jaspaert (1985, section 2.2.3); Leermakers &
Kous (1986)). 
Transfer in the EFW is as in (3). The need 
to make transfer simple must be interpreted as 
a need to make the two representations as sim- 
ilar as possible, rather than to make the source 
representation and the target descriptor as 
similar as possible, for methodological reason- 
s. Simple transfer is furthered by researching 
theories and grammars that assign representa- 
tions that are similar cross-linguistically. But 
descriptors are not governed by theories and 
grammars (other than the bare formal restric- 
tion that they must be trees). The only way 
theories and grammars get access to descrip- 
tors in the EFW is by consolidating them into 
representations. Since there is no theory of de- 
scriptors that can be researched in aid of sim- 
ple transfer, simple transfer must mean simi- 
larity of representations rather than of repre- 
sentation and descriptor. 
Where the simple transfer esearch strate- 
gy is successful, then source and target repre- 
sentations are identical except for lexical unit- 
s. Target descriptor and representation nmst 
therefore be identical, at least geometrically. 
Consolidation is therefore trivial checking, as 
in CAT. Where si,uple transfer is possible, 
parsing of descriptors i  overkill. 
Where simple transfer is not. possible, con- 
solidation would be useful if the descrip- 
tor resembled the source representation more 
than the target representation resembled the 
source. 
There are two possible subcases of such a 
situation. Firstly, there could be a general fail- 
ure of interface theory to assign similar enough 
representations. Suppose for example inter- 
face theory permitted but did not require VP 
nodes, and there was a language pair SL and 
TL such that SL had no VP nodes and TL had 
them. The TL interface descriptor might then 
have no VP nodes, and consolidation could 
add them to the interface representation. In 
practice, such language-wide ifferences in in- 
terface geometry seem to be easy to avoid, but 
in any case there is a problem of modularity. 
The output of the bilingual component, the 
transfer t-grammar, is non-trivially altered by 
a monolingual component, he target interface 
grammar. This makes the modularity of the 
bilingual component questionable. In gener- 
al, it is questionable whether a t-grammar re- 
quiring non-trivial consolidation is a separate 
module from its target generator, and in trans- 
fer, this matters, because it is highly desir- 
able that the numerous bilingual components 
be modular. 
Secondly, there can be failures of simple 
transfer caused by a peculiarity of a specific 
source expression, ff consolidation were used 
here, this would lead to such processes as: 
@(a) 
Repn: 
Descr: 
Repn: 
l'ascenseur s'est aba/ss4

the llft went

@(b) 
Repn: 
Dcscr: 
Repn: 
la voiture s'en est all4e 
I 
t-grammar 
the car went 
I 
grammar  
the car went away 
In such cases, using consolidation to fix up 
the output of over-simple t-rules is impossible. 
Such a strategy is always in danger of destroy- 
68 3 
ing the desired translation of some expression 
other than the one being fixed. 
In cases of this latter type t-rules have to 
take the whole load of the mapping, and the 
consolidation stage becomes trivial. 
So, to recapitulate, where simple transfer 
is possible, (non-trivial) consolidation is never 
called upon, and where simple transfer is not 
possible, it is never useful. 
3 Conso l idat ion  and  Ambi -  
gu i ty  
Consolidation has a peculiar property, that 
in certain restricted circumstances it throws 
away disambiguation results, recreating earli- 
er ambiguities. 
Suppose there is a sentence S that according 
to grammar G has a set of representations 
rt = {r:, r2,...r,}. 
In the EI"W these are trees, but consider them 
as labelled bracketings. Every rl will have a 
"stretch set" 
S(r ) = {,' I r c rt r has at least the 
same brackets as ri} 
Suppose then that some ri is consolidated ac- 
cording to a G ~ that also assigns R as the rep- 
resentations of S. ri will consolidate ambigu- 
ously, yielding S(rl). 
The linguistic claim that this embodies is 
obviously false, if G and G ~ are similar enough 
to yield the same set of representations for S, 
then each ri of G is in truth equivalent o a 
single representation, identical to ri~ in G': it 
is not equivalent to a set of G ~ representations 
that partly recapitulates the ambiguities that 
are already identified. 
An example is co-ordination. Consider the 
co-ordinated NP Bob and Carol and Ted and 
Alice. This is 11 ways ambiguous and might be 
represented 
The parses 
(6)(a) 
as such at English interface level. 
include 
{np}\[ {Bob}, {and}, {Carol}, {and}, 
{Ted}, {and}, {Alice} \] 
(6)(b) 
{np} \[ {np}\[ {Bob}, {m~d}, {Carol} \] , 
{and}, 
{np}\[ {Ted}, {and}, {Alice} \]\] 
Plausible t-rules into some target language 
will map these onto descriptors identical to tile 
source representation. Each local tree of these 
descriptors will then be parsed. It is obvious 
that this process will ill the case of (6)(a) will 
produce 11 consolidations identical to the orig- 
inal 11 parses. (6)(b) will consolidate unam- 
biguously into something identical to (6)(b). 
This is because (6)(a) is a case where S(ri) = 
R, and (6)(b) a case where S(r,) = {r,}. Less 
fiat representations have a smaller stretch set 
and in this example will consolidate into 3 or 
1 translations. 
The claim that (6)(a) is 11 ways ambiguous 
in any target language is false. (6)(a) repre- 
sents one interpretation of the surface string, 
and the one interpretation has one translation 
into any other language. 
It is obvious that this weakness also affect- 
s the EFW as a formalism for NLP. Suppose 
(6)(a) were a representation at a predicate- 
argument level, to be mapped to a surface syn- 
tax level of the sarne language. The EFW em- 
bodies a claim that (6)(a) is 11 ways arnbigu- 
ous on the surface, which is false, just as the 
claim that (6)(a) has \]1 translations i false. 
hi fact, re-parsing descriptors adds another 
dimension to the normal problem of the pars- 
ing ambiguity of conjoined structures: the first 
surface parse will in general be ambiguous, and 
each of its representations will in general map 
4 69 
onto many representations at the next level, 
each of which will in general breed again at 
the next level, and so on. Some sample figures 
are 
Level No. of Conjuncts

3 1 7 61 595 
4 1 9 101 1269 
5 1 11 151 2321 
The number of representations is ome func- 
tion of l (~-2), where l = number of levels and 
c = number of conjuncts. 
4 Consol idation and the 
Symmetry  of Translation 
It is often assumed that the relation "possible 
translation of" is symmetrical (Wanying Jin 
& Simmons (1986), Isabelle (1988), Arnold & 
Sadler (1989)). This is plausible: if w in lan- 
guage A translates into x, y, and z in language 
B, it is surely correct o say that w will appear 
in the set of possible translations in A of each 
of x, y and z. 
Many MT notations, including CAT, fail to 
embody this observation in a reversible nota- 
tion, and thus fail to force linguists to imple- 
ment a symmetrical translation relation. The 
EFW makes it impossible to implement a ful- 
ly symmetrical relation. (6)(a) translates into 
11 things in any target language, but (6)(a) 
does not appear in the set of possible back- 
translations of any of those 11 except one, the 
one identical to (6)(a). 
5 Conclusion 
The descriptor-representation separation and 
the parsing of descriptors may not be the right 
way to tackle the problems of the CAT MT 
formalism. This is a result which increases the 
urgency of exploring other avenues to tackling 
these problems. The obvious other avenue is 
improving the t-rules themselves, omething 
which is attempted for example in Arno\]\[d et 
al (1988),
