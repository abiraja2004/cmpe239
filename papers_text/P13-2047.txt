Abstract
This paper presents the settings and the re-
sults of the ROMIP 2013 MT shared task
for the English?Russian language direc-
tion. The quality of generated translations
was assessed using automatic metrics and
human evaluation. We also discuss ways
to reduce human evaluation efforts using
pairwise sentence comparisons by human
judges to simulate sort operations.
1 Introduction
Machine Translation (MT) between English and
Russian was one of the first translation directions
tested at the dawn of MT research in the 1950s
(Hutchins, 2000). Since then the MT paradigms
changed many times, many systems for this lan-
guage pair appeared (and disappeared), but as far
as we know there was no systematic quantitative
evaluation of a range of systems, analogous to
DARPA?94 (White et al, 1994) and later evalua-
tion campaigns. The Workshop on Statistical MT
(WMT) in 2013 has announced a Russian evalua-
tion track for the first time.1 However, this evalu-
ation is currently ongoing, it should include new
methods for building statistical MT (SMT) sys-
tems for Russian from the data provided in this
track, but it will not cover the performance of ex-
isting systems, especially rule-based (RBMT) or
hybrid ones.
Evaluation campaigns play an important role
in promotion of the progress for MT technolo-
gies. Recently, there have been a number of
MT shared tasks for combinations of several Eu-
ropean, Asian and Semitic languages (Callison-
Burch et al, 2011; Callison-Burch et al, 2012;
Federico et al, 2012), which we took into account
in designing the campaign for the English-Russian
direction. The evaluation has been held in the
1http://www.statmt.org/wmt13/
context of ROMIP,2 which stands for Russian In-
formation Retrieval Evaluation Seminar and is a
TREC-like3 Russian initiative started in 2002.
One of the main challenges in developing MT
systems for Russian and for evaluating them is the
need to deal with its free word order and com-
plex morphology. Long-distance dependencies
are common, and this creates problems for both
RBMT and SMT systems (especially for phrase-
based ones). Complex morphology also leads
to considerable sparseness for word alignment in
SMT.
The language direction was chosen to be
English?Russian, first because of the availabil-
ity of native speakers for evaluation, second be-
cause the systems taking part in this evaluation are
mostly used in translation of English texts for the
Russian readers.
2 Corpus preparation
In designing the set of texts for evaluation, we
had two issues in mind. First, it is known that
the domain and genre can influence MT perfor-
mance (Langlais, 2002; Babych et al, 2007), so
we wanted to control the set of genres. Second,
we were aiming at using sources allowing distri-
bution of texts under a Creative Commons licence.
In the end two genres were used coming from two
sources. The newswire texts were collected from
the English Wikinews website.4 The second genre
was represented by ?regulations? (laws, contracts,
rules, etc), which were collected from the Web
using a genre classification method described in
(Sharoff, 2010). The method provided a sufficient
accuracy (74%) for the initial selection of texts un-
der the category of ?regulations,? which was fol-
lowed by a manual check to reject texts clearly
outside of this genre category.

The initial corpus consists of 8,356 original
English texts that make up 148,864 sentences.
We chose to retain the entire texts in the cor-
pus rather than individual sentences, since some
MT systems may use information beyond isolated
sentences. 100,889 sentences originated from
Wikinews; 47,975 sentences came from the ?reg-
ulations? corpus. The first 1,002 sentences were
published in advance to allow potential partici-
pants time to adjust their systems to the corpus for-
mat. The remaining 147,862 sentences were the
corpus for testing translation into Russian. Two
examples of texts in the corpus:
90237 Ambassadors from the United States of
America, Australia and Britain have all met
with Fijian military officers to seek insur-
ances that there wasn?t going to be a coup.
102835 If you are given a discount for booking
more than one person onto the same date and
you later wish to transfer some of the dele-
gates to another event, the fees will be recal-
culated and you will be asked to pay addi-
tional fees due as well as any administrative
charge.
For automatic evaluation we randomly selected
947 ?clean? sentences, i.e. those with clear sen-
tence boundaries, no HTML markup remains, etc.
(such flaws sometimes occur in corpora collected
from the Web). 759 sentences originated from
the ?news? part of the corpus, the remaining 188
came from the ?regulations? part. The sentences
came from sources without published translations
into Russian, so that some of the participating sys-
tems do not get unfair advantage by using them for
training. These sentences were translated by pro-
fessional translators. For manual evaluation, we
randomly selected 330 sentences out of 947 used
for automatic evaluation, specifically, 190 from
the ?news? part and 140 from the ?regulations? part.
The organisers also provided participants with
access to the following additional resources:
? 1 million sentences from the English-Russian
parallel corpus released by Yandex (the same
as used in WMT13)5;
? 119 thousand sentences from the English-
Russian parallel corpus from the TAUS Data
Repository.6
These resources are not related to the test corpus
of the evaluation campaign. Their purpose was
5https://translate.yandex.ru/corpus?
lang=en
6https://www.tausdata.org
to make it easier to participate in the shared task
for teams without sufficient data for this language
pair.
3 Evaluation methodology
The main idea of manual evaluation was (1) to
make the assessment as simple as possible for a
human judge and (2) to make the results of evalu-
ation unambiguous. We opted for pairwise com-
parison of MT outputs. This is different from
simultaneous ranking of several MT outputs, as
commonly used in WMT evaluation campaigns.
In case of a large number of participating sys-
tems each assessor ranks only a subset of MT out-
puts. However, a fair overall ranking cannot be al-
ways derived from such partial rankings (Callison-
Burch et al, 2012). The pairwise comparisons
we used can be directly converted into unambigu-
ous overall rankings. This task is also much sim-
pler for human judges to complete. On the other
hand, pairwise comparisons require a larger num-
ber of evaluation decisions, which is feasible only
for few participants (and we indeed had relatively
few submissions in this campaign). Below we also
discuss how to reduce the amount of human efforts
for evaluation.
In our case the assessors were asked to make a
pairwise comparison of two sentences translated
by two different MT systems against a gold stan-
dard translation. The question for them was to
judge translation adequacy, i.e., which MT output
conveys information from the reference translation
better. The source English sentence was not pre-
sented to the assessors, because we think that we
can have more trust in understanding of the source
text by a professional translator. The translator
also had access to the entire text, while the asses-
sors could only see a single sentence.
For human evaluation we employed the multi-
functional TAUS DQF tool7 in the ?Quick Com-
parison? mode.
Assessors? judgements resulted in rankings for
each sentence in the test set. In case of ties the
ranks were averaged, e.g. when the ranks of the
systems in positions 2-4 and 7-8 were tied, their
ranks became: 1 3 3 3 5 6 7.5 7.5. To
produce the final ranking, the sentence-level ranks
were averaged over all sentences.
Pairwise comparisons are time-consuming: n

Table 1: Automatic evaluation results
cases require n(n?1)2 pairwise decisions. In thisstudy we also simulated a ?human-assisted? in-
sertion sort algorithm and its variant with binary
search. The idea is to run a standard sort algo-
rithm and ask a human judge each time a compar-
ison operation is required. This assumes that hu-
man perception of quality is transitive: if we know
that A < B and B < C, we can spare evaluation
of A and C. This approach also implies that sen-
tence pairs to judge are generated and presented to
assessors on the fly; each decision contributes to
selection of the pairs to be judged in the next step.
If the systems are pre-sorted in a reasonable way
(e.g. by an MT metric, under assumption that au-
tomatic pre-ranking is closer to the ?ideal? ranking
than a random one), then we can potentially save
even more pairwise comparison operations. Pre-
sorting makes ranking somewhat biased in favour
of the order established by an MT metric. For ex-
ample, if it favours one system against another,
while in human judgement they are equal, the final
ranking will preserve the initial order. Insertion
sort of n sentences requires n? 1 comparisons in
the best case of already sorted data and n(n?1)2 inthe worst case (reversely ordered data). Insertion
sort with binary search requires? n log n compar-
isons regardless of the initial order. For this study
we ran exhaustive pairwise evaluation and used its
results to simulate human-assisted sorting.
In addition to human evaluation, we also ran
system-level automatic evaluations using BLEU
(Papineni et al, 2001), NIST (Doddington,
2002), METEOR (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005),
TER (Snover et al, 2009), and GTM (Turian et
al., 2003). We also wanted to estimate the correla-
tions of these metrics with human judgements for
the English?Russian pair on the corpus level and
on the level of individual sentences.
4 Results
We received results from five teams, two teams
submitted two runs each, which totals seven par-
ticipants? runs (referred to as P1..P7 in the pa-
per). The participants represent SMT, RBMT,
and hybrid approaches. They included established
groups from academia and industry, as well as new
research teams. The evaluation runs also included
the translations of the 947 test sentences produced
by four free online systems in their default modes
(referred to as OS1..OS4). For 11 runs automatic
evaluation measures were calculated; eight runs
underwent manual evaluation (four online systems
plus four participants? runs; no manual evaluation
was done by agreement with the participants for
the runs P3, P6, and P7 to reduce the workload).

Table 2: Human evaluation results
Table 1 gives the automatic scores for each
of participating runs and four online systems.
OS1 usually has the highest overall score (except
BLEU), it also has the highest scores for ?regula-
tions? (more formal texts), P1 scores are better for
the news documents.
14 assessors were recruited for evaluation (par-
ticipating team members and volunteers); the to-
tal volume of evaluation is 10,920 pairwise sen-
tence comparisons. Table 2 presents the rankings
of the participating systems using averaged ranks
from the human evaluation. There is no statisti-
cally significant difference (using Welch?s t-test at
p ? 0.05) in the overall ranks within the follow-
ing groups: (OS1, OS3, P1) < (OS2, OS4) < P5
< (P2, P4). OS3 (mostly RBMT) belongs to the
troika of leaders in human evaluation contrary to
the results of its automatic scores (Table 1). Sim-
ilarly, P5 is consistently ranked higher than P2 by
the assessors, while the automatic scores suggest
the opposite. This observation confirms the well-
known fact that the automatic scores underesti-
mate RBMT systems, e.g., (B?char et al, 2012).
To investigate applicability of the automatic
measures to the English-Russian language direc-
tion, we computed Spearman?s ? correlation be-
tween the ranks given by the evaluators and by
the respective measures. Because of the amount
of variation for each measure on the sentence
level, robust estimates, such as the median and
the trimmed mean, are more informative than
the mean, since they discard the outliers (Huber,
1996). The results are listed in Table 3. All mea-
sures exhibit reasonable correlation on the corpus
level (330 sentences), but the sentence-level re-
sults are less impressive. While TER and GTM
are known to provide better correlation with post-
editing efforts for English (O?Brien, 2011), free
word order and greater data sparseness on the sen-
tence level makes TER much less reliable for Rus-
sian. METEOR (with its built-in Russian lemma-
tisation) and GTM offer the best correlation with
human judgements.
The lower part of Table 2 also reports the results
of simulated dynamic ranking (using the NIST
rankings as the initial order for the sort operation).
It resulted in a slightly different final ranking of
the systems since we did not account for ties and
?averaged ranks?. However, the ranking is prac-
tically the same up to the statistically significant
rank differences in reference ranking (see above).
The advantage is that it requires a significantly
lower number of pairwise comparisons. Insertion
sort yielded 5,131 comparisons (15.5 per sentence;
56% of exhaustive comparisons for 330 sentences
and 8 systems); binary insertion sort yielded 4,327
comparisons (13.1 per sentence; 47% of exhaus-
tive comparisons).
Out of the original set of 330 sentences for
human evaluation, 60 sentences were evaluated
by two annotators (which resulted in 60*28=1680
pairwise comparisons), so we were able to calcu-
late the standard Kohen?s ? and Krippendorff?s ?
scores (Artstein and Poesio, 2008). The results of
inter-annotator agreement are: percentage agree-
ment 0.56, ? = 0.34, ? = 0.48, which is simi-

Table 3: Correlation to human judgements
lar to sentence ranking reported in other evaluation
campaigns (Callison-Burch et al, 2012; Callison-
Burch et al, 2011). It was interesting to see the
agreement results distinguishing the top three sys-
tems against the rest, i.e. by ignoring the assess-
ments for the pairs within each group, ? = 0.53,
which indicates that the judges agree on the dif-
ference in quality between the top three systems
and the rest. On the other hand, the agreement re-
sults within the top three systems are low: ? =
0.23, ? = 0.33, which is again in line with the re-
sults for similar evaluations between closely per-
forming systems (Callison-Burch et al, 2011).
5 Conclusions and future plans
This was the first attempt at making proper
quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the
English?Russian MT systems. In the future edi-
tions, we will be aiming at developing a new
test corpus with a wider genre palette. We
will probably complement the campaign with
Russian?English translation direction. We hope
to attract more participants, including interna-
tional ones and plan to prepare a ?light version?
for students and young researchers. We will also
address the problem of tailoring automatic evalu-
ation measures to Russian ? accounting for com-
plex morphology and free word order. To this
end we will re-use human evaluation data gath-
ered within the 2013 campaign. While the cam-
paign was based exclusively on data in one lan-
guage direction, the correlation results for auto-
matic MT quality measures should be applicable
to other languages with free word order and com-
plex morphology.
We have made the corpus comprising the source
sentences, their human translations, translations
by participating MT systems and the human eval-
uation data publicly available.8
