Abstract
We describe a ?How was your day??
(HWYD) Companion whose purpose is to
establish a comforting and supportive rela-
tionship with a user via a conversation on
a variety of work-related topics. The sys-
tem has several fairly novel features aimed
at increasing the naturalness of the interac-
tion: a rapid ?short loop? response primed
by the results of acoustic emotion anal-
ysis, and an ?interruption manager?, en-
abling the user to interrupt lengthy or ap-
parently inappropriate system responses,
prompting a replanning of behaviour on
the part of the system. The ?long loop?
also takes into account the emotional state
of the user, but using more conventional
dialogue management and planning tech-
niques. We describe the architecture and
components of the implemented prototype
HWYD system.
1 Introduction
As the existence of this workshop shows, there is a
good deal of interest in a type of spoken language
dialogue system distinct from the traditional task-
based models used for booking airline tickets and
the like. The purpose of these ?social agent? sys-
tems is to be found in the relationship they can
establish with human users, rather than on the as-
sistance the agent can provide in giving informa-
tion or solving a problem. Designing such agents
provides many significant technical challenges, re-
quiring progress in the integration of linguistic
communication and non-verbal behaviour for af-
fective dialogue (Andre? et al 2004). In this pa-
per, we present the implementation of a Compan-
ion Embodied Conversational Agent (ECA) which
integrates emotion and sentiment detection with
more traditional dialogue components.
2 From Dialogue to Conversation
Most spoken language dialogue systems are ?task-
based?: they aim at getting from the user values for
a fixed number of slots in some template. When
enough values have been found, the filled tem-
plate is sent off to some back-end system so that
the task in question - ordering a pizza, booking a
ticket etc. - can be carried out. However, a so-
cial Companion agent assumes a kind of conver-
sation not necessarily connected to any immediate
task, and which may not follow the conventions
associated with task-driven dialogues, for exam-
ple, the relatively strict turn-taking of task-based
dialogue. In everyday life, many interhuman con-
versations see one of the participants producing
lengthy descriptions of events, without this corre-
sponding to any specific request or overall con-
versational purpose. Our objective was to sup-
port such free conversation, whilst still obtaining
meaningful answers from the agent, in the form of
advice appropriate both to the affective and infor-
mational content of the conversation. In order to
balance the constraints of free conversation with
those of tractability, we have deliberately opted
for a single-domain conversation, in contrast with
both small talk (Bickmore and Cassell, 1999) and
?chatterbot? approaches. Our HWYD domain in-
volves typical events and topics of conversation in
the workplace, ranging from the relatively mun-
dane - meeting colleagues, getting delayed by traf-
fic, project deadlines - to rather more important -
promotions, firings, arguments, office politics - de-
signed to evoke stronger emotions and hence more
affective dialogues.
However, our HWYD Companions retains
some features of a typical task based system, in
that each of these subtopics can be thought of as a
task or information extraction template. Unfilled
slots will drive the dialogue manager to question
the user for possible values. When enough slots
37
are filled, the initiative will be passed to an ?affec-
tive strategy? module, which will generate a longer
response designed to empathise appropriately with
the user over that particular topic.
3 System Overview and Architecture
The HWYD Companion integrates 15 different
software components, covering at least to some
degree all the necessary aspects of multimodal af-
fective input and output: including speech recog-
nition (ASR, using Dragon Naturally Speaking),
emotional speech recognition (AA: the EmoVoice
system (Vogt et al 2008)), turn detection (ATT),
Dialogue Act segmentation and tagging (DAT),
Emotional modelling (EM), Sentiment Analy-
sis (SA) (Moilanen et al 2007), Natural Lan-
guage Understanding (NLU), Dialogue Manage-
ment (DM), user modelling and a knowledge
base (KB/UM), an ?Affective Strategy Module?
(ASM) generating complex system replies, Natu-
ral Language Generation (NLG), Speech Synthe-
sis (TTS), an avatar (ECA), and Multimodal con-
trol of the ECA persona (MFM): gesture and fa-
cial expression, supported by the Haptek anima-
tion toolkit. Clearly the use of Naturally Speaking
imposes on us speaker dependence, since the sys-
tem needs training: in the scenario we have chosen
this is in fact not too unrealistic an assumption, but
this is merely a practical decision - we are not do-
ing research on speech recognition as such in this
project and so want to get as good a recognition
rate as possible.
The software architecture of the prototype re-
lies on the Inamode Framework developed by
Telefnica I+D. Communication between modules
follows a blackboard-like paradigm, in which cen-
tral hubs broadcast any incoming message from
any module to all of the other modules that are
connected to it. Figure 1 below shows the system
architecture, and Figure 2 shows one version of
what is on the screen when the system is running.
4 Emotional Feedback Loops
Recognising and responding appropriately to dif-
ferent emotions is an important aspect of a social
agent. In our HWYD Companion, emotion and
sentiment are used in two ways: firstly, to pro-
vide immediate feedback to a user utterance (given
that there will inevitably be some delay in the re-
sponse from natural language and dialogue pro-
cessing modules) and secondly to inform the more
extended responses given by the system when it
has learned enough about the current sub-topic.
There are two feedback loops: the ?short loop?
(response time < 700 ms) provides an immedi-
ate backchannel, and its main purpose is to main-
tain contact and keep the communication alive and
realistic. This is achieved by matching the non-
verbal response (gesture, facial expression) of the
avatar to the emotional speech parameters detected
by EmoVoice prior to affective fusion (where the
emotion detected from speech and the sentiment
value detected from the corresponding text are
merged: see below), and occasionally including
an appropriate verbal acknowledgement, on a ran-
dom basis to avoid acknowledging all user utter-
ances. The short loop essentially aligns the ECA
response to the user?s attitude, thus showing empa-
thy. (We should also use SA for this, but currently
processing speed is not fast enough).
The ?major loop? (response time < 3000 ms) in-
volves the ECA?s full response to the user utter-
ance in terms of both verbal and non-verbal be-
haviour. There are effectively two sources of sys-
tem output: the dialogue manager engages with
the user to find out what happened during their
work day, and will ask questions, or drop into
clarificatory sub-dialogues, gradually building up
a complex event description along with an assess-
ment of the prevailing emotions of the speaker.
When sufficient information has been gathered,
control is passed to an ?affective strategy module?
which will produce a longer output, typically ad-
vice or warning in response to the user?s recollec-
tion of his daily events.
The system also includes an interruption man-
ager which detects interruption and barge-in by the
user, resulting in the immediate suspension of the
current system utterance, triggering the process-
ing of any content specific to the interrupting ut-
terance, and consequent replanning on the part of
other modules to produce an appropriate response.
Such an interruption is illustrated in Figure 1. The
design of such an interruption manager in a sys-
tem with so many separate modules is quite chal-
lenging, in fact: the system is described further in
Crook et al (2010).
The ECA listens sympathetically to the user?s
account of work difficulties, whilst also reacting to
apparent discrepancies between perceived mood
and the affective content of the recognised events.
In the following example from a real conversation,
38

Figure 2: The HWYD Companion in operation: the central portion of the screen traces the dialogue, whilst the right-hand
one displays which current software module is activated.
39
the user announces a company restructuring, but in
a rather cheerful tone. Notice that some of the En-
glish is a little strange: the generator produces a
mixture of genuinely generated output along with
some canned text.
User: I have just learnt that my department is going to be
merged with the Barcelona one (EMOTION FUSION: POS-
ITIVE ACTIVE)
System: You seem a bit too ecstatic! I?m doubtful that your
workload could be maintained.
Every time the Companion has gathered suffi-
cient information it will try to respond more glob-
ally to the situation at hand. In the following ex-
ample (see also Figure 2), after the user has ex-
pressed different sorts of concerns, the Companion
picks on the latest (positive) information to sum-
marise the few positive elements it picked from the
conversation:
User: yes but one good thing anyway we had a new
coffee machine arrived today (EMOTION FUSION: POSI-
TIVE ACTIVE)
System: it?s always reassuring to hear good news! It?s right
to feel good about such a good situation. I am quite fond of
getting new stuff. I?m happy that your mood improves. It?s
worth remembering you should take time to enjoy the good
things when they happen.
5 Emotional Modelling and Fusion
Two different modules analyse the emotional con-
tent of user utterances: an emotional speech recog-
nition system (EmoVoice (Vogt et al 2008) which
returns information indicating both the arousal and
valence of the acoustic properties of the user?s
speech as negative passive, negative-active, neu-
tral, positive-active or positive-passive, and a text-
based Sentiment Analysis module which operates
on the utterance transcript after its recognition by
the ASR module. The SA module operates in
a compositional way and is able to classify lin-
guistic units of any syntactic type: noun phrases,
clauses, sentences etc. It is also able to assign
a ?strength? of the sentiment expressed. In the
current implementation it simply classifies clauses
as either negative, neutral or positive. These two
emotional inputs are then merged by a fusion pro-
cedure, whose purpose is to provide an aggregate
emotional category to be attached to the event de-
scription template produced by the NLU and DM
module. Essentially, the mechanism for affective
fusion consists in overriding the valence category
of EmoVoice with the one obtained by SA every
time the confidence score attached to EmoVoice
is below a preset value (depending on the com-
peting valence categories). Fusion is currently an
underdeveloped module: for example, detecting
mismatches between speech and language emo-
tion and sentiment values could lead to the recog-
nition of irony, sarcasm etc. (Tepperman et al
2006). Saying an intrinsically negative thing in a
positive and cheerful way, or the other way round,
suggests that the speaker is trying for some special
effect.
6 Natural Language Understanding and
Dialogue Management
The task of the NLU module is to recognise a spe-
cific set of events reported by the user within ut-
terances which can be of significant length (> 50
words) and which can be difficult to parse due to
speech recognition errors. This led us to follow an
Information Extraction (IE) approach to dialogue
analysis (see Jo?nsson et al 2004), using shallow
syntactic and semantic processing to find instan-
tiations of event templates. The NLU component
of the HWYD Companion demonstration system
takes the 1-best output from the speech recogniser
(currently: work in progress will take n-best),
which has already been segmented into dialogue-
act sized utterances (by the DAT module which si-
multaneously segments and labels the recogniser
output: see Figure 1). So, for example, a sequence
like ?It was okay there are not many projects at the
moment so it is very quiet would be segmented
into three separate dialogue acts. The utterances
are then part-of-speech tagged and chunked into
Noun Phrase (NP) and Verb Group (VG) units.
VGs consist of a main verb and any auxiliary verbs
or semantically important adverbs. Both of these
stages are carried out by a Hidden Markov Model
trained on the Penn Treebank, although some cus-
tomisation has been carried out for this applica-
tion: relevant vocabulary added and some proba-
bilities re-estimated to reflect properties of the ap-
plication. NP and VG chunks are then classified
into ?Named Entity? classes, some of which are
the usual person, organisation, time etc. but oth-
ers of which are specific to the scenario, as is tradi-
tional in IE: e.g. salient work events, expressions
of emotion, organisational structure etc. Named
Entity classification, in the absence of domain spe-
cific training data, is carried out via hand-written
pattern matching rules and gazetteers. Each chunk
40
is further annotated with features encoding the
head word, stem form, polarity, agreement fea-
tures, relevant modifiers, etc. for later syntac-
tic and semantic processing. The NPs and VGs
are represented as unification grammar categories
containing information about the internal structure
of the constituents.
The next stage applies unification based syn-
tax rules which combine NP and VG chunks into
larger constituents. These rules are of two types:
most are syntactically motivated and are attempt-
ing to build a parse tree from which main gram-
matical relations (subject, object, etc.) can be
recognised. These have coverage of the main syn-
tactic constructs of English. But within the same
formalism we add domain specific Information
Extraction type patterns, looking out for particular
constellations of entities and events relevant to the
HWYD scenario, for example ?argument at work
between X and Y?, or ?meeting with X about Y?.
Processing is non-deterministic and so sentences
will get many analyses. We use a ?shortest path
through the chart heuristic to select an interpre-
tation. This is far from perfect, and we are cur-
rently working on a separate more motivated dis-
ambiguation module.
The final stage of processing before the Dia-
logue Manager takes over is to perform reference
resolution for pronouns and definite NPs. This
module is based partly on the system described
by Kennedy and Boguraev 1996, with the various
weighting factors based on theirs, but designed so
that the weights can be trained given appropriate
data. Currently we are collecting such data and
the present set of weights are taken from Kennedy
and Boguraev but with additional salience given
to the domain-specific named entity classes. Each
referring NP gives rise to a discourse referent, and
these are grouped into coreference classes based
on grammatical, semantic, and salience properties.
The DMmaintains an information state contain-
ing all objects mentioned during the conversation,
and uses this information to decide whether the
objects referred to in the utterance are salient or
not. The DM also uses type information to inter-
pret elliptical answers to questions (System: ?Who
was at the meeting?? User: ?Nigel.?). After the
user?s utterance has been interpreted in its dia-
logue context and the information state has been
updated, the dialogue manager decides on the ap-
propriate response. If a new object has been intro-
duced by the user, the DM adds a goal to its agenda
to talk about that object. For instance, if a new per-
son is mentioned, the DM will ask questions about
the user?s relation to that person, etc.
For each turn of the dialogue, the DM chooses
which topic to pursue next by considering all the
currently un-satisfied goals on the agenda and
heuristically rating them for importance. The
heuristics employed use factors such as recency in
the dialogue history, general importance, and emo-
tional value associated with the goal. We are cur-
rently exploring the use of reinforcement learning
with a reward function based on the results of SA
on the users input to choose goals in a more natural
way. The DM also has the option of invoking the
ASM (described below) to generate an appropri-
ate answer, in the cases where the user says some-
thing highly emotive. Again, this is a decision that
could involve reinforcement learning, and we are
exploring this in our current work.
The joint operation of the NLU and the DM
hence supports a kind of IE or task-specific
template-filling: the content of the user?s utter-
ances, prompted by questions from the DM, pro-
vides the information necessary to fill a template
to the point where the ASM can take over. The
number of templates for domain events is signifi-
cantly higher than in traditional IE or task-based
dialogue systems, however, since the HWYD
Companion currently instantiates more than 30
templates, and will eventually cover around 50.
7 Affective Dialogue Strategies
Once the NLU and DM have a sufficiently in-
stantiated template, which also records emotional
value, it is passed to the ASM. This controls the
generation of longer ECA narrative replies which
aim at influencing the user by providing advice or
reassurance. Our overall framework for influence
is inspired by the work of Bremond 1973. The
narrative is constituted by a set of argumentative
statements which can be based on emotional op-
erators (e.g. show-empathy) or specific commu-
nicative operators. The ASM is based on a Hier-
archical Task Network (HTN) planner (Nau et al
2004), which works through recursive decompo-
sition of a high level task into sub-tasks until we
reach a plan of sub-tasks that can be directly ex-
ecuted. The operators constituting the plan gen-
erated by the HTN implement Bremond?s the-
ory of influence by emphasising the determinants
41
of the event reported by the user. For instance,
various operators can emphasise or play down
the event consequences (emphasise-outcome-
importance, emphasise-outcome-justification,
emphasise-outcome-warning) or comment on
additional factors that may affect the course
of events (commend-enabler, reassure-helper).
The planner uses a set of 25 operators, each of
which can be in addition instantiated to incorpo-
rate specific elements of the event. Overall this
supports the generation of hundreds of signifi-
cantly different influencing strategies.
8 Results and Conclusions
We have described an initial, fully-implemented
prototype of a Companion ECA supporting free
conversation, including affective aspects, over a
variety of everyday work-related topics. The sys-
tem has been demonstrated extensively outside of
its development group and was regularly able to
sustain consistent dialogues with an average du-
ration exceeding 20 minutes. The Companion
ECA recently won the best demonstration prize
at AAMAS 2010,the 9th International Conference
on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems,
Toronto, which is some subjective indication at
least that its behaviour is of some interest outside
of the project which developed it.
However, we have not yet systematically evalu-
ated the ECA, although this task has begun (Webb
et al 2010). The question of evaluation for sys-
tems like this is in fact a rather difficult one, since
unlike task-based systems there is no simple mea-
sure of success. In our current work we aim to
conduct extensive trials with real users and via
interview and questionnaires to get some useful
measure of how natural and ?companionable? the
system is perceived to be.
In other current work we are, as mentioned
above, experimenting with reinforcement learning
where the reward function is based on the emo-
tion and sentiment detected in the user?s input. We
are collecting data via Amazon?s Mechanical Turk
and hope to be able to show how the ECA can de-
velop different ?personalities? depending on how
this reward function is defined. For example, we
could imagine using simulated dialogues to pro-
duce a Companion that was relentlessly cheerful,
producing positive outputs whatever the input. Al-
ternatively, we could produce a ?mirror? Compan-
ion which simply reflected the mood of the user.
We could even produce a ?misery loves company?
Companion which, instead of trying to cheer the
user up when recognising negative sentiment or
emotion, could reply in an equally negative man-
ner.
