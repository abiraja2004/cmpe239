In the  present  paper  we prov ide  a repor t  
on a jo in t  approach  to the  computat iona l

surpr i s ing ly ,  p resumably  or  p robab ly )  and  
focuss ing  adverb ia l s  ( such  as on l~ or  a__ E 
leas t ,  inc lud ing  negat ion  (not )  and  some 
other  adverb ia l  express ions ,  such  as  fo r  
examE_ ~ or  in ter  a l ia )  w i th in  a sys tem of

Th is  approach  i s  based  on a jo in t  
theoret i ca l  account  o f  the  express ions  in

the  pr imary  case ,  the  express ions  in 
quest ion  occupy ,  in  the  under ly ing  top ic -

o f  the  word ,  how the  new in fo rmat ion  o f  a

The  present  paper  p rov ides  a repor t  on the

The  presence  o f  CA express ions  in natura l -

In the  present  paper  we propose  to  t reat  
CA-express ions  on a jo in t  syntact i co -

f rom the  v iewpo in t  o f  the  synthes i s  and  
ana lys i s  o f  sentences :  essent ia l l y ,  we argue  
that  the  scope  o f  CA express ions  extends  
pr imar i l y  over  the  focus ,  or  the  new

express ions  a re  usua l ly  moved on the  sur face

supposed  to be open-ended,  bat  the  major i ty

The  major  cha l lenge  o f  TIBAQ cons is ts  in  
remov ing  the  necess i ty  fo r  the  user  " to  cope

2 .2  Theoret i ca l  background 
The l ingu is t i c - theoret i ca l  background of  
TIBAQ is  p rov ided  by the  Funct iona l  
Generat ive  Descr ip t ion  (FGD) as e laborated  
by the  l ingu is t i c  team of the  Facu l ty  of  
Mathemat ics  and Phys ics  of  Char les  
Un ivers i ty  in P rague  (c f .  Sga l l  et  a l .  1969; 
Ha j i cova  and Sga l l  1980; Sga l I  et  a l .  in 
p ress ) .  FGD can be character i zed  as fo l lows :  
( i )  FGD is  a mul t i l eve l  ( s t ra t i f i ca t iona l )  
sys tem of  exp l i c i t  descr ip t ion  of  language,  
cons is t ing  of  a generat ive  component  and of  
severa l  leve ls  o f  descr ip t ion ,  wh ich  are  
ordered  f rom mean ing  to sound and re la ted  by 
a complex  in terp lay  of  cases  of  homonymy 
(ambigu i ty}  and synonymy on the  bas is  of  the  
asyrm~etr ie  dua l i sm between fo rm and funct ion .  
( i i )  The concept ion  of  l ingu is t i c  mean ing  
in FGD is  nar row ( l i te ra l  mean ing ;  c f .  Sga l l  
1978 and 1983) ,  p rov id ing  a genera l  
(un iversa l )  bas i s  fo r  di f fe rent  
app l i ca t ions .  In FGD, on ly  those  
d i s t inc t ions  are  taken  in to  account  wh ich  
are  supposed  to be d i rec t ly  s t ruc tured  by 
the  sys tem o f  natura l  language (c f .  de 
Saussure '  s and H je lms lev '  s " fo rm of  
content" ) ,  and they  are  kept  apar t  f rom the  
d i s t inc t ions  of  the  domain  of  the  
ext ra l ingu is t i c ,  cogn i t ive  {onto log ica l )  
content .  
( i i i )  \]'lie concept ion  o f  mean ing  in FGD 
invo lves  a l so  cer ta in  pragma t ic 
d i s t inc t ions .  Most  impor tant  o f  them is  the  
top ic - focus  ar i cu la t ion  (TFA) of  a sentence ,  
wh ich  inc ludes  the  par t i t ion ing  of  a 
sentence  in to  top ic  (convey ing  the  
o ld /g iven/sa l ient /p res .upposed/contextua l ly  
bound in fo rmat ion)  and focus  (convey ing  the  
new/contextua l ly  non-bound in fo rmat ion) ,  and 
the  deep word-order  of  a sentence ,  wh ich  is  
fo rmal  ly accountab le  fo r  by the  le f t - to  
r ight  o rder ing  of  the  nodes  of  the  
under ly ing  dependency  t ree .  TFA is  connected  
w i th  the  organ izat ion  of  human memory ,  or  
w i th  the  s tock  of  knowledge shared  by the  
speaker  and the  hearer  at  a g iven  po in t  o f  
d i scourse  ( the  s tock  is  supposed  to be 
chang ing  even  dur ing  a s ing le  d i scourse ,  c f .  
Ha j i cova  and Vrbova  1982) .  
We assume that  by means  of  the  deep word-  
o rder  of  a sentence  ( i .e .  w i thout  taak ing  
recourse  to sa lva  ver i ta te  paraphras ing  or  
to such  dev ices  as prenex  quant i f ie rs )  i t  i s  
poss ib le  to d i rec t ly  descr ibe  the  scop ing  
proper t ies  o f  natura l - language quant i  f i e rs  
{such  as many_) as we l l  as of  CA express ions :  
genera l  ly ,  the  express ions  s tand ing  in the  
under ly ing  representat ion  of  a sentence  to 
the  le f t  exh ib i t  w ide  scope  over  the  
express ions  s tand ing  to the  r ight .  
3. Under ly ing  Proper t ies  of  CA Express ions  
3.1 The unmarked  case .  
We argue  that  in the  unmarked  case ,  CA 
express ions  (wh ich  can be v iewed as 
spec i fy ing ,  in a broad  sense  of  the  word ,  
how the  in fo rmat ion  conveyed by the  focus  
ho lds  - e .g .  i t  surpr i s ing ly  ho lds ,  i t  
p robab ly  ho lds ,  i t  does  not  ho ld ,  i t  fo r  
exampLLel e ho lds )  occupy  the  focus - in i t ia l  
pos i t ion ,  extend ing  the i r  scope  over  the  
res t  o f  the  focus  of  the  sentence  ( th i s  
" res t  of  the  focus"  may cons is t  of  
syntact i ca l ly  d i f fe rent  e lements ,  e .g .  i t  
may but  need not  conta in  the  verb ,  i t  may 
conta in  one or  more  complementat ions ,  e tc .  ; 
fo r  example ,  i f  there  are  four  e lements  in a 
sentence  ( the  verb  and three  
complementat ions) ,  they  can be ar ranged in to  
15 d i f fe rent  d i s t r ibut ions  of  e lements  in 
the  top ic  and the  focus  of  the  sentence) .  
Our bas ic  c la im can be i l lus t ra ted  by the  
sur face  sentence  1 as der ived  f rom the  
s impl i f ied  under ly ing  representat ion  la ,  
where  the  s lash  ( / )  i nd icates  the  top ic -  
focus  boundary  of  the  sentence  and the  ar row 
ind icates  the  scope  of  the  CA express ion  in 
quest ion  (p~_~)  .
