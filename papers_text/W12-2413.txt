Abstract
The acquisition of semantic resources and re-
lations is an important task for several appli-
cations, such as query expansion, information
retrieval and extraction, machine translation.
However, their validity should also be com-
puted and indicated, especially for automatic
systems and applications. We exploit the com-
positionality based methods for the acquisi-
tion of synonymy relations and of indicators
of these synonyms. We then apply pager-
ank-derived algorithm to the obtained seman-
tic graph in order to filter out the acquired syn-
onyms. Evaluation performed with two inde-
pendent experts indicates that the quality of
synonyms is systematically improved by 10 to
15% after their filtering.
1 Introduction
Natural languages have extremely rich means to ex-
press or to hide semantic relations: these can be
more or less explicit. Nevertheless, the semantic
relations are important to various NLP tasks within
general or specialized languages (i.e., query expan-
sions, information retrieval and extraction, text min-
ing or machine translation) and their deciphering
must be tackled by automatic approaches. We fo-
cus in this work on synonymy relations. Thus, it
is important to be able to decide whether two terms
(i.e., anabolism and acetone anabolism, acetone an-
abolism and acetone biosynthesis, replication of mi-
tochondrial DNA and mtDNA replication) convey
the same, close or different meanings. According to
the ability of an automatic system to decipher such
relations, the answers of the system will be more or
less exhaustive. Several solutions may be exploited
when deciphering the synonymy relations:
1. Exploitation of the existing resources in which
the synonyms are already encoded. However,
in the biomedical domain, such resources are
not well described. If the morphological de-
scription is the most complete (NLM, 2007;
Schulz et al, 1999; Zweigenbaum et al, 2003),
little or no freely available synonym resources
can be found, while the existing terminologies
often lack the synonyms.
2. Exploitation and adaptation of the existing
methods (Grefenstette, 1994; Hamon et al,
1998; Jacquemin et al, 1997; Shimizu et al,
2008; Wang and Hirst, 2011).
3. Proposition of new methods specifically
adapted to the processed data.
Due to the lack of resources, we propose to ex-
ploit the solutions 2 and 3. In either of these situ-
ations, the question arises about the robustness and
the validity of the acquired relations. For instance,
(Hamon and Grabar, 2008) face two problems: (1)
contextual character of synonymy relations (Cruse,
1986), i.e., two words are considered as synonyms
if they can occur within the same context, which
makes this relation more or less broad depending on
the usage; (2) ability of automatic tools to detect and
characterize these relations, i.e., two words taken out
of their context can convey different relations than
the one expected. Our objective is to assess the relia-
bility of synonymy resources. We propose to weight
and to filter the synonym relations with the pager-
ank-derived algorithm (Brin and Page, 1998). When

processing textual data, this algorithm has been pre-
viously applied in different contexts such as seman-
tic disambiguation (Mihalcea et al, 2004; Sinha and
Mihalcea, 2007; Agirre and Soroa, 2009), summa-
rization (Fernandez et al, 2009) and, more recently,
for the identification of synonyms (Sinha and Mi-
halcea, 2011). This last work takes into account the
usage of a given word in corpora and its known syn-
onyms from lexical resources. Other related works
propose also the exploitation of the random walk al-
gorithm for the detection of semantic relatedness of
words (Gaume, 2006; Hughes and Ramage, 2007)
and of documents (Hassan et al, 2007). Our work
is different from the previous work in several ways:
(1) the acquisition of synonymy is done on resources
provided by a specialized domain; (2) the pager-
ank algorithm is exploited for the filtering of seman-
tic relations generated with linguistically-based ap-
proaches; (3) the pagerank algorithm is adapted to
the small size of the processed data.
In the following of this paper, we present first the
material (section 2), then the method we propose
(section 3). We then describe the experiments per-
formed and the results (section 4), as well as their
evaluation and discussion (section 5). Finally, we
conclude and indicate some perspectives (section 6).
2 Material
We use the Gene Ontology (GO) as the original re-
source from which synonym lexicon (or elementary
synonym relations) are induced. The goal of the GO
is to produce a structured vocabulary for describing
the roles of genes and their products in any organ-
ism. GO terms are structured with four types of re-
lations: subsumption is-a, meronymy part-of,
synonymy and regulates. The version used in
the current work is issued from the UMLS 2011AA.
It provides 54,453 concepts and their 94,161 terms.
The generated pairs of terms have 119,430 is-a
and 101,254 synonymy relations.
3 Methods
Our method has several steps: preprocessing of GO
terms (section 3.1), induction of elementary syn-
onyms (section 3.2) and their characterization with
lexical and linguistic indicators (section 3.3), anal-
ysis of the synonymy graph, its weighting thanks to
the pagerank algorithm and its filtering (section 3.4).
We also perform an evaluation of the generated and
filtered synonymy relations (section 3.5).
In the following, we call original synonyms those
synonyms which are provided by GO, and we call
elementary synonyms those synonyms which are in-
duced by the compositionality based approach.
3.1 Preprocessing the GO terms: Ogmios NLP
platform
The aim of terminology preprocessing step is to
provide syntactic analysis of terms for computing
their syntactic dependency relations. We use the
Ogmios platform1 and perform: segmentation into
words and sentences; POS-tagging and lemmatiza-
tion (Tsuruoka et al, 2005); and syntactic analysis2.
Syntactic dependencies between term components
are computed according to assigned POS tags and
shallow parsing rules. Each term is considered as
a syntactic binary tree composed of two elements:
head component and expansion component. For in-
stance, lipid is the head component of the two terms
analyzed on figure 1.
3.2 Compositionality based induction of
synonyms
GO terms present compositional structure (Verspoor
et al, 2003; Mungall, 2004; Ogren et al, 2005). In
the example below (concept GO:0009073) the com-
positionality can be observed through the substitu-
tion of one of the components (underlined):
aromatic amino acid family biosynthesis
aromatic amino acid family anabolism
aromatic amino acid family formation
aromatic amino acid family synthesis
We propose to exploit the compositionality for in-
duction of synonym resources (i.e., biosynthesis, an-
abolism, formation, synthesis in the given example).

While the cited works are based on the string match-
ing, our approach exploits their syntactic analysis,
which makes it independent on their surface graphi-
cal form (like examples on figure 1).
Compositionality assumes that the meaning of a
complex expression is fully determined by its syn-
tactic structure, the meaning of its parts and the com-
position function (Partee, 1984). This assumption is
very often true in specialized langages, which are
known to be compositional. On the basis of syntac-
tically analysed terms, we apply a set of composi-
tional rules: if the meaningM of two complex terms
A rel B and A? rel B, where A is its head and B its
expansion components, is given as following:
M(A rel B) = f(M(A),M(B),M(rel))
M(A? rel B) = f(M(A?),M(B),M(rel))
for a given composition function f , if A rel B and
A? rel B are complex synonym terms and if B com-
ponents are identical (such as acetone within ace-
tone catabolism and acetone breakdown), then the
synonymy relation between components A and A?
{catabolism, breakdown} can be induced. The mod-
ification is also accepted on expansion component
B: from terms replication of mitochondrial DNA
and mtDNA replication (fig. 1), we can induce syn-
onymy between mitochondrial DNA and mtDNA.
Finally, the modification is also accepted for both
components A rel B and A? rel B?, such as in
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide catabolism and
NAD breakdown, where one pair, i.e. {catabolism,
breakdown}, can be known from previously pro-
cessed synonyms and allow to induce the new
pair {nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, NAD}. It
should noticed that rel depends on the original re-
lations: if the original terms are synonyms then the
elementary terms are also synonyms, if the original
terms are hierarchically related then the elementary
terms are also hierarchically related, etc.
3.3 Lexically-based profiling of the induced
elementary synonyms
In order to test and improve the quality of the in-
duced synonymy relations, we confront these syn-
onyms with approaches which allow to acquire the
hyperonymy relations. All these resources are endo-
geneously acquired from the same terminology GO:
? Each induced pair of synonyms is controlled
for the lexical inclusion (Kleiber and Tamba,
1990; Bodenreider et al, 2001). If the test is
positive, like in the pair {DNA binding, bind-
ing} this would suggest that this pair may con-
vey a hierarchical relation. Indeed, it has been
observed that lexical subsumption marks often
a hierarchical subsumption. Thus, in the pair
{DNA binding, binding}, binding is the hierar-
chical parent of DNA binding, while DNA bind-
ing has a more specific meaning than binding.
One can assume that the cooccurrence of syn-
onymy with the lexical subsumption makes the
synonymy less reliable;
? The same compositional method, as described
in the previous section, is applied to original
GO term pairs related through is-a relations.
In this way, we can also infer is-a elemen-
tary relations. Thus, if a pair of induced syn-
onyms is also induced through is-a relations,
i.e. {binding, DNA binding}, this also makes
the synonymy relations less reliable.
In summary, an induced synonymy relation is con-
sidered to be less reliable when it cooccurs with
a lexical inclusion or with is-a relation. For in-
stance, several edges from figure 2 present the cooc-
currence of synonymy relations with the is-a rela-
tions (such as, {holding, retention}, {retention, stor-
age} or {retention, sequestering}).
3.4 Pagerank-derived filtering of the induced
elementary synonyms
The induced semantic relations can be represented
as graphs where the nodes correspond to words and
the edges to one or more relations between given two
words. An example of what it can look like can be
seen on figure 2: the induced synonymy relations
may indeed cooccur with non-synonymy relations,
like the hierarchical relations is-a. We propose to
use a pagerank approach (Brin and Page, 1998) in
order to separate a given graph of synonym relations
into subsets (or groups) within which all the words
are considered as synonyms with each other but not
with any other word outside their subset. In order
not to influence the results by the varying size of
the graphs, we exploit a non-normalized version of
pagerank (Engstro?m, 2011). Thus, given the usual

normalized version P (1)Si of pagerank:
Definition 1 P (1)S for system S is defined as the
eigenvector with eigenvalue one to the matrix
M = c(A+ gvT )T + (1? c)v1T
where g is a n ? 1 vector with zeros for nodes with
outgoing nodes and 1 for all dangling nodes, 0 <
c < 1, A is the linkmatrix with sum of every row
equal to one, v is a non-negative weightvector with
sum one.
As we mentioned, with the processed data we
have to use the non-normalized version of pagerank:
Definition 2 P (2)S for system S is defined as:
P (2)S =
P (1)S ||V ||1
d
,with d = 1?
?
cATP (1)S
where V is the part of a global weightvector corre-
sponding to the system S. We let V be the one vector
such that all words are weighted equally.
Looking at the example from figure 2, we start
from any node and then randomly either stop by a
probability c or choose (possibly weighted by edge-
weights) a new node by the probability 1 ? c from
any of those linked to the chosen node. The page-
rank of a node can then be seen as the sum of the
probabilities of all paths to the node in question
(starting in every node once including itself).
Usually A is a two-dimensional matrix in which
the sum of every row is equal to one and all non-
zero elements are equal between them. In order to
use different types of relations and different weights
on these relations we calculate cA. Given B, where
B contains the weights of different edges and their
type, we calculate A as:
Ai,j = (Bi,j,SY N/(Bi,j,OTHER + 1))/ni
where ni is the total number of edges connected to
node i. We treat all relations as symmetric relations
for the filtering algorithm when creating B. While
some relations aren?t symmetric it seems reasonable
to assume they affect the likelihood of synonyms in
both directions. We also do not distinguish non-
synonym relations among them. However, we try
a few variations on how to weight A such as assign-
ing different weights to synonym and non-synonym
relations or using a logarithmic scale to decrease the
effect of very different weights in B.
Further to the weighting, the rows of A do not
necessarily sum to one. We propose then not to
choose a specific value for c, but to threshold the
sum of every row in cA to 0.95. This means that for
most of the rows we set crow = 1/
?
Arow ? 0.95,
but for rows with a low sum we don?t increase the
strength of the links but rather keep them as they
are (crow = 1). Choosing the threshold can be
seen as choosing c in the ordinary pagerank formu-
lation. A low threshold means that only the immedi-
ate surrounding of a node may impact its pagerank,
while a high threshold means that distant nodes may
also have an impact. Higher threshold is also use-
ful to separate the pagerank of nodes and to make
slower the convergence when calculating the pager-
ank. When the sum of all rows is less than one and
all non-zero elements are positive we can guarantee
that the pagerank algorithm converges (Bryan and
Leise, 2006). We also use the Power Method modi-
fied for the non-normalized version of pagerank (En-
gstro?m, 2011). On the basis of these elements, we
apply the following algorithm for segmenting the
graph into groups of nodes:
1. Calculate weighted linkmatrix;
2. Calculate pagerank from uniform weightvector
vi;
112
3. Select the node with the highest pagerank;
4. Calculate pagerank from non-uniform
weightvector (zero vector with a single 1
for the selected node);
5. Nodes with P (2) > cutoff are selected as syn-
onyms with selected node and each other;
6. Remove the found synonym nodes from the
graph;
7. If the graph is non empty, restart from step 1;
8. Otherwise end: words belonging to the same
group are considered as synonyms.
We present the application of the algorithm on
the example from figure 2 using the cutoff =
1.5. We start by calculating the weights on the
links (weighted linkmatrix). For instance, given
the relation from storage to retention we have:
Ai,j = (Bi,j,SY N/(Bi,j,OTHER + 1))/ni =
(1/(2 + 1))/3 = 1/9. After computing the
weights for all the relations and thresholding the
sum of rows to 0.95, when the sum of weights
out of a node is larger than 0.95, we obtain fig-
ure 3. This gives the pagerank from uniform vec-
tor [4.8590, 7.7182, 16.4029, 16.1573, 15.4152], in
which we select the node storage with the highest
pagerank. Pagerank from non-uniform weightvec-
tor is then [0.5490, 1.0970, 4.7875, 4.0467, 3.9079],
in which we select the nodes with rank larger than
cutoff = 1.5 (storage, sequestration, sequestering)
as synonyms. After removing these nodes, we re-
calculate the weight matrix and repeate the algo-
rithm: the two remaining nodes are found to belong
to the same group. We then terminate the algorithm.
3.5 Evaluation protocol
The evaluation is performed against the manually
validated synonymy relations. This validation has
been done by two independent experts with the
background in biology. They were asked to vali-
date the induced synonyms acquired as the step 3.2
of the method. The inter-expert Cohen?s kappa is
0.75. On the basis of this evaluation, we compute
the precision: percentage of relations which allow to
correctly group terms within the connected compo-
nents and the groups. We compute two kinds of pre-
cision (Sebastiani, 2002): micro-precision which is
the classical conception of this measure obtained at

also after their filtering with the pagerank-derived
algorithm. This last evaluation leads to a better ob-
servation of the efficiency of the pagerank algorithm.
4 Experiments and Results
The GO terms have been fully processed with the
NLP tools (POS-tagging and syntactic analysis) in
order to prepare the next step, during which the ele-
mentary relations and the indicators are acquired.
4.1 Application of the lexical NLP methods
We applied the NLP method to the GO terms.
The application of the compositionality approach to
original synonymy and hierarchical relations gen-
erated 3,707 and 10,068 elementary relations, syn-
onymous and hierarchical respectivelly. Depend-
ing on the syntactic structure of the original terms,
the synonymy relations are induced between simple
or complex terms, but also between their abbrevi-
ated and full forms, between the morpho-syntactic
variants, etc. Very few of these synonyms exist
within GO or within the WordNet resource (Fell-
baum, 1998). We also detected 1,608 lexical in-
clusions. The lexical inclusions and the is-a re-
lations are preserved only if they cooccur with in-
113
duced synonymy relations. All these relations are
then grouped into connected components (figure 2):
the synonymy relations correspond to edges, term
components correspond to nodes, while the infor-
mation on is-a relations and on lexical inclusions
appears as reliability indicators of the synonymy
edges. A total of 2,017 connected components are
generated. The biggest connected component con-
tains 140 nodes and 183 edges. At this step, the con-
nected components are evaluated against the refer-
ence data: we compute the precision.
4.2 Filtering of the induced synonyms with the
pagerank-derived algorithm
We the apply the pagerank-derived algorithm to the
induced synonyms, but also to the combinations of
these synonyms with is-a relations and/or with
lexical inclusions. The objective is then to filter the
induced synonyms and to improve their reliability.
We perform seven experiments, in which the syn-
onymy and the indicators may receive the same im-
portance or may be weighted:
1. syn: only the elementary synonymy relations
are considered;
2. syn-isa: combination of synonymy and hierar-
chical is-a relations;
3. syn-incl: combination of synonymy relations
with lexical inclusions;
4. syn-isa-incl: combination of synonymy and hi-
erarchical relations with lexical inclusions;
5. syn-isa(535): combination of synonymy rela-
tions with lexical inclusions, using different
weights: (Ai,j = 5Bi,j,SY N/(3Bi,j,OTHER +
5))/ni;
6. syn-isa(353): combination of synonymy rela-
tions with lexical inclusions, using different
weights: (Ai,j = 3Bi,j,SY N/(5Bi,j,OTHER +
3))/ni.
7. syn-isa(log): combination of synonymy rela-
tions with lexical inclusions, using logarithmic
weights: (Ai,j = ((1/ln(2))ln(Bi,j,SY N +
1)/((1/ln(2))ln(Bi,j,OTHER + 2)))/ni.
According to the method described in section 3.4,
the connected components of the synonymy rela-
tions obtained in section 3.2 are segmented again
into one or more smaller and more homogeneous
groups. The number of groups varies between 745
and 1,798 across the experiments. Moreover, around
25% of the synonymy relations may be removed by
pagerank. These connected components and groups
can also be evaluated against the reference data and
we can compute the precision.
5 Evaluation and Discussion
The evaluation has been done by two indepen-
dent experts, with the Cohen?s kappa inter-expert
agreement 0.75. We exploit the reference data of
the two experts separately (we distinguish expert1
and expert2) and in common. We also distinguish
macro-precision and micro-precision. Finally, the
precision is first evaluated after the induction step
with the NLP methods, and then after the process-
ing of the acquired synonymy relations through the
pagerank-derived algorithm and their filtering.
For the weighting of the non-synonymy and syn-
onymy relations, we tested and applied several coef-
ficients: 5, 3 and 5 in experiment 5 (syn-isa535); 3,
5 and 3 in experiment 6 (syn-isa353), etc. Different
weights have been tested ranging from 1 to 7, as well
as the log variations. On the whole, these variations
have no significant impact on the results. But then, it
is very important to respect the dependence among
these coefficients and not to set them randomly.
The filtering of the synonymy relations has to con-
trol two factors: (1) the first is related to the fact
that the removed relations are to be true negatives
and that among them there should be no or a small
number of correct relations; while (2) the second is
related to the fact that the remaining relations are to
be true positives and that among them there should
be no or a small number of wrong relations.

Figure 5: Evaluation of the results in terms of micro-precision miP and of macro-precision maP for connected
components and for groups of terms (performed according to the reference data provided by two experts)
On figure 4, we present the impact of the cut-
off values on the selection and filtering of the syn-
onyms. Like with other parameters, we have tested
several values between 0.5 and 4. This figure illus-
trates the distribution of the correctly removed rela-
tions. The cutoff values have an important impact
on the results: we can observe that the optimal cut-
off values are set between 1.5 and 2 because they
allow to remove the highest number of the wrong
relations. We have set the cutoff value to 1.5. The
choice of cutoff is an important factor for the defi-
nition of the amount of the links that are to be re-
moved: the higher the cutoff the higher the number
of clusters. On the data processed in this work, the
cutoff value has been defined experimentally thanks
to the observation of the processed data. For the gen-
eralization of this method to new unknown but sim-
ilar linguistic data (new terminology, new langage,
new domain...), the cutoff will be either set in order
to remove a certain predefined number of links or
will be defined from a typical sample of the data.
Contrary to the cutoff values, the choice of thresh-
old doesn?t greatly impact the results, although us-
ing a lower threshold makes it harder to choose a
good cutoff values since the ranking of different
nodes will be closer to each other.
As for the analysis of the precision and of the
relations which are correctly kept within the con-
nected components, let?s observe figure 5. On this
figure, we present the evaluation results performed
within the connected components with induced syn-
onyms (figure 5(a)) and within the groups of filtered
synonyms (figure 5(b)). On the y-axis we indicate
the precision values, and on the x-axis, we indicate
the different experiments performed as mentioned
above: 1 in which only synonyms are exploited, 2
in which synonyms are combined with hierarchical
is-a relations, 3 in which synonyms are combined
with lexical inclusions, etc. Horizontal lines corre-
spond to the precision obtained before the applica-
tion of the pagerank: they remain the same whatever
the experiment. These lines correspond to three ref-
erence data provided by the expert1, the expert2 and
by their common data. As for the points, they indi-
cate the precision obtained further to the pagerank:
it varies according to experiments and experts. On
the basis of figure 5, we can observe that:
? the difference between the expert evaluations is
very low (0.02);
? the pagerank allows to increase the precision
(between 0.10 and 0.15 for micro-precision,
while macro-precision varies by 0.05);
? the consideration of synonymy alone provides
performant results;
? the consideration of is-a relations improves
the results but lexical inclusions decrease them;
? the increased weight of some of the quality in-
dicators has no effect on the evaluation;
? macro-precision is superior to micro-precision
because our data contain mainly small groups,
115
while the few large connected components have
a very low precision;
? there is but a small difference between con-
nected components (figure 5(a)) and groups
(figure 5(b));
? the consideration of is-a relations and of lex-
ical inclusions provides the best precision but
the amount of the remaining synonyms is then
the lowest. As we explained, it is important
to keep the highest number of the correct re-
lations, although when a lot of relations is re-
moved, it is logical to obtain a higher precision.
This means that the combination of is-a re-
lations and of lexical inclusions is not suitable
because it removes too much of synonyms.
In relation with this last observation, is should be
noted that the balance between the removed and the
remaining relations is a subtle parameter.
The obtained results indicate that the pagerank is
indeed useful for the filtering of synonyms, although
the parameters exploited by this algorithm must be
defined accurately. Thus, it appears that synonymy
alone may be sufficient for this filtering. When the
quality indicators are considered, is-a relations are
suitable for this filtering because very often they pro-
pose true hierarchical relations. However, the lex-
ical inclusions have a negative effect of the filter-
ing. We assume this is due to the fact that the lexical
inclusions are ambiguous: they may convey hierar-
chical relations but also equivalence relations (Har-
alambous and Lavagnino, 2011). Indeed, contextu-
ally some terms may be shortened or may be subject
to an elision while their meaning is not impacted.
Currently, the pagerank is limited by the fact that
it is applied to a relatively small set of data while
it is designed to process very large data. Then, it
can be interesting to enrich the model and to be able
to take into account other quality indicators, such as
frequencies, productivity or other semantic relations
proposed within GO (part-of and regulates).
Moreover, we can also give a lesser weight to some
indicators (such as lexical inclusions) with penal-
ties and keep the strong weight for other indicators.
In the current model of the pagerank, we thresh-
old rows to < 0.95. However, we assume that the
algorithm may have problems with very large and
very connected graphs: the pagerank may spread
out in the graph too much and possibly allow the
first words with the highest pagerank to make groups
with only one word. This can be corrected if an addi-
tional calculation is added and when the group con-
tains only one word at step 5.
6 Conclusion and Perspectives
We propose an original approach for inducing syn-
onyms from terminologies and for their filtering.
The methods exploit the NLP methods, composi-
tionality principle and pagerank-derived algorithm.
This work is motivated by the fact that synonymy
is a contextual relation and its validity and univer-
sality are not guaranteed. We assume the seman-
tic cohesiveness of synonymy relations should be
qualified and quantified. The compositionality and
NLP methods allow to acquire endogeneously the
synonymy relations and the quality indicators, while
the pagerank-derived algorithm leads to the filtering
of the acquired synonyms. Its functionning is based
upon the synonymy relations and also upon the ac-
quired indicators (is-a relations and lexical inclu-
sions). It appears that the synonymy relations alone
provide good clues for their filtering. The is-a re-
lations are also fruitful, while the use of the lexical
inclusions appears not to be suitable.
In the future, we plan to add and test other indi-
cators. Other experiments will also be done with the
pagerank approach. For instance, it will be inter-
esting to propose a model which takes into account
that, within a cluster, words may be synonym with
some cluster words but not with all the words of the
cluster. This method can be adapted for the process-
ing of corpora and also applied to terms from other
terminologies. The acquired and filtered synonymy
relations will be exploited within the NLP applica-
tions in order to test the efficiency of these resources
and also the usefulness and efficiency of their filter-
ing. Moreover, the compositionality approach can
be adapted and exploited for the paraphrasing of the
biomedical terms and for the improvement of their
understanding by non expert people.
