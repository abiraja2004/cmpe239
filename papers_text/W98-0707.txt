1 In t roduct ion  
WordNet (Miller, 1995), (Fellbaum, 1998) is 
perhaps the most widely used electronic dic- 
tionary of English and serves as the lexicon 
for a rarity of different NLP applications in- 
cluding Information Retrieval (IR), Word Sense 
Disambignation (WSD), and M~hine Transla~ 
tion (MT). Despite WordNet's large coverage, 
which comprises ome 100,000 concepts lexi- 
cMi~.ed by approySmately 120,000 word forms 
(strings) and is comparable to that of a colle- 
giate dictionary, it contains relatively little figu- 
rative language. WordNet includes a w~mber of 
multi-word strings, such as phrasal verbs, but 
many idiomatic verb phrases Like smell a rat, 
know the ropes, and eat humble pie, are mi~g- 
ing. Idioms and metaphors abound in everyday 
language and are found in texts spanning many 
genres (see, e.g., (Jackendoff, 1997) for a nu- 
merical estlm~te of the frequency of idioms and 
fixed expression). Clearly, a dictionary that in- 
dudes extended senses of words and phrases is 
likely to yield more successful NLP applications. 
On the one hand, no system wants to retrieve 
the string bucket from the idiom kick the bucket. 
On the other hand, MT and WSD efforts need 
to distinguish the sense of ropes in phrases like 
know~learn/teach someone the ropes from the 
sense meaning "strong cords"; selecting the lat- 
ter sense in any of the idiomatic phrases leads 
to failure. An IR query is likely to be interested 
only in the "strong cord" reading. When this 
sense is to be retrieved with the aid of a lexicon 
intended for multiple applications, the figura- 
tive sense must be successfully recognized and 
excluded from a text that may contain instances 
of the string ropes with both meanings. 
In this paper, we consider the possibility of 
extending WordNet o accommodate figurative 
meanings in the English lexicon. While much 
52 
h~.~ been written on figurative language, there 
is no agreement on the boundary between literal 
and non-literal language, see e.g. (Moon, 1986). 
Criteria that are commonly accepted include se- 
mantic non-compositionality and syntactic on- 
straints on internal modification (such as adjec- 
tive and adverb insertion) and movement trans- 
formations. Our purpose here is not to attempt 
a clear delimitation or definition of non-literal 
language, but to examine how extended senses 
of words and phrases from different syntactic 
and lexical categories-or conforming to none of 
the standard categories-are compatible with the 
network structure of a relational exicon like 
WordNet and its particular way of represent- 
ing words and concepts. Our discussion will fo- 
cus on, but not be limited to, idiomatic verb 
phrases. 
2 A s imple  Classif icat ion 
An inspection of idiom dictionary sources uch 
as (Boatner et al, 1975) suggests a three-fold 
distinction among idioms for our purposes. 
3 Const ruct ions  
First, some idiomatic onstructions are simply 
too complex to be integrated into WordNet and 
must be excluded at this point. We have in 
mind constructions of the kind studied by (Fill- 
more et al, 1988) and (Jackendoff, 1997),(Jack- 
endoff, 1997). Examples are the more the mer- 
rier and she can't write a letter, let alne a 
novel These structures comprise discontinu- 
ous constituents and morpheme chunks that 
are governed by special syntactic and seman- 
tic rules. Thus, the X-er the Y-er allows the 
insertion of a wide variety of adjectives. Fill- 
more et al discuss let alne and show that its 
syntactic properties require an amazing amount 
of description of facts absent from the standard

grammar. A full account of these constructions 
goes far beyond the lexical level, and there- 
fore we need to exclude them, at least for now, 
in a database like WordNet that does not in- 
dude much syntax and whose relational seman- 
tics cannot accommoda~ the kind of semantic 
facts observed by Fillmore et al and Jackend- 
off. 
4 Id ioms as a k ind  o f  po lysemy 
By contrast, the second kind of idiomatic struc- 
ture is unprobl~matic for WordNet. Word- 
Net contains not only simple verbs and no-na  
but also more complex verb and noun phrases 
like show the way and academic gown. Strings 
like stepping stone, kick the bucket, hit the bot- 
tle, and come out of the closet therefore corre- 
spond to categories already represented in the 
database, and can be included when they are 
considered as partie, lar manifestations of pol- 
ysemy. Polysemy in WordNet is represented 
by membership of the polysemous string in dif- 
ferent synonym sets; synonym sets (synsets) in 
WordiNet represent concepts that are lexicalized 
by one or more strings (synonyms). In other 
words, the synsets contain different words forms 
with the same meaning, and a word form with 
more than one meaning appea~ in as many dif- 
ferent synsets as it has meanings. 
For example, the string fish occurs as a verb 
in two different synsets, and has thus two dis- 
tinct senses in WordNet. One expresses the con- 
cept "catch, or try to catch, seafood;" the other 
sense is ~seek indirectly," as in the phrases fish 
for compliments and fish for information. Note 
that such a representation does not in fact at- 
tempt to answer the question as to whether or 
not the second sense of fish is indeed an "ex- 
tended" one or not, but simply treats them as 
different meanlngs of the same word form. 
Figurative senses can be seen as homophones 
rather than polysemes in that there is no dis- 
cernible relation between the "literal" and the 
"extended" senses. WordNet does not formally 
distinguish between polysemy and homophony 
but treats these two phenomena of multiple 
meanings alike under the label of polysemy. 
In all cases of polysemy, membership in two 
different synsets entails a different location in 
the semantic network and relatedness to distinct 
concepts for each sense. Thus, the first sense of 
53 
fish is a subordinate of catch and is further re- 
lated to more semantically specified senses (tro- 
ponyms) including flyfish, net fish, trawl, and 
shrimp. The second, arguably extended, sense 
h~_q as its superordinate concept he synset con- 
taining the strings search and look .for. The dif- 
ferent locations in the network of the two senses 
offish, together with the difference in the kinds 
of noun objects they select are the sort of in- 
formation exploited in NLP applications, and 
they will suffice in most cases to distinguish the 
two senses in such cases where the senses are 
homophones rather than polysemes. 
Some phrases consisting of more than one 
word can be treated in a similar manner. For 
example, the idiomatic verb phrases kick the 
bucket, chew the fat, and take a powder can be 
considered as single units. Their constituents 
never occur in an order different from the cited 
one because these idioms are syntactically com- 
pletely frozen. They not tolerate the insertion 
of an adjective or adverb, nor do they undergo 
passivization, clefting, or any movement trans- 
formation that would change the order of the 
individual strings.1 
The system therefore needs only to recognize 
the string that is part of the lexicon. If the 
strings kick, bucket, powder, fat, etc., occur out- 
side of the idiom order, they do not receive the 
idiomatic interpretation a d must be considered 
as carrying different meanings. 
Some compound nouns have extended senses 
as well, such as stepping stone, straight ar- 
row, and square shooter. We classify these as 
instances of non-literal anguage, because the 
head (the rightmost noun) is not the superordi- 
nate concept for the figurative reading: a step- 
ping stone is not a kind of stone; a straight 
arrow is not a type of arrow, and a square 
shooter is not a specific shooter. By contrast, 
nouns like limestone, gravestone, and gemstone, 
and sharpshooter and trapshooter are linked to 
their superordinates senses, one or more senses 
of stone and shooter, respectively; similarly, a 
broad arrow is a subordinate of arrow. Many 
NLP applications using WordNet for determin- 
lOaly the verb changes in that it shows the usual in- 
flectional endings; this should not pose a major problem 
for English idioms where the verb is virtually always the 
first constituent in a Verb Phrase (VP) idiom and can 
thus be easily recognized.

ing discourse coherence, finding malpropisms 
(Hirst and St-Onge, 1998), and word sense dis- 
ambiguation (Voorhees, 1998); (Leacock and 
Chodorow, 1998) identify related word senses 
by means of links such as between super- and 
subordinates. When searching a text, such sys- 
tems could easily recognize (and discard as po- 
tentlaUy related senses) figurative compounds 
such as stepping stone and straight shooter be- 
cause these are not l inked to nouns  correspond- 
tug to their heads. 2 
Moreover, literal and figurative senses are of- 
ten in very different WorclNet files: an arrow 
(and its hyponyms broad arrow and butt shaft) 
are classified as noun.artifacts; while a straight 
arrow is found in the noun.person file. 
Frozen VP idioms and metaphoric noun com- 
pounds can be integrated into the WordNet 
database and distinguished from literally refer- 
ring expressions in many cases. But much of 
what is commonly considered to be figurative 
language presents more serious problems for a 
semantic network like WordNet and applica- 
tions relying on its particular design. The re- 
mainder of this paper will be devoted to a dis- 
cussion of the third category of idioms, which 
includes verb phrases like learn the ropes and 
hide one's light under a bushel. These cannot 
automatically be integrated into WordNet, but 
we offer some proposals for adding them to the 
lexicon. 
5 Some cha l leng ing id ioms for 
WordNet  
The integration into WordNet of many idioms 
that do not fall into one of the categories dis- 
cussed above is problematic for a variety of rea- 
sons. 
6 Formal  p rob lems 
First, there are formal problems. Some idiom 
strings have surface forms that do not conform 
to any of the syntactic categories included in 
WordNet. For example, many idioms must oc- 
cur with a negation: the VP  give a hoot loses 
its (figurative) meaning in the absence of nega- 
tion; the same is true for the VP  hold a candle 
2In this respect, idiomatic ompounds resemble xo- 
eestric compounds like lot~-life and sea~ata, which are 
not kinds of lives or latum, either, nor ate they found in 
the vicinity of these concepts in the semantic net. 
54 
to. The negation must therefore be considered 
part of the idioms. But a verb phrase headed 
by negation is not a constituent recognized in 
WordNet. 
Consider also the string eat one's cake and 
have it, too: here, two verb phrases are adjoined 
and are often followed by an adverb. Moreover, 
the second clause contains a pronoun coreferent 
with the noun in the first clause. Again, such 
a string does not fit in with WordNet's entries. 
Some idioms are entire sentences. Wild horses 
could not make me do that and the cat's got your 
tongue are not compatible with any of Word- 
Net's noun, verb, adjective, or adverb compo- 
nent. WordNet does not contain sentences, and 
at present we see no way of integrating these 
into the lexical database. The problem should 
be addressed in the future, because an NLP sys- 
tem would simply attempt o treat each con- 
stituent in these idioms separately, with unde- 
sirable consequences. 
In some cases, idioms whose syntactic shape 
does not correspond to any of the categories in 
WordNet could be accommodated nevertheless 
when they are synonymous with strings that are 
represented in an existing synset. For example, 
the negation-headed phrase not in a pig's eye 
and the clauses when hell freezes over and when 
the cows come home are all synonymous with 
never, which is included among Word.Net's ad- 
verbs. If such strings are completely frozen, as 
they tend to be, they can be included as syn- 
onymous members of existing WordNet synsets 
and the fact that they do not conform to any of 
WordNet's yntactic ategories can be ignored. 
Such idioms do not pose problems for automatic 
processing because they do not admit of any 
phrase-internal variation or modification. 
Another formal (syntactic) problem pertains 
to the fact that the fixed parts of many VP id- 
ioms are not continuous. For example, a num- 
ber of expressions contain nouns that resem- 
ble inalienable possessions, uch as body parts, 
and a possessive adjective that is bound to the 
subject. Examples are hold one's light under a 
bushel, blow one's stack, and flip one's wig. In 
other idioms with a similar structure, the pos- 
sessive is not bound to the subject but refers 
to another noun (got someone's number). And 
expressions like cook one's goose allow for both 
bound and unbound genitives.

These idioms cannot be treated as single 
strings because the genitive slot can be filled by 
any of the possessive adjectives, or by a noun 
in the case of the unbound genitive. One so- 
lution would be to enter these strings into the 
lexicon with a placeholder, such as a metachar- 
acter, in place of the genitive. This would make 
for a somewhat unfelicitous entry. But a rule 
could be added to a preprocessor for a syntactic 
tagger that allowed the placeholder be substi- 
tuted with either a pronoun from a finite list 
(for the bound cases) or any noun from Word- 
Net (for the unbound cases); the preprocessor 
would then be able to recognize the idiom as 
a unit and match the WordNet entry and the 
actual string. Currently, we do not have a pre- 
processor that is able to recognize discontinuous 
constituents, but given the large number of VP  
idioms and their frequency in the language, the 
development of such a tool seems desirable. 3 
7 What  kinds of concepts axe these? 
In the previous section, we considered idioms 
whose syntactic form does not comply with any 
of the categories N(P), V(P), Adj(P), or Adver- 
bial(P) represented in Word.Net or whose syn- 
tax poses problems for the creation of a neat 
dictionary entry. However, such idioms could 
easily be added to the lexical database when 
they are synonymous with strings that fit into 
WordNet's design and organization. But many 
such syntactically idiosyncratic idiom strings 
raise a second problem having to do with their 
conceptual-semantic rather than their syntactic 
nature. They express concepts that cannot be 
fitted into WordNet's web structure either as 
members of existing synsets or as independent 
concepts, because there are no other lexicalized 
concepts to which they can be linked via any 
of the WordNet relations. In fact, if one exam- 
ines idioms and their glosses in an idiom dictio- 
nary, one quickly realizes that almost all idioms 
express complex concepts that cannot be para- 
phrased by means of any of the standard lexical 
or syntactic categories. Consider such exam- 
plea as fish or cut bait, cook one's/somebody's 
9oose, and drown one's sorrows/troubles. These 
~A related phenomenon is that of phrasal verbs, many 
of which allow particle movemeat. In the cases where 
the verb head and the particle are not contiguous, they 
e~nnot currently be adjoint by the preprocessor and they 
are  therefore not matched to an entry in Word.Net. 
55 
idioms carry a lot of highly specific semantic in- 
formation that would probably get lost if they 
were integrated into WordNet and attached to 
more general concepts. 
The problems for WordNet posed by syntacti- 
cally or semantically idiosyncratic dioms would 
be reduced if these could be broken up, that is, 
if the individual content words in the idioms 
could be treated as referring expressions and be 
assigned meanings that are similar to concepts 
already represented in the lexicon. Some tradi- 
tional dictionaries decompose a number of such 
idioms and attempt o give an interpretations 
to their individual parts. This may seem justi- 
fiable particularly in cases where the idioms are 
syntactically variable, indicating that speakers 
assign meanings to some of their components. 
For example, the American Heritage dictionary 
defines one sense of the noun ice as "extreme un- 
friendliness or reserve." This entry seems mo- 
tivated by the apparent semantic transparency 
of the noun (in contrast o strings like bucket 
in Idck the bucket, which seems to have no ref- 
erent at all, let alne a transparent one). But 
synsets of the kind ice, extreme unfriendliness 
or reserve seem undesirable for a computation- 
ally viable dictionary like WordNet, because ice 
cannot be used freely and compositionally with 
the proposed meanings. This is evident in sen- 
tences like the following: 
(a) I felt/resented his unfriendliness/reserve/*ice. 
(b) His unfriendliness/reserve/*ice melted away. 
(c) Our laughter broke the .unfriendliness/reserve/ 
ice. 
A language generation system (or a learner 
of English) relying on WordNet's lexicon could 
not be blocked from producing the ungrammat- 
ical sentences above, if they are exploiting on 
the close similarity and usage of the members 
of the synset. Moreover, automatic attempts 
at word sense disambiguation that rely on syn- 
tactic taggers could probably not identify the 
correct sense of ice in this phrase, because they 
could not recognize that the noun is a part of 
an idiom if the dictionary entry contains this 
noun in isolation, outside of its idiomatic con- 
text. Only when one entry for ice lists the spe- 
cific environment (break and the definite deter- 
miner) can a program recognize the idiom and 
assign the proper meaning.

Consider a second example. The American 
Heritage Dictionary contains an sense of ropes 
that is glossed as "specialized procedures or 
details." This sense of ropes is the one in 
the expressions know/learn/get/teach theropes. 
To assume a compositional reading here seems 
more justified than in the case of ice, because 
this idiom is more flexible than break the ice 
and can undergo some internal modification 
as well as passivization (he never learnt the 
ropes~he taught Fred the ropes/Pfed was taught 
the ropes). Moreover, ropes co-occurs with more 
verbs than just one. In fact, the verbs for which 
it can serve as an argument are compatible with 
the meaning assigned to ropes by the Ameri- 
can Heritage Dictionary. A word sense disam- 
biguation system that relied on the semantics 
of the contexts of the ambiguous word (such as 
? the verbs a noun co-occurs with), would prob- 
ably choose the correct sense of rope, because 
the contexts of "specialized procedures n or "de- 
tails ~ do not seem to overlap with the contexts 
in which ropes is found with the sense of "strong 
cords." 
Yet despite their shared verb contexts, the 
distribution of ropes is far more narrow than 
that of specialized procedures or details. Again, 
a language generation system or a learner of En- 
glish might overgenerate and produce incompre- 
hensible sentences like I forgot the ropes or Tell 
me the ropes. Therefore, an optimal solution 
might be to enter the idiom as a string but with 
a placeholder instead of the verb; a separate rule 
in the lexicon would list the verbs that are com- 
patible with the idiomatic reading of the string. 
The proposed solution for the idioms Like 
teach/%arn/get the ropes and those that con- 
tain a possessive genitive might suggest a huge 
amount of work. However, a survey of English 
idioms suggests that most are frozen and could 
therefore simply be entered as entire strings, 
without he need for specifying a list of selected 
verbs. 
Another type of VP idiom that does not read- 
ily fit into WordNet is that whose meaning can 
be glossed as be or become Adj. These idioms 
have the form of a VP but express tates: hide 
one's light under a bushel and hold one's tongue 
mean "be modest" and "be quiet, ~ respectively; 
flip one's wig;, blow one's stack/a fuse, and hit 
the roof/ceiling all mean "become angry," and 
56 
get the axe means be fired/dismissed. Simi- 
laxly, the phrase one's heart goes out (to) can 
be glossed by means of the verb .feel and the 
adjective phrase "sorry or sympathetic (for)." 
Such idioms pose a problem for integration into 
WordNet, not because of their form but because 
of the kinds of concepts they express. In Word- 
Net, verbs (including eopular verbs) and adjec- 
tives are strictly separated because they express 
distinct kinds of concepts. This separation is of 
course desirable and even necessary when one 
deals with non-idiomatic language, where the 
meaning of a phrase or sentence is composed of 
the meanings of its individual parts. Copular or 
copula-like verbs like be and .feel combine with a 
large number of adjectives and there is no point 
in entering specific ombinations into a lexicon. 4
While the separation of verbs and the adjec- 
tives they select accounts for the large num- 
ber of possible combinations allowed in the lan- 
guage, it also means that there exist no concepts 
like "feel sorry/sympathetic (for)" or "become 
angry" in WordNet, and idioms like one's heart 
goes out (to} and hit the roof are presently ex- 
cluded from the lexicon. Yet these strings need 
to be added if the lexicon is to serve NLP appli- 
cations of real texts, where idiomatic language is
pervasise. Expressions of the kind listed above 
can simply be added as subordinates of be with- 
out causing a change in the structure of the lex- 
icon. They would stretch the meaning of tro- 
ponymy, the manner elation that organizes the 
verb lexicon, in that it is somewhat off to state 
that "to be angry is to be in some manner." 
However this seems to be the only way to ac- 
commodate such idioms, which express concepts 
of the kind not found in the literal language. 
8 Summary  and  conc lus ions  
We considered the nature of idiomatic expres- 
sions in the light of their potential integration 
into WordNet. Some idioms pose formal, syn- 
tactic problems and express complex concepts 
that are not expressible by mean.q of the stan- 
dard lexical and syntactic ategories, including 
those represented in WordNet. Other idioms 
are formally uaremarkable but express concepts 
4There are some de-adject ival  verbs that  express spe- 
cillc concepts with meanings "be or become Adjective," 
such as pa/e or redden. Id ioms that  express the  same 
concepts as such verbs could be added as synonyms,  but  
these cases are very few.

that cannot easily be connected to any of the 
concepts in the semantic network. Perhaps one 
function of idioms (and one reason for their fre- 
quency and their persistence over time) is to 
provide for the pre-coded lexicalized expression 
of complex concepts and ideas that do not ex- 
ist as units in the language and would have to 
be composed by speakers. Their frequent oc- 
currence in the language seems to show that 
many idioms refer to salient concepts and must 
be considered an important part of the lexicon. 
We have made some proposals for their integra- 
tion into WordNet that should benefit in par- 
ticular the kinds of NLP applications that rely 
on this lexical resource.
