Abstract
Abstractive summarization has been a long-
standing and long-term goal in automatic sum-
marization, because systems that can generate
abstracts demonstrate a deeper understanding
of language and the meaning of documents
than systems that merely extract sentences
from those documents. Genest (2009) showed
that summaries from the top automatic sum-
marizers are judged as comparable to manual
extractive summaries, and both are judged to
be far less responsive than manual abstracts,
As the state of the art approaches the limits
of extractive summarization, it becomes even
more pressing to advance abstractive summa-
rization. However, abstractive summarization
has been sidetracked by questions of what
qualifies as important information, and how do
we find it? The Guided Summarization task
introduced at the Text Analysis Conference
2010 attempts to neutralize both of these prob-
lems by introducing topic categories and lists
of aspects that a responsive summary should
address. This design results in more similar
human models, giving the automatic summa-
rizers a more focused target to pursue, and also
provides detailed diagnostics of summary con-
tent, which can can help build better meaning-
oriented summarization systems.
1 Introduction
What qualifies as important information and how do
we find it? These questions have been leading re-
search in automatic summarization since its begin-
nings, and we are still nowhere near a definitive
answer. Worse, experiments with humans subjects
suggest a definitive answer might not even exist.
With all their near-perfect language understanding
and world knowledge, two human summarizers will
still produce two different summaries of the same
text, simply because they will disagree on what?s
important. Fortunately, usually some of this infor-
mation will overlap. This is represented by the idea
behind the Pyramid evaluation framework (Nenkova
and Passonneau, 2004; Passonneau et al, 2005),
where different levels of the pyramid represent the
proportion of concepts (?Summary Content Units?,
or SCUs) mentioned by 1 to n summarizers in sum-
maries of the same text. Usually, there are very few
SCUs that are mentioned by all summarizers, a few
more that are mentioned by some of them, and the
greatest proportion are the SCUs that are mentioned
by individual summarizers only.
This variance in what should be a ?gold standard?
makes research in automatic summarization meth-
ods particularly difficult. How can we reach a goal
so vague and under-defined? Using term frequency
to determine important concepts in a text has proven
to be very successful, largely because of its simplic-
ity and universal applicability, but statistical meth-
ods can only provide the most basic level of perfor-
mance. On the other hand, there is no real motiva-
tion to use any deeper meaning-oriented text anal-
ysis if we are not even certain what information to
look for in order to produce a responsive summary.
To address these concerns, the Summarization
track at the 2010 Text Analysis Conference1 (TAC)
introduced a new summarization task ? Guided
Summarization ? in which topics are divided into

narrow categories and a list of required aspects is
provided for each category. This serves two pur-
poses: first, it creates a more focused target for au-
tomatic summarizers, neutralizing human variance
and pointing to concrete types of information the
reader requires, and second, it provides a detailed
diagnostic tool to analyze the content of automatic
summaries, which can help build more meaning-
oriented systems. This paper shows how these ob-
jectives were achieved in TAC 2010, looking at the
similarity of human-crafted models, and then using
the category and aspect information to look in depth
at the differences between human and top automatic
summarizers, discovering strengths and weaknesses
of automatic systems and areas for improvement.
2 Topic-specific summarization
The idea that different types of stories might require
different approaches is not new, although the classi-
fication varies from task to task. Topic categories
were present in Document Understanding Confer-
ence2 (DUC) 2001, where topics were divided into:
single-event, single-subject, biographical, multiple
events of same type, and opinion. In their analy-
sis of these results, Nenkova and Louis (2008) find
that summaries of articles in what they call topic-
cohesive categories (single-event, single-subject, bi-
ography) are of higher quality than those in non-
cohesive categories (opinion, multiple event).
In essence, categorizing topics into types is based
on the assumption that stories of the same type fol-
low a specific template and include the same kinds
of facts, and this predictability might be employed
to improve the summarization process, since we at
least know what kinds of information are important
and what to look for. This was shown, among others,
by Bagga (1997), who analyzed source articles used
in the Message Understanding Conference (MUC)
and graphed the distribution of facts in articles on
air vehicle launches, terrorist attacks, joint ventures,
and corporate personnel changes, finding that the
same kinds of facts appeared repeatedly. A nat-
ural conclusion is that Information Extraction (IE)
methods might be helpful here, and in fact, White
et al (2001) presented an IE-based summarization
system for natural disasters, where they first filled
2http://www-nlpir.nist.gov/projects/duc/
an IE template with slots related to date, location,
type of disaster, damage (people, physical effects),
etc. Similarly, Radev and McKeown (1998) used IE
combined with Natural Language Generation (NLG)
in their SUMMON system.
There are two ways to classify stories: according
to their level of cohesiveness (to use the distinction
made by Nenkova and Louis (2008)), and accord-
ing to subject. The first classification could help
us determine which topics would be easier for au-
tomatic summarization, but the difficulty is related
purely to lexical characteristics of the text; as shown
in Louis and Nenkova (2009), source document sim-
ilarity in terms of word overlap is one of the pre-
dictive features of multi-document summary qual-
ity. The second classification, according to subject
matter, is what enables us to utilize more meaning-
oriented approaches such as IE and attempt a deeper
semantic analysis of the source text, and is what we
describe in this paper.
3 Guided summarization at TAC
The new guided summarization task in 2010 was
designed with the second classification in mind,
in order to afford the participants a chance to
explore deeper linguistic methods of text analy-
sis. There were five topic categories: (1) Acci-
dents and Natural Disasters, (2) Attacks (Crimi-
nal/Terrorist), (3) Health and Safety, (4) Endangered
Resources, and (5) Trials and Investigations (Crim-
inal/Legal/Other).3 In contrast to previous topic-
specific summarization tasks, the Guided Summa-
rization task also provided a list of required aspects,
which described the type of information that should
be included in the summary (if such information
could be found in source documents). Summariz-
ers also had the option of including any other in-
formation they deemed important to the topic. The
categories and their aspects, shown in Table 1, were
developed on the basis of past DUC and TAC topics
and model summaries from years 2001-2009.
Each topic came with 20 chronologically ordered
3In the remainder of this paper, the following short forms are
used for names of categories: Accidents = Accidents and Nat-
ural Disasters; Attacks = Attacks; Health = Health and Safety;
Resources = Endangered Resources; Trials = Trials and Inves-
tigations. Full description of the task is available at the TAC
website.

news articles. The initial summaries were to be pro-
duced on the basis of the first 10 documents. As
in TAC 2008 and 2009, the 2010 Summarization
task had an update component: using the second 10
documents, summarizers were to produce an update
summary under the assumption that the user had al-
ready read the first set of source documents. This
means that for the update part, there were two in-
teracting conditions, with the requirement for non-
redundancy taking priority over the requirement to
address all category aspects.
For each topic, four model summaries were writ-
ten by human assessors. All summaries were eval-
uated with respect to linguistic quality (Overall
Readability), content (Pyramid), and general quality
(Overall Responsiveness). Readability and Respon-
siveness were judged by human assessors on a scale
from 1 (very poor) to 5 (very good), while Pyramid
is a score between 0 and 1 (in very rare cases, it
exceeds 1, if the candidate summary contains more
SCUs than the average reference summary).
Since this was the first year of Guided Summa-
rization, only about half of the 43 participating sys-
tems made some use of the provided categories and
aspects, mostly using them and their synonyms as
query terms.
3.1 Model summaries across years
The introduction of categories, which implies tem-
plate story types, and aspects, which further nar-
rows content selection, resulted in the parallel model
summaries being much more similar to each other
than in previous years, as represented by the Pyra-

mid score, which measures information overlap be-
tween a candidate summary and a set of refer-
ence summaries. Table 2 shows the macro-averaged
Pyramid and Responsiveness scores for years 2008-
2010. Both initial and update human summaries
score higher for Pyramid in 2010, and also gain a lit-
tle in Responsiveness. The macro-averages for auto-
matic summarizers, on the other hand, increase only
for initial summaries, which we will discuss further
in Section 3.4. The similarity effect among model
summaries can be more clearly seen in Table 3,
which shows the percentage of Summary Content
Units (SCUs, information ?nuggets?or simple facts)
with different weights in Pyramids across the years
between 2008-2010. The weight of an SCU is sim-
ply the number of model summaries in which this
information unit appears. Pyramids in 2010 have
greater percentage of SCUs with weight > 1, and
their proportion of weight-1 SCUs is below half of
all SCUs. The difference is much more pronounced
for the initial summaries, since the update compo-
nent is restricted by the non-redundancy require-
ment, resulting in more variance in content selection
after the required aspects have been covered.4
3.2 Content coverage in TAC 2010
During the Pyramid creation process, assessors ex-
tracting SCUs from model summaries were asked to
mark the aspect(s) relevant to each SCU. This lets
us examine and compare the distribution of infor-
mation in human and automatic summaries. Table 4
shows macro-average SCU counts in Pyramids com-
4Each summary could be up to 100 words long, and no
incentive was given for writing summaries of shorter length;
therefore, the goal for both human and automatic summarizers
was to fit as much relevant information as possible in the 100-
word limit.

posed of four human summaries, and macro-average
counts of matching SCUs in the summaries of the
15 top-performing automatic summarizers (as deter-
mined by their Responsiveness rank on initial sum-
maries).5 Although automatic summaries find only
a small percentage of all available information (as
represented by the number of Pyramid SCUs), the
SCUs they find for the initial summaries are usually
those of the highest weight, i.e. encoding informa-
tion that is the most essential to the topic.
SCU distribution in human summaries is also in-
teresting: Health, Resources, and Trials all have
the expected pyramid shape, with many low-weight
SCUs at the base and few high-weight SCUs on top,
but for Attacks and Accidents, the usual pattern is
broken and we see an hourglass shape instead, re-
flecting the presence of many weight-4 SCUs. The
most likely explanation is that these two categories
are guided by a relatively long list of aspects (cf.
Table 1), many of which have unique answers in the
source text.
This is shown in more detail in Table 5, which
presents aspect coverage by Pyramids and top 15
automatic summarizers in terms of an average num-
ber of SCUs relevant to a given aspect and an aver-
age weight of an aspect-related SCU. Only Attack
and Accidents have aspects that tend to generate the
same answers from almost all human summarizers:
when, where in Accidents and what, when, where,
perpetrators, and who affected in Attacks all have
average weight of around 3. The patterns hold for
update summaries; although all values decrease and

in order to exclude outliers like systems that returned empty
summaries, and to measure the state-of-the-art in the summa-
rization field.

there is less overlap between models, answers to
these aspects are the most likely to occur in multi-
ple summaries.
The situation for top 15 automatic summarizers
is even more interesting: while they contain rela-
tively few matching SCUs, the SCUs they do find
are those of high weight, as can be seen by compar-
ing their SCU weight averages. Even for ?other?,
which covers ?all other information important for
the topic? and is therefore more dependent on sum-
mary writer?s subjective judgment and shows more
content diversity, resulting in low-weight SCUs in
the Pyramid, the top automatic summarizers find
those most weighted. It would seem, then, that the
content selection methods are able to identify some
of the most important facts; at the same time, the
density of information in automatic summaries is
much lower than in human summaries, indicating
that the automatic content is either not compressed
adequately, or that it includes non-relevant or re-
peated information.

3.3 Effect of categories and aspects
Some categories in the Guided Summarization task
are defined in more detail than others, depending
on types of stories they represent. Stories about at-
tacks and accidents (and, to some extent, trials) tend
to follow more predictable and detailed templates,
which results in more similar models and better re-
sults for automatic summarizers. Figure 1 gives a
graphic representation of the macro-average Pyra-
mid and Responsiveness scores for human and top
15 automatic summarizers, with exact scores in Ta-
bles 6 and 7, where the first score marked with a
letter is not statistically significant from any subse-
quent score marked with the same letter, according
to ANOVA (p>0.05). Lack of significant difference
between human Responsiveness scores in Table 6
suggests that, for all categories, human summaries
are highly and equally responsive, but a look at their
Pyramid scores confirms that Attacks and Accidents
models tend to have more overlapping information.
For automatic summaries, their Pyramid and Re-
sponsiveness patterns are parallel. Here Attacks,
Accidents, and Trials contain on average more
matching SCUs than Health and Resources, making
these summaries more responsive. One reason for
these differences might be that many systems rely on
sentence positon in the extraction process, and first
sentences in these template stories often are a short
description of event including date, location, persons
involved, in effect giving systems the unique-answer
aspects mentioned in Section 3.2. Table 5 shows
this distribution of matching information in more de-
tail: for Attacks and Accidents, automatic summa-
rizers match relatively more SCUs for what, where,
when, who affected than for countermeasures, dam-
ages, or other. For Trials, again the easier aspects
are those that tend to appear at the beginning of
documents: who [is under investigation] and why.
Stories in Health and Resources, the weakest cate-
gories overall for automatic summarizers and with
the greatest amount of variance for human summa-
rizers, are non-events, instead being closer to what
in past DUC tasks was described as a ?multi-event?
or ?single subject? story type. Individual documents
within the source set might sometimes follow the
typical event template (e.g. describing individual
instances of coral reef destruction), but in general
these categories require much more abstraction and
render the opening-sentence extraction strategy less
effective.
If the higher averages are really due to the infor-
mation extracted with first sentences, then we would
also expect higher scores from Baseline 1, which
simply selected the opening sentences of the most
recent document, up to the 100-word limit. And in-
deed, as shown in Table 8, the partial Pyramid scores
for Baseline 1 are the highest for exactly these ?con-
crete? categories and aspects, mostly for Attacks and
Accidents, and aspects such aswhere, what, andwho
(the score of 1 for Accidents other is an outlier, since
there was only one SCU relevant for this calcula-
tion and the baseline happened to match it). On the
other hand, its lowest performance is mostly con-
centrated in Health and Resources, and in the more
?vague? aspects, like why, how, importance, coun-

sentence position is not a good predictor of such in-
formation, and that automatic summarizers might do
well to diversify their methods of content identifi-
cation based on what type of information they are
looking for.

any information that can be found in the initial doc-
ument set. This restriction narrows the pool of po-
tential summary elements to choose from. More im-
portantly, since the concrete aspects with unique an-
swers like what, where, and when are likely to be
mentioned in the first set of document (and, by ex-
tension, in the initial summaries), this shifts content
selection to aspects that generate more variance, like
why, countermeasures, or other. As shown in Fig-
ure 1, while Responsiveness remains high for hu-
man summarizers across categories, which means
the content is still relevant to the topic, the Pyramid
scores are lower in the update component, which
means the summarizers differ more in terms of what
information they extract from the source documents.
Note that this is not the case for Trials, where the
human performance for both Responsiveness and
Pyramid is practically identical for initial and up-
date summaries. The time course of trials is gener-
ally longer than those for accidents and attacks, and
many of the later-occurring aspects such as plea and
sentence are well-defined; hence the initial and up-
date human summaries have similar Pyramid scores.
Automatic summarizers, on the other hand, suffer
the greatest drop in those categories in which they
were the most successful before: Attacks, Acci-
dents, and Trials, in effect rendering their perfor-
mance across categories more or less even (cf. Fig-
30
ure 1).
A closer look at the aspect coverage in initial and
update components confirms the differences in as-
pect distribution. Figure 2 gives four columns for
each aspect: the first two columns represent initial
summaries, the second two represent update sum-
maries. Dark columns in each pair are human sum-
marizers, light columns are top 15 automatic sum-
marizers. For almost all aspects, humans find fewer
relevant (and new!) facts in the update documents,
with the exception of sentence in Trials, and coun-
termeasures and other in all categories. Logically,
once all the anchoring information has been given
(date, time, location, event), the only remaining rel-
evant content to focus on are consequences of the
event (countermeasures, sentence), and possibly up-
dates in victims and damages (who affected, dam-
ages) as well as any other information that might be
relevant. A similar (though less consistent) pattern
holds for automatic summarizers.
4 Summary and conclusions
Initial attempts at more complex treatments of any
subject often fail when faced with unrestricted, ?real
world? input. This is why almost all research in
summarization remains centered around relatively
simple extractive methods. Few developers try to
incorporate syntactic parsing to compress summary
sentences, and almost none want to venture into se-
mantic decompositon of source text, since the com-
plexity of these methods is the cause of potential
errors. Also, the tools might not deal particularly
well with different types of stories in the ?newswire?
genre. However, Genest (2009) showed the limits
of purely extractive summarization: their manual,
extractive summarizer (HexTac) performed much
worse than human abstractors, and comparably to
the top automatic summarizers in TAC 2009.
But if we want to see significant progress in ab-
stractive summarization, it?s important to provide a
more controlled environment for such experiments.
TAC 2010 results show that, first of all, by guid-
ing summary creation we end up with more similar
human abstracts than in previous tasks (partly due
to the choice of template-like categories, and partly
due to the further guiding role of aspects). Narrow-
ing down possible summary content, while exclud-

ing variance due to subjective opinions among hu-
man writers, creates in effect a more concrete in-
formation model, and a single, unified information
model is an easier goal to emulate than relying on
vague and subjective goals like ?importance?. Out
of five categories, Attacks and Accidents generated
the most similar models, mostly because they re-
quired concrete, unique-answer aspects like where
or when. In Health and Resources, the aspects were
more subjective in nature, and the resulting variance
was greater.
Moreover, the Guided Task provides a very valu-
able and detailed diagnostic tool for system devel-
opers: by looking at the system performance within
each aspect, we can find out which types of infor-
mation it is better able to identify. While the top au-
tomatic summarizers managed to retrieve less than
half of relevant information at the best of times, the
facts they did retrieve were highly-weighted. Their
better performance for certain aspects of Attacks,
Accidents, and Trials could be ascribed to the fact
that most of them rely on sentence position to deter-
mine important information in the source document.
A comparison of covered aspects suggests that sen-
tence position might be a better indicator for some
types of information than others.
Since it was the first year of the Guided Task, only
some of the teams used the provided category/aspect
information; as the task continues, we hope to see
more participants adopting categories and aspects
to guide their summarization. The predictable el-
ements of each category invite the use of differ-
ent techniques depending on the type of informa-
tion sought, perhaps suggesting the use of Infor-
mation Extraction methods. Some categories might
be easier to process than others, but even if the
information-mining approach cannot be extended to
all types of stories, at worst we will end up with
better summarization for event-type stories, like at-
tacks, accidents, or trials, which together comprise a
large part of reported news.
