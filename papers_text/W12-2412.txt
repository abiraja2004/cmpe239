Abstract
Event extraction is a major focus of re-
cent work in biomedical information extrac-
tion. Despite substantial advances, many chal-
lenges still remain for reliable automatic ex-
traction of events from text. We introduce a
new biomedical event extraction resource con-
sisting of analyses automatically created by
systems participating in the recent BioNLP
Shared Task (ST) 2011. In providing for the
first time the outputs of a broad set of state-of-
the-art event extraction systems, this resource
opens many new opportunities for studying
aspects of event extraction, from the identifi-
cation of common errors to the study of ef-
fective approaches to combining the strengths
of systems. We demonstrate these opportuni-
ties through a multi-system analysis on three
BioNLP ST 2011 main tasks, focusing on
events that none of the systems can success-
fully extract. We further argue for new per-
spectives to the performance evaluation of do-
main event extraction systems, considering a
document-level, ?off-the-page? representation
and evaluation to complement the mention-
level evaluations pursued in most recent work.
1 Introduction
Biomedical information extraction efforts are in-
creasingly focusing on event extraction using struc-
tured representations that allow associations of arbi-
trary numbers of participants in specific roles (e.g.
Theme, Cause) to be captured (Ananiadou et al,
2010). Domain event extraction has been advanced
in particular by the BioNLP Shared Task (ST) events
(Kim et al, 2011a; Kim et al, 2011b), which have
introduced common task settings, datasets, and eval-
uation criteria for event extraction. Participants in
these shared tasks have introduced dozens of sys-
tems for event extraction, and the resulting methods
have been applied to automatically analyse the entire
available domain literature (Bjo?rne et al, 2010) and
applied in support of applications such as semantic
literature search (Ohta et al, 2010; Van Landeghem
et al, 2011b) and pathway curation support (Kemper
et al, 2010).
It is possible to assess recent advances in event ex-
traction through results for a task considered both in
the BioNLP ST 2009 and 2011. By the primary eval-
uation criteria, the highest performance achieved in
the 2009 task was 51.95% F-score, and a 57.46% F-
score was reached in the comparable 2011 task (Kim
et al, 2011b). These results demonstrate significant
advances in event extraction methods, but also indi-
cate that the task continues to hold substantial chal-
lenges. This has led to a call from task participants
for further analysis of the data and results, accompa-
nied by a proposal to release analyses from individ-
ual systems to facilitate such analysis (Quirk et al,
2011).
In this study, we explore new perspectives into the
analyses and performance of event extraction meth-
ods. We build primarily on a new resource compiled
with the support of the majority of groups participat-
ing in the BioNLP ST 2011, consisting of analyses
from systems for the three main tasks sharing the
text-bound event representation. We demonstrate
the use of this resource through an evaluation fo-
cusing on events that cannot be extracted even by
the union of combined systems, identifying partic-
ular remaining challenges for event extraction. We
further propose and evaluate an alternate, document-
level perspective to event extraction, demonstrat-
ing that when only unique events are considered for

each document, the measured performance and even
ranking of systems participating in the shared task is
notably altered.
2 Background
In this work, we focus on the definition of the
event extraction task first introduced in the BioNLP
Shared Task 2009.1 The task targets the extrac-
tion of events, represented as n-ary associations of
participants (entities or other events), each marked
as playing a specific role such as Theme or Cause
in the event. Each event is assigned a type such
as BINDING or PHOSPHORYLATION from a fixed,
task-specific set. Events are further typically associ-
ated with specific trigger expressions that state their
occurrence in text. As physical entities such as pro-
teins are also identified in the setting with specific
spans referring to the real-world entities in text, the
overall task is ?text-bound? in the sense of requiring
not only the extraction of targeted statements from
text, but also the identification of specific regions of
text expressing each piece of extracted information.
Events can further be marked with modifiers iden-
tifying additional features such as being explicitly
negated or stated in a speculative context. Figure 1
shows an illustration of event annotations.
This BioNLP ST 2009 formulation of the event
extraction task was followed also in three 2011 main
tasks: the GE (Kim et al, 2011c), ID (Pyysalo et al,
2011a) and EPI (Ohta et al, 2011) tasks. A vari-
ant of this representation that omits event triggers
was applied in the BioNLP ST 2011 bacteria track
(Bossy et al, 2011), and simpler, binary relation-
type representations were applied in three support-
ing tasks (Nguyen et al, 2011; Pyysalo et al, 2011b;
Jourde et al, 2011). Due to the challenges of con-
sistent evaluation and processing for tasks involv-
1While far from the only formulation proposed in the litera-
ture, this specific task setting is the most frequently considered
and arguably a de facto standard for domain event extraction.
ing different representations, we focus in this work
specifically on the three 2011 main tasks sharing a
uniform representation: GE, ID and EPI.
3 New Resources for Event Extraction
In this section, we present the new collection of au-
tomatically created event analyses and demonstrate
one use of the data through an evaluation of events
that no system could successfully extract.
3.1 Data Compilation
Following the BioNLP ST 2011, the MSR-NLP
group called for the release of outputs from various
participating systems (Quirk et al, 2011) and made
analyses of their system available.2 Despite the ob-
vious benefits of the availability of these resources,
we are not aware of other groups following this ex-
ample prior to the time of this publication.
To create the combined resource, we approached
each group that participated in the three targeted
BioNLP ST 2011 main tasks to ask for their support
to the creation of a dataset including analyses from
their event extraction systems. This suggestion met
with the support of all but a few groups that were
approached.3 The groups providing analyses from
their systems into this merged resource are summa-
rized in Table 1, with references to descriptions of
the systems used to create the included analyses. We
compiled for each participant and each task both the
final test set submission and a comparable submis-
sion for the separate development set.
As the gold annotations for the test set are only
available for evaluation through an online interface
(in order to avoid overfitting and assure the compa-
rability of results), it is important to provide also de-
velopment set analyses to permit direct comparison

3We have yet to hear back from a few groups, but none has
yet explicitly denied the release of their data. Should any re-
maining group accept the release of their data, we will release a
new, extended version of the resource.

velopment and test set annotations also allows e.g.
the study of system combination approaches where
the combination parameters are estimated on devel-
opment data for final testing on the test set (Kim et
al., 2011a).
3.2 Evaluation
We demonstrate the use of the newly compiled
dataset through a manual evaluation of GE, EPI and
ID main task development set gold standard events
that are not extracted by any of the systems for
which analyses were available.4 We perform eval-
uation on the GE subtask 1 and the EPI and ID
task CORE subtasks, as all participating systems ad-
dressed the extraction targets of these subtasks.
We first evaluated each of the analyses against the
development set of the respective task using the of-
ficial shared task evaluation software, using options
for the evaluation tools to list the sets of true posi-
tive (TP), false positive (FP) and false negative (FN)
4The final collection includes analyses from the systems of
two groups that agreed to the release of their data after the com-
pletion of this analysis, but we expect the results to largely hold
also for the final collection.
events. We then selected for each of the three tasks
the set of events that were included in the FN list
for all systems. This gives the results for the re-
call of the union of all systems shown in Table 2.
The recall of the system union is approximately 30%
points higher than that of any individual GE system
(Kim et al, 2011c) and 25% points higher for EPI
and ID (Ohta et al, 2011; Pyysalo et al, 2011a),
suggesting potential remaining benefits from system
combination. Nevertheless, a substantial fraction of
the total set of gold events remains inaccessible also
to this system union.
We then selected a random set of 100 events from
each of the three sets of events that were not re-
covered by any system (i.e. 300 events in total) and
performed a manual evaluation to identify frequent
properties of these events that could contribute to
extraction failures. In brief, we first performed a
brief manual evaluation to identify common charac-
teristics of these events, and then evaluated the 300
events individually to identify the set of these char-
acteristics that apply to each event.
The results of the evaluation for common cases
are shown in Table 3. We find that the most fre-
quent property of the unrecoverable events is that
they involve implicit arguments (Gerber and Chai,
2010), a difficult challenge that has not been ex-
tensively considered in domain event extraction. A
closely related issue are events involving arguments
in a sentence different from that containing the trig-
ger (?cross-sentence?), connected either implicitly
or through explicit coreference (?coreference?). Al-

though coreference was considered as as separate
task in BioNLP ST 2011 (Nguyen et al, 2011), it is
clear that it involves many remaining challenges for
event extraction systems. Similarly, events where
explicit arguments are connected to other arguments
through ?static? relations such as part-of (e.g. ?A
binds the X domain of B?) represent a known chal-
lenge (Pyysalo et al, 2011b). These results sug-
gest that further advances in event extraction perfor-
mance could be gained by the integration of systems
for the analysis of coreference and static relations,
approaches for which some success has already been
demonstrated in recent efforts (Van Landeghem et
al., 2010; Yoshikawa et al, 2011; Miwa et al, 2012).
?Weak? trigger expressions that must be inter-
preted in context to determine whether they express
an event, as well as a related class of events whose
type must be disambiguated with reference to con-
text (?ambiguous type?) are comparatively frequent
in the three tasks, while EPI in particular involves
many cases where a trigger is shared between mul-
tiple events ? an issue for approaches that assume
each token can be assigned at most a single class.
Finally, we noted a number of cases that we judged
to be errors in the gold annotation; the number
is broadly in line with the reported inter-annotator
agreement for the data (see e.g. Ohta et al (2011)).
While there is an unavoidable subjective com-
ponent to evaluations such as this, we note that a
similar evaluation performed following the BioNLP
Shared Task 2009 using test set data reached broadly
comparable results (Kim et al, 2011a). The newly
compiled dataset represents the first opportunity for
those without direct access to the test set data and
submissions to directly assess the task results, as
demonstrated here. We hope that this resource will
encourage further exploration of both the data, the
system analyses and remaining challenges in event
extraction.
4 New Perspectives to Event Extraction
As discussed in Section 2, the BioNLP ST event ex-
traction task is ?text-bound?: each entity and event
annotation is associated with a specific span of text.
Contrasted to the alternative approach where anno-
tations are document-level only, this approach has
a number of important benefits, such as allowing
machine learning methods for event extraction to
be directly trained on fully and specifically anno-
tated data without the need to apply frequently error-
prone heuristics (Mintz et al, 2009) or develop ma-
chine learning methods addressing the mapping be-
tween text expressions and document-level annota-
tions (Riedel et al, 2010). Many of the most suc-
cessful event extraction approaches involve direct
training of machine learning methods using the text-
bound annotations (Riedel and McCallum, 2011;
Bjo?rne and Salakoski, 2011; McClosky et al, 2011).
However, while the availability of text-bound anno-
tations in data provided to task participants is clearly
a benefit, there are drawbacks to the choice of ex-
clusive focus on text-bound annotations in system
output, including issues relating to evaluation and
the applicability of methods to the task. In the fol-
lowing section, we discuss some of these issues and
propose alternatives to representation and evaluation
addressing them.
4.1 Evaluation
The evaluation of the BioNLP ST is instance-based
and text-bound: each event in gold annotation and
each event extracted by a system is considered in-
dependently, separating different mentions of the
?same? real-world event. This is the most detailed
(sensitive) evaluation setting permitted by the data,
and from a technical perspective a reasonable choice
for ranking systems performing the task.
However, from a practical perspective, this eval-
uation setting arguably places excessively strict de-
mands on systems, and may result in poor correla-
tion between measured performance and the practi-
cal value of systems. Our motivating observations
are that specific real-world events tend to be men-
103
tioned multiple times in a single publication ? espe-
cially the events that are of particular importance in
the study ? and that there are few practical applica-
tions for which it is necessary to find each such re-
peated mention. For example, in literature search for
e.g. pathway or database curation support, one typi-
cal information need is to identify biomolecular re-
actions involving a specific protein. Event extraction
can support such needs either by summarizing all
events involving the protein that could be extracted
from the literature (Van Landeghem et al, 2011b), or
by retrieving documents (perhaps showing relevant
text snippets) containing such events (Ohta et al,
2010). For the former to meet the information need,
it may be sufficient that each different event is ex-
tracted once from the entire literature; for the latter,
once from each relevant document. For uses such
as these, there is no obvious need for, or, indeed,
no very obvious benefit from the ability of extrac-
tion systems to separately enumerate every mention
of every event in every publication. It is easy to en-
vision other practical use cases where instance-level
extraction performance is at best secondary and, we
argue, difficult to identify ones where it is of critical
importance.
For applications such as these, the important
question is the reliability of the system at identify-
ing events either on the level of documents or on the
level of (a relevant subset of) the literature, rather
than on the level of individual mentions. For a more
complete and realistic picture of the practical value
of event extraction methods, measures other than
instance-level should thus also be considered.
4.2 Task setting
While applications can benefit from the ability of
IE systems to identify a specific span of text sup-
porting extracted information,5 the requirement of
the BioNLP ST setting that the output of event ex-
traction systems must identify specific text spans for
each entity and event makes it complex or impossi-
ble to address the task using a number of IE methods
that might otherwise represent feasible approaches
to event extraction.
5For example, for curation support tasks, this allows the hu-
man curator to easily check the correctness of extracted infor-
mation and helps to select ?evidence sentences?, as included in
many databases.
For example, Patwardhan and Riloff (2007) and
Chambers and Jurafsky (2011) consider an IE ap-
proach where the extraction targets are MUC-4 style
document-level templates (Sundheim, 1991), the
former a supervised system and the latter fully un-
supervised. These methods and many like them for
tasks such as ACE (Doddington et al, 2004) work
on the document level, and can thus not be readily
applied or evaluated against the existing annotations
for the BioNLP shared tasks. Enabling the appli-
cation of such approaches to the BioNLP ST could
bring valuable new perspectives to event extraction.
4.3 Alternative evaluation
We propose a new mode of evaluation that otherwise
follows the primary BioNLP ST evaluation criteria,
but incorporates the following two exceptions:
1. remove the requirement to match trigger spans
2. only require entity texts, not spans, to match
The first alternative criterion has also been previ-
ously considered in the GE task evaluation (Kim et
al., 2011c); the latter has, to the best of our knowl-
edge, not been previously considered in domain
event extraction. We additionally propose to con-
sider only the minimal set of events that are unique
on the document level (under the evaluation criteria),
thus eliminating effects from repeated mentions of a
single event on evaluated performance. We created
tools implementing this mode of evaluation with ref-
erence to the BioNLP ST 2011 evaluation tools.
While this type of evaluation has, to the best of
our knowledge, not been previously applied specif-
ically in biomedical event extraction, it is closely
related (though not identical) to evaluation criteria
applied in MUC, ACE, and the in-domain PPI re-
lation extraction tasks in BioCreative (Krallinger et
al., 2008).
4.4 Alternative representation
A true conversion to a document-level, ?off the
page? representation would require manual anno-
tation efforts to identify the real-world entities and
events referred to in text (Doddington et al, 2004).
However, it is possible to reasonably approximate
such a representation through an automatic heuristic
conversion.

Figure 2: Illustration of BioNLP Shared Task annotation format and the proposed document-level (?off-the-page?)
format.
We first introduce a non-textbound annotation for-
mat that normalizes over differences in e.g. argu-
ment order and eliminates duplicate events. The for-
mat largely follows that of the shared task but re-
moves any dependencies and references to text off-
sets (see Figure 2). The conversion process into this
representation involves a number of steps. First, we
merge duplicate pairs of surface strings and types,
as different mentions of the same entity in different
parts of the text are no longer distinguishable in the
representation. In the original format, equivalence
relations (Kim et al, 2011a) are annotated only for
specific mentions. When ?raising? the annotations
to the document level, equivalence relations are rein-
terpreted to cover the full document by extending
the equivalence to all mentions that share the surface
form and type with members of existing equivalence
classes. Finally, we implemented an event equiv-
alence comparison to remove duplicate annotations
from each document. The result of the conversion
to this alternate representation is thus an ?off-the-
page? summary of the unique set of events in the
document.
This data can then be used for training and com-
parison of methods analogously to the original anno-
tations, but without the requirement that all analyses
include text-bound annotations.

The F-score differences range between 3-4% for
most high-ranking systems, with more substantial
increases for lower-ranking systems. Notable in-
creases in precision are seen for some systems (e.g.
HCMUS), indicating that the systems comparatively
frequently extract correct information, but associ-
ated with the wrong spans of text.

For EPI (Table 5), we find comparable differences
in F-score to those for GE, but there is a signifi-
cant difference in the precision-recall balance: the
majority of systems show over 5% points higher re-
call under the new criteria, but many show substan-
tial losses in precision, while for GE precision was
also systematically increased. This effect was not
unexpected: we judge this to reflect primarily the
increased number of opportunities to extract each
unique event (higher recall) combined with the com-
paratively higher effect from errors from the reduc-
tion in the total number of unique correct extraction
targets (lower precision). It is not clear from our
analysis why a comparable effect was not seen for
GE. Interestingly, most systems show a better pre-
cision/recall balance under the new criteria than the
old, despite not optimizing for these criteria.
For ID (Table 6), we find a different effect also on
F-score, with all but one system showing reduced
performance under the new criteria, with some very
clear drops in performance; the only system to ben-
efit is UTurku. Analysis suggests that this effect
traces primarily to a notable reduction in the number
of simple PROCESS events that take no arguments6
when considering unique events on the document
level instead of each event mention independently.7
Conversely, the Stanford system, which showed the
highest instance-level performance in the extraction
of PROCESS type events (see Pyysalo et al (2011a)),
shows a clear loss in precision.
6The ID task annotation criteria call for mentions of some
high-level biological processes such as ?infection? to be anno-
tated as PROCESS even if no explicit participants are mentioned
(Pyysalo et al, 2011a).
7It is interesting to note that there was an error in the
UTurku system implementation causing it to fail to output any
events without arguments (Jari Bjo?rne, personal communica-
tion), likely contributing to the effect seen here.

The clear differences in performance and the
many cases in which the system rankings under the
two criteria differ demonstrate that the new evalua-
tion criteria can have a decisive effect in which ap-
proaches to event extraction appear preferred. While
there may be cases for which the original shared task
criteria are preferred, there is at the very minimum
a reasonable argument to be made that the emphasis
these criteria place on the extraction of each instance
of simple events is unlikely to reflect the needs of
many practical applications of event extraction.
While these experimental results demonstrate that
the new evaluation criteria emphasize substantially
different aspects of the performance of the systems
than the original criteria, they cannot per se serve
as an argument in favor of one set of criteria over
another. We hope that these results and the accom-
panying tools will encourage increased study and
discussion of evaluation criteria for event extraction
and more careful consideration of the needs of spe-
cific applications of the technology.
5 Discussion and Conclusions
We have presented a new resource combining analy-
ses from the systems participating in the GE, ID and
EPI main tasks of the BioNLP Shared Task 2011,
compiled with the collaboration of groups partic-
ipating in these tasks. We demonstrated one use
of the resource through an evaluation of develop-
ment set events that none of the participating sys-
tems could recover, finding that events involving
implicit arguments, coreference and participants in
more than once sentence continue to represent chal-
lenges to the event extraction systems that partici-
pated in these tasks.
We further argued in favor of new perspectives to
the evaluation of domain event extraction systems,
106
emphasizing in particular the need for document-
level, ?off-the-page? representations and evaluation
to complement the text-bound, instance-level eval-
uation criteria that have so far been applied in the
shared task evaluation. We proposed a variant of
the shared task standoff representation for support-
ing such evaluation, and introduced evaluation tools
implementing the proposed criteria. An evaluation
supported by the introduced resources demonstrated
that the new criteria can in cases provide substan-
tially different results and rankings of the systems,
confirming that the proposed evaluation can serve
as an informative complementary perspective into
event extraction performance.
In future work, we hope to further extend the cov-
erage of the provided system outputs as well as their
analysis to cover all participants of all tasks in the
BioNLP Shared Task 2011. We also aim to use the
compiled resource in further study of appropriate
criteria for the evaluation of event extraction meth-
ods and deeper analysis of the remaining challenges
in event extraction.
To encourage further study of all aspects of event
extraction, all resources and tools introduced in this
study are provided freely to the community from
