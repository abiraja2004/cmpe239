Summary 
The stroke sequence of kanji has 
been investigated chiefly from the view- 
point of energy in the dynamics of writ- 
ing together with the informational 
viewpoint in memorization in learning. 
Sample characters include all the 
members for daily use, and also 
katakana. The results show that the 
standard sequence fundamentally follows 
the law of energy minimization in writ- 
ing movements, The degree of satisfac- 
tion is highest for the vertical succes- 
sion among practical writ ing conditions. 
The standard sequence is considered to 
originate from the human adaptation for 
circumstances. As for the characters 
with more strokes, it is found that to 
add the contribution of easy memori- 
zation by compression of information 
content of the sequence, the law is 
satisfied by selection of the sequence 
of sub-systems in place of individual 
strokes. These results indicate that 
the stroke sequence greatly affects the 
human abil ity of kanji processing. 
i. Introduction 
In general the standard stroke 
sequence is tradit ionally designated for 
each kanji(and also its offspring letters 
as katakana), and both in cal l igraphy 
and in primary education, writ ing 
characters according to the standard is 
imposed. But the unknown origin prevents 
justifying the observance. And also 
recently the stroke sequece has applica- 
tions in engineering as kanj i -recognit ion 
and so on. Actually, however, some vari- 
eties in existence pose some problems. 
In view of these situations, 
clar i f icat ion of scientific basis of the 
standard sequence will be not a little 
valuable to the above fields and also 
to serve as an aid to explicate the 
intrinsic nature of the character in 
linguistics. 
In this report the considerations 
from the viewpoint of energy in the 
dynamics of writ ing is extended, and the 
study of contribution to easy memoriza- 
tion, the possibi l i ty of which was 
already suggested by the author as an 
additional factor for the characters 
with more strokesl),are developed, by 
aiming at the total research on the 
traditional standard sequence. 
2. The Stroke Sequence on Hypothesis 
In writ ing kanji, if the shape 
alone is enough, the direction and the 
sequence are various and therefore a 
great number of ways of writ ing produced 
by their combinations will be possible. 
What is the reason for a specified 
sequence selected as the standard ? 
By daily experiences, it seems to the 
author that according to the standard 
sequence "easy, rapid and beautiful" 
writ ing is possible to be accomplished. 
Now, putting aside the factor of beauty 
for the moment, it can be thought that 
"ease and rapidness" means the standard 
sequence is one requiring as little 
energy consumption as possible in writ- 
ing movements. And therefore this study 
began with building up a hypothsis that 
the standard sequence satisfies the law 
of energy minimization and verifying by 
electronic computation for the kanji 
samples with fewer strokes. 1 ) As for 
kanjis with more strokes, in addition 
to the contribution to wr i t ing move- 
ments, the standard sequence is assumed 
to have an effect to ease the memoriza- 
tion of kanji, i.e. a contribution to 
reduce information content, which is 
studied by the use of the theory of 
information. 
3. Modell ing of the Writing Movements 
and the Rank Distances 
If the directions of strokes are 
conventional ly fixed, kanjis with 
n-strokes have as many possible 
sequences as n!. The energy consumed in 
writ ing depends on pen-path length, pen 
velocity, pen pressure and so on. For 
simplicity, assuming that velocity and 
pressure are constant and the effects 
of direction and others are negligible, 
the energy is reduced to a function of 
pen-path length alone. Pen-path 
consists of stroke vectors and stroke- 
with-stroke combining vectors for a 
single character, and in case of 
character succession, character-with- 
character combining vectors add to this. 
Sample kanjis used number 1850 for 
daily use. The character form employed 
is of square-style and each stroke is 
approximated by a straight line. As 
circumstances for character, an appro- 
priate field is assumed and the situa- 
tions of singleness and character 
- - -270  - 
successions in three different direc- 
tions are introduced by the boundary 
condition setting. 
The process of verifying the 
hypothesis is to calculate the energy 
consumption in all the possible 
sequences for normalized standard kanji 
samples and to examine whether the energy 
consumption for the standard sequence is 
in the lowest. 
The results of electronic computa- 
tion show, as a whole, the hypothesis is 
fairly well satisfied, as an example of 
which the degree of satisfaction is 
shown in Tab. 1 by the rank distance D 
for samples of not more than 6 strokes, 
where D is defined as 
D = \[(k - l)/(n! - I)\] x i00 (%) 
when the standard one is in the k-th 
from the lowest in energy. Among these, 
the relationship of D and cumulative 
number of characters N (%) for 6-stroke 
characters, for example, is shown in 
Fig. i. As for katakana, the perfect 
satisfaction D = 0 holds good for more 
than 60% of all the samples in the 
vert ical ly downward succession condition 
and the anisotropy is quite small. 
In Tab. i, all the samples of not 
more than two strokes are independent 
of either singleness or succession, and 
of its direction, and completely opti- 
mized, which fact is suitable to the 
nature as the most fundamental consti- 
tuent, together with katakana, in kanj i  
system. Though with the number of 
strokes per character increasing, some 
small spreading of D and anisotropy 
appear, the whole trend can still be 
seen to support the hypothesis. Here it 
is noticeable that human abil ity of 
selection through the cumulative experi- 
ences is splendidly high: in spite of 
the number of possible sequences n! 
abruptly increasing with increment of 
strokes, perfect satisfaction is found 
in quite a few samples.( In case of 5- 
stroke samples, for instance, in which 
n! = 120, optimum holds good in more 
than 20% of them ! ) 
Some difference in the degree of 
satisfaction by differnt environments 
is also observed. The degree is highest 
for vertical succession among practical 
writing conditions, which corresponds 
well to the traditional kanji call!gra- 
phical modes in past China and Japan. 
The history of the standard 
sequence has been rather stable, in 
connection with the past stable modes, 
in which,however, some examples changed 
exist. And the inspection of their D's 
indicates that the transitions are 
mostly towards the lowest. New phenomena 
observed now about the sequence are 
mostly related to the recent change in 
circumstances. These facts assure that 
the stadard sequence can be regarded as 
an example of human adaptation for 
circumstances. 
These characterist ics of the 
standard sequence agree with the general 
features of the natural language as a 
social custom. (Though the above- 
mentioned considerations were performed 
under the condition of the fixed direc- 
tions of stroke vectors, the direction 
itself is clarif ied to follow the law 
of energy minimization by introducing 
direction dependence in energy consump- 
tion per path-length.) 
4. The Structure of Kant! and 
Memorizat ion 
Some small D's spreading phenomena 
with increasing strokes per character 
suggest an additional factor existing. 
With this respect, in the previous 
report, possible relevancy to facili- 
tation of memorization, i.e. the effect 
on reducing information content, was 
just point out. 1 ) Here this factor is 
examined, with correlation to the kanji 
structure, by the aid of the informa- 
tion theory. 
Information for writ ing kanji is 
assumed to be input to/output from the 
memory device of the cerebrum as a 
symbol string of kanji-forming stroke 
vectors. In the following calculations, 
encoding only about direction is 
employed for simplicity, putting aside 
posit ion and magnitude. Quantization 
is in 8 different directions according 
to the traditional call igraphy. ( The 
case in which simplif ied to 5 direc- 
tions is also considered.) 
At the first stage, the amount of 
information by the statistcs of the 
direction occurrence frequency, multi- 
grams, etc. about all the samples is 
calculated, and possibi l i ty of data 
compression is analysed by the theories 
of Markov process and encoding. 
By the results, mean information 
content per stroke by the transit ion 
probabil ity in Markov chain, is found 
to be only about 10% less than that by 
frequency statistics. Great reduction 
of information amount is, therefore, 
unpromising as far as a stroke is the 
string element even if the transit ion 
probabil ity is learned. 
Next consideration is on compress- 
bil ity of data by deriding stroke 
string into sections, i.e. reduGtion by 
forming a kind of supersymbol, 2) viewed 
from transinformation between strokes. 
At the same time, as a graded structure 
is observed in the stroke symbol string, 
271 
transinformation content between compound 
events and possibi l i ty of compression 
are also calculated by setting each 
previous section as an encoding element, 
in which a close coupling relation is 
found between them, such as the trans- 
information amount between compound 
elements of 3-strokes, is about ten 
times as much as in case of sectioning. 
These results suggest a possibi lty of 
compression to about a half or less. 
And then, therefore, the reduction 
of information content for all the 
samples by selecting suitable sub- 
systems like the traditional radicals, 
etc. as compound element, is examined. 
With this respect, however, besides our 
calculat ion a similar study for oth@r 
purpose has already been reported. 3) 
With some different viewpoints included, 
it is thought sufficient to cite here 
instead, for the estimation of this. 
By their data, the whole information 
amount can be reduced to as small as 
40% of the amount in case that the 
individual stroke is the element. 
In view of these facts on informa- 
tion,the satisfaction of the law of 
energy minimization in the dynamics of 
writing is examined again by unit of 
sub-system. That is, by expressing 
sub-system in terms of a cummulative 
vector, the similar calculations to the 
previous chapter are performed. And the 
results prove the law is well satisfied, 
for instance, for about 450 samples 
composed of two sub-systems, each of 
which is again the member of samples, 
more than 99% of all are optimized in 
the vertical succession condition. 
The system of kanji is, by origin, 
of a graded structure, and most sub- 
systems like radicals have important 
symbolic functions such as phonetic 
value, meaningful element, etc.. 
Therefore, as for characters compound in 
structure, the stroke sequence deter- 
mined by selection of sequence of sub- 
systems has an effect to fully function- 
ate these symbolic actions, by which 
generating additional redundancy in 
human processor is expectable. 
By the above considerations, it is 
clarif ied that for a simple character 
with fewer strokes, the standard stroke 
sequence is determined by the energy 
minimization in writ ing and that a 
compound character with more strokes 
are of mult iplex structure, where the 
energy minimizat ion is satisfied by 
selecting the sequence of memorization- 
facil itating sub-systems whose stroke 
sequences have previously been decided 
by the energy minimization. 
5. Conclusion 
This investigation leads to the 
following conclusion: the traditional 
standard stroke sequence of kanji is 
thought as a human experiential result 
toward the optimization of writ ing and 
memorizat ion in learning. And the 
sequence, therefore, greatly affects 
human abil ity of l inguistic activit ies 
using kanji.
