Abstract
This paper proposes a novel two-stage
method for mining opinion words and
opinion targets. In the first stage, we
propose a Sentiment Graph Walking algo-
rithm, which naturally incorporates syn-
tactic patterns in a Sentiment Graph to ex-
tract opinion word/target candidates. Then
random walking is employed to estimate
confidence of candidates, which improves
extraction accuracy by considering confi-
dence of patterns. In the second stage, we
adopt a self-learning strategy to refine the
results from the first stage, especially for
filtering out high-frequency noise terms
and capturing the long-tail terms, which
are not investigated by previous meth-
ods. The experimental results on three real
world datasets demonstrate the effective-
ness of our approach compared with state-
of-the-art unsupervised methods.
1 Introduction
Opinion mining not only assists users to make in-
formed purchase decisions, but also helps busi-
ness organizations understand and act upon cus-
tomer feedbacks on their products or services in
real-time. Extracting opinion words and opinion
targets are two key tasks in opinion mining. Opin-
ion words refer to those terms indicating positive
or negative sentiment. Opinion targets represent
aspects or attributes of objects toward which opin-
ions are expressed. Mining these terms from re-
views of a specific domain allows a more thorough
understanding of customers? opinions.
Opinion words and opinion targets often co-
occur in reviews and there exist modified relations
(called opinion relation in this paper) between
them. For example, in the sentence ?It has a clear
screen?, ?clear? is an opinion word and ?screen? is
an opinion target, and there is an opinion relation
between the two words. It is natural to identify
such opinion relations through common syntactic
patterns (also called opinion patterns in this pa-
per) between opinion words and targets. For ex-
ample, we can extract ?clear? and ?screen? by us-
ing a syntactic pattern ?Adj-{mod}-Noun?, which
captures the opinion relation between them. Al-
though previous works have shown the effective-
ness of syntactic patterns for this task (Qiu et al,
2009; Zhang et al, 2010), they still have some lim-
itations as follows.
False Opinion Relations: As an example, the
phrase ?everyday at school? can be matched by
a pattern ?Adj-{mod}-(Prep)-{pcomp-n}-Noun?,
but it doesn?t bear any sentiment orientation. We
call such relations that match opinion patterns but
express no opinion false opinion relations. Pre-
vious pattern learning algorithms (Zhuang et al,
2006; Kessler and Nicolov, 2009; Jijkoun et al,
2010) often extract opinion patterns by frequency.
However, some high-frequency syntactic patterns
can have very poor precision (Kessler and Nicolov,
2009).
False Opinion Targets: In another case, the
phrase ?wonderful time? can be matched by
an opinion pattern ?Adj-{mod}-Noun?, which is
widely used in previous works (Popescu and Et-
zioni, 2005; Qiu et al, 2009). As can be seen, this
phrase does express a positive opinion but unfortu-
nately ?time? is not a valid opinion target for most
domains such as MP3. Thus, false opinion targets
are extracted. Due to the lack of ground-truth
knowledge for opinion targets, non-target terms
introduced in this way can be hardly filtered out.
Long-tail Opinion Targets: We further no-
tice that previous works prone to extract opinion
targets with high frequency (Hu and Liu, 2004;
Popescu and Etzioni, 2005; Qiu et al, 2009; Zhu
et al, 2009), and they often have difficulty in iden-
tifying the infrequent or long-tail opinion targets.
1764
To address the problems stated above, this pa-
per proposes a two-stage framework for mining
opinion words and opinion targets. The under-
lying motivation is analogous to the novel idea
?Mine the Easy, Classify the Hard? (Dasgupta and
Ng, 2009). In our first stage, we propose a Senti-
ment Graph Walking algorithm to cope with the
false opinion relation problem, which mines easy
cases of opinion words/targets. We speculate that
it may be helpful to introduce a confidence score
for each pattern. Concretely, we create a Sen-
timent Graph to model opinion relations among
opinion word/target/pattern candidates and apply
random walking to estimate confidence of them.
Thus, confidence of pattern is considered in a uni-
fied process. Patterns that often extract false opin-
ion relations will have low confidence, and terms
introduced by low-confidence patterns will also
have low confidence accordingly. This could po-
tentially improve the extraction accuracy.
In the second stage, we identify the hard cases,
which aims to filter out false opinion targets and
extract long-tail opinion targets. Previous super-
vised methods have been shown to achieve state-
of-the-art results for this task (Wu et al, 2009; Jin
and Ho, 2009; Li et al, 2010). However, the big
challenge for fully supervised method is the lack
of annotated training data. Therefore, we adopt a
self-learning strategy. Specifically, we employ a
semi-supervised classifier to refine the target re-
sults from the first stage, which uses some highly
confident target candidates as the initial labeled
examples. Then opinion words are also refined.
Our main contributions are as follows:
? We propose a Sentiment Graph Walking al-
gorithm to mine opinion words and opinion
targets from reviews, which naturally incor-
porates confidence of syntactic pattern in a
graph to improve extraction performance. To
our best knowledge, the incorporation of pat-
tern confidence in such a Sentiment Graph
has never been studied before for opinion
words/targets mining task (Section 3).
? We adopt a self-learning method for refining
opinion words/targets generated by Sentiment
Graph Walking. Specifically, it can remove
high-frequency noise terms and capture long-
tail opinion targets in corpora (Section 4).
? We perform experiments on three real world
datasets, which demonstrate the effectiveness
of our method compared with state-of-the-art
unsupervised methods (Section 5).
2 Related Work
In opinion words/targets mining task, most unsu-
pervised methods rely on identifying opinion rela-
tions between opinion words and opinion targets.
Hu and Liu (2004) proposed an association mining
technique to extract opinion words/targets. The
simple heuristic rules they used may potentially
introduce many false opinion words/targets. To
identify opinion relations more precisely, subse-
quent research work exploited syntax information.
Popescu and Etzioni (2005) used manually com-
plied syntactic patterns and Pointwise Mutual In-
formation (PMI) to extract opinion words/targets.
Qiu et al (2009) proposed a bootstrapping frame-
work called Double Propagation which intro-
duced eight heuristic syntactic rules. While man-
ually defining syntactic patterns could be time-
consuming and error-prone, we learn syntactic
patterns automatically from data.
There have been extensive works on mining
opinion words and opinion targets by syntac-
tic pattern learning. Riloff and Wiebe (2003)
performed pattern learning through bootstrapping
while extracting subjective expressions. Zhuang
et al (2006) obtained various dependency re-
lationship templates from an annotated movie
corpus and applied them to supervised opinion
words/targets extraction. Kobayashi et al (2007)
adopted a supervised learning technique to search
for useful syntactic patterns as contextual clues.
Our approach is similar to (Wiebe and Riloff,
2005) and (Xu et al, 2013), all of which apply
syntactic pattern learning and adopt self-learning
strategy. However, the task of (Wiebe and Riloff,
2005) was to classify sentiment orientations in
sentence level, while ours needs to extract more
detailed information in term level. In addition,
our method extends (Xu et al, 2013), and we
give a more complete and in-depth analysis on
the aforementioned problems in the first section.
There were also many works employed graph-
based method (Li et al, 2012; Zhang et al, 2010;
Hassan and Radev, 2010; Liu et al, 2012), but
none of previous works considered confidence of
patterns in the graph.
In supervised approaches, various kinds of
models were applied, such as HMM (Jin and Ho,
2009), SVM (Wu et al, 2009) and CRFs (Li et al,
2010). The downside of supervised methods was
the difficulty of obtaining annotated training data
in practical applications. Also, classifiers trained
1765
on one domain often fail to give satisfactory re-
sults when shifted to another domain. Our method
does not rely on annotated training data.
3 The First Stage: Sentiment Graph
Walking Algorithm
In the first stage, we propose a graph-based al-
gorithm called Sentiment Graph Walking to mine
opinion words and opinion targets from reviews.
3.1 Opinion Pattern Learning for Candidates
Generation
For a given sentence, we first obtain its depen-
dency tree. Following (Hu and Liu, 2004; Popescu
and Etzioni, 2005; Qiu et al, 2009), we regard all
adjectives as opinion word candidates (OC) and
all nouns or noun phrases as opinion target can-
didates (TC). A statistic-based method in (Zhu et
al., 2009) is used to detect noun phrases. Then
candidates are replaced by wildcards ?<OC>? or
?<TC>?. Figure 1 gives a dependency tree exam-
ple generated by Minipar (Lin, 1998).

Figure 1: The dependency tree of the sentence
?The style of the screen is gorgeous?.
We extract two kinds of opinion patterns: ?OC-
TC? pattern and ?TC-TC? pattern. The ?OC-
TC? pattern is the shortest path between an OC
wildcard and a TC wildcard in dependency tree,
which captures opinion relation between an opin-
ion word candidate and an opinion target can-
didate. Similarly, the ?TC-TC? pattern cap-
tures opinion relation between two opinion tar-
get candidates.1 Words in opinion patterns are
replaced by their POS tags, and we constrain
that there are at most two words other than
wildcards in each pattern. In Figure 1, there
are two opinion patterns marked out by dash
lines: ?<OC>{pred}(VBE){s}<TC>? for the
?OC-TC? type and ?<TC>{mod}(Prep){pcomp-
n}<TC>? for the ?TC-TC? type. After all pat-
1We do not identify the opinion relation ?OC-OC? be-
cause this relation is often unreliable.
terns are generated, we drop those patterns with
frequency lower than a threshold F .
3.2 Sentiment Graph Construction
To model the opinion relations among opinion
words/targets and opinion patterns, a graph named
as Sentiment Graph is constructed, which is a
weighted, directed graph G = (V,E,W ), where
? V = {Voc ? Vtc ? Vp} is the set of vertices in
G, where Voc, Vtc and Vp represent the set of
opinion word candidates, opinion target can-
didates and opinion patterns, respectively.
? E = {Epo?Ept} ? {Vp?Voc}?{Vp?Vtc}
is the weighted, bi-directional edge set in G,
where Epo and Ept are mutually exclusive
sets of edges connecting opinion word/target
vertices to opinion pattern vertices. Note that
there are no edges between Voc and Vtc.
? W : E ? R+ is the weight function which
assigns non-negative weight to each edge.
For each (e : va ? vb) ? E, where
va, vb ? V , the weight function w(va, vb) =
freq(va, vb)/freq(va), where freq(?) is the
frequency of a candidate extracted by opinion
patterns or co-occurrence frequency between
two candidates.

3.3 Confidence Estimation by Random
Walking with Restart
We believe that considering confidence of patterns
can potentially improve the extraction accuracy.
Our intuitive idea is: (i) If an opinion word/target
is with higher confidence, the syntactic patterns
containing this term are more likely to be used to
express customers? opinion. (ii) If an opinion pat-
tern has higher confidence, terms extracted by this
pattern are more likely to be correct. It?s a rein-
forcement process.
1766
We use Random Walking with Restart (RWR)
algorithm to implement our idea described above.
Let Moc p denotes the transition matrix from Voc
to Vp, for vo ? Voc, vp ? Vp, Moc p(vo, vp) =
w(vo, vp). Similarly, we have Mtc p, Mp oc,
Mp tc. Let c denotes confidence vector of candi-
dates so ctoc, cttc and ctp are confidence vectors for
opinion word/target/pattern candidates after walk-
ing t steps. Initially c0oc is uniformly distributed
on a few domain-independent opinion word seeds,
then the following formula are updated iteratively
until cttc and ctoc converge:
ct+1p = MToc p ? ctoc +MTtc p ? cttc (1)
ct+1oc = (1? ?)MTp oc ? ctp + ?c0oc (2)
ct+1tc = MTp tc ? ctp (3)
where MT is the transpose of matrix M and ? is
a small probability of teleporting back to the seed
vertices which prevents us from walking too far
away from the seeds. In the experiments below, ?
is set 0.1 empirically.
4 The Second Stage: Refining Extracted
Results Using Self-Learning
At the end of the first stage, we obtain a ranked
list of opinion words and opinion targets, in which
higher ranked terms are more likely to be correct.
Nevertheless, there are still some issues needed to
be addressed:
1) In the target candidate list, some high-
frequency frivolous general nouns such as
?thing? and ?people? are also highly ranked.
This is because there exist many opinion ex-
pressions containing non-target terms such as
?good thing?, ?nice people?, etc. in reviews.
Due to the lack of ground-truth knowledge
for opinion targets, the false opinion target
problem still remains unsolved.
2) In another aspect, long-tail opinion targets
may have low degree in Sentiment Graph.
Hence their confidence will be low although
they may be extracted by some high qual-
ity patterns. Therefore, the first stage is in-
capable of dealing with the long-tail opinion
target problem.
3) Furthermore, the first stage also extracts
some high-frequency false opinion words
such as ?every?, ?many?, etc. Many terms
of this kind are introduced by high-frequency
false opinion targets, for there are large
amounts of phrases like ?every time? and
?many people?. So this issue is a side effect
of the false opinion target problem.
To address these issues, we exploit a self-
learning strategy. For opinion targets, we use a
semi-supervised binary classifier called target re-
fining classifier to refine target candidates. For
opinion words, we use the classified list of opin-
ion targets to further refine the extracted opinion
word candidates.
4.1 Opinion Targets Refinement
There are two keys for opinion target refinement:
(i) How to generate the initial labeled data for tar-
get refining classifier. (ii) How to properly repre-
sent a long-tail opinion target candidate other than
comparing frequency between different targets.
For the first key, it is clearly improper to select
high-confidence targets as positive examples and
choose low-confidence targets as negative exam-
ples2, for there are noise with high confidence and
long-tail targets with low confidence. Fortunately,
a large proportion of general noun noises are the
most frequent words in common texts. Therefore,
we can generate a small domain-independent gen-
eral noun (GN) corpus from large web corpora to
cover some most frequently used general noun ex-
amples. Then labeled examples can be drawn from
the target candidate list and the GN corpus.
For the second key, we utilize opinion words
and opinion patterns with their confidence scores
to represent an opinion target. By this means, a
long-tail opinion target can be determined by its
own contexts, whose weights are learnt from con-
texts of frequent opinion targets. Thus, if a long-
tail opinion target candidate has high contextual
support, it will have higher probability to be found
out in despite of its low frequency.
Creation of General Noun Corpora. 1000
most frequent nouns in Google-1-gram3 were se-
lected as general noun candidates. On the other
hand, we added all nouns in the top three levels of
hyponyms in four WordNet (Miller, 1995) synsets
?object?, ?person?, ?group? and ?measure? into
the GN corpus. Our idea was based on the fact that
a term is more general when it sits in higher level
in the WordNet hierarchy. Then inapplicable can-
didates were discarded and a 3071-word English
2Note that the ?positive? and ?negative? here denote opin-
ion targets and non-target terms respectively and they do not
indicate sentiment polarities.
3http://books.google.com/ngrams.
1767
GN corpus was created. Another Chinese GN cor-
pus with 3493 words was generated in the similar
way from HowNet (Gan and Wong, 2000).
Generation of Labeled Examples. Let T =
{Y+1,Y?1} denotes the initial labeled set, where
N most highly confident target candidates but not
in our GN corpora are regarded as the positive ex-
ample set Y+1, other N terms from GN corpora
which are also top ranked in the target list are se-
lected as the negative example set Y?1. The re-
minder unlabeled candidates are denoted by T ?.
Feature Representation for Classifier. Given
T and T ? in the form of {(xi, yi)}. For a target
candidate ti, xi = (o1, . . . , on, p1, . . . , pm)T rep-
resents its feature vector, where oj is the opinion
word feature and pk is the opinion pattern feature.
The value of feature is defined as follows,
x(oj) = conf(oj)?
?
pk freq(ti, oj , pk)
freq(oj)
(4)
x(pk) = conf(pk)?
?
oj freq(ti, oj , pk)
freq(pk)
(5)
where conf(?) denotes confidence score estimated
by RWR, freq(?) has the same meaning as in Sec-
tion 3.2. Particularly, freq(ti, oj , pk) represents
the frequency of pattern pk extracting opinion tar-
get ti and opinion word oj .
Target Refinement Classifier: We use support
vector machine as the binary classifier. Hence, the
classification problem can be formulated as to find
a hyperplane < w, b > that separates both labeled
set T and unlabeled set T ? with maximum mar-
gin. The optimization goal is to minimize over
(T ,T ?,w, b, ?1, ..., ?n, ??1 , ..., ??k):

subject to : ?ni=1 : yi[w ? xi + b] ? 1? ?i
?kj=1 : y?j [w ? x?j + b] ? 1? ??j
?ni=1 : ?i > 0
?kj=1 : ??j > 0
where yi, y?j ? {+1,?1}, xi and x?j represent
feature vectors, C and C? are parameters set by
user. This optimization problem can be imple-
mented by a typical Transductive Support Vector
Machine (TSVM) (Joachims, 1999).
4.2 Opinion Words Refinement
We use the classified opinion target results to re-
fine opinion words by the following equation,
s(oj) =
?
ti?T
?
pk
s(ti)conf(pk)freq(ti, oj , pk)
freq(ti)
where T is the opinion target set in which each el-
ement is classified as positive during opinion tar-
get refinement, s(ti) denotes confidence score ex-
ported by the target refining classifier. Particularly,
freq(ti) =
?
oj
?
pk freq(ti, oj , pk). A higher
score of s(oj) means that candidate oj is more
likely to be an opinion word.
5 Experiments
5.1 Datasets and Evaluation Metrics
Datasets: We select three real world datasets to
evaluate our approach. The first one is called
Customer Review Dataset (CRD) (Hu and Liu,
2004) which contains reviews on five different
products (represented by D1 to D5) in English.
The second dataset is pre-annotated and published
in COAE084, where two domains of Chinese re-
views are selected. At last, we employ a bench-
mark dataset in (Wang et al, 2011) and named it
as Large. We manually annotated opinion words
and opinion targets as the gold standard. Three
annotators were involved. Firstly, two annotators
were required to annotate out opinion words and
opinion targets in sentences. When conflicts hap-
pened, the third annotator would make the final
judgment. The average Kappa-values of the two
domains were 0.71 for opinion words and 0.66
for opinion targets. Detailed information of our
datasets is shown in Table 1.

corpora. Stemming and fuzzy matching are also
performed following previous work (Hu and Liu,
2004).
Evaluation Metrics: We evaluate our method
by precision(P), recall(R) and F-measure(F).
5.2 Our Method vs. the State-of-the-art
Three state-of-the-art unsupervised methods are
used as competitors to compare with our method.
Hu extracts opinion words/targets by using ad-
jacency rules (Hu and Liu, 2004).
DP uses a bootstrapping algorithm named as
Double Propagation (Qiu et al, 2009).
Zhang is an enhanced version of DP and em-
ploys HITS algorithm (Kleinberg, 1999) to rank
opinion targets (Zhang et al, 2010).
Ours-Full is the full implementation of our
method. We employ SVMlight (Joachims, 1999)
as the target refining classifier. Default parameters
are used except the bias item is set 0.
Ours-Stage1 only uses Sentiment Graph Walk-
ing algorithm which does?t have opinion word and
opinion target refinement.
All of the above approaches use same five
common opinion word seeds. The choice of opin-
ion seeds seems reasonable, as most people can
easily come up with 5 opinion words such as
?good?, ?bad?, etc. The performance on five prod-
ucts of CRD dataset is shown in Table 2 and Ta-
ble 3. Zhang does not extract opinion words so
their results for opinion words are not taken into
account. We can see that Ours-Stage1 achieves
superior recall but has some loss in precision com-
pared with DP and Zhang. This may be because
the CRD dataset is too small and our statistic-
based method may suffer from data sparseness.
In spite of this, Ours-Full achieves comparable F-
measure with DP, which is a well-designed rule-
based method.
The results on two larger datasets are shown
in Table 4 and Table 5, from which we can have
the following observation: (i) All syntax-based-
methods outperform Hu, showing the importance
of syntactic information in opinion relation identi-
fication. (ii) Ours-Full outperforms the three com-
petitors on all domains provided. (iii) Ours-Stage1
outperforms Zhang, especially in terms of recall.
We believe it benefits from our automatical pattern
learning algorithm. Moreover, Ours-Stage1 do
not loss much in precision compared with Zhang,
which indicates the applicability to estimate pat-
tern confidence in Sentiment Graph. (iv) Ours-
Full achieves 4-9% improvement in precision over
the most accurate method, which shows the effec-
tiveness of our second stage.
5.3 Detailed Discussions
This section gives several variants of our method
to have a more detailed analysis.
Ours-Bigraph constructs a bi-graph between
opinion words and targets, so opinion patterns
are not included in the graph. Then RWR algo-
rithm is used to only assign confidence to opinion
word/target candidates.
Ours-Stage2 only contains the second stage,
which doesn?t apply Sentiment Graph Walking al-
gorithm. Hence the confidence score conf(?) in
Equations (4) and (5) have no values and they are
set to 1. The initial labeled examples are exactly
the same as Ours-Full. Due to the limitation of
space, we only give analysis on opinion target ex-
traction results in Figure 3.

5.3.1 The Effect of Sentiment Graph Walking
We can see that our graph-based methods (Ours-
Bigraph and Ours-Stage1) achieve higher recall
than Zhang. By learning patterns automatically,
our method captures opinion relations more ef-
ficiently. Also, Ours-Stage1 outperforms Ours-
Bigraph, especially in precision. We believe it is
because Ours-Stage1 estimated confidence of pat-
terns so false opinion relations are reduced. There-
fore, the consideration of pattern confidence is
beneficial as expected, which alleviates the false
opinion relation problem. On another hand, we
find that Ours-Stage2 has much worse perfor-
mance than Ours-Full. This shows the effective-
ness of Sentiment Graph Walking algorithm since
the confidence scores estimated in the first stage
are indispensable and indeed key to the learning
of the second stage.
5.3.2 The Effect of Self-Learning
Figure 4 shows the average Precision@N curve of
four domains on opinion target extraction. Ours-
GN-Only is implemented by only removing 50
initial negative examples found by our GN cor-
pora. We can see that the GN corpora work quite
well, which find out most top-ranked false opin-
ion targets. At the same time, Ours-Full has much
better performance than Ours-GN-Only which in-
dicates that Ours-Full can filter out more noises
other than the initial negative examples. There-
fore, our self-learning strategy alleviates the short-
coming of false opinion target problem. More-
over, Table 5 shows that the performance of opin-
ion word extraction is also improved based on the
classified results of opinion targets.

Figure 5 gives the recall of long-tail opinion
targets5 extracted, where Ours-Full is shown to
have much better performance than Ours-Stage1
and the three competitors. This observation proves
that our method can improve the limitation of
long-tail opinion target problem.

5.3.3 Analysis on Opinion Patterns
Table 6 shows some examples of opinion pattern
and their extraction accuracy on MP3 reviews in
the first stage. Pattern #1 and #2 are the two
most high-confidence opinion patterns of ?OC-
TC? type, and Pattern #3 and #4 demonstrate two
typical ?TC-TC? patterns. As these patterns ex-
tract too many terms, the overall precision is very
low. We give Precision@400 of them, which is
more meaningful because only top listed terms
in the extracted results are regarded as opinion
targets. Pattern #5 and #6 have high precision
on opinion words but low precision on opinion
targets. This observation demonstrates the false
opinion target problem. Pattern #7 is a pattern ex-
ample that extracts many false opinion relations
and it has low precision for both opinion words
and opinion targets. We can see that Pattern #7 has
5Since there is no explicit definition for the notion ?long-
tail?, we conservatively regard 60% opinion targets with the
lowest frequency as the ?long-tail? terms.
a lower confidence compared with Pattern #5 and
#6 although it extracts more words. It?s because
it has a low probability of walking from opinion
seeds to this pattern. This further proves that our
method can reduce the confidence of low-quality
patterns.
5.3.4 Sensitivity of Parameters
Finally, we study the sensitivity of parameters
when recall is fixed at 0.70. Figure 6 shows the
precision curves at different N initial training ex-
amples and F filtering frequency. We can see that
the performance saturates when N is set to 50 and
it does not vary much under different F , showing
the robustness of our method. We thus set N to
50, and F to 3 for CRD, 5 for COAE08 and 10 for
Large accordingly.

6 Conclusion and Future Work
This paper proposes a novel two-stage framework
for mining opinion words and opinion targets. In
the first stage, we propose a Sentiment Graph
Walking algorithm, which incorporates syntactic
patterns in a Sentiment Graph to improve the ex-
traction performance. In the second stage, we pro-
pose a self-learning method to refine the result of
first stage. The experimental results show that our
method achieves superior performance over state-
of-the-art unsupervised methods.
We further notice that opinion words are not
limited to adjectives but can also be other type of
word such as verbs or nouns. Identifying all kinds
of opinion words is a more challenging task. We
plan to study this problem in our future work.
