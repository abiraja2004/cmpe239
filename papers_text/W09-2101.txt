Abstract 
 Proficiency testing is an important ingredient 
in successful language teaching. However, re-
peated testing for course placement, over the 
course of instruction or for certification can be 
time-consuming and costly. We present the 
design and validation of the Versant Arabic 
Test, a fully automated test of spoken Modern 
Standard Arabic, that evaluates test-takers' fa-
cility in listening and speaking. Experimental 
data shows the test to be highly reliable (test-
retest r=0.97) and to strongly predict perform-
ance on the ILR OPI (r=0.87), a standard in-
terview test that assesses oral proficiency. 
1 Introduction 
Traditional high-stakes testing of spoken profi-
ciency often evaluates the test-taker's ability to ac-
complish communicative tasks in a conversational 
setting. For example, learners may introduce them-
selves, respond to requests for information, or ac-
complish daily tasks in a role-play. 
Testing oral proficiency in this way can be 
time-consuming and costly, since at least one 
trained interviewer is needed for each student. For 
example, the standard oral proficiency test used by 
the United States government agencies (the Inter-
agency Language Roundtable Oral Proficiency 
Interview or ILR OPI) is usually administered by 
two certified interviewers for approximately 30-45 
minutes per candidate. 
The great effort involved in oral proficiency in-
terview (OPI) testing makes automated testing an 
attractive alternative. Work has been reported on 
fully automated scoring of speaking ability (e.g., 
Bernstein & Barbier, 2001; Zechner et al, 2007, 
for English; Balogh & Bernstein, 2007, for English 
and Spanish). Automated testing systems do not 
aim to simulate a conversation with the test-taker 
and therefore do not directly observe interactive 
human communication. Bernstein and Barbier 
(2001) describe a system that might be used in 
qualifying simultaneous interpreters; Zechner et al 
(2007) describe an automated scoring system that 
assesses performance according to the TOEFL iBT 
speaking rubrics. Balogh and Bernstein (2007) fo-
cus on evaluating facility in a spoken language, a 
separate test construct that relates to oral profi-
ciency. 
?Facility in a spoken language? is defined as 
?the ability to understand a spoken language on 
everyday topics and to respond appropriately and 
intelligibly at a native-like conversational pace? 
(Balogh & Bernstein, 2007, p. 272). This ability is 
assumed to underlie high performance in commu-
nicative settings, since learners have to understand 
their interlocutors correctly and efficiently in real 
time to be able to respond. Equally, learners have 
to be able to formulate and articulate a comprehen-
sible answer without undue delay. Testing for oral 
proficiency, on the other hand, conventionally in-
cludes additional aspects such as correct interpreta-
tion of the pragmatics of the conversation, socially 
and culturally appropriate wording and content and 
knowledge of the subject matter under discussion. 
In this paper, we describe the design and valida-
tion of the Versant Arabic Test (VAT), a fully 
automated test of facility with spoken Modern 
Standard Arabic (MSA). Focusing on facility 
rather than communication-based oral proficiency 
enables the creation of an efficient yet informative 
automated test of listening and speaking ability. 
The automated test can be administered over the 
telephone or on a computer in approximately 17 
minutes. Despite its much shorter format and con-
strained tasks, test-taker scores on the VAT 
1
strongly correspond to their scores from an ILR 
Oral Proficiency Interview. 
The paper is structured as follows: After re-
viewing related work, we describe Modern Stan-
dard Arabic and introduce the test construct (i.e., 
what the test is intended to measure) in detail (Sec-
tion 3). We then describe the structure and devel-
opment of the VAT in Section 4 and present 
evidence for its reliability and validity in Section 5. 
2 Related Work 
The use of automatic speech recognition appeared 
earliest in pronunciation tutoring systems in the 
field of language learning. Examples include SRI's 
AUTOGRADER (Bernstein et al, 1990), the CMU 
FLUENCY system (Eskenazi, 1996; Eskenazi & 
Hansma, 1998) and SRI's commercial EduSpeak 
system (Franco et al, 2000). In such systems, 
learner speech is typically evaluated by comparing 
features like phone duration, spectral characteris-
tics of phones and rate-of-speech to a model of 
native speaker performances. Systems evaluate 
learners? pronunciation and give some feedback. 
Automated measurement of more comprehen-
sive speaking and listening ability was first re-
ported by Townshend et al (1998), describing the 
early PhonePass test development at Ordinate. The 
PhonePass tests returned five diagnostic scores, 
including reading fluency, repeat fluency and lis-
tening vocabulary. Ordinate?s Spoken Spanish Test 
also included automatically scored passage re-
tellings that used an adapted form of latent seman-
tic analysis to estimate vocabulary scores.  
More recently at ETS, Zechner et al (2007) de-
scribe experiments in automatic scoring of test-
taker responses in a TOEFL iBT practice environ-
ment, focusing mostly on fluency features. Zechner 
and Xi (2008) report work on similar algorithms to 
score item types with varying degrees of response 
predictability, including items with a very re-
stricted range of possible answers (e.g., reading 
aloud) as well as item types with progressively less 
restricted answers (e.g., describing a picture ? rela-
tively predictable, or stating an opinion ? less pre-
dictable). The scoring mechanism in Zechner and 
Xi (2008) employs features such as the average 
number of word types or silences for fluency esti-
mation, the ASR HMM log-likelihood for pronun-
ciation or a vector-based similarity measure to 
assess vocabulary and content. Zechner and Xi 
present correlations of machine scores with human 
scores for two tasks: r=0.50 for an opinion task and 
r=0.69 for picture description, which are compara-
ble to the modest human rater agreement figures in 
this data. 
Balogh and Bernstein (2007) describe opera-
tional automated tests of spoken Spanish and Eng-
lish that return an overall ability score and four 
diagnostic subscores (sentence mastery, vocabu-
lary, fluency, pronunciation). The tests measure a 
learner's facility in listening to and speaking a for-
eign language. The facility construct can be tested 
by observing performance on many kinds of tasks 
that elicit responses in real time with varying, but 
generally high, predictability. More predictable 
items have two important advantages: As with do-
main restricted speech recognition tasks in general, 
the recognition of response content is more accu-
rate, but a higher precision scoring system is also 
possible as an independent effect beyond the 
greater recognition accuracy. Scoring is based on 
features like word stress, segmental form, latency 
or rate of speaking for the fluency and pronuncia-
tion subscores, and on response fidelity with ex-
pected responses for the two content subscores.  
Balogh and Bernstein report that their tests are 
highly reliable (r>0.95 for both English and Span-
ish) and that test scores strongly predict human 
ratings of oral proficiency based on Common 
European Framework of Reference language abil-
ity descriptors (r=0.88 English, r=0.90 Spanish).  
3 Versant Arabic Test: Facility in Mod-
ern Standard Arabic 
We describe a fully operational test of spoken 
MSA that follows the tests described in Balogh and 
Bernstein (2007) in structure and method, and in 
using the facility construct. There are two impor-
tant dimensions to the test's construct: One is the 
definition of what comprises MSA, and the other 
the definition of facility. 
3.1 Target Language: Modern Standard 
Arabic 
Modern Standard Arabic is a non-colloquial lan-
guage used throughout the Arabic-speaking world 
for writing and in spoken communication within 
public, literary, and educational settings. It differs 
from the colloquial dialects of Arabic that are spo-
ken in the countries of North Africa and the Mid-
2
dle East in lexicon and in syntax, for example in 
the use of explicit case and mood marking. 
Written MSA can be identified by its specific 
syntactic style and lexical forms. However, since 
all short vowels are omitted in normal printed ma-
terial, the word-final short vowels indicating case 
and mood are provided by the speaker, even when 
reading MSA aloud. This means that a text that is 
syntactically and lexically MSA can be read in a 
way that exhibits features of the regional dialect of 
the speaker if case and mood vowels are omitted or 
phonemes are realized in regional pronunciations. 
Also, a speaker's dialectal and educational back-
ground may influence the choice of lexical items 
and syntactic structures in spontaneous speech. 
The MSA spoken on radio and television in the 
Arab world therefore shows a significant variation 
of syntax, phonology, and lexicon. 
3.2 Facility 
We define facility in spoken MSA as the ability to 
understand and speak contemporary MSA as it is 
used in international communication for broadcast, 
for commerce, and for professional collaboration. 
Listening and speaking skills are assessed by ob-
serving test-taker performance on spoken tasks that 
demand understanding a spoken prompt, and for-
mulating and articulating a response in real time. 
Success on the real-time language tasks de-
pends on whether the test-taker can process spoken 
material efficiently. Automaticity is an important 
underlying factor in such efficient language proc-
essing (Cutler, 2003). Automaticity is the ability to 
access and retrieve lexical items, to build phrases 
and clause structures, and to articulate responses 
without conscious attention to the linguistic code 
(Cutler, 2003; Jescheniak et al, 2003; Levelt, 
2001). If processing is automatic, the lis-
tener/speaker can focus on the communicative con-
tent rather than on how the language code is 
structured. Latency and pace of the spoken re-
sponse can be seen as partial manifestation of the 
test-taker?s automaticity.  
Unlike the oral proficiency construct that coor-
dinates with the structure and scoring of OPI tests, 
the facility construct does not extend to social 
skills, higher cognitive functions (e.g., persuasion), 
or world knowledge. However, we show below 
that test scores for language facility predict almost 
all of the reliable variance in test scores for an in-
terview-based test of language and communication.  
4 Versant Arabic Test 
The VAT consists of five tasks with a total of 69 
items. Four diagnostic subscores as well as an 
overall score are returned. Test administration and 
scoring is fully automated and utilizes speech 
processing technology to estimate features of the 
speech signal and extract response content. 
4.1 Test Design 
The VAT items were designed to represent core 
syntactic constructions of MSA and probe a wide 
range of ability levels. To make sure that the VAT 
items used realistic language structures, texts were 
adapted from spontaneous spoken utterances found 
in international televised broadcasts with the vo-
cabulary altered to contain common words that a 
learner of Arabic may have encountered.  
Four educated native Arabic speakers wrote the 
items and five dialectically distinct native Arabic 
speakers (Arabic linguist/teachers) independently 
reviewed the items for correctness and appropri-
ateness of content.  Finally, fifteen educated native 
Arabic speakers (eight men and seven women) 
from seven different countries recorded the vetted 
items at a conversational pace, providing a range 
of native accents and MSA speaking styles in the 
item prompts.  
4.2 Test Tasks and Structure 
The VAT has five task types that are arranged in 
six sections (Parts A through F): Readings, Repeats 
(presented in two sections), Short Answer Ques-
tions, Sentence Builds, and Passage Retellings. 
These item types provide multiple, fully independ-
ent measures that underlie facility with spoken 
MSA, including phonological fluency, sentence 
construction and comprehension, passive and ac-
tive vocabulary use, and pronunciation of rhythmic 
and segmental units. 
Part A: Reading (6 items) In this task, test-
takers read six (out of eight) printed sentences, one 
at a time, in the order requested by the examiner 
voice. Reading items are printed in Arabic script 
with short vowels indicated as they would be in a 
basal school reader. Test-takers have the opportu-
nity to familiarize themselves with the reading 
items before the test begins. The sentences are 
relatively simple in structure and vocabulary, so 
they can be read easily and fluently by people edu-
3
cated in MSA.  For test-takers with little facility in 
spoken Arabic but with some reading skills, this 
task provides samples of pronunciation and oral

ding fluency. 
Parts B and E: Repeats (2x15 items) Test-
takers hear sentences and are asked to repeat them 
verbatim. The sentences were recorded by native 
speakers of Arabic at a conversational pace. Sen-
tences range in length from three words to at most 
twelve words, although few items are longer than 
nine words. To repeat a sentence longer than about 
seven syllables, the test-taker has to recognize the 
words as produced in a continuous stream of 
speech (Miller & Isard, 1963). Generally, the abil-
ity to repeat material is constrained by the size of 
the linguistic unit that a person can process in an 
automatic or nearly automatic fashion. The ability 
to repeat longer and longer items indicates more 
and more advanced language skills ? particula
omaticity with phrase and clause structures.  
Part C: Short Answer Questions (20 items) 
Test-takers listen to spoken questions in MSA and 
answer each question with a single word or short 
phrase. Each question asks for basic information or 
requires simple inferences based on time, se-
quence, number, lexical content, or logic. The 
questions are designed not to presume any special-
ist knowledge of specific facts of Arabic culture or 
other subject matter. An English example1 of a 
Short Answer Question would be ?Do you get milk 
from a bottle or a newspaper?? To answer the 
questions, the test-taker needs to identify the words 
in phonological and syntactic context, infer 
and proposition and formulate the answer. 
Part D: Sentence Building (10 items) Test-
takers are presented with three short phrases. The 
phrases are presented in a random order (excluding 
the original, naturally occurring phrase order), and 
the test-taker is asked to respond with a reasonable 
sentence that comprises exactly the three given 
phrases. An English example would be a prompt of 
?was reading - my mother - her favorite maga-
zine?, with the correct response: ?My mother was 
reading her favorite magazine.? In this task, the 
test-taker has to understand the possible meanings 
of each phrase and know how the phrases might be 
combined with the other phrasal material, both 
with regard to syntax and semantics. The length 
and complexity of the sentence that can be built is

Part F: Passage Retelling (3 items) In this fi-
nal task, test-takers listen to a spoken passage 
(usually a story) and then are asked to retell the 
passage in their own words. Test-takers are en-
couraged to retell as much of the passage as they 
can, including the situation, characters, actions and 
ending. The passages are from 19 to 50 words 
long.  Passage Retellings require listening compre-
hension of extended speech and also provide addi-
tional samples of spontaneous speech. Current

4.3 Test Administration 
Administration of the test takes about 17 minutes 
and the test can be taken over the phone or via a 
computer. A single examiner voice presents all the 
spoken instructions in either English or Arabic and 
all the spoken instructions are also printed verba-
tim on a test paper or displayed on the computer 
screen. Test items are presented in Arabic by na-
tive speaker voices that are distinct from the exam-
iner voice. Each test administration contains 69 
items selected by a stratified random draw from a 
large item pool. Scores are available onlin
a few minutes after the test is co

4.5 Automated Scoring 
The VAT?s automated scoring syste
native and non-native responses to the test items 
as well as human ability judgments. 
Data Collection For the development of the 
VAT, a total of 246 hours of speech in response to 
the test items was collected from natives and learn-
ers and was transcribed by educated native speak-
ers of Arabic. Subsets of the response data were 
also rated for proficiency. Three trained native 
speakers produced about 7,500 judgments for each 
of the Fluency and the Pronunciation subscores (on 
a scale from 1-6, with 0 indicating missing data). 
The raters agreed well with one another at r?0.8 
(r=0.79 for Pronunciation, r=0.83 for Fluency). All 
test administrations included in the concurr
idation study (cf. Section 5 below) were ex-
cluded from the training of the scoring system. 
Automatic Speech Recognition Recognition is 
performed by an HMM-based recognizer built us-
ing the HTK toolkit (Young et al, 2000). Three-
state triphone acoustic models were trained on 130 
hours of non-native and 116 hours of native MSA 
speech. The expected resp
m were induced from the transcriptions of native 
and non-native responses. 
Since standard written Arabic does not mark 
short vowels, the pronunciation and meaning of 
written words is often ambiguous and words do not 
show case and mood markings. This is a challenge 
to Arabic ASR, since it complicates the creation of 
pronunciation dictionaries that link a word's sound 
to its written form. Words were represented with 
their fully voweled pronunciation (cf., Vergyri et 
al., 2008; Soltau et al, 2007).  We relied on hand-
corrected automatic diacritization of the standard 
written transcriptions to create fully-voweled 
rds from which phonemic representations were 
automatically created. 
The orthographic transcript of a test-taker utter-
ance in standard, unvoweled form is still ambigu-
ous with regard to the actual words uttered, since 
the same consonant string can have different mean-
ings depending on the vowels that are inserted. 
Moreover, the different words written in this way 
are usually semantically related, making them po-
tentially confusable for language learners. There-
fore, for system development, we transcribed 
words with full vowel marks whenever a vowel 
change would cause a change of meaning. This 
partial voweling procedure deviates from the stan-
dard way of writing, but it facilitated system-
internal comparison of target
ved test-taker utterances since the target pro-
nunciation was made explicit. 
Scoring Methods The Sentence Mastery and 
Vocabulary scores are derived from the accuracy 
of the test-taker's response (in terms of number of 
words inserted, deleted, or substituted by
ate), and the presence or absence of expected 
words in correct sequences, respectively. 
The Fluency and Pronunciation subscores are 
calculated by measuring the latency of the re-
sponse, the rate of speaking, the position and 
length of pauses, the stress and segmental forms of 
the words, and the pronunciation of the segments 
in the words within their lexical and phrasal con-
text. The final subscores are based on a non-linear 
combination of these features. The non-
del is trained on feature values and human 
judgments for native and non-native speech. 
Figure 1 shows how each subscore draws on re-
sponses from the different task types to yield a sta-
ble estimate of test-taker ability. The Pronunciation 
score is estimated from responses to Reading, Re-
peat and Sentence Build items. The Fluency score 
uses the same set of responses as for Pronuncia-
tion, but a different set of acoustic features are ex-
tracted and combined in the score. Sentence 
Mastery is derived from Repeat and
spo ses to the Sho
5 Evaluation 
For any test to be meaningful, two properties are 
crucial: Reliability and validity. Reliability repre-
sents how consistent and replicable the test scores 
are. Validity represents the extent to which one can 
justify making certain inferences or decisions on 
the basis of test scores. Reliability is a necessary 
condition for validity, since 
nts cannot support inferences that would justify 
real-world decision making. 
To investigate the reliability and the validity of 
the VAT, a concurrent validation study was con-
ducted in which a group of test-takers took both 
5
the VAT and the ILR OPI.  If the VAT scores are 
parable t  traditional 
his will be a 
tive functioning in the target language.

com o scores from a reliable
measure of oral proficiency in MSA, t
piece of evidence that the VAT indeed captures 
important aspects of test-takers' abilities in using 
spoken MSA. 
As additional evidence to establish the validity 
of the VAT, we examined the performance of the 
native and non-native speaker groups. Since the 
test claims to measure facility in understanding and 
speaking MSA, most educated native speakers 
should do quite well on the test, whereas the scores 
of the non-native test-takers should spread out ac-
cording to their ability level. Furthermore, one 
would also expect that educated native speakers 
would perform equally well regardless of specific 
national dialect backgrounds and no important 
score differences among different national groups 
of educated native speakers should be observed.  
5.1 Concurrent Validation Study 
ILR OPIs.  The ILR Oral Proficiency Interview is 
a well-established test of spoken language per-
formance, and serves as the standard evaluation 
tool used by United States government agencies 
(see www.govtilr.org). The test is a structured in-
terview that elicits spoken performances that are 
graded according to the ILR skill levels. These 
levels describe the test-taker?s ability in terms of 
communica
e OPI test construct is therefore different from 
that of the VAT, which measures facility with spo-
ken Arabic, and not communicative ability, as 
such. 
Concurrent Sample. A total of 118 test-takers 
(112 non-natives and six Arabic natives) took two 
VATs and two ILR OPIs. Each test-taker com-
pleted all four tests within a 15 day window. The 
mean age of the test-takers was 27 years old (SD = 
7) and the male-to-female split was 60-to-58. Of 
the non-native speakers in this concurrent testing 
sample, at least 20 test-takers were lear
at a llege in the U
ates from the Cen
program. Nine test-takers were recruited at a lan-
guage school in Cairo, Egypt, and the remainder 
were current or former students of Arabic recruited 
in the US. 
Seven active government-certified oral profi-
ciency interviewers conducted the ILR OPIs over 
the telephone. Each OPI was administered by two 
interviewers who submitted the performance rat-
ings independently after each interview. The aver-
age inter-rater correlation 
 average score given by the other two raters 
administering the same test-taker's other interview 
was 0.90. 
The test scores used in the concurrent study are 
the VAT Overall score, reported here in a range 
from 10 to 90, and the ILR OPI scores with levels 
{0, 0+, 1, 1+, 2, 2+, 3, 3+, 4, 4+, 5}2. 
5.2 Reliability 
Sinc each test-
estimate the VAT?s reliability using the test-retest 
method (e.g., Crocker & Algina, 1986: 133). The

score distributions of test-taker 
nistration was found to be at r=0.97, indicating 
high reliability of the VAT test. The scores from 
one test administration explain 0.972=94% of the 
score variance in another test administration to the 
same group of test-takers. 
We also compute the reliability of the ILR OPI 
scores for each test taker by correlating the aver-
ages of the ratings for each of the two test admini-
strations. The OPI scores
us 83% of the variance in the test scores are 
shared by the scores of another administration). 
This indicates that the OPI procedure implemented 
in the validation study was relatively consistent. 
5.3 Validity 
Evidence here for VAT score validity comes from 
two sources: the prediction of ILR OPI scores (as-
sumed for now to be valid) and the performance 
distribution of native and non-native test takers. 
Prediction of ILR OPI Test Scores.  For the 
comparison of the VAT to the ILR OPI, a scaled 
average OPI score was computed for each test-
taker from all the available ILR OPI ratings. The 
scaling was performed using a computer program, 
FACETS, which takes into account rater severity 
and test-taker ability and therefore produces a 
fairer estimate than a simple average (Linacre et 
al., 1990; Linacre, 2003).  
Figure 2 is a scatterplot of the ILR OPI scores 
and VAT scores for the concurrent validation sam-
ple (N=118). IRT scaling of the ILR scores allows 
a mapping of the scaled OPI scores and the VAT 
scores onto the original OPI levels, which are 
given on the inside of the plot axes. The correlation 
coefficient of the two test scores is r=0.87. This is 
roughly in the same range as both the ILR OPI re-
liability and the average ILR OPI inter-rater corre-
lation. The test scores on the VAT account for 76% 
of the variation in the ILR OPI scores (in contrast 
to 83% accounted for by another ILR OPI test ad-
ministration and 81% accounted for by one other 
ILR OPI interviewer). 
The VAT accounts for most of the variance in 
the interview-b
SA  This is one form of confirming evidence that 
AT captures important aspects of
ea ing and listening ability. 
T e close correspondence of the VAT scores 
struct, may come about because candidates easily 
transfer basic social and communicative skills ac-
quired in their native language, as long as they are 
able to correctly and efficiently process (i.e., com-
prehend and produce) the second language. Also, 
highly proficient learners have most likely ac-
quired their skills at least to some extent in social 
interaction with native speakers of their second 
language and therefore know how to interact ap-
propriately. 
Group Performance.  Finally, we examine the 
score distributions for different groups of test-
takers to investigate whether three basic expecta-
tions are met:  
? Native speakers all perform well, while non-
natives show a range of ability levels 
? Non-native speakers spread widely across 
the scoring scale (the test can distinguish 
well between a range of non-native ability   
levels)  
? Native speakers from different countries per-
form similarly (national origin does not pre-
We compare the 
groups in the training data set, which contains 
1309 native and 1337 non-native tests. For each 
test in the data set, an Overall score is computed by 
the trained scoring system on the basis of the re-
corded responses. Figure 3 presents cumulative 
distribution functions of the VAT overall scores, 
showing for each score which percentage of test-
takers performs at or below that level. This figure 
compares two speaker groups: Educated native 
speakers of Arabic and learners of Arabic. The

score distributions of the native speakers and the 
learner sample are clearly different. For example, 
fewer than 5% of the native speakers score below  
70, while fewer than 10% of the learners score 
above 70. Further, the shape of the learner curve 
bution of scores, suggesting 
that the VAT discriminates well in the range of 
. The Mo-
ccan speakers are slightly separate from the other 
native speakers, but only a negligible number of 
them scores lower than 70, a score that less than 
10% of learners achieve.  This finding supports the 
notion that the VAT scores reflect a speaker's facil-
ity in spoken MSA, irrespective of the speaker's 
country of origin. 
6 Conclusion 
We have presented an automatically scored test of 
facility with spoken Modern Standard Arabic 
(MSA). The test yields an ability profile over four 
subscores, Fluency and Pronunciation (manner-of-
speaking) as well as Sentence Mastery and Vo-
cabulary (content), and generates a single Overall 
score as the weighted average of the subscores. We 
have presented data from a validation study with 
native and non-native test-takers that shows the 
VAT to be highly reliable (test-retest r=0.97). We 
also have presented validity evidence for justifying 
the use of VAT scores as a measure of oral profi-
ciency in MSA.  While educated native speakers of 
Arabic can score high on the test regardless of their 
country of origin because they all possess high fa-
cility in spoken MSA, learners of Arabic score dif-
ferently according to their ability levels; the VAT 
test scores account for most of the variance in the 
interview-based ILR OPI for MSA, indicating that 
the VAT captures a major feature of oral profi-
ciency.  
In summary, the empirical validation data sug-
gests that the VAT can be an efficient, practical 
alternative to interview-based proficiency testing 
in many settings, and that VAT scores can be used 
to inform decisions in which a person?s listening 
and speaking ability in Modern Standard Arabic 
should play a part.
