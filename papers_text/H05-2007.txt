Abstract
We describe a method for identifying system-
atic patterns in translation data using part-of-
speech tag sequences. We incorporate this
analysis into a diagnostic tool intended for de-
velopers of machine translation systems, and
demonstrate how our application can be used
by developers to explore patterns in machine
translation output.
1 Introduction
Over the last few years, several automatic metrics for ma-
chine translation (MT) evaluation have been introduced,
largely to reduce the human cost of iterative system evalu-
ation during the development cycle (Papineni et al, 2002;
Melamed et al, 2003). All are predicated on the con-
cept of n-gram matching between the sentence hypoth-
esized by the translation system and one or more ref-
erence translations?that is, human translations for the
test sentence. Although the formulae underlying these
metrics vary, each produces a single number represent-
ing the ?goodness? of the MT system output over a set
of reference documents. We can compare the numbers of
competing systems to get a coarse estimate of their rela-
tive performance. However, this comparison is holistic.
It provides no insight into the specific competencies or
weaknesses of either system.
Ideally, we would like to use automatic methods to pro-
vide immediate diagnostic information about the transla-
tion output?what the system does well, and what it does
poorly. At the most general level, we want to know how
our system performs on the two most basic problems in
translation ? word translation and reordering. Holistic
metrics are at odds with day-to-day hypothesis testing on
these two problems. For instance, during the develop-
ment of a new MT system we may may wish to compare
competing reordering models. We can incorporate each
model into the system in turn, and rank the results on a
test corpus using BLEU (Papineni et al, 2002). We might
then conclude that the model used in the highest-scoring
system is best. However, this is merely an implicit test
of the hypothesis; it does not tell us anything about the
specific strengths and weaknesses of each method, which
may be different from our expectations. Furthermore, if
we understand the relative strengths of each method, we
may be able to devise good ways to combine them, rather
than simply using the best one, or combining strictly by
trial and error. In order to fine-tune MT systems, we need
fine-grained error analysis.
What we would really like to know is how well the
system is able to capture systematic reordering patterns
in the input, which ones it is successful with, and which
ones it has difficulty with. Word n-grams are little help
here: they are too many, too sparse, and it is difficult to
discern general patterns from them.
2 Part-of-Speech Sequence Recall
In developing a new analysis method, we are motivated
in part by recent studies suggesting that word reorder-
ings follow general patterns with respect to syntax, al-
though there remains a high degree of flexibility (Fox,
2002; Hwa et al, 2002). This suggests that in a com-
parative analysis of two MT systems (or two versions of
the same system), it may be useful to look for syntactic
patterns that one system (or version) captures well in the
target language and the other does not, using a syntax-
based, recall-oriented metric.
As an initial step, we would like to summarize reorder-
ing patterns using part-of-speech sequences. Unfortu-
nately, recent work has confirmed the intuition that ap-
plying statistical analyzers trained on well-formed text to
the noisy output of MT systems produces unuseable re-
sults (e.g. (Och et al, 2004)). Therefore, we make the
conservative choice to apply annotation only to the refer-
ence corpus. Word n-gram correspondences with a refer-
ence translation are used to infer the part-of-speech tags
for words in the system output.
The method:
1. Part-of-speech tag the reference corpus. We used

interface uses color to make examples easy to find.
MXPOST (Ratnaparkhi, 1996), and in order to dis-
cover more general patterns, we map the tag set
down after tagging, e.g. NN, NNP, NNPS and NNS
all map to NN.
2. Compute the frequency freq(ti . . . t j) of every possi-
ble tag sequence ti . . . t j in the reference corpus.
3. Compute the correspondence between each hypoth-
esis sentence and each of its corresponding refer-
ence sentences using an approximation to maximum
matching (Melamed et al, 2003). This algorithm
provides a list of runs or contiguous sequences of
words ei . . .e j in the reference that are also present in
the hypothesis. (Note that runs are order-sensitive.)
4. For each recalled n-gram ei . . .e j, look up the asso-
ciated tag sequence ti . . . t j and increment a counter
recalled(ti . . . t j)
Using this method, we compute the recall of tag pat-
terns, R(ti . . . t j) = recalled(ti . . . t j)/freq(ti . . . t j), for all
patterns in the corpus.
To compare two systems (which could include two ver-
sions of the same system), we identify POS n-grams that
are recalled significantly more frequently by one system
than the other, using a difference-of-proportions test to
assess statistical significance. We have used this method
to analyze the output of two different statistical machine
translation models (Chiang et al, 2005).
3 Visualization
Our demonstration system uses an HTML interface to
summarize the observed pattern recall. Based on frequent
or significantly-different recall, the user can select and
visually inspect color-coded examples of each pattern of
interest in context with both source and reference sen-
tences. An example visualization is shown in Figure 1.
