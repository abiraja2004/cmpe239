Context-free grammars have been a cornerstone
of theoretical computer science and computational
linguistics since their inception over half a century
ago. Topic models are a newer development in ma-
chine learning that play an important role in doc-
ument analysis and information retrieval. It turns
out there is a surprising connection between the
two that suggests novel ways of extending both
grammars and topic models. After explaining this
connection, I go on to describe extensions which
identify topical multiword collocations and auto-
matically learn the internal structure of named-
entity phrases.
The adaptor grammar framework is a non-
parametric extension of probabilistic context-free
grammars (Johnson et al, 2007), which was ini-
tially intended to allow fast prototyping of mod-
els of unsupervised language acquisition (John-
son, 2008), but it has been shown to have applica-
tions in text data mining and information retrieval
as well (Johnson and Demuth, 2010; Hardisty et
al., 2010). We?ll see how learning the referents of
words (Johnson et al, 2010) and learning the roles
of social cues in language acquisition (Johnson et
al., 2012) can be viewed as a kind of topic mod-
elling problem that can be reduced to a grammat-
ical inference problem using the techniques de-
scribed in this talk.2 About the Speaker
Mark Johnson is a Professor of Language Science
(CORE) in the Department of Computing at Mac-
quarie University in Sydney, Australia. He was
awarded a BSc (Hons) in 1979 from the Univer-
sity of Sydney, an MA in 1984 from the Univer-
sity of California, San Diego and a PhD in 1987
from Stanford University. He held a postdoc-
toral fellowship at MIT from 1987 until 1988, and
has been a visiting researcher at the University of
Stuttgart, the Xerox Research Centre in Grenoble,
CSAIL at MIT and the Natural Language group
at Microsoft Research. He has worked on a wide
range of topics in computational linguistics, but
his main research areas are computational mod-
els of language acquisition, and parsing and its ap-
plications to text and speech processing. He was
President of the Association for Computational
Linguistics in 2003 and is Vice-President elect of
EMNLP, and was a professor from 1989 until 2009
in the Departments of Cognitive and Linguistic
Sciences and Computer Science at Brown Univer-
sity.References
