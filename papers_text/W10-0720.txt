Abstract
Probabilistic topic models are a popular tool
for the unsupervised analysis of text, providing
both a predictive model of future text and a la-
tent topic representation of the corpus. Recent
studies have found that while there are sugges-
tive connections between topic models and the
way humans interpret data, these two often dis-
agree. In this paper, we explore this disagree-
ment from the perspective of the learning pro-
cess rather than the output. We present a novel
task, tag-and-cluster, which asks subjects to
simultaneously annotate documents and cluster
those annotations. We use these annotations
as a novel approach for constructing a topic
model, grounded in human interpretations of
documents. We demonstrate that these topic
models have features which distinguish them
from traditional topic models.
1 Introduction
Probabilistic topic models have become popular tools
for the unsupervised analysis of large document
collections (Deerwester et al, 1990; Griffiths and
Steyvers, 2002; Blei and Lafferty, 2009). These mod-
els posit a set of latent topics, multinomial distribu-
tions over words, and assume that each document
can be described as a mixture of these topics. With
algorithms for fast approximate posterior inference,
we can use topic models to discover both the topics
and an assignment of topics to documents from a
collection of documents. (See Figure 1.)
These modeling assumptions are useful in the
sense that, empirically, they lead to good models
of documents (Wallach et al, 2009). However, re-
cent work has explored how these assumptions corre-
spond to humans? understanding of language (Chang
et al, 2009; Griffiths and Steyvers, 2006; Mei et al,
2007). Focusing on the latent space, i.e., the inferred
mappings between topics and words and between
documents and topics, this work has discovered that
although there are some suggestive correspondences
between human semantics and topic models, they are
often discordant.
In this paper we build on this work to further
explore how humans relate to topic models. But
whereas previous work has focused on the results
of topic models, here we focus on the process by
which these models are learned. Topic models lend
themselves to sequential procedures through which
the latent space is inferred; these procedures are in
effect programmatic encodings of the modeling as-
sumptions. By substituting key steps in this program
with human judgments, we obtain insights into the
semantic model conceived by humans.
Here we present a novel task, tag-and-cluster,
which asks subjects to simultaneously annotate a doc-
ument and cluster that annotation. This task simulates
the sampling step of the collapsed Gibbs sampler (de-
scribed in the next section), except that the posterior
defined by the model has been replaced by human
judgments. The task is quick to complete and is
robust against noise. We report the results of a large-
scale human study of this task, and show that humans
are indeed able to construct a topic model in this fash-
ion, and that the learned topic model has semantic
properties distinct from existing topic models. We
also demonstrate that the judgments can be used to
guide computer-learned topic models towards models
which are more concordant with human intuitions.
2 Topic models and inference
Topic models posit that each document is expressed
as a mixture of topics. These topic proportions are
drawn once per document, and the topics are shared
across the corpus. In this paper we focus on Latent
Dirichlet alocation (LDA) (Blei et al, 2003) a topic
model which treats each document?s topic assign-
ment as a multinomial random variable drawn from
a symmetric Dirichlet prior. LDA, when applied to a
collection of documents, will build a latent space: a
collection of topics for the corpus and a collection of
topic proportions for each of its documents.

(b) Document Assignments to Topics
Figure 1: The latent space of a topic model consists of topics, which are distributions over words, and a distribution
over these topics for each document. On the left are three topics from a fifty topic LDA model trained on articles from
the New York Times. On the right is a simplex depicting the distribution over topics associated with seven documents.
The line from each document?s title shows the document?s position in the topic space.
LDA can be described by the following generative
process:
1. For each topic k,
(a) Draw topic ?k ? Dir(?)
2. For each document d,
(a) Draw topic proportions ?d ? Dir(?)
(b) For each word wd,n,
i. Draw topic assignment zd,n?Mult(?d)
ii. Draw word wd,n ? Mult(?zd,n)
This process is depicted graphically in Figure 2. The
parameters of the model are the number of topics,
K, as well as the Dirichlet priors on the topic-word
distributions and document-topic distributions, ? and
?. The only observed variables of the model are
the words, wd,n. The remaining variables must be
learned.
There are several techniques for performing pos-
terior inference, i.e., inferring the distribution over
hidden variables given a collection of documents, in-
cluding variational inference (Blei et al, 2003) and
Gibbs sampling (Griffiths and Steyvers, 2006). In the
sequel, we focus on the latter approach.
Collapsed Gibbs sampling for LDA treats the topic-
word and document-topic distributions, ?d and ?k, as
nuisance variables to be marginalized out. The poste-
rior distribution over the remaining latent variables,

where nd,k denotes the number of words in document
d assigned to topic k and nw,k the number of times

sampling equations,

where the superscript ?d, i indicates that these statis-

tics should exclude the current variable under consid-
eration, zd,i.
In essence, the model performs inference by look-
ing at each word in succession, and probabilistically
assigning it to a topic according to Equation 1. Equa-
tion 1 is derived through the modeling assumptions
and choice of parameters. By replacing Equation 1
with a different equation or with empirical observa-
tions, we may construct new models which reflect
different assumptions about the underlying data.
3 Constructing topics using human judg-
ments
In this section we propose a task which creates a
formal setting where humans can create a latent
space representation of the corpus. Our task, tag-and-
cluster, replaces the collapsed Gibbs sampling step
of Equation 1 with a human judgment. In essence,
we are constructing a gold-standard series of samples
from the posterior.1
Figure 3 shows how tag-and-cluster is presented
to users. The user is shown a document along with its
title; the document is randomly selected from a pool
of available documents. The user is asked to select
a word from the document which is discriminative,
i.e, a word which would help someone looking for
the document find it. Once the word is selected, the
user is then asked to assign the word to the topic
which best suits the sense of the word used in the
document. Users are specifically instructed to focus
on the meanings of words, not their syntactic usage
or orthography.
The user assigns a word to a topic by selecting an
entry out of a menu of topics. Each topic is repre-
sented by the five words occuring most frequently in
that topic. The order of the topics presented to the
user is determined by the number of words in that
document already assigned to each topic. Once an
instance of a word in a document has been assigned,
it cannot be reassigned and will be marked in red
when subsequent users encounter this document. In
practice, we also prohibit users from selecting infre-
quently occurring words and stop words.
1Additionally, since Gibbs sampling is by nature stochastic,
we believe that the task is robust against small perturbations in
the quality of the assignments, so long as in aggregate they tend
toward the mode.
4 Experimental results
We conducted our experiments using Amazon Me-
chanical Turk, which allows workers (our pool of
prospective subjects) to perform small jobs for a fee
through a Web interface. No specialized training
or knowledge is typically expected of the workers.
Amazon Mechanical Turk has been successfully used
in the past to develop gold-standard data for natural
language processing (Snow et al, 2008).
We prepare two randomly-chosen, 100-document
subsets of English Wikipedia. For convenience, we
denote these two sets of documents as set1 and set2.
For each document, we keep only the first 150 words
for our experiments. Because of the encyclopedic
nature of the corpus, the first 150 words typically
provides a broad overview of the themes in the article.
We also removed from the corpus stop words and
words which occur infrequently2, leading to a lexicon
of 8263 words. After this pruning set1 contained
11614 words and set2 contained 11318 words.
Workers were asked to perform twenty of the tag-
gings described in Section 3 for each task; workers
were paid $0.25 for each such task. The number of
latent topics, K, is a free parameter. Here we explore
two values of this parameter, K = 10 and K = 15,
leading to a total of four experiments ? two for each
set of documents and two for each value of K.
4.1 Tagging behavior
For each experiment we issued 100 HITs, leading to
a total of 2000 tags per experiment. Figure 4 shows
the number of HITs performed per person in each
experiment. Between 12 and 30 distinct workers par-
ticipated in each experiment. The number of HITs
performed per person is heavily skewed, with the
most active participants completing an order of mag-
nitude more HITs than other particpants.
Figure 5 shows the amount of time taken per tag,
in log seconds. Each color represents a different
experiment. The bulk of the tags took less than a
minute to perform and more than a few seconds.

selected, e.g., distractors and words previously selected, are shown in red. Once a word is selected, the user is asked to

topic is expressed by the five words which occur most frequently in that topic.

struct a topic model. One way of visualizing a learned
topic model is by examining its topics. Table 1 shows
the topics constructed by human judgments. Each
subtable shows a different experimental setup and
each row shows an individual topic. The five most
frequently occurring words in each topic are shown,
ordered from left to right.
Many of the topics inferred by humans have
straightforward interpretations. For example, the
{november, february, april, august,
december} topic for the set1 corpus with K = 10
is simply a collection of months. Similar topics
(with years and months combined) can be found
in the other experimental configurations. Other
topics also cover specific semantic domains,
such as {president, emperor, politican,
election, government} or {music, pop,
records, singer, artist}. Several of the
topics are combinations of distinct concepts,
such as {catholic, church, film, music,
actor}, which is often indicative of the number of
clusters, K, being too low.
136
Table 2 shows the topics learned by LDA un-
der the same experimental conditions, with the
Dirichlet hyperparameter ? = 0.2 (we justify
this choice in the following section). These
topics are more difficult to interpret than the
ones created by humans. Some topics seem
to largely make sense except for some anoma-
lous words, such as {district, town, city,
local, kolkata} or {school, university,
college, election, born}. But the small
amount of data means that it is difficult for a model
which does not leverage prior knowledge to infer
meaningful topic. In contrast, several humans, even
working independently, can leverage prior knowledge
to construct meaningful topics with little data.
There is another qualitative difference between
the topics found by the tag-and-cluster task and
LDA. Whereas LDA must rely on co-occurrence,
humans can use ontological information. Thus, a
topic which has ontological meaning, such as a list
of months, may rarely be discovered by LDA since
the co-occurrence patterns of months do not form a
strong pattern. But users in every experimental con-
figuration constructed this topic, suggesting that the
users were consistently leveraging information that
would not be available to LDA, even with a larger
corpus.
Hyperparameter values A persistent question
among practitioners of topic models is how to set or
learn the value of the hyperparameter ?. ? is a Dirich-
let parameter which acts as a control on sparsity ?
smaller values of ? lead to sparser document-topic
distributions. By comparing the sparsity patterns of
human judgments to those of LDA for different set-
tings of ?, we can infer the value of ? that would
best match human judgments.
Figure 6 shows a boxplot comparison of the en-
tropy of draws from a Dirichlet distribution (the gen-
erative process in LDA), versus the observed en-
tropy of the models learned by humans. The first
six columns show the distributions for the Dirichlet
draws for various values of ?; the last two columns
show the observed entropy distributions on the two
corpora, set1 and set2.
The empirical entropy distributions across the cor-
pora are comparable to those of a Dirichlet distri-
bution with ? between approximately 0.2 and 0.5.
Table 3: The five words with the highest probability mass
in each topic inferred by LDA on set1 with ? = 0.2,
K = 10, and initialized using human judgments. Each
row is a topic; the most probable words are ordered from
left to right.

These settings of ? are slightly higher than, but still in
line with a common rule-of-thumb of ? = 1/K. Fig-
ure 7 shows the log-likelihood, a measure of model
fit, achieved by LDA for each value of ?. Higher
log-likelihoods indicate better fits. Commensurate
with the rule of thumb, using log-likelihoods to se-
lect ? would encourage values smaller than human
judgments.
However, while the entropy of the Dirichlet draws
increases significantly when the number of clusters
is increased from K = 10 to K = 15, the entropies
assigned by humans does not vary as dramatically.
This suggests that for any given document, humans
are likely to pull words from only a small number of
topics, regardless of how many topics are available,
whereas a model will continue to spread probability
mass across all topics even as the number of topics
increases.
Improving LDA using human judgments The re-
sults of the previous sections suggests that human be-
havior differs from that of LDA, and that humans con-
ceptualize documents in ways LDA does not. This
motivates using the human judgments to augment the
information available to LDA. To do so, we initialize
the topic assignments used by LDA?s Gibbs sampler
to those made by humans. We then run the LDA
sampler till convergence. This provides a method to
weakly incorporate human knowledge into the model.
Table 3 shows the topics inferred by LDA when
initialized with human judgments. These topics re-
semble those directly inferred by humans, although
as we predicted in the previous sections, the topic
consisting of months has largely disappeared. Other
semantically coherent topics, such as {located,

in its place.
Figure 8 shows the log-likelihood course of LDA
when initialized by human judgments (blue), versus
LDA without human judgments (red). Adding hu-
man judgments strictly helps the model converge to
a higher likelihood and converge more quickly. In
short, incorporating human judgments shows promise
at improving both the interpretability and conver-
gence of LDA.
5 Discussion
We presented a new method for constructing topic
models using human judgments. Our approach re-
lies on a novel task, tag-and-cluster, which asks
users to simultaneously annotate a document with
one of its words and to cluster those annotations. We
demonstrate using experiments on Amazon Mechan-
ical Turk that our method constructs topic models
quickly and robustly. We also show that while our
topic models bear many similarities to traditionally
constructed topic models, our human-learned topic
models have unique features such as fixed sparsity
and a tendency for topics to be constructed around
concepts which models such as LDA typically fail to
find.
We also underscore that the collapsed Gibbs sam-
pling framework is expressive enough to use as the
basis for human-guided topic model inference. This
may motivate, as future work, the construction of dif-
ferent modeling assumptions which lead to sampling
equations which more closely match the empirically
observed sampling performed by humans. In effect,
our method constructs a series of samples from the
posterior, a gold standard which future topic models
can aim to emulate.
