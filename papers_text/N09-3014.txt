Abstract
We present a shallow approach to the sentence
ordering problem. The employed features are
based on discourse entities, shallow syntac-
tic analysis, and temporal precedence relations
retrieved from VerbOcean. We show that these
relatively simple features perform well in a
machine learning algorithm on datasets con-
taining sequences of events, and that the re-
sulting models achieve optimal performance
with small amounts of training data. The
model does not yet perform well on datasets
describing the consequences of events, such as
the destructions after an earthquake.
1 Introduction
Sentence ordering is a problem in many natural lan-
guage processing tasks. While it has, historically,
mainly been considered a challenging problem in
(concept-to-text) language generation tasks, more
recently, the issue has also generated interest within
summarization research (Barzilay, 2003; Ji and Pul-
man, 2006). In the spirit of the latter, this paper
investigates the following questions: (1) Does the
topic of the text influence the factors that are im-
portant to sentence ordering? (2) Which factors are
most important for determining coherent sentence
orderings? (3) How much performance is gained
when using deeper knowledge resources?
Past research has investigated a wide range of as-
pects pertaining to the ordering of sentences in text.
The most prominent approaches include: (1) tem-
poral ordering in terms of publication date (Barzi-
lay, 2003), (2) temporal ordering in terms of textual
cues in sentences (Bollegala et al, 2006), (3) the
topic of the sentences (Barzilay, 2003), (4) coher-
ence theories (Barzilay and Lapata, 2008), e.g., Cen-
tering Theory, (5) content models (Barzilay and Lee,
2004), and (6) ordering(s) in the underlying docu-
ments in the case of summarisation (Bollegala et al,
2006; Barzilay, 2003).
2 The Model
We view coherence assessment, which we recast as
a sentence ordering problem, as a machine learning
problem using the feature representation discussed
in Section 2.1. It can be viewed as a ranking task be-
cause a text can only be more or less coherent than
some other text. The sentence ordering task used
in this paper can easily be transformed into a rank-
ing problem. Hence, paralleling Barzilay and Lapata
(2008), our model has the following structure.
The data consists of alternative orderings
(xij , xik) of the sentences of the same document di.
In the training data, the preference ranking of the
alternative orderings is known. As a result, training
consists of determining a parameter vector w that
minimizes the number of violations of pairwise
rankings in the training set, a problem which
can be solved using SVM constraint optimization
(Joachims, 2002). The following section explores
the features available for this optimization.
2.1 Features
Approaches to sentence ordering can generally be
categorized as knowledge-rich or knowledge-lean.
Knowledge-rich approaches rely on manually cre-
ated representations of sentence orderings using do-
78
main communication knowledge.
Barzilay and Lee (2004)?s knowledge-lean ap-
proach attempts to automate the inference of
knowledge-rich information using a distributional
view of content. In essence, they infer a number of
topics using clustering. The clusters are represented
by corresponding states in a hidden Markov model,
which is used to model the transitions between top-
ics.
Lapata (2003), in contrast, does not attempt to
model topics explicitly. Instead, she reduces sen-
tence ordering to the task of predicting the next sen-
tence given the previous sentence, which represents
a coarse attempt at capturing local coherence con-
straints. The features she uses are derived from three
categories - verbs, nouns, and dependencies - all of
which are lexicalised. Her system thereby, to some
extent, learns a precedence between the words in the
sentences, which in turn represent topics.
Ji and Pulman (2006) base their ordering strategy
not only on the directly preceding sentence, but on
all preceding sentences. In this way, they are able to
avoid a possible topic bias when summarizing mul-
tiple documents. This is specific to their approach as
both Lapata (2003)?s and Barzilay and Lee (2004)?s
approaches are not tailored to summarization and
therefore do not experience the topic bias problem.
The present paper deviates from Lapata (2003)
insofar as we do not attempt to learn the ordering
preferences between pairs of sentences. Instead, we
learn the ranking of documents. The advantage of
this approach is that it allows us to straightforwardly
discern the individual value of various features (cf.
Barzilay and Lapata (2008)).
The methods used in this paper are mostly shallow
with the exception of two aspects. First, some of the
measures make use of WordNet relations (Fellbaum,
1998), and second, some use the temporal ordering
provided by the ?happens-before? relation in VerbO-
cean (Chklovski and Pantel, 2004). While the use of
WordNet is self-explanatory, its effect on sentence
ordering algorithms does not seem to have been ex-
plored in any depth. The use of VerbOcean is meant
to reveal the degree to which common sense order-
ings of events affect the ordering of sentences, or
whether the order is reversed.
With this background, the sentence ordering fea-
tures used in this paper can be grouped into three
categories:
2.1.1 Group Similarity
The features in this category are inspired by dis-
course entity-based accounts of local coherence.
Yet, in contrast to Barzilay and Lapata (2008), who
employ the syntactic properties of the respective oc-
currences, we reduce the accounts to whether or not
the entities occur in subsequent sentences (similar
to Karamanis (2004)?s NOCB metric). We also in-
vestigate whether using only the information from
the head of the noun group (cf. Barzilay and Lapata
(2008)) suffices, or whether performance is gained
when allowing the whole noun group in order to de-
termine similarity. Moreover, as indicated above,
some of the noun group measures make use of Word-
Net synonym, hypernym, hyponym, antonym rela-
tionships. For completeness, we also consider the
effects of using verb groups and whole sentences as
syntactic units of choice.
2.1.2 Temporal Ordering
This set of features uses information on the tem-
poral ordering of sentences, although it currently
only includes the ?happens-before? relations in Ver-
bOcean.
2.1.3 Longer Range Relations
The group similarity features only capture the re-
lation between a sentence and its immediate suc-
cessor. However, the coherence of a text is clearly
not only defined by direct relations, but also re-
quires longer range relations between sentences
(e.g., Barzilay and Lapata (2008)). The features in
this section explore the impact of such relations on
the coherence of the overall document as well as the
appropriate way of modeling them.
3 Experiments
This section introduces the datasets used for the ex-
periments, describes the experiments, and discusses
our main findings.
3.1 Evaluation Datasets
The three datasets used for the automatic evaluation
in this paper are based on human-generated texts
(Table 1). The first two are the earthquake and acci-
dent datasets used by Barzilay and Lapata (2008).
79
Each of these sets consists of 100 datasets in the
training and test sets, respectively, as well as 20 ran-
dom permutations for each text.
The third dataset is similar to the first two in that
it contains original texts and random permutations.
In contrast to the other two sources, however, this
dataset is based on the human summaries from DUC
2005 (Dang, 2005). It comprises 300 human sum-
maries on 50 document sets, resulting in a total of
6,000 pairwise rankings split into training and test
sets. The source furthermore differs from Barzilay
and Lapata (2008)?s datasets in that the content of
each text is not based on one individual event (an
earthquake or accident), but on more complex top-
ics followed over a period of time (e.g., the espi-
onage case between GM and VW along with the
various actions taken to resolve it). Since the differ-
ent document sets cover completely different topics
the third dataset will mainly be used to evaluate the
topic-independent properties of our model.

test sets for the three datasets
3.2 Experiment 1
In the first part of this experiment, we consider the
problem of the granularity of the syntactic units to be
used. That is, does it make a difference whether we
use the words in the sentence, the words in the noun
groups, the words in the verb groups, or the words
in the respective heads of the groups to determine
coherence? (The units are obtained by processing
the documents using the LT-TTT2 tools (Grover and
Tobin, 2006); the lemmatizer used by LT-TTT2 is
morpha (Minnen and Pearce, 2000).) We also con-
sider whether lemmatization is beneficial in each of
the granularities.
The results - presented in Table 2 - indicate that
considering only the heads of the verb and noun
groups separately provides the best performance. In
particular, the heads outperform the whole groups,
and the heads separately also outperform noun and
verb group heads together. As for the question
of whether lemmatization provides better results,
one needs to distinguish the case of noun and verb
groups. For noun groups, lemmatization improves
performance, which can mostly be attributed to sin-
gular and plural forms. In the case of verb groups,
however, the lemmatized version yields worse re-
sults than the surface forms, a fact mainly explained
by the tense and modality properties of verbs.

of processing of the training datasets. Accuracy is the
fraction of correctly ranked pairs of documents over the
total number of pairs. (?Heads sentence? is the heads of
NGs and VGs.)
Given the appropriate unit of granularity, we can
consider the impact of semantic relations between
surface realizations on coherence. For these exper-
iments we use the synonym, hypernym, hyponym,
and antonym relations in WordNet. The rationale
for the consideration of semantic relations lies in the
fact that the frequent use of the same words is usu-
ally deemed bad writing style. One therefore tends
to observe the use of semantically similar terms in
neighboring sentences. The results of using seman-
tic relations for coherence rating are provided in Ta-
ble 3. Synonym detection improves performance,
while the other units provide poorer performance.
This suggests that the hypernym and hyponym rela-
tions tend to over-generalize in the semantics.
The third category of features investigated is the
temporal ordering of sentences; we use VerbO-
cean to obtain the temporal precedence between two
events. One would expect events to be described ei-

ther in chronological order or in its reverse. While
the former ordering represents a factual account of
some sequence of events, the latter corresponds to
newswire-style texts, which present the most impor-
tant event(s) first, even though they may derive from
previous events.
Table 4 provides the results of the experiments
with temporal orderings. The first two rows vali-
date the ordering of the events, while the latter two
require the corresponding sentences to have a noun
group in common in order to increase the likeli-
hood that two events are related. The results clearly
show that there is potential in the direct ordering
of events. This suggests that sentence ordering can
to some degree be achieved using simple temporal
precedence orderings in a domain-independent way.
This holds despite the results indicating that the fea-
tures work better for sequences of events (as in the
accident dataset) as opposed to accounts of the re-
sults of some event(s) (as in the earthquake dataset).

Table 5: Effect of longer range relations on coherence
accuracy
The final category of features investigates the de-
gree to which relations between sentences other than
directly subsequent sentences are relevant. To this
end, we explore two different approaches. The first
set of features considers the distribution of entities
within a fixed set of sentences, and captures in how
many different sentences the entities occur. The re-
sulting score is the number of times the entities oc-
cur in N out of M sentences. The second set only
considers the similarity score from the current sen-
tence and the other sentences within a certain range
from the current sentence. The score of this fea-
ture is the sum of the individual similarities. Table 5
clearly confirms that longer range relations are rele-
vant to the assessment of the coherence of text. An
interesting difference between the two approaches is
that sentence similarity only provides good results
for neighboring sentences or sentences only one sen-
tence apart, while the occurrence-counting method
also works well over longer ranges.
Having evaluated the potential contributions of
the individual features and their modeling, we now
use SVMs to combine the features into one com-
prehensive measure. Given the indications from the
foregoing experiments, the results in Table 6 are dis-
appointing. In particular, the performance on the

earthquake dataset is below standard. However, it
seems that sentence ordering in that set is primarily
defined by topics, as only content models perform
well. (Barzilay and Lapata (2008) only perform well
when using their coreference module, which de-
termines antecedents based on the identified coref-
erences in the original sentence ordering, thereby
biasing their orderings towards the correct order-
ing.) Longer range and WordNet relations together
(Chunk+Temp-WN+LongRange+) achieve the best
performance. The corresponding configuration is
also the only one that achieves reasonable perfor-
mance when compared with other systems.
4 Experiment 2
As stated, the ultimate goal of the models presented
in this paper is the application of sentence ordering
to automatically generated summaries. It is, in this
regard, important to distinguish coherence as studied
in Experiment 1 and coherence in the context of au-
tomatic summarization. Namely, for newswire sum-
marization systems, the topics of the documents are

unknown at the time of training. As a result, model
performance on out-of-domain texts is important for
summarization. Experiment 2 seeks to evaluate how
well our model performs in such cases. To this
end, we carry out two sets of tests. First, we cross-
train the models between the accident and earth-
quake datasets to determine system performance in
unseen domains. Second, we use the dataset based
on the DUC 2005 model summaries to investigate
whether our model?s performance on unseen topics
reaches a plateau after training on a particular num-
ber of different topics.
Surprisingly, the results are rather good, when
compared to the poor results in part of the previ-
ous experiment (Table 7). In fact, model perfor-
mance is nearly independent of the training topic.
Nevertheless, the results on the earthquake test set
indicate that our model is missing essential compo-
nents for the correct prediction of sentence order-
ings on this set. When compared to the results ob-
tained by Barzilay and Lapata (2008) and Barzilay
and Lee (2004), it would appear that direct sentence-
to-sentence similarity (as suggested by the Barzilay
and Lapata baseline score) or capturing topic se-
quences are essential for acquiring the correct se-
quence of sentences in the earthquake dataset.
The final experimental setup applies the best

the model generalises as the number of topics in the
training dataset increases. The results - provided in
Table 8 - indicate that very little training data (both
regarding the number of pairs and the number of dif-
ferent topics) is needed. Unfortunately, they also
suggest that the DUC summaries are more similar
to the earthquake than to the accident dataset.
5 Conclusions
This paper investigated the effect of different fea-
tures on sentence ordering. While a set of features
has been identified that works well individually as
well as in combination on the accident dataset, the
results on the earthquake and DUC 2005 datasets are
disappointing. Taking into account the performance
of content models and the baseline of the Barzilay
and Lapata (2008) model, the most convincing ex-
planation is that the sentence ordering in the earth-
quake datasets is based on some sort of topic notion,
providing a variety of possible antecedents between
which our model is thus far unable to distinguish
without resorting to the original (correct) ordering.
Future work will have to concentrate on this aspect
of sentence ordering, as it appears to coincide with
the structure of the summaries for the DUC 2005
dataset.
