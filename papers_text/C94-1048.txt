flY", and "&}i~" (jinshu : human race) as their 
respective quivalencies. Since ".&~i\[(" has notl,- 
ing to do with "~(/,'", race is excluded. We 
call this inethod of looking up ECs in the inverse 
dictionaries when choosing relevant equivalencies 
inverse consultation, and we call the words ob- 
tained by looking up inverse dictionaries the se- 
lection area (SA). Inverse consultation utilizes the. 
structure of dictionaries to measure the nearness 
of the meanings of words in (tiff>rent languages. 
The simplest application of inverse consultation 
is to use Dic~_,~. In the above example, each EC 
is looked up in Dict_,e and the results are com- 
pared with the English equivalencies of ")~'6"" (E); 
namely, competition, contest, and race. The SA of 
eompdt i t lon  is competit ion, contest and match, 
which have tile elements contest and competition 
in common with E (Fig. 2). As compdt i t ion  
derived from competition, competition should be 
put aside, but contest is still left as a common 
element and thus compdt i t ion  is selected as an 
equivalence of '"~(P"'. As for race ,  the SA of 
race  consists  of race and ancestry, whose inter- 
section with E only gives race; so race is judged 
as an inadequate EC. In shorl;, the number of ele- 
ments in common between the selection area and 
E indicates the nearness of the meaning between 
the EC and the original word. 
For the inverse consultation (lmseril)ed above, 
the SA was in English. If we use Dice~j as 
an inverse dictionary successively afl;er consult> 
ing Dic~-.e, then the SA is in Japanese an(1 we 
~f\[' with the SA (Fig. 3). The. SA for eon lpare  " ' '~  ""

There can be a infinit.e number of inverse (:on- 
sultations according to the nmnber of (:onsulte(1 
inverse (tietionaries. If the inverse dictionaries arc 
consulted 'n times, we call the method n ti'mes 
inverse cons'ultation. (/C',,). Which inverse di(:tio- 
nary to use. does not always have a unique answer. 
For IC2 for example, we ntay consulU Di%_** a f  
ter consulting Dicf.-.e with the SA in French. 
2.2 Se lec t ion  Procedure  
Once the SA tbr a give.n woM is obtained, equiv- 
Mencies are selected by handling two collections 
of words. We (:all this process the selection p'ro- 
ced.ure. 
One way to do this is to count the mnnber of 
specific element:s in the SA. For example, if the 
SA is in Japanesc', the number of l.he element ""~?~d 
@"' itself is counted. Another way is to count how 
many parts of words (PWs) are eontMnmd in the 
SA.  " ~a and  "?6" \[ or exaulple, the number o\[' ""'~:" 
contained in the SA is considered (thus "" ..... ~ in 
"~j~'~" iS ;dSO collnl;ed). 
If we handle the meaning of words, a third way 
.v)?.~ in ;t Japalmse Lhesaurns an(1 is to look up ' *'~-" 
COllar how nlal\]y times the synottynls ai)i)ear in 
the $A. For exanq)le, il' ,. is a synonym or 
.,%,k ~" , ~)t.)', , then the numl)e.r of at)i)ear:mces of "~j~ 
~( ~'lfi: z" I ~}:" is added to that of ,g ~ . If we go further 
to h;mdle the meaning, we might as well process 
words by semantic processing. 
Since a kanji is an ideogram, the second method 
also handles the meaning. When 1;11o s(,qection 
area is in English or l"rench, the eorresi)on(ting 
me.tlm(1 is to count morphemes such as "inl;er" 
and "national" for the word "int0.rnationar'. W(; 
are interested in to what extent he method that 
does not (;xplicitly concern the meaning may be 
used to handle the me,ruing of words, lln |;11(; for 
lowing, we. focus on 1;11(; former two inethods.

3 Fundamenta l  Concepts  
3.1. Harmon ized  D ic t ionary  
A bilingual dictionary forms a grN)h whose nodes 
are words and whose })ranches are correspon- 
dences between the words. Branchc's haw; direc- 
tions, which make the graph asymmetric. D:ic.,(1,g 
is a graph with all the tn'anches in Dic> 'v in in- 
verse direction. 
Since the purpose of bil ingual dictionaries is 
to denote the correspondences of words that 
have the same meaning \[tIar83\], it; is Iud.ura\] that 
branches ~re bidirectional. We t;herefore design 
symmetrical dictionaries and we denote, a di(:tio- 
nary from hmguage :c to y as D .... u ,calling it; ;t 
harmonized ictiona'uI. When D,._ ,,/and D:j ,~, are 
construc~;e(1 fi'om the same dictionaries, D!t.**=: 
DTly holds. We remove the overlaps of branches. 
3.2 Syntact i c  Se lect ion P rocedure  
A multiset here is a set in which each element: has 
:~ weight that is a m~tural nmnl)er. The weighl; of 
ml element is defined as the nmnl)er of times it 
appears when looking up words in dietiomwies. 
In the example shown in Fig. 3, the nmltiset SA 
~\[(' with weighl; 2 for eompdt i t ion  ('onsists of " "~ ....
and ")j~J,hi" with weight 3. We denote the. weight: 
of eh;nlent x in multiset X as ba(X,x); for in- 
stance, 5~(SA, ~e)~-Tf~**~ ) = 2. Using the same nota- 
tion, 5a(X, Y)  is defined as ibllows when X and 
Y are multisets: 
~'a(X, Y) = ~ 5a(X, .,) 
yC l  / 
When a mult iset Z consists of" ,,,.,,:zw)~.)q . . . . . .  and ma~z,~'~"" 
the.n G(SA,  Z) = 5. 
The nol;;tl;ion ~b(X, X) represents he sum of the 
weights of the elements that contain PWs of :c 
in Inultiset X. For instance., if PWs are defined 
as k~mji, 5 / . . . . .  ~a, bLot*,~.~q) is 7 by adding 5 (sum of 
weights of elements in the SA that have kmt}i 
"~")  ~ul(l 2 (SlllII Of weights of elemenl:s ht I.he 
SA that have kanji "q""). Using ~lw. same nota- 
l;ion, 5a(X,Y) is defined as fi)llows when X ~md 
Y are multisets: 
eb(X ,V)  :: ~ eb(X,v) 
y~Y 
For instance, 5b(SA, Z) = 12; that is 7 plus 5 
(=~b(SA,'~)).We ,,s  the .,,t~|:i,,,, ~ . s  ~ >-  
ramet;er for ~a or ~5 b. 
3.3 P roper t ies  o f  Inverse  Consu l ta t ion  
In the following, we use Df.~ e ~tn(\[ De__+ j ~ts hlverse 
dictionaries when starting fl'om Japanese words 
:tnd we use Dj_~ e and De_~ f as invers(,, di(:timmries 
when starting Dora French words. French gCs for

This properi;y is cle~u' with symmel,rically strut-.

doe.s not ~dways l)ecome a harmonized ictimu~ry. 
P roper ty  3 If there is (t st'ructure s'u.ch as 
shown in Fig. ~, 5b must bc used as 5 to e:rcl'ude 
ir'rclcva'nl ECs. 
When 5 a is used, t;he SA for two ECs will be ex- 
ael;ly the same, which makes i~. intpossible to dis- 
card inapprol)riate ECs. All.hough this kind of 
structure seems t;o b(.' rare, it cmt exist lw.(:ause of 
the hist:m'ical transition of words. When a sit@e

Although there are other ways to symmetrize dic- 
tionaries, (for example, by removing all branches 
that are not bidirectional), we chose the above 
procedm:es for the lexieographical reason de- 
scribed below \[IlarS3\]. 
There are two kinds of bilingual dictionar- 
ies, one is from ,~ foreign language (f) to the 
nmther language (Die/ ..... ), and tile other is fi'om 
a mother language \[m) to a foreign language 
(Diem_,/). In Dic/  ...... when there are no equiv- 
aleneies in m for a foreign word, the dictionary 
gives its definition or explam~tion of the word in 
m. Therefore, all the foreign words can be con- 
tained in the dictionary. In Dic,r>~f on tl,e other 
hand, if there are no equivalencies in f for a word 
of m, the word itself is often dropped fl'om the 
dictionary. The words contained in the dictionary 
are therefbre a part of m, and Dic ....... f lacks many 
entries. A harmonized ictionary is a solution t;o 
this problem because it contains equiwdenc, ies of 
Dicf_.,~ as entries of Diem--,\]'. 
4.2 Procedure of Inverse Consu l ta t ion  
lh'om Property 1, we use 5a wi~h IC1 and we use 
5b with IC'2. The PW for 5b are defined as for 
lows: 
? Japanese 6353 kanjis. 
? French morphemes \[Mauaa\]. 
1151 prefix and 710 suffix. 
ih'om Property 2, inverse consultation is applied 
to both Japanese and French entries, and then 
tile results are put together to construct a harmo- 
nized dictionary. We denote it as Dj~t or Df_+j. 
Each entry within Dj-+e and Dt--,e is classified 
into one of five types according to the procedure 
used to select its equivaleneies from ECs. 
? Type A A single EC exists and is selected 
unconditionally as the eqnivalence. 
? Type 13 Equiwdeneies 1)y \[CI exist; all are 
selected and the rest of the ECs are discarded. 
? Type C There are no equivalencies by ICt 
but there are by \[C.2 . One third (empirically 
decided) of ECs by 1C2 arc' selected according 
to the wdue of the following fl'action (larger 
ones are seleet:ed): 
Value of flmction 5b 
SA (byte) 
? Type D No equivahmeies by ICt nor by 
IC'2 appeared but there are several ECs. For 
this entry, it is impossible to select the rele- 
wmt equivalencies. 
? Type E There are no ECs. 
Entries of Type A acquire more appropri~te 
equivalencies than do entries of Type B, and en- 
tries of Type B acquire more appropri~d;e equiw> 
lencies t;han do entries of Type C.

The entries tend to have either R1=80%,,~10{1% 
or R1=0%~,20%. Of the latter, some examples 
are listed in Table 5 and 6. For d i s t ique  in Ta- 
ble 5, which is a term in French literature, De~j 
translates it into the term for the corresponding 
kind of Japanese literature. Although it resem- 
bles to the direct translation of d is t ique,  it is 
only an analogy. On the other hand, since the di- 
rect translation of d i s t lque  in the published ic- 
t ionary adopts the concept of French imems, it 
is uncommon and cannot be mtt lerstoo(1  \])y iilOSl; 
Japanese readers. The same is true for bou l ie r  
except that the commml Japanese is indicated in 
a published ictionary. Pu l l  is borrowed front the 
English word pull-over whose direct translation is 
contained in a published dictionary, and it is not 
a common word in Japanese. 
In the first example in Table 6, gr ive is the 
generic name equivalent to th rush, whereas mer le  
is a kind of thrush. The second example shows 
that more equivalencies are found in Dj_d. 
To sum up, the resulting dictionary can be uti- 
lized in conjunction with the published (tictionar- 
ies as follows: 
? To revise the equiwdeneies. 
? To supplement the equivaleneies. 
Sections of the resulting dictionaries is listed 
in Table 7. List 1 is Dj_~, and List 2 is D,+j .  
For each list, entrie.s arc in t;he first row and their 
equiwdeneies are in the third row. Symbols in the. 
second row indicate how approI/riate ach equiv- 
alence is. (Refer to t, he notes beside.) 
6 Re la ted  Work  
The use of a third hmguage English as an inter- 
mediary in the construction of a bilingual diet:to-- 
nary was test;ed manually on a large scale on c(lit- 
ing the Spanish-Japanese (lictionary \[Kuwg0\]. It is 
now a representative middle-sized ictionary hav- 
ing a large quantity of informal;ion. 
Toktmaga nd Tanaka \[Tok90\] tried t;o extract; a 
eonceI)tual dictionary fi'om Japanese-English and 
English-Japanese dictionaries. Although they 
used a concept similar to ours that is the graph 
structure of a dict ionaryrelate(\[  to meaning of 
words, their t?ameworks and final product differ 
frol i l  ol lrs.  
7 Conc lus ion  and  Future  Works  
The i)rol)osed method for using a intermediate 
hmguage to construct a l)ilingu:d dictionary uti- 
lizes the structure of dictionaries and morphemes 
and can choose appropriate equiwdencies for most, 
entries. Comi)aring the resulting dictionary with 
publishe(l dictionaries showed that tiara obtained 
are usefltl for revising and sUi)l)lementing t.he vo- 
cabulary of existing dictionaires. 
To increase the accuracy with which eqniva- 
h',ncie.s can be selected, mistakes in word-to-word 
dictionaries must t)e corrected even if' our method 
may detect aI)i)ropri:~te equiwdeneies. One way 
to do this would be t.o use thesaurus to cheek 
whether the extracted eorresi)ondences are rele- 
wmt. 
Nouns were l;akeu into consideration i tiffs re- 
search, and the next ste I) will be to apply the 
proposed method to other parts of speech. We 
also need to estat/lish a way to handle compom~d 
words in European languages.
