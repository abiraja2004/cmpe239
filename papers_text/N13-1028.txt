Abstract 
Language variations are generally known to 
have a severe impact on the performance of 
Human Language Technology Systems. In or-
der to predict or improve system performance, 
a thorough investigation into these variations, 
similarities and dissimilarities, is required. 
Distance measures have been used in several 
applications of speech processing to analyze 
different varying speech attributes. However, 
not much work has been done on language dis-
tance measures, and even less work has been 
done involving South African languages. This 
study explores two methods for measuring the 
linguistic distance of six South African lan-
guages. It concerns a text based method, (the 
Levenshtein Distance), and an acoustic ap-
proach using extracted mean pitch values. The 
Levenshtein distance uses parallel word tran-
scriptions from all six languages with as little 
as 144 words, whereas the pitch method is 
text-independent and compares mean language 
pitch differences. Cluster analysis resulting 
from the distance matrices from both methods 
correlates closely with human perceptual dis-
tances and existing literature about the six lan-
guages.     
1 Introduction 
The development of objective metrics to assess the 
distances between different languages is of great 
theoretical and practical importance. Currently, 
subjective measures have generally been employed 
to assess the degree of similarity or dissimilarity 
between different languages (Gooskens & 
Heeringa, 2004; Van-Bezooijen & Heeringa, 2006; 
Van-Hout & M?nstermann, 1981), and those sub-
jective decisions are, for example, the basis for 
classifying separate languages, and certain groups 
of language variants as dialects of one another. It is 
well known that languages are complex; they differ 
in vocabulary, grammar, writing format, syntax 
and many other characteristics. This presents levels 
of difficulty in the construction of objective com-
parative measures between languages. Even if one 
intuitively knows, for example, that English is 
closer to French than it is to Chinese, what are the 
objective factors that allow one to assess the levels 
of distance? 
     This bears substantial similarities to the analo-
gous questions that have been asked about the rela-
tionships between different species in the science 
of cladistics. As in cladistics, the most satisfactory 
answer would be a direct measure of the amount of 
time that has elapsed since the languages? first split 
from their most recent common ancestor. Also, as 
in cladistics, it is hard to measure this from the 
available evidence, and various approximate 
measures have to be employed instead. In the bio-
logical case, recent decades have seen tremendous 
improvements in the accuracy of biological meas-
urements as it has become possible to measure dif-
ferences between DNA sequences. In linguistics, 
the analogue of DNA measurements is historical 
information on the evolution of languages, and the 
more easily measured?though indirect measure-
ments (akin to the biological phenotype)?are ei-
ther the textual or acoustic representations of the 
languages in question. 
280
     In the current article, we focus on language dis-
tance measures derived from both text and acoustic 
formats; we apply two different techniques, name-
ly Levenshtein distance between orthographic 
word transcriptions, and distances between lan-
guage pitch means in order to obtain measures of 
dissimilarity amongst a set of languages. These 
methods are used to obtain language groupings 
which are represented graphically using multidi-
mensional scaling and dendrograms?two standard 
statistical techniques. This allows us to visualize 
and assess the methods relative to known linguistic 
facts in order to judge their relative 
reliability(Zulu, Botha, & Barnard, 2008). 
     Our evaluation is based on six of the eleven 
official languages of South Africa.1 The eleven 
official languages fall into two distinct groups, 
namely the Germanic group (represented by Eng-
lish and Afrikaans) and the South African Bantu 
languages, which belong to the South Eastern Ban-
tu group. The South African Bantu languages can 
further be classified in terms of different sub-
groupings: Nguni (consisting of Zulu, Xhosa, Nde-
bele and Swati), Sotho (consisting of Southern So-
tho, Northern Sotho and Tswana), and a pair that 
falls outside these sub-families (Tsonga and Ven-
da). The six languages chosen for our evaluation 
are English, Afrikaans, Zulu, Xhosa, Northern So-
tho (also known as Sepedi) and Tswana, which 
equally represent the three groups; Germanic, 
Nguni and Sotho.  
     We believe that an understanding of these lan-
guage distances is not only of inherent interest, but 
also of great practical importance. For purposes 
such as language learning, the selection of target 
languages for various resources and the develop-
ment of Human Language Technologies, reliable 
knowledge of language distances would be of great 
value. Consider, for example, the common situa-
tion of an organization that wishes to publish in-
formation relevant to all languages in a particular 
multi-lingual community, but has insufficient fund-
ing to do so. Such an organization can be guided 
by knowledge of language distances and mutual 
intelligibility between languages to make an ap-
propriate choice of publication languages. 
     The following sections describe the Levenshtein 
distance and pitch characteristics in detail. There-

 Data for all eleven languages is available on the Lwazi web-
site: (http://www.meraka.org.za/lwazi/index.php).  
after, the paper will present an evaluation on the 
six languages of South Africa, highlighting lan-
guage groupings and proximity patterns. In conclu-
sion, the paper discusses the results.   
2 Theoretical Background 
Orthographic transcriptions are one of the most 
basic types of annotation used for speech transcrip-
tion, and are particularly important in most fields 
of research concerned with spoken language. The 
orthography of a language refers to the set symbols 
used to write a language and includes its writing 
system. English, for example, has an alphabet of 
26 letters which includes both consonants and 
vowels. However, each English letter may repre-
sent more than one phoneme, and each phoneme 
may be represented by more than one letter. In the 
current research, we investigate the use of Le-
venshtein distance on orthographic transcriptions 
for the assessment of language similarities. 
     On the other hand, speech has been and still 
very much is the most natural form of communica-
tion. Prosodic characteristics such as rhythm, stress 
and intonation in speech convey important infor-
mation regarding the identity of a spoken language. 
Results of perception studies on spoken language 
identification confirm that prosodic information, 
specifically pitch and intensity?which represent 
intonation and stress respectively?are useful for 
language identification (Kometsu, Mori, Arai, & 
Murahara, 2001; Mori et al, 1999). This paper pre-
sents a preliminary investigation of pitch and its 
role in determining acoustic based language dis-
tances.    
2.1 Levenshtein Distance 
There are several ways in which phoneticians have 
tried to measure the distance between two linguis-
tic entities, most of which are based on the descrip-
tion of sounds via various representations. This 
section introduces the Levenshtein Distance Meas-
ure, one of the more popular sequence-based dis-
tance measures. In 1995 Kessler introduced the use 
of the Levenshtein Distance as a tool for measuring 
linguistic distances between dialects (Kessler, 
1995). The basic idea behind the Levenshtein Dis-
tance is to imagine that one is rewriting or trans-
forming one string into another. Kessler 
successfully applied the Levenshtein Distance 
281
measure to the comparison of Irish dialects. In his 
work, the strings were transcriptions of word pro-
nunciations. In general, rewriting is effected by 
basic operations, each of which is associated with a 
cost, as illustrated in Table 1 in the transformation 
of the string ?mo?emane? to the string ?umfana?, 
which are both orthographic translations of the 
word boy in Northern Sotho and Zulu respectively.

Table 1. Levenshtein Distance between two strings. 
 
The Levenshtein Distance between two strings can 
be defined as the least costly sum of costs needed 
to transform one string into another. In Table 1, the 
transformations shown are associated with costs 
derived from operations performed on the strings.  
The operations used are: (i) the deletion of a single 
symbol, (ii) the insertion of a single symbol, and 
(iii) the substitution of one symbol for another 
(Kruskal, 1999). The edit distance method was also 
taken up by (Nerbonne et al, 1996) who applied it 
to Dutch dialects. Whereas Kruskal (1999) and 
Nerbonne et al (1996) applied this method to pho-
netic transcriptions in which the symbols repre-
sented sounds, here the symbols were associated 
with alphabetic letters. 
     Similarly, Gooskens and Heeringa (2004) cal-
culated Levenshtein Distances between 15 Norwe-
gian dialects and compared them to the distances 
as perceived by Norwegian listeners. This compar-
ison showed a high correlation between the Le-
venshtein distances and the perceptual distances.  
2.2 Language pitch distance 
Speech is primarily intended to convey some mes-
sage through a sequence of legal sound units in a 
language. However, speech cannot merely be char-
acterized as a sequence of sound units. There are 
some characteristics that lend naturalness to 
speech, such as the variation of pitch, which pro-
vides some recognizable melodic properties to 
spoken language. This controlled modulation of 
pitch is referred to as intonation. The sound units 
are shortened or lengthened in accordance to some 
underlying pattern giving rhythmic properties to 
speech. The information attained from these 
rhythmic patterns increases the intelligibility of 
spoken languages, enabling the listener to segment 
continuous speech into phrases and words with 
ease (Shriberg, Stolcke, Hakkani-Tur, & Tur, 
2000). The characteristics that make us perceive 
this and other information such as stress, accent 
and emotion are collectively referred to as prosody. 
Comparisons have shown that languages differ 
greatly in their prosodic features (Hirst & Cristo, 
1998), therefore providing a basis for objective 
comparison between languages. Further, pitch is a 
perceptual attribute of sound, the physical correlate 
of which is fundamental frequency (F0), which rep-
resents vibration of the vocal folds.  
     This paper extracts pitch contours from six dif-
ferent languages, and uses the mean fundamental 
frequency values for each language to calculate the 
differences in pitch amongst them. From this we 
derive a distance matrix of F0 dissimilarities (dif-
ferences) which in turn is used to obtain language 
groupings.     
2.3 Language Clustering 
In using the Levenshtein Distance measure, the 
distance between two languages is equal to the av-
erage of a sample of Levenshtein Distances of cor-
responding word pairs. With pitch, the distance 
between two languages is merely the difference 
between the mean fundamental frequencies of the 
two languages. When we have n languages, then 
these distances are calculated for each possible pair 
of languages. For n languages n x n distances can 
be calculated. The corresponding distances are ar-
ranged in an n x n matrix. The distance of each 
language with respect to itself is found in the dis-
tance matrix on the diagonal from the upper left to 
the lower right. As this is a dissimilarity matrix, 
these values are always zero and therefore give no 
real information, so that only n x (n - 1) distances 
are relevant. Furthermore, both the Levenshtein 
and pitch distances are symmetric, implying that 
the distance between language X and Y is equal to 
the distance between language Y and X. Therefore, 
the distance matrix is symmetric. We need to use 
only one half which contains (n x (n - 1))/2 dis-
282
tances. Given the distance matrix, groups of larger 
sizes are investigated. Hierarchical clustering 
methods are employed to classify the languages 
into related language groups using the distance 
matrix. 
     Data clustering is a common technique for sta-
tistical data analysis, which is used in many fields 
including machine learning, bioinformatics, image 
analysis, data mining and pattern recognition. 
Clustering is the classification of similar objects 
into different groups, or more precisely, the parti-
tioning of a data set into subsets, so that the data in 
each subset share some common trait according to 
a defined distance measure. The result of this 
grouping is usually illustrated as a dendrogram; a 
tree diagram used to illustrate the arrangement of 
the groups produced by a clustering algorithm 
(Heeringa & Gooskens, 2003), whereas multidi-
mensional scaling adds to illustrate the visualiza-
tion of the language proximities in a 2-dimensional 
space. 
3 Evaluation 
This evaluation aims to present language groups of 
the six chosen languages of South Africa generated 
from dissimilarity matrices of the languages. These 
matrices are the results of Levenshtein distance 
and average pitch distance measurements. The dia-
grams provide visual representations of the pattern 
of similarities and dissimilarities between the lan-
guages.  
3.1 Language grouping using Levenshtein 
distance 
Levenshtein distances were calculated using exist-
ing parallel orthographic word transcriptions of 
144 words from each of the six languages. The 
data was manually collected from various multilin-
gual dictionaries and online resources.  Initially, 
200 common English words, mostly common 
nouns easily translated into the other five lan-
guages, were chosen. From this set, those words 
having unique translations into each of the other 
five languages were selected, resulting in 144 
words that were used in the evaluations. Examples 
of four word translations in all six languages are 
shown in Table 2.

Distance matrix 
Table 3 represents the distance matrix, containing 
the distances, taken pair-wise, between the differ-
ent languages as calculated from the summed Le-
venshtein Distances between the 144 target words. 
The zero values along the diagonal axis of the ma-
trix indicate no dissimilarity, making it clear that 
higher values reveal high levels of dissimilarity 
between the paired languages. The distance matrix 
contains n x (n ? 1)/2 independent elements in light 
of the symmetry of the distance measure.

Graphical representation  
The confusion matrices provide a clear indication 
of the ways the languages group into families. 
These relationships can be represented visually 
using graphical techniques. Multidimensional scal-
ing (MDS) is a technique used in data visualization 
for exploring the properties of data in high-
dimensional spaces. The algorithm uses a matrix of 
dissimilarities between items and then assigns each 
item a location in a low dimensional space to 
match those distances as closely as possible. The 
study used the dissimilarity matrix to serve as a 
measure between languages, and used the statisti-
cal package XLSTAT (XLSTAT, 2012). The dis-
similarity matrix was input into the 
multidimensional scaling algorithm which mapped 
the language dissimilarities in a 2-dimensional 
space. 
283
     Figure 1 shows the mapping that was created 
using the dissimilarity matrix in Table 3; we can 
see that the languages from the same subfamilies 
group together. The mapping using just 144 words 
shows a definite grouping of the families. In the 
mapping the Sotho languages are more closely re-
lated internally than both the Nguni and Germanic 
languages as expected ? from the historical record 
(Heine & Nurse, 2000), it is clear that a tighter in-
ternal grouping of the Sotho and Nguni languages 
is accurate.

larities between languages calculated from the dissimi-
larity matrix in Table 3. 
 
In conjunction with multidimensional scaling, den-
drograms also provide a visual representation of 
the pattern of similarities or dissimilarities among 
a set of objects. We again used the dissimilarity 
matrix in Table 3 with the statistical package 
XLSTAT. 
     Figure 2 illustrates the dendrogram derived 
from clustering the dissimilarities between the lan-
guages as depicted by the dissimilarity matrix in 
Table 3. The dendrogram shows three classes rep-
resenting the previously defined language group-
ings, Nguni, Sotho and Germanic. This 
dendrogram closely relates to the language group-
ings described in (Heine & Nurse, 2000).

matrix of Table 3. 
 
3.2 Pitch Extraction and language grouping 
The extraction of pitch contours was carried out 
with Praat (Boersma & Weenink, 2011), a free 
scientific software program for the analysis of 
speech and phonetics. The use of Praat is advanta-
geous in that it is fairly easy to use, has high pro-
cessing speed, is accurate and allows scripting, 
which is very useful in processing large numbers 
of files (in our case, speech recordings).  
     A Praat script was written specifying two main 
parameters; the expected minimum and maximum 
pitch values in Hertz, which were selected to be 
75Hz and 600Hz respectively. The extraction of 
pitch contours is based on the detection of perio-
dicities. The Praat command To PointProcess (pe-
riodic, peaks)? analyses the selected speech file 
and creates a sequence of points in time. The 
acoustic periodicity detection is performed on the 
basis of an accurate short-term analysis of the fun-
damental frequency and the harmonics-to-noise 
ratio working in the autocorrelation domain as de-
scribed by Boersma (Boersma, 1993). This method 
was able to achieve more accurate and noise-
resistant results when compared to combs or 
cepstrum based methods (Pokorny, 2011). The ex-
tracted acoustic periodicity contour is interpreted 
as being the frequency of an underlying sequence 
of glottal closures in vocal fold vibrations. For 
each speech file?for every voiced interval?a

number of points representing glottal pulses are 
found and their points in time are saved, forming 
the pitch contour for that particular speech file 
(Pokorny, 2011). Pitch contours were extracted 
from 5000 speech files per language for each of the 
six languages, with each language having approx-
imately 200 different speakers (25 recordings per 
speaker) with a relatively equal distribution of 
males and females, all aged between 18 and 65 
years.  
     The extracted pitch frequency points for all 
5000 files were collected and placed in a single 
array for each language. Each array represents the 
pitch distribution for the specific language, and the 
mean frequency for each language was used to 
model the respective language. The dissimilarity 
matrix was then derived from the differences of 
these means for each pair of languages. Figure 3 
illustrates the distribution of pitch frequencies for 
the selected languages. It clearly shows the relative 
pitch content variations of the different languages, 
which is key to determining the dissimilarity 
amongst the languages. Also of note in Figure 3 
are the peak positions representing approximate 
positions of male and female fundamental frequen-
cies?in the range of 85 to 180Hz for males and 
165 to 255 Hz for females.

between the selected pair of languages.

relative closeness within the three sub-families is 
not as clearly indicated in Figure 4 as in Figure 1,

manic languages branching from the same parent

group from the Bantu languages. Thus, Figure 5

than Figure 2.

Conclusion 
 
Both dissimilarity matrices resulting from the text-
based Levenshtein Distance and the acoustic mean 
pitch frequency differences can effectively be 
combined with multidimensional scaling and den-
drograms to epitomize language relationships. 
Both methods reflect the known family relation-
ships between the languages being studied. The 
main conclusion of this research is therefore that 
statistical methods, used with both text-based and 
acoustic-based methods and data, are able to pro-
vide useful objective measures of language similar-
ities or dissimilarities. It is clear that these methods 
can be refined further using other inputs such as 
phonetic transcriptions or further acoustic meas-
urements; such refinements are likely to be im-
portant when, for example, fine distinctions 
between dialects are required. 
     However, each approach has its advantages and 
disadvantages. Levenshtein Distance measures do 
not require much data to perform a reasonable 
classification of the data. With as few as 50 words 
per language, reasonable classification is possible. 
Also, the process of generating the distance matrix 
is not computationally taxing. However, this meth-
od is less discriminating in assessing languages 
with different writing styles, for example Chinese 
and English. Using pitch bares the advantage of 
using language data in its most natural form, but 
has its disadvantages in being computationally tax-
ing when dealing with large amounts of data?
which is generally required in order to produce 
good results.  
     It would be most interesting to see whether 
closer agreement between these methods can be 
achieved by measuring Levenshtein Distances be-
tween larger text collections?perhaps even paral-
lel corpora rather than translations of word lists. 
Comparing these distance measures with measures 
derived from different acoustic parameters, or a 
combination of parameters, is another pressing 
concern. Finally, it would be valuable to compare 
various distance measures against other criteria for 
language similarity (e.g. historical separation or 
mutual intelligibility) in a rigorous fashion.
