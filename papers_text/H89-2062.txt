Objective: 
The goal of this project is to develop improved acoustic models for speaker-independent 
recognition of continuous peech, together with efficient search algorithms appropriate for 
use with these models. The current work on acoustic modelling is focussed on stochastic, 
segment-based models that capture the time correlation of a sequence of observations (feature 
vectors) that correspond to a phoneme. Since the use of segment models is computationally 
complex, we will also investigate multi-level, iterative algorithms to achieve a more efficient 
search. Furthermore, these algorithms will provide a formalism for incorporating higher- 
order information. This research is jointly sponsored by DARPA and NSF. 
Summary of Accomplishments: 
? Refined the stochastic segment model to model time correlation using a Markov time 
structure and using time-dependent parameter reduction. 
? Investigated the utility of sentence-level duration phenomena for incorporation i  a 
multi-level algorithm. 
? Investigated robust covariance stimates for limited training data. 
? Developed a speaker-independent phoneme classification system that achieves 72% 
accuracy on the TIMIT database. 
? Implement segment-based and HMM-based phoneme recognition systems to better 
understand the relative advantages of these modelling techniques. 
? Evaluate further efinements o the stochastic segment model such as use of different pa- 
rameter estimation methods, alternative variable-to-fixed-length transformations, and 
incorporation of context modelling. 
? Implement a multi-level, iterative search algorithm for phomeme recognition.
