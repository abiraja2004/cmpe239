This paper proposes a method to resolve 
the reference of deictic Japanese zero 
pronouns which can be implemented in
a practical machine translation system. 
This method focuses on semantic and 
pragmatic onstraints uch as semantic 
constraints on cases, modal expressions, 
verbal semantic attributes and conjunc- 
tions to determine the deictic reference 
of Japanese zero pronouns. This method 
is highly effective because the volume of 
knowledge that must be prepared before- 
hand is not very large and its precision 
of resolution is good. This method was 
implemented in the Japanese-to-English 
machine translation system, ALT-J/E. 
According to a window test for 175 zero 
pronouns with deictic referent in a sen- 
tence set for the evaluation of Japanese- 
to-English machine translation systems, 
all of zero pronouns could be resolved 
consistently and correctly. 
1 In t roduct ion  
In all natural anguage, elements that can be eas- 
ily deduced by the reader are frequently omitted 
from expressions in texts (Kuno, 1978). This phe- 
nomenon causes considerable problems in natural 
language processing systems. For example in a 
machine translation system, the system needs to 
recognize that elements which are not present in 
the source language, may become mandatory el- 
ements in the target language. In particular, the 
subject and object are often omitted in Japanese; 
whereas they are often mandatory in English. 
Thus, in Japanese-to-English machine translation 
systems, it is necessary to identify case elements 
omitted from the original Japanese (these are re- 
ferred to as "zero pronouns") for their translation 
into English expressions. 
Several methods have been proposed with re- 
gard to this problem (Kameyama, 1986) (Walker 
et al, 1990) (Yoshimoto, 1988) (Dousaka, 1994). 
When considering the application of these meth- 
ods to a practical machine translation system for 
which the translation target area can not be lim- 
ited, it is not possible to apply them directly, both 
because their precision of resolution is low as they 
only use limited information, and because the vol- 
ume of knowledge that must be prepared betbre- 
hand is so large. 
The zero pronouns that must be resolved by a 
machine translation system carl be classitied into 3 
types; (a) zero pronouns with antecedents within 
the same sentence (intrasenteutial), (b) zero pro- 
nouns with antecedents elsewhere in the text (in- 
tersentential) and (c) zero pronouns with deictic 
reference (extrasentential). Regarding type (b), 
Nakaiwa and Ikehara (1992) proposed a method 
to determine the intersentential ntecedents us-- 
ing verbal semantic attributes. The rules used 
in this method are independent of the field of 
the source text. Therefore, anaphora resolution 
may be conducted with a relatively small volume 
of knowledge, making the proposed method very 
suitable for machine translation systems. Further- 
more, for type (a), Nakaiwa and \[kehara(1995) 
proposed a method to determine the intrasenten- 
tim antecedents of Japanese zero pronouns using 
semantic onstraints uch as verbal semantic at- 
tributes and pragmatic onstraints uch as types 
of conjunctions and modal expressions. 
In this paper, we propose a widely applica- 
ble method to determine the deictic referents of 
Japanese zero pronouns (type (c)) using not only 
semantic onstraints to the c~es but also fln:ther 
semantic onstraints uch as verbal semantic at- 
tributes and pragmatic onstraints such as modal 
expressions and types of conjunctions. 
2 Appearance  o f  Zero  P ronouns  in  
Japanese Texts 
In order to understand the distribution of zero 
pronouns with antecedents hat do not appeal" in 
the text, in this section, we examine which zero 
pronouns nmst be resolved and where their an- 
tecedents appear, using a test set designed to eval- 
uate the performance of Japanese-to-English ma- 
812 
chine translat ion systems ( lkehara et al, 1994). 
' l 'he results of the examinat ion of zero pronouns 
and their referential elements in the f lmctional 
test sentence set (3718 sentences) are shown in 
Table l. There were ~, total  of 512 zero pronomls 
in 463 sentences. The location of referential ele- 
ments can be divided into 2 kinds: those expressed 
in the same sentence, and those, not expressed in 
the same sentence. 'r im latter were fltrther classi- 
tied into 6 kinds. 
? The zero pronoun is not translated be(:ause the 
passive voi(:e is used. 
? The referent is the writer or speaker, I or a 
grollp~ we. 
? '\['he referent is the reader or hemmer, you, 
? The referent is human but it is not known who 
the human is. 
? The zero pronoun shouhl be translated as it. 
? The rcf(,rent is another specitic element. 
According to this study of the f imctional test 
sentence set, in 373 out of 512 instances (73%) 
the antecedent was not expressed in the sentence. 
Zero pronouns conhl be left unexpressed by con- 
verting the translat ion to the passive voice in 173 
instances (34%). 'Fhe other zero pron(mns, 200 
instances (39%), referred to antecedents that (lid 
not appear in the sentence. \[n 69 ()tit, of the 200 
instances (13%) zero pronouns were th.e subject  of 
the sentence and referred to the writer or speaker 
I or a group we. Further  examinat ion revealed 
that only in these 69 instances did the verb that 
governed them express some modal i ty  such as - 
shilai '- want to -'  or -shiyou 'Let us -'  or the 
verbs were omou ' tMnk'  and other such words in- 
dicating ~TI\]\[INKING ACTION'. Furthermore,  zero 
pronouns that  were the subjects and that referred 
to the reader or hearer you, ainounted to 28 out 
of the 200 instances (5%). In these 28 instances, 
~he verbs that  governed these zero pronouns ex- 
pressed the modal i t ies o f -  subekida 'should'  or 
-s i tehanaranai  'nmst n(it'. Similarly, modal it ies 
and verb types can be used to identify it or the 
'unknown human' .  This tyl)e of zero t)ron(mn 
can be resolved by deducing their referents us- 
ing modal i ty  or categor:ized verl)al semantic at- 
tr i lmtes. 
3 Deictic Resolution of Japanese 
Zero Pronouns 
lhused on the results shown in section 2, we pro- 
pose a method to resolve Japanese zero pronouns 
whose antecedents do not appear  in the texts.

elements to deduce like.ly referents. The semantic 
information used to est imate supplement ing ele- 
ments is similar to the constraints on cases used 
tbr selecting the transfer patterns in a machine 
translation systeln. Figure \[ shows an examph: 
of a transtb.r pat tern  in a Japanese-to-Engl ish tna- 
chine translat ion syst, em for the ,lapanese~ verb iki- 
masu 'gC. Figure 1 shows how, if the ,lapane.se 
verb is ik imasu 'go' and the noun phr~use with a ga 
pc.riMe, which shows a subject,  has the senmntic 
at t r ibute SUBJECT, VEIIICLES OR, ANIMALS~ then 
the verb should be translated as 'go'. In this pat- 
tern, if Lit(; suhject N I beeonles a zero l)ronoun, 
the system tries to est imate the referent using se- 
mantic constraints. But, in this case., it is impos- 
sible to est imate the referent as one type, be.cause 
there are three kinds of semantic constraints. In 
the transfer pattern,  the semantic  constraints are 
left unfulfilled if they are not used in selecting 
the appropr iate translat ion.  So, this method fre- 
quently l)oses di\[\[iculties in pinpoint ing elements 
to be est imated.  
According to die results that  were examined in 
section 2, this type of zero pronoun can be re- 
solved by deducing I;heir reDrents not only /ts- 
ing semantic constraints to the cases but also us- 
ing modal i ty  or categorized verbal semantic ato 
tr ibutes. For example, in this case, it is efl'cetive 
to determine the referents corresponding to ' I '  its- 
ing the verbal semantic at t r ibutes of the pattern,

3.2 De ie t i c  Re, so lu t ion  us ing  Semant ic  
and  Pragmat ic  Const ra in ts  
According to the analysis of the results shown 
in section 2, we found that modal  expressions 
and verbal semantic a.ttribntes are usefltl in (le- 
retraining the dei('tic referents of Japanese zero 
pronouns. Also, we can est imate the types of con- 
jun<:tions that are effe(:tive in determining the tel< 
813 
erents in a complex sentence. In this section, we 
examine three kinds of semantic and pragmatic 
constraints, modal expressions, verbal semantic 
attributes arid conjunctions. 
3.2.1 Const ra in ts  Based  on  Moda l  
Express ions  
Modal expressions in Japanese are expected Co 
be the most powerful constraints for estimating 
deictie reference. For example, in the case of zero 
prononns in ga-cases 'subject',  the referent be- 
comes the writer or speaker, I or a group, we if the 
sentence has the modal expressions, -sitai '4) want 
to -' HOPF, or -silchosii '? want ? to - '  CAUSATIVE 
HOI'E; the referent becomes the reader or hearer, 
you if the sentence has the modal expressions, - 
sileha-ikenai '4) must not -' PR()IIIBIT or -subekida 
'? should -' OBLmA'rmN. If there are no refer- 
eat candidates found within the surrounding text, 
the referents can be determined using the previous 
constraints based on modal expressions. 
3.2.2 Constra ints  based on Verba l  
Smnant ie  At t r ibutes  
Constraints b~sed on verbal semantic attributes 
can be divided into tile \[bllowing two types: 
(1) Constra ints  based on the  types  o f  verbs  
'Give and take' expressions such as the verbs 
moran 'get' and yaru 'give' and transfer expres- 
sions such as the verbs iku 'go' and h'ur'u 'come' 
can deternfine the referents of zero pronouns with- 
out modal expressions. For example, if the ga-case 
(subject) of the sentence whose verb is ,nora'tt 'get' 
becolnes a zero pronoun, the referent becomes 1. 
In the case of verb kuru 'come', the referent be- 
comes an element other than i, tbr example you. 
These kinds of verbs inrplicitly indicate tile rela- 
tionship between the writer/speaker and the ref- 
erent of the ga-case (for example, the empathy 
(Kuno, 1978) or the side of the territory of in- 
fbrmation (Kmnio, 1985)). Based on these prop- 
erties, tire deictic referents of Japanese zero pro- 
nouns (:an be estimated. 
(2) Constra ints  based on the  types  o f  verbs  
and  moda l  express ious  
I,;ven if the referents of zero pronouns (:an not be 
determined using modal expressions or tile types 
of verbs, the referents can sometimes be deter- 
mined using a combination of modal expressions 
and the types of verbs. For example, it1 the fol- 
lowing Japanese expression, the ga-case becomes 
a zero pronoun. 
(1) hon-wo gon-da 
?-SUBJ book-OI3J \]read-PAST 
I read a book. 
In this sentence the experience of the 
writer/speaker, 1 is suitable for the reference of 
the zero pronoun. As shown in this sentence, if 
the ga-c~use in an expression with a verb whose 
semantic attr ibute is ACTION and modal expre.s- 
sion is -ta PAST, becomes a zero pronoun, it will 
be translated by a truman translator ~s 1. In a 
similar way, if the ga-case in an expression with 
a verb whose semantic attr ibute is ACT1ON and 
modal expression is -darou 'will' FSTIMA'FION, be- 
comes a zero l)ronottn, the referent is you. Such 
constraints using both verbal semantic attributes 
and modal expressions can be used to determine 
the deictic reference of 3 apanese zero pronouns. 
To write constraints based on types of verbs eflbx:- 
tively, we used the 97 verbal semantic attributes 
(VSA) proposed by Nakaiwa (1994). 
3.2.3 Const ra in ts  based  on Con junct ions  
Sometimes the deictic referents of Japanese zero 
pronouns can be determined depending on the 
types of conjunctions. The constraints based on 
the Japanese conjunctions can be divided into the 
following two types. 
(1) The  eonst ra ln ts  on  <:as(; shar ing  depend-  
ing on the  types  o f  con junct ions  
Minami (1974) and Takubo (1987) proposed that 
(lilt'event Japanese conjunctions cover or share 
different cases, l,'or example Minanfi divided 
Japanese conjnnctions into three kinds, A, B and 
C. A complex sentence which includes A type 
Japanese conjunctions, such as tsu-Lsu 'while' and 
nagara 'while', shares one ha-case ('l'opie) and one 
ga-ea,se (Subject). In the case of B type Japanese 
conjullctions, stlch a8 lzodc 'because' or tara 'iF, 
one ha.-c~e is shared but not the ga-case. In 
the case of C type J a I)an esc conj u actions, such as 
kcredo 'but '  or kedo 'but', neither the ha-case nor 
the ga-case are necessarily shared. According to 
this classification, if two ga-cases in a complex sin> 
tence joined by an A type Japanese conjunction 
were to become zero pronouns and the referent 
of one of the two zero pronouns wins determined 
by the constraints proposed previously, then the 
referent of the other zero pronoun is the same ref- 
erent. These characteristics of Japanese c(mjunc- 
tions can be used to determine the refit'rents of 
zero pronouns. 
(2) Const ra in ts  based  on con junct ions ,  
inoda l  express ions  and  verba l  semant ic  at- 
tr ibutes 
Sometimes co-occurrence of conjunctions, verbal 
semantic attributes and moda.l expressions in a 
complex sentence determines the meaning of the 
sentence, and sometimes they determine the deic- 
tic referen(;e of zero pronouns in the sentence. For 
example, in the following Japanese expression, th(~ 
subject of the verb ika-nai 'go-not'  becomes a zero 
pronoun but the referent can be determin(;d as the 
writer or speaker, you. 
(2) tokoya-ni ika-nai to, 
?-SUBJ b~'ber-IND-O13 J go-not if 
If you don't go to the tmrber, 
kami-ga boubou-ni-naru 
hair  begin to look unt2dy 
your hair will begin to look untidy. 
814 
This sentence has the meaning that  the wr i te r  
or speaker advises that  if you do not do some- 
thing, a situation will arise. The meaning type of 
a complex sentence can be determined using the 
rules that  the eOBjlIIICtiO\[I is tO ' i f '  and in the sub 
clause ga-case beeoInes a zero pronoun and tile 
meaning; o\[' the verb is ACTION with negation and 
in the main clause the meaning of the verb is A'P- 
'PlLIBU'FE with tnoda\] expression i -uaru  'become'  
AT'I'ItlB U'\['\],', '\['ltA N S FE \[1.. 
'\['he meaning type of a complex sentence can 
he determined using the tblowing ruh'.s: when the 
con.imletion is ' if ' ~md the sill) clause ga-c;~se be- 
(;on~es a zero \ ] \ ]FOl IO/ I l l ,  and the meanil~g of the verb 
is aCTION with negation, and in the main cla.use 
the meaning of the verb is ATTRIBUT\],; with modal  
expression, then n i -naru  q)eeome' is an example 
of  A'\["PI{IBUTE TRANSI,'I~3R. Using these kinds of 
rules, the meaning types o1" complex sentences can 
I)e determined, and the reference of zero pr(m(mns 
c.an be deterufine.d. 
3.3 A lgor i thm 
In this sul)section, we t)ropose an algor ithm for 
the deictic resolution of Japanese zero pronouns 
using the constraints proposed in this section. 
This a lgor i thm was implemented in a Japanese- 
tod,3nglish machine translat ion system, so the only 
zero pron(mns that must be resolved are those tlu~t 
become mandatory  elernents in li\]nglish. To real- 
ize the previously proposed condit ions in an al- 
gorithm, we must consider eases when these tm- 
tece(lelll, s exist in the same selitellCe ;ts well as 
when these antecedents exist in another sent, ences 
in the text, and we must  design the algor ithm to 
increase the eve.rail accuracy of the resolution of 
zero pronouns. 
Anaphora  resolution of zero pronouns is con- 
ducted as follows. In each step in the algorithm, 
when the referential element within or without the 
text is determined,  the system checks not only the 
condit ions that are written in the following algo- 
r ithm, I)ut also the semantic  ondit ions that  verbs 
impose on zero pronouns in tile case elements in 
each pat tern  of the Japanese-to-Engl ish transfer 
dictionaries.

4 Eva luat ion  
4.1 Eva luat ion  Method 
In this section, w('. show the results of evaluation 
of the method that  was proposed above. The 
method to resolve zero pronouns with deictic ref- 
erence was tested using the Japanese-to- l 'hlgl ish 
machine translat ion system AI / \ [ ' - J /F ,  ( lkehara et 
al., 1991). The criteria for tile evaluat ion and pro- 
eedures  used were as folh)ws. 
815 
4.1.1 Reso lut ion  Target  
The target was to resolve successfully the five 
types of zero pronouns (ga-case ~-- 'T' or "we", ga- 
case e- "you" , ga-case +-- HUMAN, ga-case ~-- "it" 
, hi-case ~- "you"; 175 instances). These are the 
zero pronouns with deictic reference found within 
the 512 zero pronouns in the a718 sentence set 
for the evaluation of Japanese-to-English machine 
translation systems. 
4.1.2 Rules to Resolve Zero P ronouns  
The rules to resolve 175 zero pronouns were cre- 
ated by examining these zero pronouns using the 
constraints discussed in section 3 (46 rule@. 
4.1.3 Tests for the Eva luat ion  
'l'o examine the relationship between conditions 
of resolution and accuracy of resolution, we con- 
ducted the following two tests. 
(1) Reso lut ion  aeeuraey for eondit ions of 
resolut ion 
We examined the accuracy of resolution depend- 
ing on the types of conditions in a.naphora reso- 
lutiou such as semantic onstraints to the cases, 
modal expression, verbal semantic attributes and 
conjunctive xpressions. We evaluated the accu- 
racy depending on the types of constraints used. 
(2) Reso lut ion  accuracy  for rule complex i ty  
We examined the accuracy of the resohttions to 
see how they were affected by the complexities of 
the rules that were used in the resolution. In this 
test we evaluated the accuracy using simple, easily 
created and universal rules. 
4.2 Reso lut ion  Accuracy  for Condi t ions  
of Reso lut ion  
To examine the resolution accuracy under differ- 
ent conditions, we examined the accuracy of the 
method proposed in this paper with the tbllowing 
4 kinds of conditions: 
? using conditions of semantic onstraints on cases 
only 
? using conditions of semantic onstraints on cases 
and modal expression 
? using conditions of semantic onstraints on cases, 
modal expression and verbal semantic attributes 
? using conditions of semantic onstraints on cases, 
modal expression, verbal semantic attributes and 
conjunctions 
Table 3 shows the results of the resolution de- 
pending on the types of the rules. As shown in 
tAt the moment, it is difficult to use sentences 
which were not successfully syntactically and semanti- 
cally a.nalyzed for the evaluation of our method. So, to 
evaluate the technical limitation of proposed method, 
we evaluated the resolution accuracy in the sentences 
which were examined to make the 46 rules (window 
test). We will conduct blind tests after we have fin- 
ished debugging the whole system. 
this table, all 175 zero pronouns can be resolved 
using the rules that were proposed in section 3. 
The. introduction of verbal semantic attributes has 
achieved the same accuracy of resolution as the in-- 
troduction of modM expressions (41 entries, 24%). 
From this result, we can say that the verbal se- 
mantic attributes are comparatively as effective 
as modal expressions. The results also show that 
, without using the constraints of conjunctions, 
the accuracy achieved is as high as 85%. 
4.3 Reso lut ion  Accuracy  against  Rule 
Complex i ty  
To examine how the resolution accuracy varied 
according to the complexity of' rules, we tested the 
accuracy of the method proposed in this paper at 
different levels of complexity. The complexities C
were evaluated using the following formula, and 
depended on the number of constraints used. 
C = # of modal const.* 1 + # of VSA coast.* 1 
+ # of conjunctions coast.* 2 
In this formula, 1 in the modal and VSA and 
2 in the conjunction indicate the weights. Be- 
cause conjunction constraints affect both sides of 
the unit sentence, we gave the conjunctions con- 
straints a weight of 2. According to this formula, 
the complexity of a rule that has a constraint fbr 
conjunctions and for VSA in the main clause and 
for modM and VSA in the sub clause, becoines 5(-- 
l(modal)*l + I(VSA)*2 + 2(conjunction)*l). 
Table 4 shows the accuracy of the resolution de- 
pending on the complexities of the rules. 46 kinds 
of rules were used in the deictic resolution of 175 
zero pronouns as shown in |;able 4. The accuracy 
of resolution using rules with complexities of 3 or 
less, is 90%, and the accuracy of resolution us- 
ing rules with complexities of 4 or less, is 95%. 
This result shows that the use of the constraints 
based on modM expressions, VSA and conjunc- 
tions can achieve high accuracy using relatively 
simple rules. 
5 Conclusion 
This paper proposes a powerful method for the 
resolution of Japanese zero pronouns with deic- 
tic reference. It was found possible to resolve all 
of the sentences in the window test where the 
referential elements were not in the sentence re- 
solved. This was achieved by the introduction of 
rules based on four kinds of constraints: seman- 
tic constraints on cases, modal expressions, verbal 
semantic attributes and conjunctions. In the fu- 
ture, we will examine the universality of the rules 
that have been discussed in this paper by applying
