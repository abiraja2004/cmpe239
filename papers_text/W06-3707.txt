Abstract
MedSLT is a unidirectional medical
speech translation system intended for
use in doctor-patient diagnosis dialogues,
which provides coverage of several differ-
ent language pairs and subdomains. Vo-
cabulary ranges from about 350 to 1000
surface words, depending on the language
and subdomain. We will demo both the
system itself and the development envi-
ronment, which uses a combination of
rule-based and data-driven methods to
construct efficient recognisers, generators
and transfer rule sets from small corpora.
1 Overview
The mainstream in speech translation work is for the
moment statistical, but rule-based systems are still a
very respectable alternative. In particular, nearly all
systems which have actually been deployed are rule-
based. Prominent examples are (Phraselator, 2006;
S-MINDS, 2006; MedBridge, 2006).
MedSLT (MedSLT, 2005; Bouillon et al, 2005)
is a unidirectional medical speech translation system
for use in doctor-patient diagnosis dialogues, which
covers several different language pairs and subdo-
mains. Recognition is performed using grammar-
based language models, and translation uses a rule-
based interlingual framework. The system, includ-
ing the development environment, is built on top of
Regulus (Regulus, 2006), an Open Source platform
for developing grammar-based speech applications,
which in turn sits on top of the Nuance Toolkit.
The demo will show how MedSLT can be used
to carry out non-trivial diagnostic dialogues. In par-
ticular, we will demonstrate how an integrated intel-
ligent help system counteracts the brittleness inher-
ent in rule-based processing, and rapidly leads new
users towards the supported system coverage. We
will also demo the development environment, and
show how grammars and sets of transfer rules can be
efficiently constructed from small corpora of a few
hundred to a thousand examples.
2 The MedSLT system
The MedSLT demonstrator has already been exten-
sively described elsewhere (Bouillon et al, 2005;
Rayner et al, 2005a), so this section will only
present a brief summary. The main components are
a set of speech recognisers for the source languages,
a set of generators for the target languages, a transla-
tion engine, sets of rules for translating to and from
interlingua, a simple discourse engine for dealing
with context-dependent translation, and a top-level
which manages the information flow between the
other modules and the user.
MedSLT also includes an intelligent help mod-
ule, which adds robustness to the system and guides
the user towards the supported coverage. The help
module uses a backup recogniser, equipped with a
statistical language model, and matches the results
from this second recogniser against a corpus of utter-
ances which are within system coverage and trans-
late correctly. In previous studies, we showed that
the grammar-based recogniser performs much bet-
ter than the statistical one on in-coverage utterances,
but worse on out-of-coverage ones. Having the help
system available approximately doubled the speed
at which subjects learned, measured as the average
difference in semantic error rate between the results
for their first quarter-session and their last quarter-
session (Rayner et al, 2005a). It is also possible to
recover from recognition errors by selecting a dis-
played help sentence; this typically increases the
number of acceptably processed utterances by about
10% (Starlander et al, 2005).
We will demo several versions of the system, us-
ing different source languages, target languages and
subdomains. Coverage is based on standard exami-
nation questions obtained from doctors, and consists
mainly of yes/no questions, though there is also sup-
port for WH-questions and elliptical utterances. Ta-
ble 1 gives examples of the coverage in the English-
input headache version, and Table 2 summarises
recognition performance in this domain for the three
main input languages. Differences in the sizes of the
recognition vocabularies are primarily due to differ-
ences in use of inflection. Japanese, with little in-
flectional morphology, has the smallest vocabulary;
French, which inflects most parts of speech, has the
largest.
3 The development environment
Although the MedSLT system is rule-based, we
would, for the usual reasons, prefer to acquire these
rules from corpora using some well-defined method.
There is, however, little or no material available for
most medical speech translation domains, including
ours. As noted in (Probst and Levin, 2002), scarcity
of data generally implies use of some strategy to ob-
tain a carefully structured training corpus. If the cor-
pus is not organised in this way, conflicts between
alternate learned rules occur, and it is hard to in-

Table 1: Examples of English MedSLT coverage
duce a stable set of rules. As Probst and Levin sug-
gest, one obvious way to attack the problem is to
implement a (formal or informal) elicitation strat-
egy, which biases the informant towards translations
which are consistent with the existing ones. This is
the approach we have adopted in MedSLT.
The Regulus platform, on which MedSLT
is based, supports rapid construction of com-
plex grammar-based language models; it uses an
example-based method driven by small corpora
of disambiguated parsed examples (Rayner et al,
2003; Rayner et al, 2006), which extracts most of
the structure of the model from a general linguis-
tically motivated resource grammar. The result is
a specialised version of the general grammar, tai-
lored to the example corpus, which can then be com-
piled into an efficient recogniser or into a genera-

tion module. Regulus-based recognisers and gen-
erators are easy to maintain, and grammar struc-
ture is shared automatically across different subdo-
mains. Resource grammars are available for several
languages, including English, Japanese, French and
Spanish.
Nuance recognisers derived from the resource
grammars produce both a recognition string and a
semantic representation. This representation con-
sists of a list of key/value pairs, optionally including
one level of nesting; the format of interlingua and
target language representations is similar. The for-
malism is sufficiently expressive that a reasonable
range of temporal and causal constructions can be
represented (Rayner et al, 2005b). A typical exam-
ple is shown in Figure 1. A translation rule maps
a list of key/value pairs to a list of key/value pairs,
optionally specifying conditions requiring that other
key/value pairs either be present or absent in the
source representation.
When developing new coverage for a given lan-
guage pair, the developer has two main tasks. First,
they need to add new training examples to the
corpora used to derive the specialised grammars
used for the source and target languages; second,
they must add translation rules to handle the new
key/value pairs. The simple structure of the Med-
SLT representations makes it easy to support semi-
automatic acquisition of both of these types of in-
formation. The basic principle is to attempt to find
the minimal set of new rules that can be added to the
existing set, in order to cover the new corpus exam-
ple; this is done through a short elicitation dialogue
with the developer. We illustrate this with a simple
example.
Suppose we are developing coverage for the En-
glish ? Spanish version of the system, and that
the English corpus sentence ?does the pain occur at
night? fails to translate. The acquisition tool first
notes that processing fails when converting from in-
terlingua to Spanish. The interlingua representation
is
[[utterance_type,ynq],
[pronoun,you],
[state,have_symptom],
[symptom,pain],[tense,present],
[prep,in_time],[time,night]]
Applying Interlingua ? Spanish rules, the result is
[[utterance_type,ynq],
[pronoun,usted],
[state,tener],[symptom,dolor],
[tense,present],
[prep,por_temporal],
failed:[time,night]]
where the tag failed indicates that the element
[time,night] could not be processed. The tool
matches the incomplete transferred representation
against a set of correctly translated examples, and
shows the developer the English and Spanish strings
for the three most similar ones, here
does it appear in the morning
-> tiene el dolor por la man?ana
does the pain appear in the morning
-> tiene el dolor por la man?ana
does the pain come in the morning
-> tiene el dolor por la man?ana
This suggests that a translation for ?does the pain
occur at night? consistent with the existing rules
would be ?tiene el dolor por la noche?. The devel-
oper gives this example to the system, which parses
it using both the general Spanish resource grammar
and the specialised grammar used for generation in
the headache domain. The specialised grammar fails
to produce an analysis, while the resource grammar
produces two analyses,
[[utterance_type,ynq],
[pronoun,usted],
[state,tener],[symptom,dolor],
[[utterance_type,ynq],[pronoun,you],[state,have_symptom],
[tense,present],[symptom,headache],[sc,when],
[[clause,[[utterance_type,dcl],[pronoun,you],
[action,drink],[tense,present],[cause,coffee]]]]
Figure 1: Representation of ?do you get headaches when you drink coffee?
[tense,present],
[prep,por_temporal],
[temporal,noche]]
and
[[utterance_type,dcl],
[pronoun,usted],
[state,tener],[symptom,dolor],
[tense,present],
[prep,por_temporal],
[temporal,noche]]
The first of these corresponds to the YN-question
reading of the sentence (?do you have the pain at
night?), while the second is the declarative reading
(?you have the pain at night?). Since the first (YN-
question) reading matches the Interlingua represen-
tation better, the acquisition tool assumes that it is
the intended one. It can now suggest two pieces of
information to extend the system?s coverage.
First, it adds the YN-question reading of ?tiene
el dolor por la noche? to the corpus used to train
the specialised generation grammar. The piece
of information acquired from this example is that
[temporal,noche] should be realised in this
domain as ?la noche?. Second, it compares the cor-
rect Spanish representation with the incomplete one
produced by the current set of rules, and induces a
new Interlingua to Spanish translation rule. This will
be of the form
[time,night] -> [temporal,noche]
In the demo, we will show how the development
environment makes it possible to quickly add new
coverage to the system, while also checking that old
coverage is not broken.
