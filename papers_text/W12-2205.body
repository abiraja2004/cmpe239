Abstract
Lexicons of word difficulty are useful for var-
ious educational applications, including read-
ability classification and text simplification. In
this work, we explore automatic creation of
these lexicons using methods which go beyond
simple term frequency, but without relying on
age-graded texts. In particular, we derive infor-
mation for each word type from the readability
of the web documents they appear in and the
words they co-occur with, linearly combining
these various features. We show the efficacy of
this approach by comparing our lexicon with an
existing coarse-grained, low-coverage resource
and a new crowdsourced annotation.
1 Introduction
With its goal of identifying documents appropriate
to readers of various proficiencies, automatic anal-
ysis of readability is typically approached as a text-
level classification task. Although at least one pop-
ular readability metric (Dale and Chall, 1995) and
a number of machine learning approaches to read-
ability rely on lexical features (Si and Callan, 2001;
Collins-Thompson and Callan, 2005; Heilman et al.,
2007; Petersen and Ostendorf, 2009; Tanaka-Ishii et
al., 2010), the readability of individual lexical items
is not addressed directly in these approaches. Nev-
ertheless, information about the difficulty of individ-
ual lexical items, in addition to being useful for text
readability classification (Kidwell et al., 2009), can
be applied to other tasks, for instance lexical simpli-
fication (Carroll et al., 1999; Burstein et al., 2007).
Our interest is in providing students with educa-
tional software that is sensitive to the difficulty of
particular English expressions, providing proactive
support for those which are likely to be outside a
reader?s vocabulary. However, our existing lexical
resource is coarse-grained and lacks coverage. In
this paper, we explore the extent to which an auto-
matic approach could be used to fill in the gaps of
our lexicon. Prior approaches have generally de-
pended on some kind of age-graded corpus (Kid-
well et al., 2009; Li and Feng, 2011), but this kind
of resource is unlikely to provide the coverage that
we require; instead, our methods here are based on
statistics from a huge web corpus. We show that
frequency, an obvious proxy for difficulty, is only
the first step; in fact we can derive key information
from the documents that words appear in and the
words that they appear with, information that can be
combined to give high performance in identifying
relative difficulty. We compare our automated lexi-
con against our existing resource as well as a crowd-
sourced annotation.
2 Related Work
Simple metrics form the basis of much readability
work: most involve linear combinations of word
length, syllable count, and sentence length (Kincaid
et al., 1975; Gunning, 1952), though the popular
Dale-Chall reading score (Dale and Chall, 1995) is
based on a list of 3000 ?easy? words; a recent re-
view suggests these metrics are fairly interchange-
able (van Oosten et al., 2010). In machine-learning
classification of texts by grade level, unigrams have
been found to be reasonably effective for this task,
outperforming readability metrics (Si and Callan,
2001; Collins-Thompson and Callan, 2005). Var-
33
ious other features have been explored, including
parse (Petersen and Ostendorf, 2009) and coherence
features (Feng et al., 2009), but the consensus seems
to be that lexical features are the most consistently
useful for automatic readability classification, even
when considering non-native readers (Heilman et
al., 2007).
In the field of readability, the work of Kidwell et
al. (2009) is perhaps closest to ours. Like the above,
their goal is text readability classification, but they
proceed by first deriving an age of acquisition for
each word based on its statistical distribution in age-
annotated texts. Also similar is the work of Li and
Feng (2011), who are critical of raw frequency as an
indicator and instead identify core vocabulary based
on the common use of words across different age
groups. With respect to our goal of lowering reliance
on fine-grained annotation, the work of Tanaka-Ishii
et al. (2010) is also relevant; they create a readability
system that requires only two general classes of text
(easy and difficult), other texts are ranked relative to
these two classes using regression.
Other lexical acquisition work has also informed
our approach here. For instance, our co-occurrence
method is an adaption of a technique applied in
sentiment analysis (Turney and Littman, 2003),
which has recently been shown to work for formal-
ity (Brooke et al., 2010), a dimension of stylistic
variation that seems closely related to readability.
Taboada et al. (2011) validate their sentiment lex-
icon using crowdsourced judgments of the relative
polarity of pairs of words, and in fact crowd sourcing
has been applied directly to the creation of emotion
lexicons (Mohammad and Turney, 2010).
3 Resources
Our primary resource is an existing lexicon, pre-
viously built under the supervision of the one of
authors. This resource, which we will refer to
as the Difficulty lexicon, consists of 15,308 words
and expressions classified into three difficulty cate-
gories: beginner, intermediate, and advanced. Be-
ginner, which was intended to capture the vocabu-
lary of early elementary school, is an amalgamation
of various smaller sources, including the Dolch list
(Dolch, 1948). The intermediate words, which in-
clude words learned in late elementary and middle
Table 1: Examples from the Difficulty lexicon

school, were extracted from Internet-published texts
written by students at these grade levels, and then fil-
tered manually. The advanced words began as a list
of common words that were in neither of the origi-
nal two lists, but they have also been manually fil-
tered; they are intended to reflect the vocabulary un-
derstood by the average high school student. Table
1 contains some examples from each list.
For our purposes here, we only use a subset of the
Difficulty lexicon: we filtered out inflected forms,
proper nouns, and words with non-alphabetic com-
ponents (including multiword expressions) and then
randomly selected 500 words from each level for
our test set and 300 different words for our develop-
ment/training set. Rather than trying to duplicate our
arbitrary three-way distinction by manual or crowd-
sourced means, we instead focused on the relative
difficulty of individual words: for each word in each
of the two sets, we randomly selected three compar-
ison words, one from each of the difficulty levels,
forming a set of 4500 test pairs (2700 for the de-
velopment set): 1/3 of these pairs are words from
the same difficulty level, 4/9 are from adjacent dif-
ficulty levels, and the remaining 2/9 are at opposite
ends of our difficulty spectrum.
Our crowdsourced annotation was obtained using
Crowdflower, which is an interface built on top of
Mechanical Turk. For each word pair to be com-
pared, we elicited 5 judgments from workers. Rather
than frame the question in terms of difficulty or read-
ability, which we felt was too subjective, we instead
asked which of the two words the worker thought
he or she learned first: the worker could choose ei-
ther word, or answer ?about the same time?. They
34
were instructed to choose the word they did know if
one of the two words was unknown, and ?same? if
both were unknown. For our evaluation, we took the
majority judgment as the gold standard; when there
was no majority judgment, then the words were con-
sidered ?the same?. To increase the likelihood that
our workers were native speakers of English, we
required that the responses come from the US or
Canada. Before running our main set, we ran sev-
eral smaller test runs and manually inspected them
for quality; although there were outliers, the major-
ity of the judgments seemed reasonable.
Our corpus is the ICWSM Spinn3r 2009 dataset
(Burton et al., 2009). We chose this corpus because
it was used by Brooke et al. (2010) to derive a lexi-
con of formality; they found that it was more effec-
tive for these purposes than smaller mixed-register
corpora like the BNC. The ICWSM 2009, collected
over several weeks in 2008, contains about 7.5 mil-
lion blogs, or 1.3 billion tokens, including well over
a million word types (more than 200,000 of which
which appear at least 10 times). We use only the
documents which have at least 100 tokens. The cor-
pus has been tagged using the TreeTagger (Schmid,
1995).
4 Automatic Lexicon Creation
Our method for lexicon creation involves first ex-
tracting a set of relevant numerical features for each
word type. We can consider each feature as defin-
ing a lexicon on its own, which can be evaluated us-
ing our test set. Our features can be roughly broken
into three types: simple features, document readabil-
ity features, and co-occurrence features. The first of
these types does not require much explanation: it in-
cludes the length of the word, measured in terms of
letters and syllables (the latter is derived using a sim-
ple but reasonably accurate vowel-consonant heuris-
tic), and the log frequency count in our corpus.1
The second feature type involves calculating sim-
ple readability metrics for each document in our cor-
pus, and then defining the relevant feature for the
word type as the average value of the metric for all
the documents that the word appears in. For exam-
1Though it is irrelevant when evaluating the feature alone,
the log frequency was noticeably better when combining fre-
quency with other features.
ple, if Dw is the set of documents where word type
w appears and di is the ith word in a document d,
then the document word length (DWL) for w can be
defined as follows:
DWL(w) = |Dw|
?1 ?
d?Dw
?
|d|
i=0 length(di)
|d|
Other features calculated in this way include: the
document sentence length, that is the average token
length of sentences; the document type-token ratio2;
and the document lexical density, the ratio of content
words (nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs) to all
words.
The co-occurence features are inspired by the
semi-supervised polarity lexicon creation method of
Turney and Littman (2003). The first step is to build
a matrix consisting of each word type and the docu-
ments it appears in; here, we use a binary representa-
tion, since the frequency with which a word appears
in a particular document does not seem directly rel-
evant to readability. We also do not remove tradi-
tional stopwords, since we believe that the use of
certain common function words can in fact be good
indicators of text readability. Once the matrix is
built, we apply latent semantic analysis (Landauer
and Dumais, 1997); we omit the mathematical de-
tails here, but the result is a dimensionality reduc-
tion such that each word is represented as a vector
of some k dimensions. Next, we select two sets of
seed words (P and N) which will represent the ends
of the spectrum which we are interested in deriving.
We derive a feature value V for each word by sum-
ming the cosine similarity of the word vector with
all the seeds:
V (w) =
?p?P cos(?(w,p))
|P|
?
?n?N cos(?(w,n))
|N|
We further normalize this to a range of 1 to
?1, centered around the core vocabulary word and.
Here, we try three possible versions of P and N: the
first, Formality, is the set of words used by Brooke
et al. (2010) in their study of formality, that is, a

ment, to avoid the well-documented influence of length on TTR.
35
set of slang and other markers of oral communica-
tion as N, and a set of formal discourse markers and
adverbs as P, with about 100 of each. The second,
Childish, is a set of 10 common ?childish? concrete
words (e.g. mommy, puppy) as N, and a set of 10
common abstract words (e.g. concept, philosophy)
as P. The third, Difficulty, consists of the 300 begin-
ner words from our development set as N, and the
300 advanced words from our development set as P.
We tested several values of k for each of the seed
sets (from 20 to 500); there was only small variation
so here we just present our best results for each set
as determined by testing in the development set.
Our final lexicon is created by taking a linear
combination of the various features. We can find an
appropriate weighting of each term by taking them
from a model built using our development set. We
test two versions of this: by default, we use a linear
regression model where for training beginner words
are tagged as 0, advanced words as 1, and intermedi-
ate words as 0.5. The second model is a binary SVM
classifier; the features of the model are the differ-
ence between the respective features for each of the
two words, and the classifier predicts whether the
first or second word is more difficult. Both models
were built using WEKA (Witten and Frank, 2005),
with default settings except for feature normaliza-
tion, which must be disabled in the SVM to get use-
ful weights for the linear combination which creates
our lexicon. In practice, we would further normalize
our lexicon; here, however, this normalization is not
relevant since our evaluation is based entirely on rel-
ative judgments. We also tested a range of other ma-
chine learning algorithms available in WEKA (e.g.
decision trees and MaxEnt) but the crossvalidated
accuracy was similar to or slightly lower than using
a linear classifier.
5 Evaluation
All results are based on comparing the relative dif-
ficulty judgments made for the word pairs in our
test set (or, more often, some subset) by the various
sources. Since even the existing Difficulty lexicon is
not entirely reliable, we report agreement rather than
accuracy. Except for agreement of Crowdflower
workers, agreement is the percentage of pairs where
the sources agreed as compared to the total num-
ber of pairs. For agreement between Crowdflower
workers, we follow Taboada et al. (2011) in calcu-
lating agreement across all possible pairings of each
worker for each pair. Although we considered using
a more complex metric such as Kappa, we believe
that simple pairwise agreement is in fact equally in-
terpretable when the main interest is relative agree-
ment of various methods; besides, Kappa is intended
for use with individual annotators with particular bi-
ases, an assumption which does not hold here.
To evaluate the reliability of our human-annotated
resources, we look first at the agreement within the
Crowdflower data, and between the Crowdflower
and our Difficulty lexicon, with particular attention
to within-class judgments. We then compare the
predictions of various automatically extracted fea-
tures and feature combinations with these human
judgments; since most of these involve a continuous
scale, we focus only on words which were judged to
be different.3 For the Difficulty lexicon (Diff.), the
n in this comparison is 3000, while for the Crowd-
flower (CF) judgments it is 4002.
6 Results
We expect a certain amount of noise using crowd-
sourced data, and indeed agreement among Crowd-
flower workers was not extremely high, only 56.6%
for a three-way choice; note, however, that in these
circumstances a single worker disagreeing with the
rest will drop pairwise agreement in that judgement
to 60%.4 Tellingly, average agreement was rela-
tively high (72.5%) for words on the extremes of our
difficulty spectrum, and low for words in the same
difficulty category (46.0%), which is what we would
expect. As noted by Taboada et al. (2011), when
faced with a pairwise comparison task, workers tend
to avoid the ?same? option; instead, the proximity of
the words on the underlying spectrum is reflected in
disagreement. When we compare the crowdsourced
judgements directly to the Difficulty lexicon, base
3A continuous scale will nearly always predict some differ-
ence between two words. An obvious approach would be to set
a threshold within which two words will be judged the same,
but the specific values depend greatly on the scale and for sim-
plicity we do not address this problem here.
4In 87.3% of cases, at least 3 workers agreed; in 56.2% of
cases, 4 workers agreed, and in 23.1% of cases all 5 workers
agreed.

agreement is 63.1%. This is much higher than
chance, but lower than we would like, considering
these are two human-annotated sources. However,
it is clear that much of this disagreement is due to
?same? judgments, which are three times more com-
mon in the Difficulty lexicon-based judgments than
in the Crowdflower judgments (even when disagree-
ment is interpreted as a ?same? judgment). Pairwise
agreement of non-?same? judgments for word pairs
which are in the same category in the Difficultly lex-
icon is high enough (45.9%)5 for us to conclude that
this is not random variation, strongly suggesting that
there are important distinctions within our difficulty
categories, i.e. that it is not sufficiently fine-grained.
If we disregard all words that are judged as same in
one (or both) of the two sources, the agreement of
the resulting word pairs is 91.0%, which is reason-
ably high.
Table 2 contains the agreement when feature val-
ues or a linear combination of feature values are used
to predict the readability of the unequal pairs from
the two manual sources. First, we notice that the
Crowdflower set is obviously more difficult, proba-
bly because it contains more pairs with fairly subtle
(though noticeable) distinctions. Other clear differ-
ences between the annotations: whereas for Crowd-
flower frequency is the key indicator, this is not true
for our original annotation, which prefers the more
complex features we have introduced here. A few
features did poorly in general: syllable count ap-
pears too coarse-grained to be useful on its own,
lexical density is only just better than chance, and
type-token ratio performs at or below chance. Oth-
erwise, many of the features within our major types
give roughly the same performance individually.
When we combine features, we find that simple
and document features combine to positive effect,
but the co-occurrence features are redundant with
each other and, for the most part, the document fea-
tures. A major boost comes, however, from combin-
ing either document or co-occurrence features with
the simple features; this is especially true for our
Difficulty lexicon annotation, where the gain is 7%
to 8 percentage points. It does not seem to matter
very much whether the weights of each feature are
determined by pairwise classifier or by linear regres-

sion: this is interesting because it means we can train
a model to create a readability spectrum with only
pairwise judgments. Finally, we took all the 2500
instances where our two annotations agreed that one
word was more difficult, and tested our best model
against only those pairs. Results using this selec-
tive test set were, unsurprisingly, higher than those
of either of the annotations alone: 91.2%, which is
roughly the same as the original agreement between
the two manual annotations.
7 Discussion
Word difficulty is a vague concept, and we have ad-
mittedly sidestepped a proper definition here: in-
stead, we hope to establish a measure of reliabil-
ity in judgments of ?lexical readability? by looking
for agreement across diverse sources of informa-
tion. Our comparison of our existing resources with
37
crowdsourced judgments suggests that some consis-
tency is possible, but that granularity is, as we pre-
dicted, a serious concern, one which ultimately un-
dermines our validation to some degree. An auto-
matically derived lexicon, which can be fully con-
tinuous or as coarse-grained as needed, seems like
an ideal solution, though the much lower perfor-
mance of the automatic lexicon in predicting the
more fine-grained Crowdflower judgments indicates
that automatically-derived features are limited in
their ability to deal with subtle differences. How-
ever, a visual inspection of the spectrum created by
the automatic methods suggests that, with a judi-
cious choice of granularity, it should be sufficient for
our needs. In future work, we also intend to evalu-
ate its use for readability classification, and perhaps
expand it to include multiword expressions and syn-
tactic patterns.
Our results clearly show the benefit of combin-
ing multiple sources of information to build a model
of word difficulty. Word frequency and word length
are of course relevant, and the utility of the docu-
ment context features is not surprising, since they
are merely a novel extension of existing proxies
for readability. The co-occurrence features were
also useful, though they seem fairly redundant and
slightly inferior to document features; we posit that
these features, in addition to capturing notions of
register such as formality, may also offer seman-
tic distinctions relevant to the acquisition process.
For instance, children may have a large vocabulary
in very concrete domains such as animals, includ-
ing words (e.g. lizard) that are not particularly fre-
quent in adult corpora, while very common words in
other domains (such as the legal domain) are com-
pletely outside the range of their experience. If we
look at some of the examples which term frequency
alone does not predict, they seem to be very much
of this sort: dollhouse/emergence, skirt/industry,
magic/system. Unsupervised techniques for identi-
fying semantic variation, such as LSA, can capture
these sorts of distinctions. However, our results indi-
cate that simply looking at the readability of the texts
that these sort of words appear in (i.e. our document
features) is mostly sufficient, and less than 10% of
the pairs which are correctly ordered by these two
feature sets are different. In any case, an age-graded
corpus is definitely not required.
There are a few other benefits of using word co-
occurrence that we would like to touch on, though
we leave a full exploration for future work. First, if
we consider readability in other languages, each lan-
guage may have different properties which render
proxies such as word length much less useful (e.g.
ideographic languages like Chinese or agglutinative
languages like Turkish). However, word (or lemma)
co-occurrence, like frequency, is essentially a uni-
versal feature across languages, and thus can be di-
rectly extended to any language. Second, if we con-
sider how we would extend difficulty-lexicon cre-
ation to the context of adult second-language learn-
ers, it might be enough to adjust our seed terms to
reflect the differences in the language exposure of
this population, i.e. we would expect difficulty in ac-
quiring colloquialisms that are typically learned in
childhood but are not part of the core vocabulary of
the adult language.
8 Conclusion
In this paper, we have presented an automatic
method for the derivation of a readability lexicon re-
lying only on an unannotated word corpus. Our re-
sults show that although term frequency is a key fea-
ture, there are other, more complex features which
provide competitive results on their own as well as
combining with term frequency to improve agree-
ment with manual resources that reflect word diffi-
culty or age of acquisition. By comparing our man-
ual lexicon with a new crowdsourced annotation, we
also provide a validation of the resource, while at
the same time highlighting a known issue, the lack
of fine-grainedness. Our manual lexicon provides a
solution for this problem, albeit at the cost of some
reliability. Although our immediate interest is not
text readability classification, the information de-
rived could be applied fairly directly to this task, and
might be particularly useful in the case when anno-
tated texts are not avaliable.
