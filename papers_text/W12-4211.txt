Abstract 
Verb plays a crucial role of specifying the 
action or function performed in a sentence. 
In translating English to morphologically 
richer language like Hindi, the organization 
and the order of verbal constructs 
contributes to the fluency of the language. 
Mere statistical methods of machine 
translation are not sufficient enough to 
consider this aspect. Identification of verb 
parts in a sentence is essential for its 
understanding and they constitute as if they 
are a single entity. Considering them as a 
single entity improves the translation of the 
verbal construct and thus the overall 
quality of the translation. The paper 
describes a strategy for pre-processing and 
for identification of verb parts in source 
and target language corpora. The steps 
taken towards reducing sparsity further 
helped in improving the translation results.  
1 Introduction 
With the availability of parallel content, increased 
memory and processing speed, there has been 
growing trend moving towards Statistical Machine 
Translation. Most of the phrase based machine 
translation systems are based on the noisy-channel 
based IBM models (Koehn, Och & Marcu, 2003,   
Zens et al, 2004). Phrases refer to a number of 
consecutive words that may not be a valid syntactic 
phrase but are learnt through the statistical 
alignment between two languages. English and 
Hindi have differing syntactical structure and pose 
great challenge in aligning phrases of the two 
languages. The former follows SVO pattern while 
the later adheres to the SOV pattern. Hindi being 
morphologically richer offers several verbal 
constructs governed through Tense, Aspect and 
Modality (TAM). The non-monotonocity between 
the two languages causes inferior alignment of 
phrases especially verbal constructs. 
There have been efforts towards single 
tokenization of MWE parts. Ueffing and Ney, 
2003 reported use of POS information for SMT to 
morphologically richer language. They tried to 
transform the source language while the approach 
proposed here attempts transformations on both 
source and target laguage sides. Recent related 
works use statistical measures like Mutual 
Information and Log Likelihood Ratio (Seretan 
and Wehrli, 2007) to know the degree of cohesion 
between constituents of a MWE. These require 
defining threshold value above which the extracted 
phrase is qualified as a MWE.  
Minkov et al (2007) utilized the rich syntactic 
and morphological analyzers to generate the 
inflections. Hindi lacks availability of robust 
parsers and complex morphological analyzers.  
The paper describes the process of identifying 
verbal constructs of both languages and grouping 
them in single units to reduce the search space. For 
identification of the verbal constructs, the POS 
information is utilized with simple combining rules 
to make verb phrases. This yields better alignment 
of verbal phrases and results in more grammatical, 
fluent and acceptable translations. Besides that, the 
data sparseness generated from chunking is 
95
handled through extending the phrase table with 
verbal parts entries.  
The paper is organized in sections, describing 
the phrase based SMT in brief, Hindi language and 
its verbal properties followed by sections 
describing identification of verbal constructs in 
English and Hindi. Further to it, corpus and pre-
processing activities are detailed alongwith the 
experimental setup, process adopted to reduce 
sparcity, the translation process, observations and 
conclusion. 
2 Overview of SMT 
Candide SMT system [Brown et al, 1990], 
presented by the IBM researchers paved the path 
for statistical approach to machine translation.  
In statistical machine translation, we are given a 
source language sentence S = sI1 = s1 . . . si . . . sI , 
which is to be translated into a target language 
(?English?) sentence T = tJ1 = t1 . . . tj . . . tJ.  
Statistical machine translation is based on a noisy 
channel model. It considers T to be the target of a 
communication channel, and its translation S to be 
the source of the channel. System may generate 
multiple translation sentences options and the 
problem of translation becomes identifying 
sentence T which fits as the best translation of the 
source sentence S. Hence the machine translation 
task becomes to recover the source from the target. 
So, we need to maximize P(T|S). According to the 
Bayes rule, 
 
  
 
As, P(S) is constant,  
 
 
Here,  P(s|t) represents Translation model and 
P(t) represents language model.  Translation model 
plays the role of ensuring translation faithfulness 
and Language model to ensure the fluency of 
translated output. 
3 Hindi language and its verbal 
properties  
Indian languages are classified in four major 
families: Indo-Aryan (a branch of the Indo-
European family), Dravidian, Austro-Asiatic 
(Austric), and Sino-Tibetan, with the 
overwhelming majority of the population speaking 
languages belonging to the first two families. 
There are 22 languages listed in eighth schedule of 
constitution of India. The four major families are 
different in their form and construction, but they 
share many orthographic similarities, because their 
scripts originate from Brahmi (Ishida, 2002).  
Hindi language belongs to the Indo-Aryan 
language family. It is spoken in vast areas of 
northern India and is written in Devanagari script. 
In Hindi, words belonging to various grammatical 
categories appear in lemma and inflectional forms. 
Hindi Verbal constructs system is based on the 
TAM of the action. The Verbal costructs are 
formed by placement of auxiliary verbs after the 
main verb. The main verb that carries the lexical 
meaning may appear in the root or inflected form. 
Auxiliary verbs of the main verb denote the TAM 
property of the verbal construct.  
Tense is a grammatization of the relations 
between time of some event and the refrence time. 
Aspect markers are semantically very sensitive and 
often convey subtle meanings and nuances that are   
not generally expressed through simple lexical 
words. Here we look at the two example sentences,  
1. ?? ??? ?? ???? ???? ??  
    vaha din bhar baithaa rahataa hai  
    (?He remains seated whole day?).   
2. ?? ???-??? ????? ???? ??  
    vaha baar-baar baithtaa rahataa hai 
    (?He sits frequetly?)  
Here, aspect marker ?? ?? ?yaa raha? in first 
sentence, denotes the resultant state of the action 
and ?? ?raha? gives perception of a longer period of 
time. While in a slightly modified second sentence, 
the aspect marker ?? ?? ?taa raha? gives the sense 
of repetition or infinity of the action and ?? ?raha? 
gives the perception of a time spread.  
The mood reflects speaker?s attitude towards the 
action and is manifested in many ways in a 
language. In Hindi the moods can be of Imperative, 
? ? ? ? ? ?
? ?sP
tPtsP
stPt
tt
*|
maxarg|maxarg* ??
? ? ? ?tPtsPt
t
*|maxarg* ?
96
Subjunctive, Indefinite and definite potential, 
conditional and future etc. Here we look at the 
following three sentences. 
1. ? ???   tu padh  (?You read?) 
2. ?? ????  tu padh (?You read?) 
3. ?? ???? tu padh (?You read?) 
All the above three sentences are imperative in 
nature but there is subtle difference in speaker?s 
attitude. The first sentence is the impolite form of 
expression, the second one is common form and 
the third sentence is the polite form of expressing 
the same thing.  
All constituents of the verbal constructs are 
obligatory. Semantically TAM markers are so 
closely interlinked that it would be appropriate to   
treat them as a single entity rather than treating 
them sperately. Besides that, the main verb appears 
frequently in compound and conjunct forms in the 
verbal constrcuts (Singh, 2010). Compound verbs 
follow the pattern of verb-verb (V-V) combination 
while conjunct verbs are formed with either noun-
verb (N-V) or adjective-verb (A-V) combinations. 
In V-V expressions the first verb word carries 
verbal stem while successive verb words play the 
role of auxiliary or light verbs (LV). The LVs 
loose their independent meaning and are used to 
reflect the shade of main verb. The compound and 
conjunct verb expressions are also referred as 
complex predicates (CP). The CPs are multi-word 
expressions (MWEs) which may be compositional 
or non-compositional in nature (Sinha, 2011). 
These should be treated as a single verbal unit to 
infer the intended meaning or semantics. The CP 
adds to the expressiveness of the expression but 
pose difficulty for automatic identification.  
4 Identification and treatment verbal 
constructs  
The elements of verbal constructs, if treated as 
individual words leave too many entries in the 
sentences to get algned through statistical 
alignment. This makes the probability distribution 
unfocussed. Co-joining parts of verbal constructs 
reduces the sentence length and thus helps in better 
alignment. 
4.1 English verbal constructs 
The Stanford POS tagger (Kristina Toutanova et 
al., 2003) is used for tagging words in a sentence 
with their POS categories. The POS tags are based 
on Penn Treebank POS tagset (Mitchell et al, 
1993). The verbal parts to be chunked together are 
identified with the help of a set of rules. Some of 
these rules are listed in the Table 1. As an example, 
the rule ?get NP VBN? specifies, that if Noun 
Phrase appears in between the word ?get? and 
VBN, this is considered as a verbal construct. 
 
POS based Verb Chunking Rules 
VBP/VBD/VBZ  VBG 
MD not VB 
get  NP VBN 
 
Table 1: Sample rules for identiying English 
Verbal constructs 
These rules are impletemented in the form of a 
Finite State Machine (FSM). The NP-phrase 
appearing in between the verb construct parts is 
identified and FSM implementation helps in 
achieving this. Similarly, the model auxiliaries like 
?can be? are also co-joined with successive verbs. 
These simple rules help in identifying the 
constituents of verbal constructs. The negation 
markers or noun phrases that appear in between 
verbal constructs are moved out to reduce sparsity. 
Table 2 shows some English verbal constructs and 
how these are co-joined. 
 
Verbal Constructs Co-joined Verbal Constructs 
is going is_going 
can not be done not can_be_done 
get the work done get_done the work 
 
Table 2: Sample English Verbal constructs 
4.2 Identification of Hindi verbal constructs 
For identifying the Hindi verbal constructs, a 
combination of POS tagging and presence of the 
TAM markers appearing as verb ending sequences 
are used. The POS tags are based on modified 
Penn Treebank POS tagset. The POS tagging 
identifies possible verbal parts to be chunked, 
while the TAM rules help in confirmation of them. 
Table 3 lists some of the TAM rules. Here $ 
indicates the presence of main verb stem.

Table 4 shows some of the verbal constrcts and 
their co-joined forms after processing. The 
negation markers, such as, ??? ? nahi (?not?) and 
particles, such as, ?? (emphatic marker) occurring 
in between are moved out of the verbal expressions 
to reduce the sparsity.

5 Corpus and pre-processing 
Basic Travel Expressions Corpus (BTEC) 
containing travel conversations is used for 
performing the experiments (Kikui, 2006). This 
contains travel expressions which are generally 
used when a person travels to another country and 
covers the utterances of potential subjects in travel 
situations. The expressions contained more than 
one sentence in single expression. These have been   
separated by sentence end markers (dot). Such 
sentences have been treated as separate sentence 
entities. This increased the number of independent 
sentences in parallel corpus. The Tables 6 and 7  
list corpus statistics.

Table 7: Corpus Statistics after pre-processing 
The average sentence length in the English 
corpus before pre-processing was 7.7 words per 
sentence and after pre-processing it came down to 
6.3 words per sentence. Hindi corpus had 8.7   
words per sentence and it became 7.2 words per 
sentence after pre-processing.  
The pre-processing activity also included 
expanding of common abbreviated expressions e.g. 
I?ll to ?I will? etc. This has been performed with a 
set of simple expansion rules. Besides that, dots 
appearing after titles are also replaced with hash 
(#), to avoid being treated them as sentence end-
markers. 
6 Experimental setup 
For the training of the statistical models, standard 
word alignment GIZA++ (Och & Ney, 2003) and 
language modelling toolkit SRILM (Stolcke, 2002) 
tools were used. For translation, MOSES phrase-
based SMT decoder (Koehn, 2007) has been used. 
For evaluation, the automatic evaluation metrics, 
BLEU (Papineni, 2002) was applied to the 
translation output. 
7 Translation process 
The overall process can be classified as Training 
and Testing processes. The training process 
describes the steps involved in building models. 
These steps include ? pre-processing of training 
corpus, POS tagging source and target language 
training corpus, chunking words forming the 
verbal constructs, building translation and 
language models.  
 
Figure 1: Training process 
Testing process describes steps while 
translating. It involves - pre-processing of test 
corpus, POS tagging of test corpus, chunking the 
words forming the verbal constructs and searching 
words in the vocabulary of training models. If 
some words are unseen but are lexical words of 
verbal constructs, they are handled as described in 
section 8 below.  
 
Figure 2: Testing process 
99
8 Handling sparsity 
Due to limited size of parallel corpus used for 
training the models, it is quite probable that some 
verbal constructs may appear which is unseen by 
the training model and is out of vocabulary (OOV). 
The probability of such occurrence increases due 
to the co-joining of words forming verbal 
constructs. To meet this situation, templates of 
different verbal constructs with their translations 
are used. The Table 8 shows some sample 
templates with their translations. 
If verbal construct is OOV, it is changed to its 
translation template form. After that, its equivalent 
translation is picked up and is replaced in the 
sentence to be translated. As an example, if the 
verbal construct ?would_have_been_cleaning? is 
OOV. It is changed to its template form   
would_have_been_VBG and its respective 
translation VB_???_???? is picked up from the 
translation template table. Now, with the help of 
English-Hindi dictionary, translation of verbal 
construct ?would_have_been_cleaning? in the 
sentence is replaced with the translated as 
????_??_???_???? and is sent for final translation. 
 
Verbal construct template Translation template 
can_VB VB_????_?? 
VB_saktaa_hai 
would_have_been_VBG VB_???_???? 
VB_rahaa_hogaa 
has_not_VBN ???_?VB??_?? 
nahi_VByaa_hai 
 
Table 8: Verbal Construct template translation 
If the verb is not present in the English-Hindi 
dictionary too, it is translierated and ???? is added 
to it. Now, the verbal construct in the source 
sentence is replaced with its transliterated form   
before sending for translation. As an example, if  
word ?clean? is not found in English-Hindi 
dictionary, its translterated form ?????? is 
generated and ???? is added to it. The verbal 
construct ?would_have_been_cleaning? in the 
source sentence is replaced with transliterated 
verbal construct ?????_??_???_????? before 
sending for SMT. For trnasliteration in-house 
statistical transliteration system is used.  
9 Experiments 
The experiments were carried on original, pre-
processed and chunked verbal constructs based 
models. Table 9 below show that there is 
improvement in BLUE score when we pre-process 
the raw corpus. Better alignment is achieved due to 
reduced sentence length and data being in 
normalized form. The chunked verbal constructs 
corpus further improves the BLUE score. Though 
the BLUE score gain is marginal but on human   
inspection, better order and organization of Verbal 
constructs is observed. The table below shows the 
BLEU score for experiments.

10 Conclusion and Future Work 
Results show, moderate gain in BLUE score is 
obtained with pre-processing of the corpus. This 
can be attributed to better alignment due to   
reduced length of sentences. Marginal gain is 
observed with chunking of Verbal constructs, yet   
manual inspection show fluent translation of verbal 
parts.  
Hindi verb forms are sensitive to gender, 
number and person information, which is not 
considered in current implementation. Work on 
interrogatives, prepositional phrases and other   
multi-word expressions, is in progress. There is 
scope to improve the statistical alignment using 
linguitic knowledge. The investigations on these 
are currently in progress.
