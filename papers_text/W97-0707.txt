Abstract 
Over the years, the amount of information 
avmlable lectromcally has grown mamfold 
There Is an increasing demand for automatic 
methods for text summarization Dommn- 
independent techniques for automauc summa- 
nzation by paragraph extractton have been pro- 
posed m (Salton et al 1994, Salton et al 
1996b) In tins study, we attempt to evain- 
ate these methods by companng the automat- 
lcally generated extracts to ones generated by 
humans In view of the fact that extracts gen- 
errated by two humans for the same article are 
surprisingly dzssmular, the performance of the 
automatic methods I satisfactory Even though 
thin observation calls into question the feasibil- 
ity of producing perfect summaries by extrac- 
tion, given the unavallablhty ofother effective 
domain-independent summarization tools, we 
beheve that fins m a reasonable, though imper- 
fect, alternative 
1 Introduction 
As the amount of textual mformaUon avmlable lectron- 
really grows rapidly, It becomes more difficult for a user 
to cope with all the text that ~s potentially of interest 
of the art (Brandow et al 1995) Thus, the process of 
automatic summary generaUon generally reduces to the 
.task of extractzon, ~ e ,  we use heunsUcs based upon a 
detmled staustlcal analysis of word occurrence to Iden- 
tify the text-pieces ( entences, paragraphs, etc ) that are 
likely to be most important, and concatenate the selected 
pieces together to form the final extract I (Luhn, 1958, 
Earl, 1970) 
Techmques for sentence extracuon have been proposed 
In (Brandow et al 1995, Luhn, 1958, Patce, 1900, Ku- 
plec et al 1995) In (Salton et al 1994, Salton et al 
1996b), the paragraph Is chosen as the umt of extraction 
It was expected that since a paragraph provides more con- 
text, the problems of readablhty and coherence that were 
seen m the summaries generated by sentence extracUon 
would be, at least parUally, amehorated Various prop~ 
emes of the extracts generated by chfferent paragraph 
selection algorithms were observed m prevmus tuthes 
In this study, we intend to do a more detatled evaluaUon 
of these chfferent algorithms 
The remainder of the paper Is orgamzed as follows

2.1 Text Relationship Maps 
Usually, m mformauon retrieval, each text or text ex- 
cerpt is represented by a vector of weighted terms of 
the form D~ = (d,~, d, 2, , , d,,) where d,b rep- 
resents an nnportance weight for term T~ attached to 
document D, The terms attached to documents for con- 
tent representauon purposes may be words or phrases 
derived from the document teKts by an antomauc in- 
dexing procedure, and the term weights are computed 
by taking Into account the occurrence charactensucs of 
\]Henceforth, e term summary is used m tins sense of a

the terms m the mdlwdual documents and the document 
collection as a whole (Salton and McGlll, 1983) As- 
sunung that every text or text excerpt ~s represented m 
vector form as a set of weighted terms, ~t ~s possible 
to compute parwlse sumlanty coefficients, howing the 
snndanty between pars of texts, based on coincidences 
m the term assignments o the respecUve ~tems Typi- 
cally, the vector smulanty rmght be computed as the m- 
nor product between corresponding vector elements, that 
= ~=~ ~,  d~, and the snmlanty ~s, S)m (D,, D~) 
functaon might be normahzed to he between 0 for disjoint 
vectors and I for completely \]denucal vectors (Salton, 
1989) The Smart mfolrmauon remeval system (Salton, 
1971) ~s based on these pnnclples and m used m our 
expenments 
In order to decide wl~ch paragraphs of a document 
are most useful for text summanzaUon, we first want to 
determine how the-paragraphs are related to each other 
Tins task ~s accomphshed using a text relationship map 
A text relalaonslnp map m a graplucal representat, on of 
textual structure, m winch paragraphs On general, pieces 
of text) are represented by nodes on a graph and related 
paragraphs are hnked by edges (Salton and Allan, 1993) 
Nodes are joined by hnks based on a numencal sm-alar - 
~ty computed for each par  of texts usmg mformaUon re- 
trieval techmques described above Typlcally, a threshold 
value ~s selected, and all pars of paragraphs whose simi- 
larity exceeds the threshold are connected by hnks Since 
the snmlanty between two text vectors m based upon the 
vocabulary overlap between the corresponding texts, ff 
the snmlanty between two vectors ~s large enough (above 
a threshold) to be regarded as non-random, we can say 
that the vocabulary matches between the corresponchng 
texts are meamngful, and the two texts are "semantically 
related" (Salton et al 1997)

clently snndar arejomed by a hnk The smulanty thresh- 
old used m flus map is 0 12  Important concluslons about 
text structure can be drawn from a text relaUonsh~p map 
For example, the nnportance of a paragraph wlthm the 
text is hkely to be related to the number of links lncl- 
dent on the corresponding ode The map can be used to 
~denUfy related passages covenng parucular toplc areas 
It also provides mformaUon about he homogeneity of
the text under cons~deraUon When the map ~s well con- 
nected and has many cross-hnks between paragraphs, and 
direct hnks between adjacent paragraphs, one expects a
umfied, homogeneous treatment of the topic (Salton et 
al, 1996b) 
A text relaUonslup map maybe used to decompose a 
documentmtosegmenta(Saltonetal,1996a) A segment 
Is a conuguous piece of text that ~s hnked internally, but 
largely dmconnected from the adjacent text (Hearst and 
Plaunt, 1993) Segments are our (automauc) appmxnna- 
uon to secuonmg when a text does not have well defined 
SecUons (as ~s the case with numerous arUcles on the web 
these clays) Consider Figure 2, for example It shows the 
relatxonslup map for the arucle on Telecommumcattons 
at a sumlanty threshold of 0 12 with hnks between chs- 
rant paragraphs (paragraphs that are more than five apart) 
deleted Paragraphs 3 to 12 are hnked to each other, but 
there are few links connecting them to other nearby para- 
graphs This suggests that these paragraphs deal with 
one topic, and the topic slurs from paragraph 12 to 14 
Thus, paragraphs 3 to 12 form a segment On reading 
the text, we find that they, m fact; deal with the devwes 
and hardware used m telecommumcaUons, andthe topic 
slnrs from paragraph 14 to a discussion of the software 
used m telecommumcauons 2 Snmlarly, paragraphs 28

2.2 Text Traversal 
We now come to the problem of generaung summaries 
by selecting paragraphs of the document for inclusion 
TbJs could be accomphshed byautomattcally identifying 
the tmportant paragraphs on the map and traversing the 
selected nodes m text order to construct an extract, or 
path Various criteria maybe used to assocmte importance 
with paragraphs, glwng rise to &fferent paths In thin 
study, we evaluate four types of paths 
Bushy path 
The bushiness of a node on a map ~s defined as the 
number of hnks connecung ~t o other nodes on the map 
Since a Inghly bushy node (paragraph) ~s related to a 
number of other nodes, ~t has an overlapping vocabu- 
lary with many other paragraphs and is hkely to discuss 
topics covered m several paragraphs Such paragraphs 
are good overview paragraphs and are deswable m a sum- 
mary, and therefore are good candxdates for extracuon A 
global bushy path ~s constructed out of the ~ most bushy 
nodes on the map, where n ts the targeted number of 
paragraphs m the summary. These nodes are arranged m 
chronologtcal order, I e ,  the order m winch they appear 
m the original document, o form the summary 
Depth-first path 
The nodes on a bushy path are connected to a number 
of other paragraphs, but not necessarily to each other 
uon Since heachng paragraphs are not full-text and are not 
avmlable m all dommns, we do not leverage the,r presence m 
our summarization algorithms

Therefore, whde they may prowde comprehensive cov -  
erage of an arucle, they may not form a very coherent ex- 
tract, and the rea~l~blhty of the summary nught be poor 
To avoid tlus problem, we use the following strategy to 
budd depth-first paths start at an important node - -  the 
first node or a htghly bushy node are typical choices m 
and WSlt the next most s~mdar node at each step Note 
' that, only the paragraphs that follow the current one m 
text order are can&dates for the next step Smce each 
paragraph is slmdar to the next one on the path, abrupt 
transmous m subJeCt matter should be ehrmnated, and 
the extract should be a coherent one However, since the 
subJeCt matter of the paragraphs on the path is dictated 
to some extent by the contents of the first paragraph, all 
aspects of the arUcle may not be covered by a depth-first 
path (Salton and Smghal, 1995, Salton et al 1996b) 
Segmented bushy path 
Some arucles contain segments deahng with a spe- 
clahzed topic The paragraphs msuch a segment would 
be well connected to each other, but poorly connected 
to other paragraphs A bushy path would not include 
these paragraphs, and would thereby completely exclude 
an aspect of the subJect matter covered in the amcle 
A segmented bushy path attempts to remedy tins prob- 
lem It is obtained by construcUng bushy paths individ- 
ually for each segment and concatenaung them m text 
order At least one paragraph ~s selected from each seg- 
ment The reramnder of the extract is formed by picking 
more bushy nodes from each segment m propomon to Its 
length Since all segments are represented m the extract, 
this algorithm should, m pnnclple, enhance the compre- 
hensweness ofthe extract (Salton et al 1996b)

based on manually exarmmng some of the extracts How- 
ever, objective valuauon of these algorithms has always 
been problematsc In (Salton and Smghal, 1995), an

ranked retrieval Since relevance judgments were not 
avadable for passages or extracts, the avadable relevance 
judgments for full documents were extrapolated to the 
extracts However, the pomon of a document that is rele- 
vant to a query may well get left out of a passage, and so, 
results obtmned from such an evaluauon are unrehable 
Since the goa l  of our summarization schemes ~s to 
automate a process that has trachUonally been done man- 
ually, a comparison of automaucally generated extracts 
with those produced by humans would prowde a rea- 
sonable evaluauon of these methods We assume that 
a human would be able to identify the most Important 
? paragraphs In an amcle most effectwely If the set of 
paragraphs selected by an automatic extraction method 
has a Ingh overlap with the human-generated extract, he 
automauc method should be regarded as effective Thus, 
our evaluation method takes the following form a user 
submits a document to the system for summanzatson, i  
one case, the system presents a summary generated by 
another person, m the other, It produces an automatically 
generated extract The user compares the two summaries 
manual and automauc - -  to Ins/her own notion of 
an ideal extract To evaluate the automatic methods, we 
compare the user's 'sausfacuon' m the two cases Such 
an evaluation methodology has its shurtcormngs, for ex- 
ample It does not account for the readabihty aspect of a 
summary, It also ignores the fact that user satisfaction 
Is related to whether a user has seen the full-arucle or 
not Unfortunately, given the lack of a good testhed for 
evaluaung automatic summarization, xt ts the best we can 
do 
Fifty articles were selected from the Funk and Wag- 
nallsEncyclopedla(PunkandWagnalls, 1979)Foreach 
arucle, two extracts were constructed manually One of 
these extracts was used as the manual summary The 
otherone, winch then becomes a user's 0deal) smnmary, 
is used as the oracle to compare the performance of the 
manual summary and an automatic summary .The fol- 
lowing instructions were given to those who constructed 
the manual extracts 
Please read through the articles Determine 
-, wh!ch n paragraphs are the most tmportant for 
summarizing tins amcle n = MAX(5, l/5th 
the total number of paragraphs (round to the 
next Ingher number for fracuons)) Mark the 
paragraphs winch you chose 
The resulting database of 100 manual summanes (two for 
each of the fifty arUcles) was used m the final evaluation 
of the automaUc methods Summaries were then auto- 
matically generated for the amcles, using each of the four 
methods descnbed above In each caseJhe automauc and 
manual extracts had the same number of paragraphs 3 
In manual summarization by paragraph extraction, 
there are certam paragraphs m a text hat certainly belong 
m a summary extract, but then there are many paragraphs 
whose importance is subjectively judged by the mChvld- 
ual doing the extraction To reduce the effect of the ar- 
bltranness introduced by mchvldual's subjective notions, 
for very short arUcles, we asked our subjects to extract. 
at least five paragraphs, hoping that the mtersecuon of 
the two manual summaries roll indeed yield the most 
important paragraphs m an artscle The articles used m 
our evaluation had anywhere between thn'teen and forty 
eight content paragraphs The current implementation f  
the Smart system also considers the section headings, etc 
as |ndlvldual paragraphs Such paragraphs were marked 
as non-content and were ~gnored m the summanzatmn 
process 
4 Results and Discussion 
The following scenario was assumed for evaluauon of 
the automatic summaries 
? A user walks up to the system and presents an article 
for summanzauon 
? In the first case, the system asks another human to do 
the summanzaUon and presents it to the user The 
user compares tins summary to lus/her own nouon 
of an ideal summary 
? In the second case, the system automatically gener~ 
ates a summary and returns it to the user The user 
agmn compares this summary to his/her own nouon 
of an Ideal summary 
? The user saUsfaction m the above two cases Is mea- 
sured by the "degree of overlap" between the sum- 
mary presented by the system and the user's nouon 
of an ideal summary 
3Different users could count paragraphs &fferently Thus, 
for a few amcles, the lengths of the two manually generated 
summaries were different In such cases, the autoraaUc proce- 
dures took the average of these two lengths as the target length 
for the extract 
43 
If  the user's sausfactton as about the same an the above 
two cases, then our automatic summanzataon schemes 
are summanzang aswell as a human would summanze 
by paragraph extracUon 
For each automaue summanzaUon algonthm, four 
quanUties were computed 
10pwmi .c  evaluatmn Smce the two manual ex- 
tracts for an amcle are chfferent, the amount of 
overlap between an automatic and a manual ex- 
tract depends on which manual extract as selected 
for comparison The opUmisuc evaluauon for an 
algonthm as done by selecung the manual extract 
wath winch the automatic extract has a Ingher over- 
lap,.and measuring tins overlap Tins as the same as 
using the human whose noUon of an ~deal extract ~s 
closer to the automauc extract as our user 
2 Pesszrmstw evaluanon Analogously, a pessarmstic 
evaluation ~s done by Selecting the manual extract 
with winch the automauc extract has a lower over- 
lap Thas as the same as using the human whose. 
notion of an adeal extract ~s more chss~rmlar to the 
automatac extract as our user Tins, in some sense. 
as the worst case scenario 
3 Intersection For each arucle, an antersecuon of 
the two manually generated summaries as computed 
The fact that he paragraphs an tins intersection were 
deemed amportant by both the readers uggests that 
they may, an fact, be the most irnportant paragraphs 
m the arucle We compute the percentage of these 
paragraphs that ~s included an the automaue xtract 
4 Umon We also calculate the percentage of auto- 
maucally selected paragraphs that as selected by at 
least one of the two users Tins as, an some sense, a 
precasmn measure, since at provades us wah a sense 
of how often an automatically selected paragraph ~s 
potenually amportant 
In our experimentation, we observed that many sub- 
jects tend to select paragraph 3 an the summaries Tins 
as because tins paragraph is the first content paragraph an 
an amcle and tends to be a chctionary-style d fimtion for 
the amcle For example, for arUcle 15930 (Monopoly), 
tins paragraph reads 
Monopoly, economic snuauon in winch there as 
only a single seller or producer of a eommochty 
or a servace For a monopoly to be effective, 
there must be no prazucal subsututes for the 
product or servace sold, and no serious threat 
of the ency of a competitor into the market 
'Flus enables the seller to control the pnce 
Such &cUonary-style definmons are generally hked by 
readers and thus are usually included m a summary by 
our subjects 
In general, an written texts, the first content paragraph 
tends to be an introductory paragraph and ~s a good start- 
mg paragraph for summargauon For the encyclopecha 
amcles, we use tins reformation and we always include 
paragraph 3 m the bushy and the depth-first summaries 
"Flus paragraph might be nussed by the segmented bushy 
paths but Is recaptured by the augmented segmented 
bushy paths In case such collection specific mfonna- 
uon as not avadable, we use the first paragraph wath a 
? reasonable number of hnks to the rest of the paragraphs 
as the mtreductory paragraph (Salton and Smghal, 1995) 
Table 5 shows the overlap for the two manual extracts, 
and the dafferent evaluation measures averaged over all 
fifty amcles, for the bushy, depth-first, segmented bushy, 
and augmented segmented bushy extracts In adchtion 
to using these four methods, extracts were also gener- 
ated for the amcles by selecting the reqmred number of 
paragraphs at random To ehnunate any advantage that 
the bushy, depth-first, and augmented segmented bushy 
extracts might have due to the presence of the introduc- 
tory paragraph, paragraph 3 is always included m the 
? random paths The eValuauon results for these random 
extracts are also shown m the table Random selection 
of paragraphs serves as the weakest possible basehne If 
an algorithm does not perform noticeably better than a 
random extract, then at as certmnly doing a poor job of 
summanzauon Also, Brandow, Matze, and Rau found 
m (Brandow et al 1995) that simply selecting the first 
few sentences (the lead sentences) produced the most 
acceptable summanes To test their findmgs m our enva- 
ronment, we also Selected the first 20% paragraphs ofan 
arucle and used n as yet another automauc summary 
Manual Extracts 
The most unexpected result of our experiment was the 
low level of agreement between the two human subjects 
The overlap between the two manual extracts as only 
46% on an average, ze, an extract generated by one 
person is hkely to cover 46% of the mformatmn that as 
regarded as most mportant by anotherperson This ratto 
suggests that two humans dasagree on more than half the 
paragraphs that hey consider to be critical In addmon, as 
re&cared above, the first paragraph of these ncyclopedm 
arucles ~s a general introduction to the amcle and ~s often 
selected by both subjects-- m 50% of the cases m w~ch 
the mtersection between the two users' extracts ~s a single 
paragraph, tins paragraph as the first one Tins increases 
the chances of overlap between the two manual extracts 
If we exclude tins specml paragraph from the arUcle, the 
overlap figures for two humans wall be even worse " 
The lack of consensus between users on winch para- 
graphs are miportant can be explained as follows On a 
first reading, users earmarked ceruun paragraphs as am- 
portant Some of these paragraphs were then einmnated, 
m order to reduce the extract o the stipulated size Of. 
ten, the choace between winch paragraphs to keep and 
winch to exclude was a &flicult one, and m such satua- 
uons, some arbm'armess ts bound to creep m Tins facts 
casts some shadows on the utahty of automatac text sum- 
manzauon by text extraction It ~s possable that the user 
satisfactaon maght be Ingher m reabty when the true user 
does not read the poruon of an amcle not presented to

Table 5 Evaluatton measures for automatic extractton methods 
Automatic Extracts 
Table 5 mdtcates that global bushy paths and aug- 
mented segmented bushy paths produce the best extracts 
among the four paths considered m flus study 55% of 
the paragraphs selected by the process were considered 
important by at least one user OptmusUcally spealang, 
a global bushy or an augmented segmented bushy path 
may be expected toagree approximately 46% with a user 
Tlus number is at par with the agreement between two 
humans (45 81%) This result is reassunng m terms of 
? the method's viablhty for generating good extracts, ince 
the scheme performs as well as a human 
About 47% of the paragraphs deemed important by 
both users are included m the bushy extract for an amcle 
This figure ms somewhat dlsbeartemng We expected a 
better coverage of these vital paragraphs by our extracts 
A further study of these paragraphs nught reveal some 
propemes that users look for in a paragraph to decide 
its importance It might then be possible to automate 
this selection process We also ldenufied the arucles 
for which the intersection of the two user summaries 
is a single paragraph For 78% of these amcles, this 
paragraph was included in the bushy path 
Segmented bushy paths perform worse than expected 
Tills Is because the first paragraph of an artacle Is very 
often selected by users, and segmented bushy paths oc- 
casronally omit flus paragraaph Tins results m a decrease 
m the overlap between automauc and manual extracts 
In contrast, the other paths are guaranteed to include 
the first paragraph, and perform better But, in general, 
the performance of segmented bushy paths was saus- 
factory (45 48% overlap with the user in the opunusuc 
method) Smularly, the performance of the depth-first 
path was also sausfactory All paths aclueved the tram- 
mum reqtmement of perfonmng significantly better than 
a random extract 
But more lnteresUngly, we observe that extracts pro- 
duced by selecting the first few paragraphs of the amcles 
also performed comparably tothe best paragraph extrac- 
Uon scheme Adrmttedly, our evaluation methodology 
lacks the evaluaUon of the readabdlty aspect of a sum- 
mary wluch was one of the mmn mouvauons ofmoving 
from a sentence-based extracuon strategy to paragraph- 
based extracUon With very high chances, the lead sum- 
mary roll outperform all other automauc summaries m 
terms of readabthty We beheve this because automauc 
summaries are a forced concatenauon f paragraphs &s- 
tnbuted all across a document, whereas alead summary 
Is a mcely coherent sequence of paragraphs, as wntten 
by the author Overall, the lead summanes are compa- 
rable to the best summanzauon strategy and could be 
more readable than allother summaries Tlus troth is 
rather discouraging for the feasthlhty of automauc sum- 
manzauon by text extracUon but agrees wlth the obser- 
vauons m (Brandow et al 1995) News reports, used 
m (Brandow et al 1995), frequently contmn a leading 
paragraph t at summanzes the story contmned inthe rest 
of the report Likewise, m the encyclope&a amcles used

that he overlap between the two manual extracts i , 
on an average, 46%, and given the enormous reduc- 
uon m the amount of resources reqmred 4,our results 
indicate that automauc methods for extracuon com- 
pare very favorably with manual extracUon 
? But the bad news ms that a summary formed by 
extracung the mltmi paragraphs of an arUcle IS as 
good as the best automatic summary and might just 
be more readable from a user's perspective Tins 
bnngs into question the overall uUhty of automatic 
text summanzatmn bytext (sentence or paragraph) 
extracUon - 
It ms possible that the nature of the articles used m 
thls study (encyclope&a amcles) and m (Brandow et al 
1995) (news articles) have a structure that yields very 
good summanes, tmply by extracting the initial part of 
an ar~cle It wdl be interesting to see lfobservattons from 
flus study and from (Brand0w et al 1995) carry over to 
other, more non-encyclopedia likeand non-news like do- 
mmns (for example legal documents or U S Patents) 
In our stu&es with text summanzauon (by text extrac- 
uon), we have always felt a very strong need for a good 
evaluauon test-bed Lack of good objecuve valuauon 
techniques for text summanzauon has always been the 
biggest problem in all our work, an~ has consistently

for each of 50 amcles A human would reqmre about 10 nunutes 
to produce a summary for a typical amcle from tlus set

5 Conclusion 
In tlus study, we have tried to evaluate automattc sum- 
manzaUon methods proposed earlier If a good testbed 
for evaluaUng summaries were available, the evalualaon 
methodology adopted m this study could be improved, 
but we believe it is the best we can currently do Under. 
our evaluation scheme, the four extraclaon algorithms 
exanuned perform comparably, but they produced sigmf- 
lcantly better extracts than a random selection of para- 
graphs The absolute performance figures are not/ugh, 
but given the low overlap between two human-generated 
extracts, they are enunenfly satisfactory However, this 
wide vanatton between users brings us to the question of 
whether summanzauon byautomauc extracuon is feasi- 
ble If humans are unable to agree on wluch paragraphs 
best represent an amcle, it is unreasonable to expect an 
automauc procedure to identify the best extract, what- 
ever that might be We also find that presenting the user 
with the lmUal part of an arucle is as good as emploYing 
any "mtelhgent" ext extraction scheme In summary, 
automauc summanzauon by extractuon is admtttedly an 
imperfect method However, at the moment, itdoes ap- 
pear to be the only domain-independent t chnique which 
performs reasonably
