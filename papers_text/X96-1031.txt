ABSTRACT 
Over the past few years, HNC has developed 
a neural network based, vector space approach to text 
retrieval. This approach, embodied in a system called 
MatchPlus, allows the user to retrieve information on 
the basis of meaning and context of a fi'ee text query. 
The MatchPlus system uses a neural network based, 
constrained sel~organization technique to learn word 
stem interrelationships directly 3~om a training 
corpus, thereby eliminating the need for hand crafted 
linguistic knowledge bases and their often substantial 
maintenance requirements. This paper presents 
results fi'om recent enhancements o the basic 
MatchPlus concept. These nhancements include the 
development ofa one step learning law that greatly 
reduces the amount of time and~or computational 
resources required to train the system, and the 
development ofa prototype multilingual (English and 
Spanish) text retrieval system. 
1. INTRODUCTION 
While the current MatchPlus learning law has 
proven to be effective in encoding relationships 
between words, it is computationally intensive and 
requires multiple passes through the training corpus. 
The purpose of the one step learning law is to 
approximate he behavior of the original earning law 
while performing only a single pass through the 
training corpus. The one step learning law uses a 
single pass through the training corpus to obtain 
desired dot product values for the set of trained 
context vectors. The desired dot product values are 
determined on the basis of information theoretic 
statistical relationships between co-occurring word 
stems found in the training corpus. Desired dot 
products are found such that words that tend to co- 
occur will have context vectors that point in similar 
directions while words that do not co-occur will have 
context vectors that tend to be orthogonal. These 
desired ot products are used to perform a quasi-linear 
transformation  an initial set of quasi-orthogonal, 
high dimensional vectors. This vector transformation 
and subsequent renormalization results in a set of 
context vectors that represents the relationships 
between word stems in a near-optimal fashion. The 
time requirements for training this set of vectors cale 
as O(Nn) where N is the number of word stems in the 
vocabulary and n is the average number of word stems 
found to co-occur (and/or be related to) any given 
word stem (usually on the order of several hundred). 
This new learning law reduces the training time by a 
factor on the order of 100 over the original context 
vector learning law with little or no degradation i
performance. Results can be improved even further by 
adjusting the dimension of the context vectors. 
HNC has also developed an approach to 
learning stem-level relationships across multiple 
languages and has used this approach to develop a 
prototype multilingual retrieval system. This 
technique, called "symmetric learning", is based upon 
the use of tie words, which provide connectivity 
between each language's portion of the context vector 
space. In the symmetric approach, learning is 
conducted using both languages simultaneously, thus 
removing any donor language biases. Tie words are 
used to connect the context vector space for multiple 
languages through a "unified hash table". The unified 
hash table provides the mechanism to translate a stem 
into an associated context vector. In the English-only 
MatchPlus ystem, this is a straight forward process. 
The stem in question is fed to the hashing function and 
the index is produced. The resulting index is the offset 
in the stem hash table. The content of that location in 
the hash table is a pointer to the context vector data 
structure. Using this approach (hash fimction 
collisions not withstanding), each unique stem results 
in a unique entry and thus a unique context vector. In 
the multilingual system, a tie word list is used to 
provide multiple references, one word stem ffi'om each 
language, for common context vectors. Context vector 
learning is performed in multiple languages 
149 
simultaneously using multilingual training corpora. 
HNC has performed preliminary evaluation of an 
English-Spanish version of this system by examining 
stem trees for tie words and non-tie words. Results 
indicate that the English-Spanish MatchPlus prototype 
is able to learn reasonable word stem interrelationships 
for tie words and non-tie words, thereby demonstrating 
the suitability of this concept for further development. 
2. TECHNICAL BACKGROUND 
The HNC MatchPlus system was developed 
as part of the ARPA-sponsored TIPSTER text 
program. MatchPlus uses an information 
representation scheme called context vectors to encode 
similarity of usage. Other vector space approaches to
text retrieval exist, but none embody the ability to 
learn word-level relationships \[1-5\]. Key attributes of 
the context vector approach are as follows: During 
this effort, the initially proposed context vector 
approach using human defined coordinates and initial 
conditions was extended and refmed to allow fully 
automatic generation of context vectors for text 
symbols (stems) based upon their demonstrated 
context of usage in training text. The MatchPlus 
system learns relationships at the stem level and then 
uses those relationships to construct a context vector 
representation for sets of symbols. For the text case, 
these sets of symbols are paragraphs, documents and 
queries. 
To start the learning process, each stem is 
associated with a random vector in the context vector 
space. Random unit vectors in high dimensional 
floating point spaces have a property that is referred to 
a "quasi-orthogonality"\[6\]. That is, the expected value 
of the dot product between any pair of random context 
vectors elected fi'om the set is approximately equal to 
zero (i.e. all vectors are approximately perpendicular 
to one another). This property of quasi-orthogonality 
is important because it serves as the initial condition 
for the context vector learning algorithm. The usage 
of the context vector technique is predicated upon the 
rule that symbols (stems) that are used in a similar 
context (exhibit proximate co-occurrence behavior) 
will have trained vectors that point in similar 
directions. Conversely, stems that never appear in a 
similar context will have context vectors that are 
approximately orthogonal. 
To achieve the desired representation, the 
context vector learning algorithm must take the 
context vectors for symbols that co-occur and move 
them toward each other. Symbols that do not co-occur 
are left in their quasi-orthogonal original condition. It 
is a basic tenet of the MatchPlus approach that "words 
that are used in a similar context convey similar 
meaning". Since the learning is driven by proximate 
co-occurrence of words, the learning results in a vector 
set where closeness in the space is equivalent o 
closeness in subject content. To perform learning, a 
learning window is used to identify local context. The 
window is "slid" through each document in the corpus. 
The window has 1 target stem and multiple neighbor 
stems. Once the context window has been determined, 
the learning rule of "Move context vector for target in 
the direction of the context vector of the neighbors" is
applied. Once the correction is made, we move the 
learning window to next location and the learning 
operation is repeated. The equation for this learning is 
shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1. MatchPlus Learning Equations 
Several points should be noted: 
? All stem vectors are of length 1 (unit vectors). In 
this paradigm, only the direction of the vector 
carries information. 
? Fully trained vectors have the property that words 
that are used in a similar context will have vectors 
that point in similar directions as measured by the 
dot product. 
? Words that are never used in a similar context will 
retain their initial condition of quasi- 
orthogonality. That is, approximately orthogonal 
with a dot product of approximately zero. 
? Trained context vectors result in a concept space 
where similarity of direction corresponds to 
similarity of meaning. 
? No human knowledge is required for training to 
occur. Only flee text examples are needed. 
150 
* The algorithm determines the coordinate space of 
the context vectors. 
When the training is complete, "words that 
are used in a similar context will have their associated 
vectors point in similar directions". Conversely, 
words that are never used in a similar context will 
have vectors that are approximately orthogonal. 
At the summary level, the MatchPlus ystem 
translates flee text into a mathematical representation 
in a meaningful way. Note that the MatchPlus 
approach does not use any external dictionaries, 
thesauri or knowledge bases to determine word vector 
relationships. These relationships are learned 
automatically using only the text examples provided 
for learning. The result of the learning procedure is a 
vocabulary of stem context vectors that can be used 
for a variety of applications including document 
retrieval \[7\], routing \[8\], document clustering and 
other text processing tasks. 
Once the stem learning is complete, it is 
possible to "query" the vector set to determine the 
nature of the learned relationships. To perform this 
operation, the user selects a "root" word and the 
trained context vector for that word is determined by a 
table lookup in the context vector vocabulary. 
MatchPlus computes the dot product of every other 
word vector in the vocabulary to the selected word. 
The resulting dot products are sorted by magnitude 
where larger means closer in usage. 
Sets of words (text passages and queries) and 
documents can also be represented by context vectors 
in the same information space. Document context 
vectors are derived as the inverse document 
frequency-weighted sum of the context vectors 
associated with words in the document. Document 
context vectors are normalized to prevent long 
documents from being favored over short documents. 
The resulting document context vectors have the 
property that documents that discuss similar themes 
will have context vectors that point in similar 
directions. It is this property that translates the 
problem of assessment of similarity of content for text 
into a geometry problem. Documents that are similar 
are close in the space and dissimilar documents are far 
away. Additionally, it should be noted that all 
document vectors are unit length. This prevents 
system biases in retrieval due to document length. 
3. ONE STEP CONTEXT VECTOR 
LEARNING 
The sections below describe an approach to 
context vector learning that greatly reduces the amount 
of computer time and resources required to obtain a 
trained set of stem context vectors. This approach 
uses a single pass through the training corpus (or 
corpora) to obtain desired dot product values for the 
set of trained context vectors. These desired dot 
products are used in a single pass through the 
vocabulary of word stems to expand a starting set of 
quasi-orthogonal, high dimensional vectors. This 
vector expansion and subsequent renormalization 
results in a set of context vectors that represents he 
relationships between words stems in a near-optimal 
fashion. The time requirements for training this set of 
vectors cale as O(Nn) where N is the number of word 
stems in the vocabulary and n is the average number of 
word stems found to co-occur (and/or be related to) 
any given word stem (usually on the order of several 
hundred). Using a near-worst case estimate of n = 1000 
word stems, a vocabulary size of 50,000 words, and 
assuming that at least ten iterations of the original 
learning law are required for convergence (more often 
at least one hundred iterations are required), this new 
learning law reduces the training time by a factor of 
between 10 and 500 (depending on whether or not the 
non co-occurring terms are explicitly considered in the 
current learning law). 
3.1 Current MatchPlus Context Vector 
Learning Law 
The current MatchPlus context vector 
learning law is presented in Figure 1 and discussed in 
Section 2. This learning law can be derived as a 
stochastic gradient descent procedure for minimizing 
the cost function

where:

where:

Figure 3. Learning Law Vector Magnitude 
Constraints 
The factors at ,  b are the desired ot products 
for the trained set of context vectors. These desired 
dot products are found as a function of co-occurrence 
statistics for word stems i and j. In most cases the 
number of words for which a j . j  is non-zero (i.e. the 
co-occurring words) is several orders of magnitude 
smaller than the size of the vocabulary. In theory, the 
summation on the right hand side extends over all 
word stems in the vocabulary. In practice, however, 
this summation is performed only over words that co- 
occur with the target word stem i. Since n=number of 
co-occurring words is usually much less than 
N=number of vocabulary word stems, summing only 
over co-occurring words represents a considerable 
time savings. Non co-occurring word stem context 
vectors are adjusted by subtracting the mean context 
vector at the end of each update iteration. This has the 
effect of spreading out the context vectors, hopefully 
driving the context vectors of non co-occurring words 
closer to orthogonality. With this approximation, the 
time requirements for the current learning law scale as 
O(kNn) where k is the number of iterations required 
for convergence. 
3.2 Approach to One Step Learning 
The objective of any learning law used to 
train context vectors is to minimize the cost function 
specified in Figure 2 subject to the constraints in 
Figure 3. In order to avoid the requirement for 
multiple iterations, HNC proposes to evaluate the 
performance ofthe following one step learning law: 
r : ' -  = r, 
J 
TiN~w Ti N?" 
= I I r : " l l  
where: 
i~ M" = Context vector of target i after one step update 
i~ = Context vector of target i before update 
i~ = Context vector for word stem j before update. Word 
stem j co- occurs with word stem i
tl = Design parameter chosen to optimize performance 
a u = Desired context vector dot product for 
target i and co- occurring stemj 
Figure 4. One Step Learning Law Equations. 
Note that the summation in Figure 4 is over 
co-occurring word stems. This learning law is 
motivated by the following observation. Suppose 
there exists a cost function of two variables Xl and x2, 
where J (x , ,x2)=~X(a#-x ,  xb) 2 . Suppose 
i , j= l ,2  
further that we wish to choose 8x I and 8x  2 such that 
replacing x~ and xz with the quantities x I + 8x  I and 
x 2 +Sx  2 minimizes the cost function. For the 
situation in which IIx,ll=llx211 =1 and 8x I and 8x 2 
are assumed to be small, it is easily demonstrated that 
the solutions for 8x I and #x 2 are 8x  I = a~2 x2 and 
2 
_ O~12 #x 2 - -~- -x  I . Adding these solutions to x~ and x2 
yields an expression similar to that of Figure 4. Of 
course, the fact that the resulting vectors must be 
normalized makes the analogy only approximate. 
However, Figure 4 can be viewed as a one step 
approximation to the optimal solution. The value of 
this approximate solution is that it provides adequate 
performance with only a fraction of the computational 
requirements. This one step learning law scales as 
O(Nn), so that it is faster than the current learning law 
by a factor of k (number of original learning law 
iterations) and is faster than the theoretically derived 
learning law by a factor of kN/n. For reasonable 
values of k, N, and n, this translated into a time 
savings of a factor of 10 to 1000. 
3.3 Summary of One Step Learning 
The successful development and testing of 
the one step learning law offers the possibility of much 
faster context vector training. The performance of the 
152 
system using this law can be optimized through 
parameter sweeps on context vector dimension and 
free parameter 1"1 (see Figure 4). 
4. APPROACH TO MULTILINGUAL 
INFORMATION RETRIEVAL (MIR) 
The objective of solving the MIR problem is 
to provide the analyst/user with a flexible high 
performance tool to allow retrieval of relevant 
information from multilingual corpora without the 
need for prior translation of large volumes of text. 
The key issue is prior translation of the 
foreign language material. Clearly, if all material was 
translated to a uniform representation, say English, the 
problem is solved. However, translation is time 
consuming, costly and subjective. Additionally, the 
current volumes of information would overwhelm any 
organization who attempted to perform bulk 
translation. Machine translation efforts have been 
partially successful, but these techniques frequently 
ignore subtleties in the translation process. 
Additionally, the cost of development, tuning and 
validation of this approach is a hindrance to 
widespread use. 
HNC has developed an approach to the MIR 
problem that leverages the context vector technology. 
It is called symmetric learning and its attributes, as 
well as the implications of its attributes, are discussed 
in the section below. Explanations of the approach 
will be given from the frame of reference of two 
simultaneous languages. However, it should be noted 
that hese approaches are extensible to many languages 
being processed simultaneously. These discussions 
assume that language 1 is English and language 2 is 
Spanish. It should also be noted that HNC has 
implemented a minimal subset of the symmetric 
approach as a proof of concept. The preliminary 
results are extremely encouraging. A description of 
this system, the training corpus and the preliminary 
results are provided in Section 5. 
4.1 Symmetric Learning 
HNC has developed an approach to learning 
stem-level relationships across multiple languages. 
This technique, called "symmetric learning", is based 
upon the use of tie words. These tie words provide 
connectivity between each language's portion of the 
context vector space. However, learning is conducted 
using both languages imultaneously, thus removing 
any donor language biases. 
The symmetric approach is based upon the 
use of a "unified hash table". The unified hash table 
provides the mechanism to translate a stem into an 
associated context vector. In the English-only 
MatchPlus ystem, this is a straight forward process. 
The stem in question is fed to the hashing function and 
an index is produced. The resulting index is the offset 
in the stem hash table. The contents of that location in 
the hash table is a pointer to the context vector data 
structure. Using this approach (hash function 
collisions not withstanding), each unique stem results 
in a unique entry and thus a unique context vector. 
What is proposed is to use the tie word list to provide 
references for common context vectors. An example 
is shown in Figure 5. Assume that "attack" and 
"ataque" have been chosen as a tie word pair. Since 
these words should have the same context vector, 
some form of connection must be made between the 
words. Figure 5 shows 4 words in the unified hash 
table: "rebel", "attack", "ataque", and "contra". 
Without hash table unification based upon the tie word 
list, all four words would have unique and independent 
context vectors. However, as can be seen in the 
figure, the hash table entries for the tie words have 
been forced to point to a common context vector entry. 
This very simple approach allows multiple references 
to the same context vector entity.

Figure 5. Unified Hash Table Example. 
Once the mechanism for multiple references 
has been established, the next step is to consider the 
actual training algorithm. Example training text for 
English and Spanish is shown in Figure 6. For this 
example, it is assumed that the pair "attack" and 
"ataque" are a tie word pair. Note that in this 
example, the text chosen is a near-literal translation. 
There is no requirement for parallel text for the 
153 
symmetric learning algorithm. The English text in 
Figure 6 comes from the passage, "Four people were 
killed in the attack by the rebel group Shining Path". 
The corresponding Spanish text is "Quatro personas 
fiJeron matadas en el ataque por el group contras 
Sendero Luminoso". Figure 6 shows the context 
window for the stemmed text centered on the tie word 
attack. 
Like the standard MatchPlus context vector 
learning algorithm, the symmetric learning approach 
will utilize a convolutional "context window" with a 
center and neighbors. The stem at the center of the 
window is called the "target". The context vector for 
the target stem is adjusted in the direction of its 
neighbors' context vectors. 
peopl kill attack rebel group 
neighbor target neighbor 
person mat ataq group contr 
neighbor target neighbor 
Figure 6. Symmetric Learning Example. 
The steps that will occur during learning 
given the text example shown in Figure 6 are as 
follows: 
? The convolutional window location is chosen and 
the target and neighbor stems are identified. In 
the English portion of this example, the window is 
centered on the word "attack". The neighbor 
words are "people", "killed", "rebel", and 
"group". 
? The context vector for "attack" is moved in the 
direction of its neighbors. When the update is 
completed, the window is moved and the process 
is repeated. 
? Spanish text is processed using the same 
approach. In the Spanish portion of this example, 
the window has as its center the word "ataque". 
Neighbors for "ataque" are "personas", matado", 
"groupo", and "contra". The context vector for 
"ataque" is moved in the direction of its 
neighbors. When the update is completed, the 
window is moved and the process is repeated. 
? Note that "attack" and "ataque" are a tie word 
pair. As a consequence, they share a common 
context vector. As a consequence, the context 
vector for this pair has been influenced by the 
words that have occurred in a similar context in 
both languages. Specifically, the attack-ataque 
tie word pair has been influenced by "people", 
"kill", "rebel", "group", "personas", "matado", 
"groupo", and "contra". 
? Since all context vectors are in the same 
information space, the symmetric learning 
technique will result in a unified information 
space for both languages. Because of the "second 
order" learning effects of the context vector 
approach, not only will "attack" be related to 
"people" and "personas", but "people" will be 
related to "personas", matado", groupo", etc. 
The block diagram for generation of a system 
using the symmetric approach is shown in Figure 7. As 
can be seen in this figure, the symmetric system build 
uses the unified hash table as the basis for combining 
the stem sets from both languages. Once this process 
has taken place, all stem context vectors are stored in a 
single dataset. This unified set of context vectors is 
the basis for formation of document context vectors. 
When the system generation is complete, MIR is ready 
for query processing. The block diagram for this 
process is shown in Figure 8.

Figure 8. Symmetric Approach Query Processing. 
Attributes of the symmetric learning approach 
are as follows: 
1. Once tie word pairs (or n-toples) have been 
selected, all subsequent processing is fully 
automated. No other external knowledge sources 
are required. 
2. Training text can be presented in any order. All 
of language 1 can be presented, followed by 
language 2. Alternately, documents from the two 
languages can be presented in intermixed order. 
3. Context vector approach will learn "second order" 
relationships between the languages used for 
training. The resulting unified context vector set 
can be used to identify relationships between 
words in the two languages. 
4. The user can enter multi lingual queries based on 
tie words as well as non tie words. Because all 
the text is used during training second order 
relationships will be formed between non tie 
words in different languages. As an extreme 
example if "white" is only used as "white house" 
and "blanca" is only used as in "casablanca" the 
user will be able to query using only "white" and 
Spanish documents about "casa blanca" will be 
retrieved. This is not so in the previous approach 
where the user is limited to using only tie words 
as query terms. 
5. The basic approach described here is extensible 
and capable of processing more than two 
languages at once. Additionally, this approach 
can be utilized for ideographic languages such as 
Japanese, Chinese and Korean. 
The key benefit of the MatchPlus context 
vector approach is its ability to learn the relationships 
between words. To simply disregard the relationships 
contained in the foreign data simply does not make 
sense. The Symmetric Learning approach exploits the 
learned relationships without he need to translate the 
foreign text. The Symmetric Learning approach 
requires only the translation of a limited number of 
words (tie words). Furthermore, this operation eed 
only be done once. 
The benefits of a multilingual approach to 
text processing extend well beyond text retrieval. 
Obviously, text routing and index term assignment 
could benefit from multilingual technology. Language 
learning tools could exploit he technology to analyze 
the relationships between word usage's across 
languages. Finally, as innovative text visualization 
techniques are found, multilingual text processing will 
surely enhance the value of such technology. 
5. PRELIMINARY RESULTS OF 
SYMMETRIC LEARNING TESTS 
As stated above, HNC has implemented a 
limited scope preliminary test of the symmetric 
learning approach. A preliminary set of 465 tie-words 
was prepared. This list consisted of words of nearly 
equivalent meaning in both English and Spanish. 
Approximately 100 tie-words were selected from the 
Spanish TREC topics. The balance were selected 
from high frequency words in the Spanish text. The 
corpus used for testing consisted of data from three 
sources as shown in Table 1.

Table 1. Bilingual Training Corpus Statistics. 
The total number of stems in this test was 
32739. The stemmer was disabled for both Spanish 
and English. The existing MatchPlus learning 
algorithm was run on the resulting bilingual corpus. 
When training was complete, a series of stem trees 
were prepared to assess the nature of the learned 
relationships. Ideally, one would hope to see both 
English and Spanish words in the stem trees. The 
presence of bilingual information in the tree would 
indicate that he basic approach is viable. 
Stem trees were performed for both tie-words 
and non-tie-words. Based upon the earlier assertion 
155 
that the presence of bilingual information indicated 
correct behavior, the true proof of the concept is to 
demonstrate hat bilingual information occurs in stem 
trees for non-tie-words.

linguistic boundaries. Specifically, the list contains 
"infected" and "infectadas" and "infectados". Also, 
the list contains related terms like "portadores' 
(carriers). These relationships, though not 
unexpected, bodes well for the potential of the 
approach. Clearly, for tie-words, the technique will 
work. The true test is the stem trees for non-tie-words. 
Table 3 and Table 4 show the stem trees for 
the non-tie-words "immuniodeficiency" and 
"inmunodeficiencia". Clearly, their context of usage 
in the two languages should be similar and 
consequently, their" stem trees should be similar. 
Inspection of Table 3 and Table 4 show exactly the 
type of behavior desired. Indeed, all the correct 
Spanish terms are present in the stem tree for the 
English root "immuniodeficiency" and likewise for the 
Spanish root "inmunodeficiencia". This data suggests 
that the proposed approach as a very high probability 
of correctly representing the terms in both Spanish and 
English in a unified meaning space. 
To add one more example of the ability of the 
context vector approach to identify second order 
relationships, consider the stem tree for the term 
"monopoly" shown in Table 5. Notice that MatchPlus 
correctly detects the relationship between "monopoly" 
and "pemex" the Mexican national oil company. 
Table 4. Stem Tree for Non-Tie-Word

Table 2 shows the stem tree for the tie-word 
"AIDS". In Spanish, AIDS has the acronym "SIDA" 
which stands for sindrome inmuno deficiencia 
adquirida. Also note that HIV in Spanish is VIH for 
virus inmunodeficiencia humana. Inspection of Table 
2 shows that all stems present make sense and that the 
stem tree captures the contextual similarity across

5.1. Multilingual Approach Summary 
The success demonstrated on bilingual text 
characterization strongly suggests that the context 
vector approach will provide an effective means of 
providing multilingual information retrieval. Because 
the preliminary results are so positive, HNC proposes 
to extend the preliminary demonstration system to 
Spanish in two steps. The first step for Spanish will be 
to develop all the required support files and software 
for the Spanish language including stop lists, 
stemmers, etc. This will result in a full capability 
MatchPlus ystem for Spanish. The second step will 
be to continue development of an English-Spanish 
MatchPlus ystem by augmenting the current ie-word 
list and to perform a series of engineering 
experiments. These experiments will identify the 
sensitivity of system performance to the 
characteristics of the tie-words chosen.
