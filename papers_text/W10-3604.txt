Abstract 
A morphological analyzer forms the 
foundation for many NLP applications of 
Indian Languages. In this paper, we pro-
pose and evaluate the morphological 
analyzer for Marathi, an inflectional lan-
guage. The morphological analyzer ex-
ploits the efficiency and flexibility of-
fered by finite state machines in model-
ing the morphotactics while using the 
well devised system of paradigms to 
handle the stem alternations intelligently 
by exploiting the regularity in inflection-
al forms. We plug the morphological 
analyzer with statistical pos tagger and 
chunker to see its impact on their per-
formance so as to confirm its usability as 
a foundation for NLP applications. 
1 Motivation and Problem Definition 
A highly inflectional language has the capability 
of generating hundreds of words from a single 
root. Hence, morphological analysis is vital for 
high level applications to understand various 
words in the language. Morphological analyzer 
forms the foundation for applications like infor-
mation retrieval, POS tagging, chunking and 
ultimately the machine translation. Morphologi-
cal analyzers for various languages have been 
studied and developed for years. But, this re-
search is dominated by the morphological ana-
lyzers for agglutinative languages or for the lan-
guages like English that show low degree of in-
flection. Though agglutinative languages show 
high morpheme per word ratio and have com-
plex morphotactic structures, the absence of fu-
sion at morpheme boundaries makes the task of 
segmentation fluent once the model for imple-
mentation of morphotactics is ready. On this 
background, a morphological analyzer for highly 
inflectional language like Marathi which has the 
tendency to overlay the morphemes in a way that 
aggravates the task of segmentation presents an 
interesting case study. 
Eryi?it and Adal? (2004) propose a suf-
fix stripping approach for Turkish. The rule 
based and agglutinative nature of Turkish allows 
the language to be modeled using FSMs and 
does not need a lexicon. The morphological ana-
lyzer does not face the problem of the changes 
taking place at morpheme boundaries which is 
not the case with inflectional languages. Hence, 
although apprehensible this model is not suffi-
cient for handling the morphology of Marathi. 
Many morphological analyzers have 
been developed using the two-level morphologi-
cal model (Koskenniemi, 1983) for 
morphological analysis. (Oflazer, 1993; Kim et 
al., 1994) have been developed using PC-
Kimmo (Antworth, 1991), a morphological 
parser based on the two-level model. Concep-
tually, the model segments the word in its con-
stituent parts, and accounts for phonological and 
orthographical changes within a word. While, 
the model proves to be very useful for develop-
ing the morphological analyzers for agglutina-
tive languages or the languages with very less 
degree of inflection, it fails to explicitly capture 
the regularities within and between paradigms 
present in the inflectional languages. Marathi 
has a well defined paradigm-based system of 
inflection. Hence, we decided to develop our 
own model which works on the similar lines of 
PC-Kimmo (Antworth, 1991) but exploits the 
26
usefulness of paradigm-based inflectional sys-
tem. 
Bharati et al (2004) propose a paradigm 
based algorithm for morphological analysis of 
Hindi, an inflecting language. In Hindi, the in-
flected forms of roots do not allow further at-
tachment of any other suffixes. In contrast, in 
Marathi once the root is transformed into its in-
flected form it is followed by suffixes to show 
its agreement with the other words in the sen-
tence. Some postpositions derive new words 
which themselves may undergo inflection and 
allow attachment of other suffixes. This makes 
the simple paradigm-based model proposed in 
this work unfit for Marathi morphological analy-
sis. 
Dixit et al (2006) developed a morphological 
analyzer with a purpose of using it for spell 
checking. Though their analyzer successfully 
analyzes the words with a single suffix, its scope 
is restricted to the handling of only first level 
suffixes. 
1.1 Our Approach 
In this paper, we present the morphological 
analyzer for Marathi which is official language 
of the state of Maharashtra (India). With 90 
million fluent speakers worldwide, Marathi 
ranks as the 4th most spoken language in India 
and the 15th most in the world. The methodology 
is based on the use of paradigm-based 
inflectional system combined with finite state 
machines (FSMs) for modeling the 
morphotactics. To the best of our knowledge, 
such an approach has never been tried out for 
Marathi. The crux of the system lies in the 
detailed study of morphosyntactic phenomena, 
the morphotactic structure of the language and 
the use of paradigm-based inflectional system. 
The approach can be used for other inflection-
al languages by developing the resources like 
language specific inflection rules and the FSM 
that models the morphotactics for the language. 
1.2 Marathi Morphology 
Marathi is a morphologically rich language. It is 
highly inflectional and also shows derivation to 
a high degree. Like other synthetic languages, 
Marathi morphological analysis faces some 
well-known challenges. Words contain multiple 
morphemes fused together in such a way that, it 
becomes difficult to segment them. A single 
morpheme contains a bunch of grammatical 
attributes associated with it which creates a chal-
lenge for morphological parsing. A single root is 
capable of generating hundreds of words by 
combining with the other morphemes. 
The complexity involved in the formation of a 
polymorphemic word can be better illustrated 
using an example. Consider the word 
 {devaasaarakhyaalaa} (to the one 
like the god). The nominal root ? ? {deva} 
(god) gets inflected to the oblique case, singular 
form ? ? {devaa} which is then followed by 
the adjectival suffix ? ? {saarakhaa} (alike). 
This derives the adjective ? ? {devaa-
saarakhaa} (the one like the god) which then 
starts behaving like a noun. This noun on getting 
inflected to the oblique case, singular form 
 {devasaarakhyaa} is followed by the 
case marker  {laa} (to). This gives the word 
 {devaasaarakhyaalaa} (to the one 
like the god). Equation 1 illustrates this process. 
 
 
 
Equation 1. Formation of  {de-
vaasaarakhyaalaa} (to the one like the god) 
 
This suggests that the process of formation of 
polymorphemic words is recursive in nature with 
inflection taking place at every level of recur-
sion. 
Section 2 discusses the design of the morpho-
logical analyzer which tries to overcome the 
problems discussed above with respect to Mara-
thi language. Sections 3 and 4 discuss the lin-
guistic resources and the processing of words 
belonging to various categories respectively. 
Sections 5 and discuss the classification of suf-
fixes and development of automata based on this 
classification respectively. Section 7 briefs on 
the experimental setup and the results.

2 Morphological Analyzer for Marathi 
The formation of polymorphemic words leads to 
complexities which need to be handled during 
the analysis process. FSMs prove to be elegant 
and computationally efficient tools for modeling 
the suffix ordering in such words. However, the 
recursive process of word formation in Marathi 
involves inflection at the time of attachment of 
every new suffix. The FSMs need to be capable 
of handling them. Koskenniemi (1983) suggests 
the use of separate FSMs to model the ortho-
graphic changes. But, Marathi has a well devised 
system of paradigms to handle them. One of our 
observations led us to a solution that combines 
paradigm-based inflectional system with FSM 
for modeling. The observation was that, during 
the ith recursion only (i-1)th morpheme changes 
its form which can be handled by suitably mod-
ifying the FSM. The formation of the same word 
devaasaarakhyaalaa described above can be 
viewed as illustrated in Equation 2. 
 
 
Equation 2. Simulating the formation of 
 {devaasaarakhyaalaa} (to the 
one like the god) 
Generalizing the word formation process we ar-
rived at the formulation specified by Equation 3.  
 
Equation 3. Formulation of Polymorphemic 
Word Formation 
This requires a morphotactic FSM which is 
aware of the inflected forms of morphemes in 
addition to the actual morphemes to handle the 
above recursive process of word formation. We 
use the paradigm-based system to generate the 
inflected form of the morphemes and feed them 
to the FSM. Figure 1 shows the architecture of 
the morphological analyzer based on this philos-
ophy. 
Inflector inflects all morphemes in the lex-
icon using the inflection rules associated with 
the paradigms to which they belong.  
Given a word, Morphological Recognizer 
recognizes the constituent morphemes in their 
inflected forms using finite state machine that 
models the morphotactics. For example, the out-
put of the Morphological Recognizer for the 
word devaasaarakhyaalaa is devaa + saarakhyaa 
+ laa. Morphological Parser outputs per mor-
pheme analysis of the word using the mor-
phemes recognized by the Morphological Re-
cognizer. 
3 Linguistic Resources 
The linguistic resources required by the morpho-
logical analyzer include a lexicon and inflection 
rules for all paradigms. 
3.1 Lexicon 
An entry in lexicon consists of a tuple <root, 
paradigm, category>. The category specifies the 
grammatical category of the root and the para-
digm helps in retrieving the inflection rules as-
sociated with it. Our lexicon contains in all 
24035 roots belonging to different categories. 
 
Figure 1. Architecture of Marathi Morphological Analyzer

3.2 Inflection Rules 
Inflection rules specify the inflectional suffixes 
to be inserted (or deleted) to (or from) different 
positions in the root to get its inflected form. An 
inflectional rule has the format: <inflectional 
suffixes, morphosyntactic features, label>. The 
element morphosyntactic features specifies the 
set of morphosyntactic features associated with 
the inflectional form obtained by applying the 
given inflection rule. Following is the exhaustive 
list of morphosyntactic features to which differ-
ent morphemes get inflected: 
1) Case: Direct, Oblique 
2) Gender: Masculine, Feminine, Neuter, 
Non-specific 
3) Number: Singular, Plural, Non-specific 
4) Person: 1st, 2nd, 3rd 
5) Tense: Past, Present, Future 
6) Aspect: Perfective, Completive, Fre-
quentative, Habitual, Durative, Incep-
tive, Stative 
7) Mood: Imperative, Probabilitive, Sub-
junctive, Conditional, Deontic, Abiltive, 
Permissive 
The label specifies the morphotactic class to 
which the inflected form (generated by applying 
the inflection rule) belongs. It is used by the 
Morphological Recognizer. 
4 Category Wise Morphological For-
mulation 
The grammatical categories observed in Marathi 
include nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, ad-
verbs, conjunctions, interjections and postposi-
tions. The morphemes belonging to different 
categories undergo different treatment. 
4.1 Noun Morphology 
Marathi nouns inflect for number and case. 
Postpositions get attached to the oblique forms 
of the nouns (known as stems) to show their re-
lationship with other words in the sentence. A 
single stem is used for the attachment of all 
postpositions which makes nominal morphology 
absolute economic in nature. For example vari-
ous forms of the word  {daara} (door) are 
 {daaraasa} (to the door),  {daa-
raane} (by the door),  {daaraashejarii} 
(besides the door). Please note that the same 
stem  {daaraa} is used for the attachment of 
various postpositions. 
Depending upon their ending, gender 
and the inflectional patterns, the nouns in Mara-
thi can be classified into various paradigms. A 
paradigm is a complete set of related inflectional 
forms associated with a given root. All words 
that share the similar inflectional forms fall in 
the same paradigm. Table 1 presents the para-
digm  {daara} (door). 
 Case 
 Direct  Oblique 
Number Singular  {daa-
ra} 
 {daaraa} 
Plural  
{daare} 
 {daa-
raaN} 
Table 1. Paradigm Table for  {daara} 
(door) 
 {kaapaDa} (cloth),  {paana} (leaf), 
 {pustaka} (book),  {kapaaTa} (cup-
board) are the few nouns that fall into this para-
digm. 
Every paradigm has a set of inflection rules 
associated with it one corresponding to every 
inflectional form of the word. A noun has four 
inflectional forms each one corresponding to a 
case-number pair. Hence, every paradigm has 
four inflectional rules associated with it. 
An inflectional rule for Marathi consists of a 
tuple specifying the inflectional suffixes that 
should be inserted and deleted from ultimate and 
penultimate position of the root. Table 2 lists the 
inflectional suffixes that collectively form an 
inflectional rule. 
The procedure to obtain the inflected form 
of the given root R belonging to paradigm P by 
applying the inflectional rule I <UD, UI, PUD, 
PUI> is as follows: 
i. R =R - PUD 
ii. R = R + PUI 
iii. R = R ? UD 
iv. R = R + UI

Table 2. Suffixes in an Inflectional Rule 
For a given word, even if a single rule out of the 
four is different from the set of available para-
digms, a new paradigm needs to be created. Ta-
ble 3 shows the paradigm  {bhakta} (devo-
tee). Note that, the only difference between the 
two paradigm tables is in the direct case plural 
form.

taa}

 {bhak-

Table 3. Paradigm Table for  {bhakta} 
(devotee) 
In this way, our lexicon contains 16448 nouns 
categorized into 76 paradigms. Out of the 76 
paradigms, 30 correspond to feminine gender, 29 
to masculine and 17 to neuter gender. This set of 
paradigms includes three null paradigms, one 
corresponding to each gender. In modern Mara-
thi, the stem of the proper nouns or foreign 
words transliterated in Marathi is same as the 
root. In short, postpositions can be directly at-
tached to these roots without any modification. 
Such nouns belong to the null paradigm. 
4.2 Postposition Morphology 
Postpositions follow the stems of nouns and 
pronouns. Postpositions in Marathi can be 
broadly classified into case markers and shab-
dayogi avyayas. Shabdayogi avyayas show the 
relationship of nouns and pronouns with the oth-
er words in the sentence while deriving the ad-
jectives or adverbs in most of the cases. Depend-
ing upon the category of the word derived by 
them they are classified as adjectival and adver-
bial suffixes respectively. We have 142 postpo-
sitions listed in our lexicon.  
4.3 Classification of Postpositions 
The first step towards defining the morphotactics 
of a language is the classification of various suf-
fixes into classes depending upon the mor-
phemes they can follow and the morphemes that 
can follow them. Given the list of 142 postposi-
tions, we carefully examined each one to under-
stand its morphotactic behavior and came up 
with the classification of Marathi postpositions 
as presented in the Table 4.

They can follow any ob-
lique form. No other suf-

(uptil) 
Shuddha-
shabdayo-
gi avyayas 
They can follow almost 
any morpheme except 
oblique forms of nouns. 
They can be followed by 
some postpositions. But, 
this behavior is quite ir-
regular and needs more 
investigation. In most of 
the cases, these suffixes 
close the word. Hence, 
we consider them to be 
occurring only at the end 
of the word. 
 
{cha} 
(only) 
Table 4. Classification of Postpositions 
4.4 Verbs 
The verbs inflect for gender, number and person 
of the subject and the direct object in a sentence. 
They also inflect for tense and aspect of the ac-
tion as well as mood of the speaker in an illocu-
tionary act. They may even undergo derivation. 
Further discussion on verbal morphology will be 
based on Aakhyaata theory (inflection) and Kru-
danta theory (derivation) (Damale, 1970). Our 
lexicon contains 1160 verb roots classified into 
22 paradigms. 
Aakhyaata Theory forms the basis of 
verbal inflection in Marathi. Aakhyaata  
refers to tense, aspect, and mood. Aakhyaata is 
realized through an aakhyaata suffix which is a 
closing suffix, attached to the verb root. There 
are 8 types of aakhyaatas named after the pho-
nemic shape of the aakhyaata suffix. Associated 
with every aakhyaata are various aakhyaata-
arthas which indicate the features: tense, aspect 
and mood. An aakhyaata may or may not agree 
with gender. There are around 80 Aakhyaata 
suffixes in Marathi. 
Krudanta Theory forms the basis of 
verbal derivation in Marathi. Krudanta refers to 
the word ending in a krut-pratyaya (a suffix 
which refers to an action). Krut-pratyayas are 
attached at the end of verbs to form non-
infinitive verb forms. These forms usually be-
long to one of the categories: noun, adverb or 
adjective. They contribute to the aspect of the 
verb from which they are derived. We cover on-
ly the krudanta forms which are regular in beha-
vior. 
Irregular Verbs: Some verbs in Marathi have 
different behavior as compared to the other 
verbs (regular verbs). These verbs are present in 
some inflected forms for which no definite stem 
exists.  
4.5 Adjectives 
Marathi adjectives can be classified into two 
categories: ones that do not inflect and others 
that inflect for gender, number and case where 
such an inflection agrees with the gender and 
number of the noun modified by them. The in-
flectional forms of the adjectives are generated 
using similar procedure as that of nouns.  
4.6 Pronouns 
There are nine types of pronouns in Marathi. 
Pronouns possess very irregular behavior result-
ing into a large number of suppletive forms. In 
addition to these forms every pronoun has a spe-
cific oblique form (one each for singular and 
plural) to which shabdayogi avyayas can be at-
tached. 
4.7 Indeclinable Words 
Adverbs, conjunctions and interjections are the 
indeclinable words. Some adverbs can be fol-
lowed by a subset of postpositions. 
5 Morphotactics and Automata 
Along with the postpositions mentioned in the 
Table 4 the complete set of morphemes in Mara-
thi includes the roots and their inflectional 
forms. Every morpheme is labeled according to 
the class it belongs to. These labels are used to 
define the ?Morphotactic FSM? that models Ma-
31
rathi language. Table 5 enlists various labels 
used in the Morphotactic FSM.

Note that, the label field mentioned in the inflec-
tion rules refers to the corresponding labels of 
the morphemes mentioned in Table 5. 
Figure 2 shows the FSM for morphological 
recognition of Marathi. The input symbols are 
the labels of the morphemes as mentioned in the 
Table 5. The classification of the suffixes as 
specified in Table 5 explains the construction of 
FSM. We use SFST 1  (Stuttgart Finite State 
Transducer) for implementing the FSM. 
6 Experiments 
Morphological analysis caters to the needs of 
variety of application like machine translation, 
information retrieval, spell-checking. Different 
applications are interested in different bit of in-
formation provided by the analyzer like the 
stem, the root, the suffixes or the morphosyntac-
tic features. Hence, the performance evaluation 
of a morphological analyzer has to be observed 
in terms of its impact on the performance of the 
applications that use it. Hence, we carry out the 
evaluation in two parts: In direct evaluation we 
directly measure the accuracy of morphological 
analyzer on the given data. In indirect evalua-
tion, we observe the improvement in the per-
formances of statistical pos tagger and chunker

by using the morphological analyzer to generate 
the morphological features that help in boosting 
their accuracies. We used the corpora in TOUR-
ISM and NEWS domain for all our experiments.  
6.1 Direct Evaluation 
We used Marathi Morphological Analyzer for 
the analysis of 21096 unique words. We manual-
ly measured the accuracy of the morphological 
analyzer by counting the number of correctly 
analyzed words out of the total number of 
words. In the cases where a word has multiple 
analyses, the word was counted as correctly ana-
lyzed only when all of the correct analyses are 
present. Note that, in order to emphasize more 
on the usefulness of our approach towards mor-
phological analysis of Marathi, we added most 
of the roots used in the corpus to the lexicon be-
fore starting the experiments. For a language like 
Marathi, it is required to build a very rich lex-
icon which can be done over a larger period of 
time. 
 Out of the 21096 unique words, 20503 
(97.18%) were found to be correctly analyzed. 
Of the remaining 593 words, 394 words could 
not be recognized by Morphological Recognizer 
and 199 words were assigned the incorrect or 
insufficient analyses. 
By taking a closer look at the 394 words 
which were not recognized (segmented) we 
could come up with the causes of recognition 
failure as listed in Table 6.  
 
Cause Number of 
Words 
Lexicon Coverage 82    (20.81%) 
Absence of Rules 69    (17.51%) 
Acronyms 66    (16.75%) 
Compound words  55    (13.96%) 
Irregular forms needing 
further investigation 
47    (11.92%) 
Transliterated words which 
are uncommon 
25    (6.34%) 
Unidentified words 20    (5.08%) 
Dialect words/ words used

Use of common nouns as 
proper nouns

Table 6. Causes of Recognition Failure 
6.2 Indirect Evaluation 
CRF based sequence labelers (pos tagger 
and chunker) were trained using morpholog-
ical features and the other elementary features 
like (contextual words and bigram tags). The 
morphological features include ambiguity 
scheme (set of all possible categories of a word) 
and the suffixes for the pos tagger whereas just 
the suffixes in case of chunker.  
    To throw the light of role played by morpho-
logical analyzer in improving the accuracies of 
the sequence labelers, we performed the experi-
ments using two sets of features: The Learning 
Based (LB) labeler was trained using only ele-
mentary features whereas Morphologically Dri-
ven Learning Based (MDLB) labeler used the 
morphological features along with the elementa-
ry features. The results were obtained by per-
forming 4-fold cross validation over the corpora. 
The average accuracy of MDLB Pos tagger 
turned out to be 95.03 as compared to 85% of 
LB. The average accuracy of MDLB chunker 
was found to be 97.87% whereas that of LB was 
found to be 96.91%. . 
7 Conclusion and Future Work 
We presented a high accuracy morphological 
analyzer for Marathi that exploits the regularity 
in the inflectional paradigms while employing 
the Finite State Systems for modeling the lan-
guage in an elegant way. The accuracy figures as 
high as 97.18% in direct evaluation and the per-
formance improvement in shallow parsing speak 
about the performance of the morphological ana-
lyzer. We gave detailed description of the mor-
phological phenomena present in Marathi. The 
classification of postpositions and the develop-
ment of morphotactic FSA is one of the impor-
tant contributions since Marathi has complex 
morphotactics. As a next step the morphological 
analyzer can be further extended to handle the 
derivation morphology and compound words.
